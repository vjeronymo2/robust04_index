			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (1): The obstacles to modernity - Militant Hindu nationalism has provoked a painful reappraisal of India's political identity, which could impede the reforms vital to her future FOR nearly a year, India has been living in the shadow of the ruins of the Ayodhya mosque, torn down last December by Hindu militants. The mosque's destruction and the violence which followed have plunged Indians into a deep bout of soul-searching about their national identity. It has left the ruling Congress (I) party seriously concerned about its own political future. It has harmed relations with Pakistan. And it has consumed the energy of the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister. Economic reform, ministers' top priority until mid-1992, has been pushed aside by the urgent need to fight the fires started by Ayodhya. There is little prospect of the economy returning to the top of the agenda at least until after state elec tions due to be held in northern India later this year, when Ayodhya will be the main issue. Even afterwards, it is unlikely that Mr Rao will have the stomach for further radical economic changes. With luck, the reforms which have already been carried out should enable India to maintain a steady growth rate of 5-6 per cent in the mid-1990s. Deregulation is opening India to the world - in the coming years there will be much more foreign trade and investment. But with the reforms slowing, the prospect of India astonishing the world by staging a Chinese-style economic take-off is becoming increasingly remote. The Congress party's ideal of a secular India, in which Hindus, Moslems and other religious minorities live together in harmony, seems to have lost its appeal for many Hindus. They are searching instead for a stronger sense of national identity and finding it in the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party's calls for greater Hindu self-assertiveness. The BJP is taking risks by exploiting inter-religious tensions. At least 20,000 Indians have died in Hindu-Moslem violence since independence - more than 2,000 in the unrest which followed Ayodhya. But violence does not seem to have cost the BJP much support. In his Independence Day address last month, Mr Rao warned that India faced disintegration if religious tensions grew worse. 'Nobody has the right to go and ask for votes in the name of Hindu, Moslem or Christian religion. No one has a right to exploit the sentiments of the people by creating a frenzy.' The BJP's answer is that without a greater sense of being Hindu, India is nothing. Mr KR Malkani, a party vice-president, says: 'A country the size and diversity of India cannot be held together without a common culture. Since there are quite a lot of Hindus here, that culture should be modern Hindu culture.' Congress is in a quandary. If it attacks Hindu militancy too aggressively, it risks alienating Hindus, who, after all, constitute 80 per cent of the population. But if Congress is soft on militancy, it risks losing its traditional support among Moslems and low-caste Hindus, who distrust the high-caste leadership of the BJP. Congress's answer has, so far, been to try to steer between the two extremes - at the cost of irritating both wings of its support. A crucial test of voters' opinion comes in state elections to be held in November and December in four northern states. All were ruled by BJP governments until they were suspended for allegedly failing to follow central government orders after Ayodhya. The BJP expects to win all four. Congress will be fighting desperately to limit its losses. If Congress fares badly, Mr Rao will be under pressure from the party to resign. The BJP would almost certainly repeat demands for an early general election, but would be unlikely to get one. The present Parliament's term does not expire until 1996. The outlook seems to be for prolonged political uncertainty. Congress has ruled for two years without an overall parliamentary majority. At first, Mr Rao was able to win support from centrist splinter groups quite easily. Today he struggles. According to opinion polls, if a general election were held now Congress would lose seats but would still be the single biggest party. The BJP would gain MPs but not enough to overtake Congress. While strong in northern India, the BJP is too weak in the south and west to form a national government. The centrist Janata Dal and the parties of the left would remain a potent third force. None of this bodes well for future economic reform. The government was at its most energetic immediately after the 1991 balance-of-payments crisis when the threat of international default galvanised Mr Rao into action. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, presided over reforms which, by Indian standards, were mould-breaking. A panopoly of controls over industry, called the 'licence Raj', was dismantled; import bans and duties cut; and the rupee made convertible on the trade account. Public sector spending has been squeezed. In the financial markets, the key changes include extensive banking reforms such as the introduction of proper accounting and provisioning standards. Further reform of finance and foreign trade is in the pipeline. But the government has baulked at more far-reaching economic restructuring. Ministers postponed plans for extending employers' rights to sack redundant workers, something which is virtually impossible under current legislation. They have also been half-hearted in pursuit of privatisation, refusing to countenance the sale of more than 50 per cent of a public sector enterprise. Little has been done to rationalise the inefficient public sector which accounts for nearly half the nation's capital but only produces 27 per cent of its output. The government has also been slow to cut subsidies to farmers and other politically-privileged groups. Congress is reluctant to act for fear of hurting interest groups such as wealthy farmers, bureaucrats and trade unionists who are among the party's most loyal supporters. MPs rely for patronage on their influence over public sector appointments and contracts. They would not willingly cut the ground from under their own feet. However, ministers may have already done enough to generate steady economic growth. From a low of 1.2 per cent in 1991-92, economic growth in the year to the end of March 1994 is forecast to recover to 5 per cent. Inflation has fallen from a peak of 13.6 per cent to about 6 per cent. Exports are rising rapidly. There are signs of a strong recovery in industrial output. Foreign direct investment is starting to flow, albeit at a modest Dollars 100m-Dollars 200m a year. Moreover, middle-class Indians are beginning to see the benefits of liberalisation: competition from private airlines has jolted Indian Airlines, the state-owned domestic carrier, into improving services. Private satellite television operators have prodded Doordarshan, the state broadcasting network, into launching better programmes. Across India, reforms have created big opportunities for entrepreneurs, particularly in exports. Jewellery makers of Surat, for example; garment factories in Bombay; software producers Bangalore; car parts manufacturers in Madras. All have benefited from deregulation and the devaluation of the rupee. In domestic markets too there are pockets of rapid growth, notably among the middle-classes for high quality goods and services - within days of announcing a new model, the Zen, Maruti Udyog, the carmaker, had a three-year waiting list. Unfortunately, none of this seems enough to transform the Indian economy. In the immediate aftermath of the 1991 reforms, there was much talk in Delhi of India following China into high-speed development. That now seems rather unlikely. Finance ministry officials expect reforms to generate sustainable growth of 5-6 per cent a year: that is well worth having, but it is the same as India enjoyed pre-reform. For a developing country, it is the economic equivalent of muddling along. Moreover, there is still a risk that growth might slow. Government borrowing, which fell sharply after 1991, is now expanding so fast that the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has sounded the alarm about a possible resurgence in inflation. Finance ministry officials are concerned but are under great pressure from Congress to keep spending up at least until after the state elections. Also, despite liberalisation, the bureaucracy retains much of its grip. For example, the Companies Act still requires an enterprise to file no fewer than 66 different official reports. Armies of inspectors are employed to supervise the process. The number of separate clearances required, particularly for large and complex projects, still puts off potential investors, especially foreigners. Mr Udayan Bose, chairman of Creditcapital Finance Corporation, a merchant bank, says: 'The regulators don't seem to realise that investors don't have to invest in India. They have other places.' Furthermore, there is too little investment in power, transport and other infrastructure. In the next two or three years, shortages of electricity and other services will slow growth. In power, for example, the squeeze on public sector spending limited growth in output in the year to March 1993 to just 5 per cent, compared with 9 per cent a year in the 1980s. The government hopes that private companies, including foreign groups, will close the gap. But private investors have reservations about the terms which the government is offering. Even if deals were signed tomorrow, it would be three years or more before the first new large private sector stations came on stream. Mr Tarun Das, general secretary of the Confederation of Indian Industry, the employers' body, says: 'We see a very bleak outlook for infrastructure.' Finally, the benefits of growth will be restricted to high-growth centres such as Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore unless the great majority of Indians can become better trained to participate in the industrialised economy. Decades of under-investment in primary education has left India among the world's least literate nations - with just 52 per cent of adults able to read compared with 73 per cent in China. Except for the oil-rich Gulf states, no country has achieved economic take-off without also achieving a literacy rate of 60 per cent. Without better education, India cannot hope to control population growth, which is running at nearly 25 per cent a decade. By the year 2000 there will be 1bn Indians. Some businessmen believe that the only way for India to confront these problems is at the state level. 'We must abolish the centre,' says one company chairman in Bombay, who argues that India is too big to govern centrally and, given its diversity, well suited to decentralisation. Decentralisation might also take some steam out of separatist movements in the troubled northern state of Kashmir and elsewhere. But Delhi is too powerful to surrender control without a struggle. And there is little sign that the larger states are ready to fight this battle. By its own standards, the Indian economy is changing out of all recognition. But by the standards of those developing countries which have achieved industrial take-off it is moving too slowly. The danger is that without more reforms there will not be faster growth. Without faster growth there will be too little money to satisfy many Indians' aspirations. Dissatisfaction breeds anger and anger spawns Ayodhyas.</p>

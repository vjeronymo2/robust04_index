			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid from Baghdad] </F>   [Text] Iraq will begin a broad diplomatic move in the  international arena on 14 April.    This move, which takes advantage of the new situation  manifested in the Security Council's periodic discussion of the  economic blockade on Iraq, is aimed at explaining Baghdad's  position on a number of issues, including its implementation of  Security Council resolutions and its response to the resolution  on long-term monitoring of weapons of mass destruction. The  adverse effects on the people caused by the blockade in terms of  food and medicine shortages will also be explained.    AL-DUSTUR learned from the Iraqi Foreign Ministry sources  that a number of ministers, advisers, and diplomats will leave  Baghdad simultaneously for a number of Arab and foreign  capitals. Minister of Culture and Information Hamid Yusuf  Hammadi will visit Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, Djibouti, and Libya.  Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf will visit Malaysia,  Indonesia, and India.    Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Iraq's permanent envoy to the UN  mission in Geneva will tour Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and  Mauritania.    Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Dr. 'Abd-al-Amir al-Anbari  will visit Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal, and the  Netherlands. Second Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Wisam  al-Zahawi will visit Greece, Italy, the Vatican, New Zealand,  Germany, and Japan. Counselor Wahbi Qurrah Ghuli will visit  Venezuela and Argentina. The Iraqi foreign minister is scheduled  to make another tour for the same purpose, but the source  declined to name the capitals the second tour will include.    Meanwhile, Baghdad is witnessing increasing diplomatic  activities. A Turkish Foreign Ministry undersecretary will  arrive in Baghdad next Thursday to discuss the Iraqi oil  pipeline crossing Turkish territory and the possibility of  selling the oil locked in it since the embargo on Iraqi oil  exports in August 1990 when the Security Council adopted  resolutions imposing economic and technological sanctions  against Baghdad.    Romanian Foreign Ministry undersecretary is currently  visiting Baghdad as envoy of his country to the Iraqi  leadership, and is carrying a message dealing with the detention  of Romanian citizens in Iraq after judicial sentences were  issued against them.    Preparations are under way in the Iraqi capital for the  visit  of Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati who will hold  talks on a number of issues between Tehran and Baghdad suspended  since the cease-fire on 8 August 1988 after an eight-year war.  Diplomats said Velayati will discuss with Iraqi officials the  fate of prisoners and the Iraqi planes that took refuge in  Iranian airports during the second Gulf war that broke out on 17  January 1991. The number of these planes is 148, including 22  civilian planes.    An Iraqi Foreign Ministry source expects that the Iranian  official will arrive in Baghdad leading a delegation that  comprises a number of experts within the next two weeks.    The Iraqi envoys' visits to world capitals will prepare for  the next debate on the oil embargo imposed on Iraq due to take  place in New York next month.    An Indian envoy visited Baghdad last week and conveyed a  message requesting the release of an Indian citizen who had been  convicted by Iraqi judges.</p>

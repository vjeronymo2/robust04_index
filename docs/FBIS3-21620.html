			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Drug Prevention and Social Rehabilitation Under  Secretary Jose Luis Harb yesterday disclosed that the Bolivian  and Chilean Governments have agreed to unify their policies to  prevent drug consumption in the high risk regions in both  countries.    The plan is to establish control, education, and health  promotion policies, as well as to work on drug prevention  programs and the struggle against drug trafficking, as part of a  plan to change the antinarcotics strategy.    In Jose Luis Harb's opinion, the most important achievements  in international negotiations were those reached with the  Chilean Government.    He asserted: "Important agreements have been reached for the  establishment of common and reciprocal actions in the  interdiction field, and for the exchange of information on the  border control and particularly on illegal precursors smuggled  into the country."    The "narco-influence" ["narco-influencia"] phenomenon, which  the government has identified as the "number one" threat to  youths in Bolivian territory, has increased the level of drug  consumption in the country to 2 percent of the Bolivian  population.    According to a study conducted by the Drug Prevention and  Social Rehabilitation Undersecretariat, "narco-influence" has  become the main concern of the Government Ministry due to  Bolivia's character as a drug producer and generator of cocaine  trafficking to the rest of the world.    Jose Luis Harb commented: "Most youths start off by getting  involved in drug production, then in drug trafficking, and they  end up becoming highly addicted."    This is how the "narco-influence" phenomenon is generated in  Bolivia, although he did not mention the true origin of "the  youths' involvement in the underworld." [passage omitted]</p>

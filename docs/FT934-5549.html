			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / NUM accepts Wearmouth axe Miners at Wearmouth, the last pit in the Durham coalfield, voted yesterday to accept closure of their colliery, where output ended last week. The decision, taken at a meeting of virtually all 430 members of Wearmouth's National Union of Mineworkers' lodge, follows British Coal's closure announcement last week which said there was no market for its power station coal. The 167-year-old pit employs 670 people. NUM lodge secretary Mr Alan Mardghum said the mood at the meeting was one of resignation and despondency. 'The vast majority of people made redundant from Wearmouth will end up on the dole,' he said. In the past four years British Coal has invested more than Pounds 24m at Wearmouth. The NUM says Wearmouth has more than 100m tonnes of undersea reserves.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Guinness in China link with LVMH GUINNESS yesterday reinforced its alliance with LVMH, the French luxury goods and drinks group, by forming a new joint venture operation in China. The venture is the 16th to be established in international Scotch whisky and cognac markets since the two companies became partners in 1987. Another joint operation is expected to be announced shortly. Speculation about the future relationship between the companies  - and in particular their 24 per cent cross-shareholdings  - has been rampant in recent weeks. Their performance has been hit by recession in many world markets and their share prices have been under pressure amid rumours that the alliance would be restructured. However, Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, yesterday stressed: 'This latest joint venture serves to reinforce our relationship with LVMH. The cross-shareholding supports our global network which has served both companies well for the past six years.' Riche Monde China, the new company formed by LVMH and United Distillers, the Guinness spirits division, has already recruited a sales staff of 60 and intends to increase the number of employees to more than 150 by 1995. Mr Greener, who has just returned from a visit to UD's operations in Asia, said: 'China, with its population of 1.2bn, represents a huge opportunity for us in the long term. It is estimated that international brands account for only 1.4 per cent of the spirits market at present. 'But once the infrastructure is in place to deliver the product to the market, China could be a 20m case annual market for premium branded imported spirits by the next century.' Total UD Scotch sales in China are expected to be close to 1m bottles this year. Sales of Johnnie Walker Black Label, its de luxe Scotch brand, increased by 70 per cent in the first half. LVMH's Hennessy cognac, the other best-selling spirits brand in the portfolio of the new company, is established as market leader in its premium category. Joint venture agreements between the two companies already operate in Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, France, Ireland, the US and Mexico.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Plea on executive pay disclosure The UK's biggest shareholders' group is urging its members to sack non-executive directors who do not fully disclose all details of executive pay and explain how it was awarded. The National Association of Pension Funds' investment committee met yesterday to discuss proposals, aired last week by government officials, that shareholders ought to have greater ability to control excessive pay for executives. Mr John Rogers, investment committee secretary, said association members were not eager for new powers to vote down executive pay contracts. He said: 'Shareholders appoint boards as their agents.' Boards had to decide what pay levels are appropriate, not shareholders. The investment committee is urging that remuneration committees consist entirely of non-executive directors and that these non-executives retire and stand for re-election each year. At present the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance call for remuneration committees to be mainly composed of non-executives. The remuneration committees should make full disclosure of policy and the principal factors leading to remuneration decisions. Also, they should make full disclosure of all the elements of each named director's remuneration. Shareholders have complained that they know too little about the true cost of each executive because the terms of share option schemes and pension arrangements are hidden in the small print of lengthy executive contracts. Shareholders would expect the non-executives to ensure that there are no reciprocal arrangements between non-executives of different companies. The association said that those non-executives who failed to follow the guidelines should not have their contracts renewed by shareholders.</p>

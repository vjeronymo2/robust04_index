			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: IMF prepares Dollars 850m S Africa loan THE International Monetary Fund is preparing a Dollars 850m (Pounds 551.9m) loan to South Africa under its compensatory and contingency financing facility. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said at the weekend the Fund was already helping South Africa with policy advice. The CCFF loan, which is now the subject of preliminary discussions, would offset export losses caused by the drought in the region. He said the IMF was ready to provide further financial support. However, it was up to the South African authorities to decide how much they wished the Fund to be involved in economic transformation. Mr Camdessus met Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, for private talks in Washington on Saturday. Although the South Africa issue was not on the agenda of the weekend meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, it was raised in bilateral talks between some of the ministers. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said he discussed the country in a meeting with Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary.</p>

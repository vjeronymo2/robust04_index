			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REYNOLDS RESIGNS  </P> <P> I am appalled to learn that Ann Reynolds has resigned (as chancellor of the  20-campus California State University) over the controversy surrounding her  appreciable pay raise (Part A, April 21). She perhaps was awarded this raise in  a procedure that can be criticized, but the point is that her position has been  seriously underpaid for a decade and deserves a compensation level comparable  to her University of California counterpart.  </P> <P> The salary of David Gardner is in excess of $230,600. The trustees of CSU  rightfully should raise her salary from $136,248 to $195,000. She supervises a  budget of $2 billion, encompassing 20 exceptional universities. Reynolds'  salary is appropriate to her responsibilities and her headaches.  </P> <P> RICHARD MOORE  </P> <P> Superintendent and President  </P> <P> Santa Monica College  </P></p>

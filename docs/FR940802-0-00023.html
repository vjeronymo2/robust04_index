Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Legal Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rule adopted today is a reasonable exercise of the discretionary authority granted the agency under section 211(k)(1) of the Act. EPA interprets the first sentence of section 211(k) as broad authority to adopt reasonable requirements for reformulated gasoline, unless otherwise prohibited by the Clean Air Act or other statutory provision. EPA interprets the second sentence of section 211(k)(1) as authorizing EPA to adopt regulations for the reformulated gasoline program that result in the greatest emission reductions achievable, and at the same time tend to optimize the resulting impacts on cost, energy requirements, and other health and environmental impacts. In effect, EPA has full authority to adopt emission reduction standards and other requirements that achieve this result. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Various commenters argued that statements in the Regulatory Impact Analysis supporting the FRM signed on 12/15/93 showed that EPA believed it did not have the legal authority to require the use of renewable oxygenates. To the contrary, EPA's proposal, also signed on 12/15/93, clearly described EPA's view that it did have the authority to require the use of renewable oxygenates. The statements in the RIA address renewable oxygenate requirements that would be significantly different from that proposed in December and would raise many of the same concerns described in the preamble to the final rule, such as increased emissions in the summertime from increased use of ethanol in the summertime. The prior statements in the RIA are not relevant to the proposal issued by EPA in December.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Analysis of the Text of the Statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An analysis of EPA's authority starts with the text of the statute. Under the first sentence of that paragraph, EPA is authorized to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> promulgate regulations under this section establishing requirements for reformulated gasoline to be used in gasoline-fueled vehicles in specified nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Under the second sentence of section 211(k)(1), EPA's regulations are to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> require the greatest achievable reduction in emissions of ozone forming volatile organic compounds (during the high ozone season) and emissions of toxic air pollutants (during the entire year) achievable through the reformulation of conventional gasoline, taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reductions, any nonair-quality and other air-quality related health and environmental impacts and energy requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 211(k)(1) provides EPA general authority to establish reasonable requirements for reformulated gasoline, including emissions reduction requirements. Other provisions in section 211(k) address various specific elements of the program, such as minimum requirements for various fuel parameters (section 211(k)(2)), minimum emissions reduction requirements (section 211(k)(3)), certification requirements (section 211(k)(4)), prohibited acts (section 211(k)(5)), state opt-ins, (section 211(k)(6)), and credit programs (section 211(k)(7)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interpretation of section 211(k)(1) is supported by the plain meaning of that provision. On its own terms, the first sentence stands as a general grant of authority to establish any reasonable requirement for reformulated gasoline, with no explicit restriction on this authority other than a one year deadline for agency action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first sentence of section 211(k)(1) both grants authority to the agency and establishes a deadline for agency action. This structure is not at all uncommon, and was employed by Congress in several similar provisions adopted in 1990. See, e.g., section 211(h)(1) (regulation of Reid vapor pressure), section 211(i)(2) (regulation of motor vehicle diesel fuel), section 211(l) (regulation of gasoline detergent additives), and section 202(a)(6) (regulation of refueling emissions from motor vehicles). The general framework of section 211(k) is also not unique_a grant of broad general authority in (k)(1) followed by several detailed provisions that ensure certain minimum actions are taken. This is consistent with the approach taken by Congress in various other provisions of Title II of the Clean Air Act. For example, Congress granted EPA broad, general authority to regulate motor vehicles and their fuels, as in section 202(a) and section 211(c)(1). These grants of broad, general authority were then supplemented by detailed provisions providing specific actions that Congress expected in these areas. See, e.g., section 202(b), (f), (g), (h), and (i), as well as sections 211(c)(2), 211(g), prior to the 1990 amendments, and the various paragraphs of section 211 cited above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted today are a reasonable exercise of this discretionary authority. They further Congressional goals by fostering achievement of the important benefits that Congress expected to flow from this program. They are not prohibited by any provision of the Act or any other law, and are well within the range of authority granted by Congress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The plain meaning of the second sentence of section 211(k)(1) corroborates EPA's view on it authority to issue this rule. This provision requires promulgation of regulations that require a certain result. The result desired by Congress is clear_the greatest achievable reductions, taking into consideration cost, energy, environmental and other impacts. There is no indication that EPA's authority is limited to establishing emissions reduction standards. In fact, this provision would authorize EPA to adopt all reasonable requirements designed to achieve the required result. The regulation adopted today is designed to ensure that the emissions reduction requirements for reformulated gasoline are achieved in a manner that reasonably optimizes the energy, cost, environmental, and other impacts of this program. The regulations adopted today, in combination with the regulations promulgated in December 1993, act together to achieve this result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

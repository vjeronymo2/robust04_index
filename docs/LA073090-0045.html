			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLAN'S DEMISE COULD ARREST DEVELOPMENT;  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA: PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER RAMPANT GROWTH FORCES THE CITY TO REJECT THE  SANTA CATARINA CONDOS-FOR-ROADS PROPOSAL, AND THE DECISION MAY AFFECT POLITICS  AND PLANNING IN THE AREA FOR YEARS TO COME.  </P> <P> It was a debate that, in the words of Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, has  "literally torn this community apart."  </P> <P> After five months of lengthy and often rancorous public meetings, the Santa  Clarita City Council last week killed a controversial project in which a  developer at one point agreed to provide $55 million in road improvements in  exchange for being allowed to build 1,452 condominiums.  </P> <P> Although some City Council members originally hailed the plan as a way to solve  traffic problems, they finally bowed to intense public pressure from homeowners  who said the project was poorly planned and environmentally unsound.  </P> <P> The political repercussions of the decision will reverberate for some time,  setting the stage for new conflicts that may guide planning, growth and  politics in the city for years to come, according to those involved in the  debate.  </P> <P> The fall of the Santa Catarina project could influence the fate of a  growth-control initiative now in the works, the proposed recall of one  councilman and the overall way developers conduct business in the Santa Clarita  Valley.  </P> <P> In many ways, Santa Catarina acted as a political lightning rod, drawing  together various forces in the city, all of which are tied to discontent with  the rapid development of the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The various movements -- for a recall and for growth controls -- were  symbolically united in the fight over Santa Catarina. "It all started to come  together," said Kevin La Sota, a spokesman for homeowners opposing the project.  </P> <P> As Councilwoman Jill Klajic sees it, the lesson of Santa Catarina is quite  simple: "The lesson is, the community out here is sick and tired of  development. The community wants to see some control, some restraint."  </P> <P> The Santa Catarina project took many forms over the months, but G. H. Palmer  Associates initially proposed building 1,452 condominiums on 135 acres in  Canyon Country, north of Soledad Canyon Road and southwest of Ermine Street.  </P> <P> Santa Catarina was just one part of a complex deal that would have allowed the  company to build two other housing projects in the city in exchange for  millions of dollars in road improvements that Santa Clarita engineers said the  city could not afford to build. But homeowner activists said the project was  too large and unsuited for the site, and they charged that the Santa Clarita  City Council was willing to let developers run roughshod over the city just to  get some roads built. The activists also questioned the need for the roads,  saying the new thoroughfares would encourage even more growth in the area.  </P> <P> The activists even enlisted the aid of the state attorney general's office,  which in May said the city should compel Palmer Associates to revise the  environmental impact report for the project. The report, prepared by a  consultant for Palmer Associates, "inadequately, inaccurately or altogether  failed to address a number of significant issues," the attorney general's  office said in a letter to the City Council.  </P> <P> Council members tried to placate homeowners by saying that they would allow no  more than 800 dwelling units on the site. But when the developer said he could  not afford to scale back the project, the council said it would allow up to  1,292. The council later changed its position again, saying the new cap was  1,000 units.  </P> <P> Developer Dan Palmer, trying to save the deal, said Tuesday night that he could  build the project with only 800 units after all. But by then, council members  said there was no way they could swiftly resolve the environmental concerns  raised by the attorney general and homeowners. What's more, they said the deal  had become too complex and unwieldy to handle. They voted it down 4 to 1.  </P> <P> "The City Council, after months and months and months of public hearings,  finally decided to listen to the people," said John O'Dwyer, a homeowner who  was a popular and colorful figure at Santa Catarina hearings, blasting the  project with humorous speeches, poetry and even flash cards. O'Dwyer attended  council hearings wearing a T-shirt that said: "Just Say No to Devious  Planning."  </P> <P> La Sota, who said he did not think that Santa Catarina would be defeated, said  he was encouraged by the outcome because it proved that the City Council was  willing to respond to the public. Three of the council members -- Darcy, Howard  P. (Buck) McKeon and Carl Boyer III -- had tried for months to forge a  compromise to save the roads-for-condos deal.  </P> <P> "As long as you have the facts, you can fight City Hall," La Sota said.  </P> <P> Marsha McLean, a civic activist who watches City Hall closely, agreed that the  council's decision to scuttle Santa Catarina would enhance its reputation. "I  think that's to their credit," she said.  </P> <P> But for Boyer, the lone council member to vote against killing off Santa  Catarina, the repercussions could be far more serious.  </P> <P> Shortly after Tuesday's vote on the project, Boyer was formally presented a  notice by a citizens group calling for his recall. The notice said Boyer  ignored the will of residents and promoted bad planning.  </P> <P> The demise of Santa Catarina, meanwhile, has buoyed the hopes of a citizens  group that hopes to place a growth-control measure before city voters, perhaps  by next spring.  </P> <P> "I feel it just makes us even more convinced that we're going to win," said  John Drew, spokesman for the group known as Citizens Assn. for a Responsible,  Residential Initiative on Growth, or CARRING.  </P> <P> The group was recently encouraged by a public opinion poll, commissioned by the  city, that found that 60% of those surveyed would support a slow-growth  initiative. The initiative is still being drafted, but Drew said it would  probably place limits on the number of units that could be built each year and  set forth the criteria that would be used when the council considers a  development proposal.  </P> <P> The activists who opposed the Santa Catarina project formed a grass-roots  organization that wisely used the expertise of citizens who are lawyers,  engineers or planners, Drew said. These professionals were able to pick apart  the project's environmental impact report, a move that lead to the project's  demise. CARRING is confident that it can duplicate that strategy, he said.  </P> <P> The failure of Santa Catarina also puts developers on notice that they will  have to win the support of homeowners if they expect to get their projects  approved, Klajic said.  </P> <P> What's more, homeowners will demand that developers build parks, donate money  for schools or build roads as the price of their support. "This is a good  message to the developers -- that they're going to have to give a lot more than  they have been giving to develop here," McLean said. "And that's a good  message."  </P> <P> Developers are already unpopular in the Santa Clarita Valley, a city that  incorporated in part because of the fear of overdevelopment. But the Santa  Catarina debate lowered their stature even further. O'Dwyer, La Sota and other  critics regularly charged that Palmer Associates treated homeowners with  disrespect and disdain. Company officials said they were frank and responsive  with residents.  </P> <P> "They poisoned the well not only for themselves but for the rest of the  development community," said Allan Cameron, a planning and political consultant  for developers in the valley. Cameron said developers will have to work hard to  overcome the stigma of Santa Catarina.  </P> <P> Other developers, meanwhile, said Santa Catarina could scare off builders who  otherwise might want to annex into the city of Santa Clarita.  </P> <P> Just a few hours after the Santa Catarina proposal was killed, Gary Cusumano,  chief operating officer of Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., the valley's leading  developer, told the City Council that he did not want to have company property  west of the Golden State Freeway annexed into the city.  </P> <P> "There's a considerable amount of unrest in this community," Cusumano told the  council. The defeat of Santa Catarina, coupled with the initiative drive by  CARRING, sets the stage for growth controls that could inhibit Newhall Land's  future building plans, he said.  </P></p>

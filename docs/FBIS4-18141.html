			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni, Northern League lower house </F> floor leader, by Stefano Caviglia in Rome; date not given:  "Maroni: `A Right-Wing Government Is Close at Hand'" -- first  paragraph is L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Caviglia] A great  electoral success as far as the number of those elected goes,  Honorable Maroni, but a little less in percentage terms.    [Maroni] It was the most difficult electoral test of our  history. We did not succeed in explaining to everybody what we  wanted, but we retained our identity up to the end of a battle  in which anything could have happened. Did you see what  happened to Rete? We, instead, are firmly on our feet. This  means that the federalist battle is very much alive and will  continue throughout the north.    [Caviglia] And that you will be able to govern...    [Maroni] Of course, but not at any cost. We will see if they  accept our conditions.    [Caviglia] Which also includes a request regarding the prime  minister's seat, for which [Northern League Secretary] Umberto  Bossi has proposed you as a candidate. Is this not slightly  excessive given that Forza Italia and National Alliance got more  proportional representation votes than you?    [Maroni] You cannot base your reasoning on numbers alone.  You must also look at political positions. We want guarantees  that the values we have always fought for will not be betrayed.  For this reason we are asking for the seat of prime minister.  For us it is the best guarantee of a free enterprise and  federalist government. But it is not a final condition.  Instead, I really think we can come to an agreement.    [Caviglia] In short, there are no longer any conditions  regarding the participation of National Alliance in the  government.    [Maroni] The only condition that we cannot renounce is that  of federalism. We could not become part of a government whose  members are contrary to federalism. But I think there is no  hint of this. The Social Movement has such a great desire to  increase its votes after all these years that I do not think it  will object. Moreover, we do not want everything immediately by  any means. We know that one has to proceed gradually.    [Caviglia] And which are the first measures that should be  taken in order to satisfy the League?    [Maroni] Well, to begin with, tax reform with the autonomy  of  local bodies is necessary. Something like that would be a first  step.    [Caviglia] Well then, the government of the center-right  pole  is at hand.    [Maroni] I would say so. The others are certainly what they  are. Did you see the scenes of [National Alliance leader]  Gianfranco Fini's election meeting in Piazza del Popolo? It was  full of Roman [Fascist] greetings. Our role is important  precisely because of this. We are the anchor that is preventing  this pole from sliding into a reactionary status. Today's  result moreover is just the beginning. The objective is to  create a great lineup, which is not only electoral, as soon as  possible: An authentic liberal-democratic pole, the modern,  liberal, and federalist Right that comes from the north.    [Caviglia] And what about the controversies with your allies  [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and Fini over the past  weeks?    [Maroni] These belong to the past. We have put these away in  the cellar, or if you prefer, in the attic.</p>

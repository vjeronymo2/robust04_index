			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bettina Hubo: "Netherlands Speculates on </F> Lubbers' Chances for European Commission Presidency"]    [Excerpt] What will be the repercussions of the election  results for outgoing Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers' chances  for the European Commission (EC) presidency? Differing answers  have been given to this question. Maij-Wegen, heading the list  of CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] candidates, considers that  the election results will favor Lubbers since the CDA remains  the largest Netherlands party in Europe. De Vries and Bertens,  who are heading the list of VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66] candidates, respectively, feel  on the contrary that the poor turnout will work against Lubbers.  EC Commissioner van den Broek said that the low level of  interest shown by Netherlanders in the elections does not bode  well for Lubbers. He fears that the Netherlanders' European  convictions may be questioned. [passage omitted]</p>

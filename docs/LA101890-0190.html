			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> CITY CLERK NAMED TREASURER  </P> <P> City Clerk Janet Berry will hold two positions when she replaces city treasurer  Charlene Jung, who resigned last week.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to appoint Berry to serve until the  April, 1992, election. That will avoid the cost of a special election,  estimated at $40,000 to $50,000.  </P> <P> The city charter allows the council to choose between appointment and a special  election to fill such a vacancy, city spokesman Tom Manheim said.  </P> <P> Jung, who was elected treasurer in 1988, left to work as investment manager for  the city of Anaheim.  </P></p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Royal cuts dividend after Pounds 79m interim loss THE PROBLEMS of the housing market have undermined recovery at Royal Insurance, one of the largest UK composite (general and life) insurers, which made interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 79m. The group, which reported a loss of Pounds 97m at the same stage in 1991, reduced its interim dividend to 2p from 11.25p. The result was heavily skewed by poor results from domestic mortgage indemnity policies, which insure mortgage lenders against a percentage of losses from sales of repossessed properties. Claims and provisions against such claims amounted to Pounds 100m compared with Pounds 22m at the same stage last year. Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, expected mortgage indemnity losses for 1991, 1992 and 1993 to top Pounds 500m, compared with an estimate of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 450m made earlier this year. 'More of the claims are coming through. The recession is biting even harder,' he said. The group also said it was separating UK life operations from general insurance business, in a restructuring scheme which will transfer some Pounds 500m of debt and ownership of the life company from the insurance operating subsidiary to the holding group. The restructuring increases the solvency ratio (net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income) of the general insurance subsidiary to 40 per cent. Without it the ratio would have fallen below 30 per cent. Mr Gamble was cheered, however, by a fall in underwriting losses on most other lines of business as a result of premium increases, more selective underwriting and tighter control of costs. Underwriting losses in the UK fell to Pounds 172m from Pounds 195m and to Dollars 148m (Pounds 77m) from Dollars 200m in the US. The group has reduced its exposure to the UK motor market and insures 30 per cent of its 1m policyholders via its direct writing subsidiary, The Insurance Service. At the new Royal Insurance operating subsidiary, general insurance underwriting losses of Pounds 310m (against a loss of Pounds 361m last time), estate agency losses of Pounds 9m (up from a loss of Pounds 8m) and long-term insurance losses of Pounds 12m (against a profit of Pounds 8m), were offset by investment income of Pounds 235m (down from Pounds 247m). Income from associated undertakings fell to Pounds 9m from Pounds 20m. Profits at the new life subsidiary, Royal Life Holdings, rose to Pounds 27m from Pounds 26m.

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Lombard League shows poll strength PARTIAL municipal elections in Italy have confirmed beyond doubt the strength of the populist Lombard League in northern Italy. The League achieved its ambition of winning the mayoral race in Milan and will now be able to use Italy's biggest northern city as a show-piece for plans to clean up the administration and privatise municipal services. The second round run-off to elect mayors, held on Sunday, has also demonstrated the power of the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the former communist party. It managed to act as a rallying point in the centre and south of the country. The PDS, allying with a shifting series of local partners that included the Republicans, Greens and Mr Mario Segni's referendum movement, has done extraordinarily well at the expense of its traditional rivals, the Christian Democrat party and the socialists. The new mayors elected for such cities as Turin and Ravenna to Siena, Catania and Agrigento now have the right to choose 60 per cent of the municipal councillors. This means that for the first time Italian municipalities will have stable administrations over the next four-year term of office. Also, there will be none of the usual politicking to form administrations which in the past have taken up to three months or more to organise. The new rules for municipal elections, which were approved in March, allowed for direct election of mayors and laid down rules for the allocation of seats with a majority voting system - with 60 per cent of the seats allocated to the winning mayoral candidate's party/coalition and 40 per cent to the other parties on the basis of the first round vote. Mr Marco Formentini, the 63 year-old mayor of Milan, takes over an administration that has been run by a special commissioner for the past months because the corruption scandals have completely undermined the governing coalition. Mr Formentini, a lawyer who worked for more than 10 years in the European Community, easily beat his left-wing rival, Mr Nando dalla Chiesa, gaining 57 per cent of the vote. Elsewhere the League consolidated its hold on several north towns, including Novara and three provincial administrations - Gorizia, Mantua and Pavia. In the first round held on June 6, a broad pattern emerged of the League gaining a wide margin of support to become the main party in the North; the PDS took control of the centre in terms of votes; while the Christian Democrats continued to dominate the South. Under the new rules, the mayor had to be elected by an overall majority in towns of more than 15,000. This led to a second round in 145 towns and cities between the two candidates who received most votes. The League always insisted on going it alone; but the system benefited those candidates who presented themselves as new faces. Thus, although the Christian Democrats still obtained the most votes overall, the PDS has acquired more power because its candidates for mayor have done almost unversally well in the centre and south. The PDS alliance also won in Turin with their telecommunications professor candidate, Mr Valentino Castellani.</p>

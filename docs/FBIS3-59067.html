			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Patrice de Beer: "Chinese Foreign Minister in </F> Paris: Franco-Chinese Reconciliation"]    [Excerpts] In Paris since 22 January, where he had meetings  with President Mitterrand; his French counterpart, Alain Juppe;  and Edouard Balladur, China's foreign minister has sealed the  reconciliation between the two countries. While in the French  capital, Qian Qichen also had talks with the U.S. secretary of  state. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Arms Sales to Taiwan </H5>   The Chinese minister seemed pleased with his visit, stating  that "the future of Franco-Chinese relations is promising."  However, he did not commit himself to much, saying that he had  "told the president that French firms had to take a place in  China." Which place, one wonders, since France's market share  in China (1.8 percent) is much smaller than Germany's (4.9  percent), or even Italy's (2.1 percent).    A cautious Mr. Qian steered clear of the issue of French  weapon sales to Taiwan. He did not say whether he viewed the 12  January communique as ending permanently this particular trade  -- which is what Beijing has always wanted -- or, in Mr. Juppe's  words, as a simple "limitation." Indeed, it is clear that  France -- and especially weapon manufacturers and the Defense  Ministry -- would be pleased to sign new contracts bringing in  fresh money, even though sales must now be limited to  non-offensive weapons.    The question is now to determine how and by whom the  definition of such defensive weapons will be drawn. What of  armored vehicles, for example? And will it be necessary, as  stated in Singapore by Industry and Foreign Trade Minister  Gerard Longuet, to ask for Beijing's permission before each  transaction? This position seems hardly congruous with that of  the Quai d'Orsay [French Ministry of Foreign Affairs].  Furthermore, Mr. Longuet announced that French assistance to  Beijing, which had been suspended in 1993, would be resumed. In  1992, China had been the first beneficiary of French State  assistance with Fr1,250 billion -- France being the second  biggest contributor of state aid to Beijing, after Japan.    So this is indeed a new start -- commercial interests having  now displaced the memory of the Tiananmen massacre, which the  French Government of the time had denounced with a determination  unmatched throughout the world. Of the resolutions made at the  time by the Twelve, only the ban on arms sales -- can it last  much longer? -- and the suspension of state visits remain in  force. And Chancellor Kohl has shown how little concern he has  for the latter resolution, when he invited China's President  Jiang Zemin to come to Bonn.    Will the latest compromises made by France on the altar of  reconciliation with China be the last ones, or will commercial  or political reasons incite some people to be even more pliant  in the future? For there is no doubt that Beijing will try, as  usual, to take advantage of any disagreements it may notice in  Paris as well as the vague terms of the joint communique. Even  though barriers to renewed cooperation have been removed, it  does not follow that China's nature is going to change.    The appointment of Chen Kuiyuan, the secretary of the Tibet  Autonomous Regional Party Committee, as head of the Chinese  delegation to the PCF [French Communist Party] congress shows in  just how little regard China's rulers hold the concerns of  Western democracies with respect to the human rights issue in  Tibet. Be it insensitivity or provocation, the utmost caution  will be required if Paris is to avoid looking like it has let  itself be lured by PRC's siren song.</p>

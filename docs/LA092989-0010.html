			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNINGS FROM VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SHOULD PRODUCE PROTECTION  </P> <P> Law enforcement agencies must protect citizens irrespective of their sex, race  or the area in which they live. No one can fault the police for their inability  to prevent certain crimes of opportunity, particularly when little or no  warning is given. But in cases of domestic violence, warnings from prospective  victims are like flares fired from a sinking ship. When seen, they must be  heeded by law enforcement officers.  </P> <P> The tragic death of Maria Navarro on Aug. 27 after a fruitless call to the  Sheriff's emergency number seeking help focused debate on police  responsibilities and service. The lawsuit filed last Wednesday against the  county on behalf of her children has renewed that debate.  </P> <P> Complaints of poor service and inattention are not new to local law  enforcement. The Los Angeles Police Department was besieged by a coalition of  civic organizations a year ago demanding equal service and protection. Studies  by the department indicated that it took several minutes longer to respond to  911 emergency calls in less affluent sections of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department has released no such study.  </P> <P> A basic service that police provide is protection. It is that service that  Navarro, a Latina who was allegedly slain by her estranged husband in a  converted garage in East Los Angeles, was clearly denied.  </P> <P> There are a variety of reasons why police resent responding to  domestic-violence calls. Officers sometime feel uncertain about how to solve  domestic disputes. Officers sometime view domestic complaints as one party  attempting to manipulate them into punishing the other. A lack of physical  signs of abuse can often diminish a victim's credibility. Officers called in to  arrest an abusive husband are sometimes attacked by both the victim and abuser.  And, when both parties are injured, it is sometimes difficult to determine  which individual started the fight. They are also annoyed by the reluctance of  victims to follow through with prosecution.  </P> <P> The list of mitigating circumstances is endless. Yet it does not relieve police  from their duty to investigate these matters.  </P> <P> Police agencies seem to have adopted a play-it-by-the-ear approach in dealing  with domestic disputes. The state Justice Department mandates that all domestic  violences detected by officers be described in a report. It is impossible to  report the severity of a domestic dispute if no one investigates. Sheriff  Sherman Block's position that "no response" was correct in the Navarro incident  says that there is no danger unless the gun is at your head.  </P> <P> It is obvious that equal protection cannot be ensured for this country's  citizens if we fail to adopt more comprehensive policies in dealing with  domestic violence. In addition to policy amendments, there are training and  organizational changes that can enhance the effectiveness of officers in  dealing with domestic violence calls. One step would be to expand training  curriculum for domestic violence. The majority of calls police respond to don't  involve gunplay or burglaries. In spite of this, most police training is geared  toward combat situations that may arise only a few times in the careers of  officers.  </P> <P> A second step would be the inclusion of experts and victims from battered  women's centers in the process. Women deserve an active role in shaping the  training that could save their lives. Legislation should be introduced  requiring treatment before chronic abusers can be released from custody. In  cases of repeated life-threatening abuse or stalking of victims, the abuser  should be required to register with the police agency in the jurisdiction in  which the former spouse resides.  </P> <P> Some departments use what is called a "premise history." A premise history is  computer-stored information on a specific address. When officers receive a call  to respond to a certain address, the premise history informs them of prior  complaints or unusual incidents at the address.  </P> <P> Premise-history information is available to the dispatcher, and he or she may  consider it in making a decision on sending a patrol unit on a call. Had a  premise history been entered in the Navarro case, information regarding Maria  Navarro's expired restraining order, her husband's prior incidents of violence  and any serious crimes committed at the address would have been available to  the dispatcher.  </P> <P> Police should also have the authority to issue a court summons in cases of  serious conflict. The summons would require the estranged couple to make a  formal appearance before a hearing officer dealing solely with spousal abuse  issues. More direct long-term help could be provided in this form.  </P> <P> Service to victims of spousal abuse and other crimes occurring in the inner  city hinge on perceptions police officers have about the residents of the area.  Reshaping attitudes of officers about the poor should result in better service  for the disadvantaged. Information is the best weapon against the stereotypes  and cynicism that police officers bring to work with them.  </P> <P> It is imperative that police officers be educated to understand that crime  victims have a legitimate right to service whether they live in a penthouse or  a public-housing tract.  </P></p>

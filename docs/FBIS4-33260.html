			<p>BFN     [Text] Belem do Para (Brazil), 5 Jun (EFE) -- The foreign  ministers of the member countries of the Organization of  American States (OAS) reiterated in their General Assembly the  need to seek a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis, in  contrast to the thesis that supports armed intervention.    In brief statements made before the traditional "informal  meeting of foreign ministers" and prior to tomorrow's opening of  the OAS General Assembly, most ministers came out in favor of  maintaining the policy of sanctions against the Haitian coupist  military.    Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, who will  chair the "ad hoc" OAS foreign ministers meeting to be held on  Monday to study the Haitian crisis, affirmed that they have  drafted a resolution of consensus that is almost finished. It  is almost certain that a statement will be issued here  "reaffirming the search for a peaceful solution based on all the  UN and OAS resolutions that have been adopted throughout this  period," Aranibar stated.    The Bolivian foreign minister said that, at the 24th OAS  General Assembly being held in this Brazilian coastal city, the  countries of the continent will also condemn "all illegal acts  that are being committed and the continual and systematic  violation of human rights in Haiti."    Among the OAS countries, "there is a deep conviction that a  return to democracy and the return of President (Jean-Bertrand)  Aristide are essential elements for the peaceful solution that  the continent wants," Aranibar said. He added that his country  "is opposed to any armed action." "Any decision along those  lines could cause a cure worse that the illness," the president  of the "ad-hoc" meeting said, adding that "some new ideas" are  being studied to reinforce sanctions, "but nothing spectacular."    Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, whose country  has not ruled out armed intervention in Haiti to resolve the  crisis following the coup against Aristide in 1991, did not  refer to this point, but indicated that he expects that this  meeting will reiterate the message of the international  community that "the de facto government must end very soon."    "We have already done plenty for this to happen through  cooperation, and we hope that new steps are adopted in the next  few days and weeks," added Talbott, even though he did not  specify the types of additional measures he was referring to.    The U.S. representative to the OAS meeting was optimistic  regarding a solution to the Haitian crisis because of the  "extraordinary solidarity" Assembly participants have displayed  regarding this problem.    Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Naranjo, on  the  other hand, said "there are still certain diplomatic, economic,  and financial actions that can be implemented before thinking of  more extreme measures." He added, "I believe that it is still  not time for the use of force; instead, certain additional  sanctions are still required.    The only person to openly admit the possibility of military  intervention in Haiti was Argentine Foreign Relations Minister  Guido di Tella who said his country would back an action of this  sort if it were agreed to and authorized by the UN Security  Council. Nevertheless, Di Tella affirmed that for the time  being, what has to be done is to guarantee the closure of the  border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in order to  comply with the total embargo imposed by the Security Council,  which went into effect on 21 May.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Konstantin Parishkura under the "Peninsula" </F> rubric: "Sevastopol Will Remain Russian Naval Base"]    [Text] "The experts have managed mainly to complete work  on dividing the water craft of the Black Sea Fleet into  classes," said Vice Admiral Volodymyr Beskorovaynyy, commander  of the Ukrainian Navy, upon the completion of talks between  Ukrainian and Russian delegations on the problems of the Black  Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. The experts' conclusions have not been  officially formulated yet, while Vice Prime Minister Valeriy  Shmarov, head of the Ukrainian delegation, told journalists that  Sevastopol will definitely remain a base of the Russian  Federation Navy following a corresponding legal procedure. The  location where Kiev will receive ships after the division of the  Black Sea Fleet is yet unknown, although Donuzlav is being named  as the most probable port.    In the meantime it has become known that a joint working  group of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians is supposed to  submit proposals before 15 June on harmonizing the constitutions  and legislation of both sides. The Ukrainian delegation and the  working group of the Crimean Supreme Soviet have appealed to  President Kravchuk and Ukraine's parliament to introduce no  sanctions before this date for not acting on the decree calling  for bringing Crimea's laws into line with those of Ukraine. The  sides urged the presidents and parliamentarians of Ukraine and  Crimea "not to take unlawful, uncoordinated actions in regard of  the power structures responsible for the maintenance of law and  order in Crimea."    On 6 June the presidium of Crimea's Supreme Soviet appointed  Vladimir Karpov, adviser to the president of Crimea, head of the  joint working group that will draft and submit proposals on  bringing the republic's laws into line with those of Ukraine.  His candidacy is supposed to be up for confirmation at today's  session of the Supreme Soviet of Crimea when the deputies hear a  report on the results of the talks with the Ukrainian delegation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Tunis, 9 Feb (MENA)--Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed Salah Dembri has praised the cooperation and  coordination between Egypt and Algeria. He described  Egyptian-Algerian relations as solid, adding that an extensive  program for joint bilateral cooperation has been in force for  years, the most prominent result of which was the official visit  to Cairo by Ali Kafi, then head of the Higher State Council, and  his meeting with President Mubarak.    In an exclusive interview with a MENA correspondent in  Tunis,  Dembri noted a constant political dialogue between Egypt and  Algeria to outline the main features of the two countries'  common fate and the difficulties facing each country, adding  that the circumstances each country is going through require  constant rapprochement and closeness.    In the interview with MENA on the sidelines of the recent  meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] foreign ministers in  Tunis, Dembri stressed that there is constant coordination and  information exchange between the Egyptian and Algerian security  authorities to determine ways to confront terrorism and  extremism. He emphasized facing the conspiracies to which the  two states are subjected as model states in the Arab world. He  noted that the two must coordinate to protect their political  position in the Arab world, since the stability of each country  means the stability of the other Arab countries.    On the identity of the forces that are trying to shake up  security and stability in Egypt and Algeria, Dembri said:  Particular foreign quarters are plotting together against Egypt  and Algeria and the responsible authorities in both countries  have accurate information about them.    Dembri stressed that the policy of new Algerian President  Liamine Zeroual seeks to achieve national accord among all  Algerian forces and parties and to bring together all Algerians  within a unified and prosperous community. He added that the  dialogue the Algerian authority is holding with various Algerian  forces is open to all sincere citizens without exception,  representing the political structure of the dialogue and the  building of an Algerian society that combines all its sons. The  only exception, he added, is the exclusion of all signs of  violence and armed extremism. He emphasized that the dialogue  is open to all political forces in Algeria that reject violence  as a means to achieve or stay in power.    Dembri noted that he agreed with his Moroccan counterpart  and  the secretary of the Libyan Committee for Unity during the  recent AMU meetings in Tunis to hold meetings on a ministerial  level to resolve the existing differences between Algeria and  Morocco over the Sahara and those between Algeria and Libya. He  said a working plan was established to overcome the difficulties.    Dembri noted that Algeria is now holding negotiations with  the international financial and monetary institutions to  implement a plan to build a new Algerian economy, an open,  market economy, that could help to overcome the current and the  expected difficulties.

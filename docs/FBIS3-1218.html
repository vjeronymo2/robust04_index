James?    [Barkhuizen] Norma, from a quiet Bisho everything has  suddenly erupted into chaos. People are out on the streets, the  whole of Bisho is filled with people carrying placards and  shouting slogans. Earlier when I was at Brigadier Gqozo's house  I was forced by his bodyguards -- at least six of them, all  armed -- I was forced to call Television News in the earlier  bulletin and to say Brigadier Gqozo was not under house arrest.  When I had reported that, the bodyguards brought the brigadier  into the room to speak with you on the telephone. It was a very  tense situation. Later I left, and at the gate, when I was  leaving the palace, a Ciskei Defense Force member, a corporal,  told me that he was going to search my car because Brig. Gqozo  must not be allowed to escape under any cirumstances. Shortly  after that Brig. Gqozo was taken out through the palace gates  under guard. I waited for them at the Ciskei police college  where the strike has been under way since yesterday, and where  the hostages are being held. Brig. Gqozo wanted to speak with  Ciskeian police force members in small groups at the college. On  his arrival at the gates he was led into an ambush. No shots  were fired, but people armed and in Casspirs [armored vehicle]  and other vehicles surrounded his own armored vehicle and his  bodyguards. One cannot tell whether the bodyguards themselves  led him into the ambush, whether they are part of the plot, or  whether they have also now been arrested. But they were taken  back from the police college under armed guard in a convoy, back  through Bisho and out to the Bisho stadium, where the Bisho  massacre took place in 1992. Civil servants, Ciskei Defense  Force and Police Force members have all gathered in the stadium.  They are demanding to hear Brig. Gqozo. That is the situation  at the moment. I will have to leave for the stadium now to see  what happens there.    [Odendaal] Thank you very much, James.</p>

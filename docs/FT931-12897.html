			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Investment of Pounds 19m to expand Humber ports THE HUMBER ports are to get more than Pounds 19m of investment to cope with growing demand from European traffic across the North Sea, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Most of the investment will go on an Pounds 18m extension of the Immingham oil terminal, announced yesterday, which is used by oil company Conoco for its Humber refinery, and Total and Fina for their adjacent and jointly-owned Lindsey refinery. A smaller investment of Pounds 1.2m in the Port of Hull, to restore inner and outer lock gates at Alexandra Dock, will have a wider impact on general cargoes. The dock was closed in 1981 because overmanning made it uncompetitive with non-unionised wharves further up the Humber estuary. Associated British Ports, the owner, decided to spend Pounds 2m reopening it on trial two years ago, after the government's abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme in 1989 enabled lower staffing levels to be achieved. ABP has funded the Hull investment alone but is sharing its Immingham jetty development costs with Conoco, which will contribute Pounds 4m. Mr Alan Hodson, who runs the Conoco refinery, said the new jetty was needed to cope with growing export traffic. The new berth should open in April next year, the 25th anniversary of the commissioning of the terminal. Construction will be undertaken by Amec Civil Engineering. ABP owns the ports of Immingham, Grimsby, Hull and Goole.</p>

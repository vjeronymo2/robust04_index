			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Quito frames its market laws under the volcano - Sarita Kendall on an equity revolution in Ecuador Two laws which should revolutionise the size and scope of the Ecuadorian stock market are being put to Congress by the government. The modernisation law, including the framework for a far-reaching privatisation programme, has already raised heated debate in and out of Congress. The capital markets project also covers a lot of ground and is designed to develop and regulate the stock market, so that it can play a major part in the privatisation process. Financial experts believe that it would have been more logical to send the capital markets law through first, particularly as the government is extremely anxious to guarantee 'total transparency' (a modish phrase in Quito) for privatisation. Mr Edison Ortiz, president of the Quito stock exchange, expects the law to slip through fairly easily: 'It will professionalise the market and ensure high ethical and technical standards. The government wants to show that it is possible to privatise without overconcentration of shares.' The Quito stock exchange, which began operating in 1970, could hardly be quieter. Up above one of the main business streets, with a magnificent view of the semi-active volcano that looms over the city, the glass phone booths are empty; there is a slight flurry among the half-dozen present as some local bank shares are offered for sale. But Mr Ortiz believes this will soon change: 'With privatisation, the total value of operations could go from USDollars 100m a year to USDollars 2bn - or more if the unregulated market can be formalised. We want to bring in as many investors and institutions as possible.' Shares account for less than 1 per cent of market transactions in Quito and Guayaquil; the 1992 figure was just under half a million dollars. Although this is partly due to the fact that most business is done outside the stock exchange, very few shares are traded in Ecuador. Companies tend to be family-run, with capital raised through the family network. While there is a growing demand for shares, prices have remained surprisingly low: stocks are so prized, and the alternatives are so limited, that people prefer not to sell. The last two months of 1992 brought a sudden jump in trading and the surge is expected to continue as the state sells off shares in mixed companies. This can be done without any new legislation: it is the sale of assets in more sensitive (and juicier) areas, such as telecommunications, that is at stake in Congress. 'Big companies like the cement works would add a lot of liquidity to the market,' says Mr Alberto Dorfzaun, president of the Investban financial and stockbroking group. 'Things are changing, there are more opportunities, shares are starting to pick up. Most people hold on to them because they are such a good investment.' Although plans for privatisation cover virtually all sectors, including electricity, ports, railways and oil, the government is still undecided about specific mechanisms. Concern about political reaction, monopolies and transparency has dictated caution, but the programme must get under way rapidly in order to produce results within President Sixto Duran Ballen's four-year term. Attracting foreign investment and returning capital is essential for the privatisation of the bigger companies and the government has promised to put foreign investors on the same footing as nationals. A decree published in January eased registration and reduced red tape, but all-important tax differences still have to be tackled. Foreign companies pay 36 per cent income tax, compared with the national rate of 25 per cent, and foreign investment funds are liable for 8 per cent capital gains tax. Liberalisation of the Ecuadorian economy, with access to much larger markets, should push local companies to raise capital on the stock exchange. Mr Ortiz expects companies to open up and new shares to be traded more frequently; market commissions have been reduced, pension funds are to be encouraged and the Quito stock exchange is beginning to sell itself more actively. Once the rules are in place, the phone lines should start buzzing.</p>

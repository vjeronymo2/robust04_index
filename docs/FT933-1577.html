			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Arts: 'Giovanni' and 'Tito' open Glyndebourne tour The performance began even before the conductor had lifted his baton; it was a virtuoso exhibition of disciplined passion which only only someone really short of money could achieve. Sarah Playfair, the Glyndbourne Touring Opera's administrator stood before the footlights wringing the hearts of the Sadlers Wells audience with lamentation for the loss of its grant. The prospect of a sizeable Arts Council reduction in opera funding - to be phased in gradually or, in the case of GTO, with brutal immediacy  - is now looming menacingly large. In response, Miss Playfair gave us the first sample of what may prove to be a new kind of performance in which her audience-rousing rhetoric was in danger of overshadowing the evening's account of La clemenza di Tito. She needed to. In the summer, Glyndebourne received warning that the 1993 six-city, eight-week programme (September 16 - November 13) is the last for which GTO can expect public funding. This threat is pointed at the head of an artistic enterprise whose attention to its touring duties has obviously met every possible Arts Council criterion and measurement of quality. It is so patently unjust and lacking in logic that public outcry has already started, and can only be expected to increase during the tour (it will if Miss Playfair and her associates have anything to do with it). But if GTO is to go under - a thought too horrible to contemplate for anyone concerned with the health present and future of British opera - it will have done so fighting, and with a 1993 schedule that shows exactly what the company ideal is all about and why it is worth fighting for. Two Mozart productions from the main festival lead the way - Don Giovanni in the famous Peter Hall staging of 1977, Tito in the two-year-old one by Nicholas Hytner, both cast with rising talents adding new lustre to the experience of each. Still to come is the British premiere of an important opera, Cornet Rilke's Song of Love and Death, by a significant (and in Britain largely unknown) German composer, Siegfried Matthus. In truth, neither of the Mozart performances - Thursday's Tito, Tuesday's Giovanni - came fully into focus: in both cases the good things, of which there were many, were compromised by flecks of ensemble imprecision, stage untidiness which can be confidently expected to clear as the season gets under way. (But the ill-considered surtitling of both operas is something that needs urgent attention: the mirth aroused during Donna Anna's narration, in defiance of its powerful delivery by Susan McCulloch, was shaming.) Hard-driven musical direction by both Ivor Bolton (Tito) and Louis Langree (Giovanni) added to the feeling of unsettlement. Both these young conductors, approaching their operas from the 'period' end of the Mozart stylistic spectrum, concentrate on light orchestral sonorities, clean rhythmic patterns and fast-moving dramatic paragraphs. In Mr Bolton's hands the limpid Classicism of Tito is treated with a foursquare directness that amounts to brusqueness; Mr Langree's Giovanni displays a rather more natural sense of phrase-shape and part-balance, but only fitfully so. Relax, chaps] The 1977 Giovanni production, seldom matched for its surface stillness and dramatic mobilisation of fiery inner tensions, is here rather dimly reproduced - David Massarella's is 'based on' Hall's, the giveaway phrase. Too much clutter, too much cameo business: and where is the fiery cross that marks Giovanni's passage to hell? Still, the revival has several strong points in its favour, none stronger than Simon Keenlyside's utterly compelling account of the title role. Whether in the lizard slither of his limbs or the cold glitter and unwavering gaze of his unsmiling eyes, the physical address of the role betokens total absorption in its substance. The Italian words fall exquisitely from his lips; except for a below-pitch serenade, the youthful lyric baritone is in wonderful trim. He forms a fine partnership with Steven Page's lean, Dickensian Leporello, another lipsmackingly lively deliverer of words. Susan McCulloch's Anna (her dramatic-soprano breadth of tone well employed), Susan Bickley's Elvira (edgy but emotionally ripe) and Adrian Thompson's musically astute Ottavio are all full of promise not wholly realised on opening night. Hytner's Tito production - a typically tough, intelligent response to this late, endlessly fascinating sample of Mozartian opera seria theatricality - lacks its full festival stage apparatus but retains much of its original cool thoughtfulness. The level of singing, a touch more 'local' than that notched by the Giovanni cast, is never less than competent and, in the case of Fiona Janes (a rich, dignified Sextus) and Anne Williams-King (an uneven Vitellia with a splendidly fearless vocal approach), a good deal more. Nigel Robson's Titus is subtle, deep, expertly negotiated. The Stephen Oliver recitatives, written to replace those produced (in haste) by Sussmayr for Mozart, are a worthwhile experiment that plainly failed. Back to Sussmayr as soon as decently possible] GTO at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London EC1, until October 9</p>

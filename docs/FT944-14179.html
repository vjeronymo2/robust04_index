			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Poll shock puts Pasok in leadership dilemma: The search for a successor to the ailing Papandreou The defeat of Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greece's former European affairs minister, in Sunday's run-off poll for mayor of Athens amounts to more than a temporary embarrassment for the governing Socialists. It complicates a succession struggle now gathering momentum in the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) as Mr Andreas Papandreou, 76, the prime minister, prepares to hand over the leadership, probably next spring. That is when Mr Papandreou is expected either to seek the presidency (a largely ceremonial post) through a vote in parliament, or, if his health worsens further, to retire from politics. Until Sunday, Mr Pangalos was the frontrunner to take over the helm of Pasok. His colourful personality, including a talent for putting down political opponents in a few words, appealed to the party's populist faction, offsetting the image of an intellectual more at home in Paris than Athens. It was always going to be a close race in Athens where voters, as well as being wealthier and more conservative, have few inhibitions about showing their dissatisfaction with the government. Mr Papandreou did his best to shorten the odds with a last-minute offer to inject an extra Dr40bn (Pounds 107m) into the city budget for 1995. But Mr Pangalos's personal attacks on his conservative opponent, Mr Dimitris Avramopoulos, an ex-diplomat who entered politics last year, clearly backfired. The leftwing voters whose support he needed in the run-off deserted in droves, casting blank ballots or switching to Mr Avramopoulos, who won 54.4 per cent. Such a heavy defeat marks a personal failure for Mr Pangalos, especially when the Pasok candidate managed to edge out a conservative in the run-off poll for governor of Attica, the district that includes Athens. Overall, too, the local government election results showed the Socialists maintaining a lead of around five percentage points over the conservative New Democracy party. Other candidates for the Pasok leadership are now back in the picture, though Mr Papandreou is not likely to give any immediate indications of his preference. Potential contenders find it hard to jostle for favour in Pasok's byzantine atmosphere, with Mr Papandreou distanced from political associates by weak health and his wife Dimitra, who restricts access to him in her role as head of the premier's personal office. Few prominent Socialists seem capable of bridging the divisions between the party's populists - who are nationalist and insist on state participation in the economy - and the younger pro-European technocrats. Mr Gerasimos Arsenis, the defence minister, has tried to build support among the nationalists, while Mr Costas Simitis, the industry minister, is close to the pro-Europeans. In the year since the Socialists returned to power, both have been cultivating alliances in Pasok's central committee and in grassroots party organisations. However, both men are tainted in the eyes of Pasok supporters by having quarrelled with Mr Papandreou in the past. Recently, Mr Papandreou has a given a free hand in policy-making to several younger cabinet ministers, among them Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister who is enthusiastically re-launching privatisation in Greece. The alternative to nominating a successor would be for Mr Papandreou to hand over power to a collective leadership. It would probably have to be led by the hard-working Mr Akis Tsochatzopoulos, Pasok's secretary general and Mr Papandreou's most loyal political colleague.</p>

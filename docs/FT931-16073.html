			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: IRI approves break-up of SME foods side IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday formally approved the break-up and partial disposal of its SME foods, catering and retailing unit in what could be one of the country's biggest sales this year. SME, which made net profits of L125.6bn (Dollars 91.18m) on turnover of L5,814bn in 1991, will be broken into at least three, and possibly four, operations, most of which will be sold. Shares in SME, which have risen sharply on privatisation hopes, climbed L95 to L5,845 in Milan yesterday. IRI has appointed Wasserstein Perella, the US investment bank, to prepare the break-up plan. Once the reorganisation is complete, private investors in SME, which is almost 65 per cent owned by IRI, will be offered shares in the new divisions, which will be quoted. Once IRI has picked buyers via competitive auctions, the successful bidders are expected to launch public tender offers for the remaining shares floating. Only SME's GS supermarket chain and Autogrill catering division will be retained, at least in the short term. SME's other activities, concentrated in food production, will be split into two, or possibly three, units. One will comprise frozen foods and sweets, the other vegetable oils, canned vegetables and fresh milk. Milk may be split off separately. Investors will also be invited into the retailing and catering business, although IRI has said it would expect to retain a significant stake. Public-sector control could be guaranteed through the arrival of other state or municipal shareholders. Retailing and catering accounted for L3,525bn of SME's sales in 1991. Turnover at GS and smaller retailing units was around L2,500bn while Autogrill's sales were about L1,000bn. SME's food sales reached L2,323bn in 1991. Its Bertolli vegetable oils and Cirio canned vegetables brands are household names in Italy. Cirio and linked companies have almost 28 per cent of the domestic tinned tomato market, while SME group concerns come second to Unilever in olive oil. The foods business is likely to appeal to a number of Italian and multinational concerns. The frozen foods side, concentrated in the Italgel division, could interest multinationals like Nestle or Unilever. The Italian Ferruzzi agro-industrial group has expressed interest in the food production business, though its ambitions could be clipped by its current high indebtedness.</p>

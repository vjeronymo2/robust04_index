			<p>BFN     [Text] As we have already reported, President Zhelev this  morning invited representatives of the parliamentary groups to a  meeting to discuss the political situation in the country. Only  Stefan Savov [leader of the Union of Democratic Forces  parliamentary group] showed up for this meeting.    At lunchtime President Zhelev met with Professor Nikolay  Vasilev and Georgi Kostov, representatives of the NSD [New  Alliance for Democracy], and with Ruslan Semerdzhiev and Ivan  Pushkarov of the Assembly for Democracy [SD]. At the meeting  they discussed possible ways out of the present political  situation. President Zhelev suggested that a definite date  should be fixed for holding early parliamentary elections,  which, in his view, should take place at the end of September or  the beginning of October. Once this date had been determined,  the political forces should reach an agreement on electing a  government. During this period parliament should concentrate on  passing the most urgent economic legislation. Two months before  the date fixed for the elections, the government should become a  caretaker and start preparing for early parliamentary elections.    President Zhelev also explained his views on the way out of  the present political situation with Aleksandur Tomov, GOR  [Civic Alliance for the Republic] leader. As Tomov said a few  minutes ago after the meeting had ended, they discussed the  possibility of signing an agreement on early parliamentary  elections within the next 10 days and of ensuring a smooth  transitional period until the elections are held.</p>

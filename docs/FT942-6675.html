			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (4): A 'back to basics' policy for your home - Period pieces / Need to restore an old house? In search of old bricks, tiles, flagstones or hearths? James Fisher has the answers Architectural salvage is a lucrative business. The practice is not new. Builders throughout time have reclaimed old materials to re-use them. This makes sense because it saves money - or at least it used to. Now we are alert to the value of preservation - so it makes better sense to save the salvaged artefacts and sell them to home-owners who will pay a good price for something authentic. It is a 'back to basics' policy of which almost everyone would approve. Prices do vary, but they are generally high - the idea being that if you want the real thing, you must be prepared to pay for it. There are also strict laws relating to architectural salvaging. The listing of a building not only protects it from structural change or demolition, but also prevents the removal of its fixtures and fittings without consent. So the older the required object, the less likely it is that it will appear on the market - and the higher the price if it does. But it is always worth shopping around and for some rare fittings it is very necessary. When Drummond Shaw, a former City commodities broker, moved to a Georgian house which needed restoration, he wanted to do the job properly. But he had problems finding what he needed locally in the Guildford area of Surrey. After he had restored his house, he recognised with entrepreneurial insight, a business opportunity. Five years ago he set up Drummonds of Bramley on an old farm to cater for the needs of others with property to restore. His colleague, Major Tony Swayne, claims expansively that the company has just about everything anyone could need for renovations and covers domestic property from the Tudor period onwards. Where necessary, Drummonds will undertake to find particular items that people want. With an estimated 70 per cent of the stock being bought in, Swayne admits the company has to be very careful what it buys. It also has builders who are skilled in the use of traditional materials and who can be employed by customers. In some cases, the way fixtures are installed can be as important as their authenticity. In addition, Drummonds offers an unusual specialist service. For about Pounds 900, the company will despatch your chipped and stained bath to Eastern Europe and return it sparkling with six fresh coats of vitreous enamel and a 50-year guarantee. The price varies according to weight and size. If, however, a new old bath appeals, Drummonds has some to offer, including one from the Earl of Derby. Another company in the salvage business is Dorset Reclamation, of Bere Regis, which is run by Tessa Pearce. Her sources include hospitals, schools and, occasionally, dangerous structures that are being demolished. One of her recent acquisitions was a set of Georgian doors. Pearce stocks all the usual general fixtures as well as the more localised staddlestones. Dorset Reclamation has a good selection of original flagstones, hand-made clay roofing tiles, oak beams, quarry tiles and floorboards. The company can deliver, and will search for specific objects that customers want. Because of the protective legislation, certain older fixtures and fittings, such as lead guttering, are no longer readily available. So if you want a match, the only option is to have the fitting made - which can be expensive. Original bricks can be bought for houses under 200 years old. Lazdan builders' merchants, in east London, currently has a stock of bricks reclaimed from demolished buildings. Very old bricks can be bought but they are difficult to find in significant quantities. Again, the alternative is to have a specialist firm make up a matching product. A company specialising in copying bricks is W T Lamb of Haslemere, Surrey. People in the business are naturally sensitive about the issue of provenance. But it can be advantageous when authenticity is assured. 'Provenance is important and adds to value,' says Les Smith, sales manager of the London Architectural Salvage and Supply Company. 'A bathroom from the Savoy, for instance, is not just any old bathroom.' This provides an extra incentive, if it were needed, to deal in goods with provenance. LASSCo has been in business for 20 years. The company says it houses one of the UK's largest stocks of architectural antiques and reclaimed fixtures and fittings in its warehouse, in a church just north of the City of London. Other companies claim to have the largest supply. LASSCo clears buildings that are due to be demolished or refurbished. Its current stock of radiators comes from County Hall, London, the former headquarters of the Greater London Council, which is being converted into a hotel. There are fire surrounds a-plenty, stair rods, doors, weather vanes and, appropriately for the surroundings, church pews and the occasional lectern. The company also sells original brass door handles and keyholes, and it has an extensive range of Edwardian taps and shower units which can be ordered from a catalogue. LASSCo also has some very unusual items, including a panelled deco interior taken from a club and priced at Pounds 26,500. The company has also recently acquired the complete neo-classical entrance that once adorned the headquarters of the National Farmers' Union. Smith is open to offers on this, but expects it to go outside the UK. Architectural Heritage, in Cheltenham, has a large stock of 19th century oak, mahagony and pine panelling. The company has a range of original fireplaces and also makes stone fireplaces to order because it is often difficult to find one to fit the available space.

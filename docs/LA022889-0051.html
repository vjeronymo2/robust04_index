			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'NINJA 3': BLAND LEADING THE BLAND  </P> <P> The karate genre is alive, if hardly kicking, in "American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt"  (citywide).  </P> <P> The silly fight scenes gave a few sound-effects experts a lot of work, even if  the violent snaps, crackles and pops on the sound track don't precisely match  the fights staged on screen. It's a cinch that the sound men still put far more  care into their work than did writer-director Cedric Sundstrom, who has  bothered neither with wit nor logic.  </P> <P> All that the tedious "Ninja 3" has in common with with two earlier "Ninjas" is  the likable presence of Steve James as the brawny black sidekick. The new white  lead in this episode is the wooden but hunky David Bradley, playing Sean  Davidson, a young man who mastered martial arts after seeing his karate-champ  father gunned down at a tournament by robbers.  </P> <P> Either the lead character or the screenwriter seems to have forgotten the  father after the prologue, and thus, the hero never seems to recognize the  baddies as the very same scum who orphaned him. Gifted with a poor memory and  stripped of a revenge motive, Davidson mostly just worries about the bad guys'  cache of homicidal germs as he demolishes craniums by the hundreds.  </P> <P> Even flamboyant Marjoe Gortner, who has made a career out of being -- as Daffy  Duck would say -- deth-spicable, is bland unto death here as the chief bad guy.  For a movie with so many flying feet, "American Ninja 3" (MPAA-rated R) is  amazingly short on kicks.  </P> <P> 'AMERICAN NINJA 3: BLOOD HUNT'  </P> <P> A Cannon presentation. Producer Harry Alan Towers. Director/writer Cedric  Sundstrom. Executive producer Avi Lerner. Editor Michael J. Duthie. Music  George S. Clinton. With David Bradley, Steve James, Marjoe Gortner, Michele  Chan, Calvin Jung.  </P> <P> Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes.  </P> <P> MPAA-rated: R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  </P></p>

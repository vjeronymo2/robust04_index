			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Deutsche makes DM500m provision for Schneider loans Deutsche Bank will have to make provisions of DM500m (Pounds 200m) against its exposure to the collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group, the bank's chief executive said yesterday. This is about 40 per cent of the bank's total DM1.2bn loans to Schneider. The bank had previously insisted that its loans to finance eight of Schneider's property developments were well secured, although it had hinted that provisions would amount to several hundred million D-Marks. Analysts had estimated that the bank would have to make provisions of DM300m. The Schneider group's collapse last month was the biggest in Germany's property sector since the second world war. Mr Hilmar Kopper and his boardroom colleagues faced intense shareholder criticism over the Schneider affair, at the bank's annual meeting in Dusseldorf yesterday. Last month he dismissed the DM50m owing to trade creditors as 'peanuts', but yesterday he was apologetic about the bank's role and for this particular comment. 'Mistakes of professional judgment were certainly made,' he conceded. He added that loans to Schneider were made in at least one case on the basis of manipulated documentation, for example forged rental agreements which gave rise to fraudulent property valuations. Mr Kopper told shareholders that despite the Schneider affair the level of provisioning against bad and doubtful debts would actually fall at the bank this year, reflecting recovery in the German economy. However, he said the bank's record profits in 1993 could not be matched this year. Group operating profit, after risk provisioning, was down more than 10 per cent in the first four months, against the comparable period in 1993. The interest margin showed signs of narrowing, Mr Kopper said, and profits from the bank's own account trading activities would be down from last year's spectacular levels. Last year group operating profits rose 16 per cent to DM5.3bn, after taking account of a DM1.4bn increase in risk provisioning to DM3.3bn. Lex, Page 18</p>

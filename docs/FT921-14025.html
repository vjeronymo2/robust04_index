			<p>920117 FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome faces protest on price of Aids drug A group of Wellcome shareholders will try to freeze dividend payments and force down the price of Retrovir, the Aids treatment, at the company's annual meeting today, writes Daniel Green. The Wellcome Independent Shareholders Association (Wisa) conceded that it would not succeed but that 'in future they may lower the price.' Wisa has 'about 60' members, all small shareholders. It has links with shareholders in other countries including the US, where a well-established Aids lobby has been campaigning for several years to reduce the price of the drug.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 1 (AFP) -- An aide to presidential  hopeful Jacques Chirac on Tuesday [1 February] strongly  criticised an anti-unemployment package produced at the weekend  by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur as insufficient.    Jean-Louis Debre, assistant secretary-general of the  dominant  right-wing party Rally for the Republic (RPR), brought the race  for presidential elections in May 1995 into the open when he  said of the package: "Good, but could do better."    Balladur is flying high in opinion polls as favourite of the  French to succeed President Francois Mitterrand, well ahead of  Chirac. Chirac is president of the RPR and Balladur a member of  the same party.    In a statement to the daily LE MONDE Tuesday, Chirac ally  Debre criticised the package for not exempting firms from social  security charges so as to create jobs. "This does not correspond  with the different policy we want as far as employment is  concerned."    The cautious package, which was decided at a much-trumpeted  government seminar on Sunday, was mainly aimed at the key motor  and building industries. Car owners will be offered a 5,OOO  franc (850 dollar) bonus if they exchange a 10-year-old vehicle  for a new one.    An interest rate cut was announced on government-backed  house-buying savings schemes in an attempt to encourage new  property purchases by spending rather than saving. Limited  measures for job creation were also announced.    The package earned faint praise from the other component in  Balladur's governing coalition, the centre-right Union for  French Democracy (UDF). Charles Millon, leader of the UDF's  parliamentary group, said the package was "nice," but  "short-term", and called on the government to "start basic  essential reforms."    On the left, opposition Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard  said the measures were "not up to the job."    France has an unemployment rate of 12 percent and rising,  and  about 3.3 million are out of work. The government is  forecasting a 1.4 percent rise in gross domestic product in 1994.</p>

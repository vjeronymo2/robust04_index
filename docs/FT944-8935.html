			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: Not quite at the end of the road  -Smooth journey to market, but challenges remain Renault, the French motor group, will today end its journey to the Paris stock market. Its flotation has been a smooth ride, in spite of a cautious response from the general public, the principal target of the company's state shareholder. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said retail demand for the shares, which saw the public offer 1.4 times subscribed, was a good performance given the state keeps control of the group - a factor which he believes had dampened investor enthusiasm. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chairman, expressed satisfaction with the operation, citing strong demand for shares from Renault's workers and from international institutional investors. However, Renault is left facing some important challenges. In particular, Mr Schweitzer must develop the company's strategy, which was derailed by the collapse of plans to merge with Volvo at the end of last year. The question of the future shareholding structure of the motor group remains a point of uncertainty. According to Mr Schweitzer, the flotation, and the fact that it has been accompanied with a FFr2bn (Dollars 381m) capital increase, will strengthen Renault's position in the international car industry. Its financial position is healthy. The company was one of the few motor groups to endure the sharp recession in 1992 and 1993 without falling into loss. Mr Schweitzer confirmed yesterday that results this year should see a strong improvement over the FFr1.07bn in 1993. The collapse of merger plans with Volvo has left a question mark above the company's industrial strategy. 'For several years, this was the centre piece of Renault's thinking. The two companies were well matched in terms of geographical markets and in terms of products,' says an industry analyst in Paris. 'In particular, Volvo would have given Renault a strong partner in trucks.' For Mr Schweitzer the answer to the strategic question does not lie in another grand alliance. 'We are not seeking a big marriage,' he said yesterday. Instead, the Renault chairman favours case-by-case alliances, aimed at increasing geographical penetration and reducing costs in the joint production and development of components. Renault already has such partnerships. It co-operates with Peugeot, its domestic rival, in the development of V6 engines. In July, Renault concluded an agreement with Iveco, the truck-making division of Fiat of Italy, for the joint development of cabs. A project to develop gear boxes with Volkswagen of Germany is under way. Mr Schweitzer has a free hand to pursue further agreements. 'We could not do this while we were in the process of the flotation . . . but within the next few months we will start negotiations,' he said. The Renault chairman does not go into details. But there has been much flirtation with Mercedes-Benz of Germany. Mr Gerard Longuet, the former industry minister, made no secret of his desire for co-operative ventures between the two companies, while Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of Mercedes, described Renault as 'a very attractive partner'. Partnerships are important, not just to strengthen Renault's position in a consolidating and fiercely competitive industry. The French government has described industrial alliances as a necessary condition for the full privatisation of the motor group, although Mr Jose Rossi, the new industry minister, has indicated this need not take the form of a grand alliance. Few doubt that yesterday's flotation is simply a step in Renault's eventual privatisation. Mr Alphandery said yesterday such an operation was 'not on the agenda'. But once presidential elections are out of the way next spring, the government may be encouraged to review a dossier rendered politically sensitive by Renault's status as a former trade union stronghold. The centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur will also be encouraged by certain aspects of the partial privatisation. In particular, the healthy demand from Renault workers, 60 per cent of whom subscribed for shares, reduces the threat from trade unions which sought to block the flotation. International demand was strong, resulting in a subscription of more than 15 times the available shares for the institutional tranche. 'The international demand showed that France is seen as attractive as a manufacturing base and that Renault is viewed as an attractive company,' said Mr Schweitzer. His ability to forge alliances with international partners will help determine whether it remains so.</p>

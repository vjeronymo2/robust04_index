			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UN envoy due in S Africa: Cyrus Vance to begin talks on ending violence Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, last night named Mr Cyrus Vance, former US secretary of state, as the UN special representative to South Africa. Mr Vance is expected to fly in to South Africa next week to begin discussions on ending political violence and restarting constitutional negotiations. The mandate contained in Security Council resolution 765, adopted unanimously on Thursday night after a two-day debate on South Africa, steers a careful path between the positions of the government and the African National Congress (ANC). It includes a broad condemnation of the violence, in particular last month's massacre at Boipatong township, and while stressing that it is the government's responsibility to protect lives, does not suggest that Pretoria is involved in the killings. The resolution calls for the special representative 'to recommend, after discussions with the parties, measures which would assist in bringing an effective end to violence and in creating conditions for negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic. . . . South Africa.' President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, differ widely on what would be appropriate measures. The former indicates he would accept UN observers taking part in efforts to end the violence; Mr Mandela has suggested a substantial UN monitoring force will be necessary. Prospects for resuming the talks have nevertheless improved, although formal constitutional negotiations are not expected to take place before Mr Vance has reported back. Mr de Klerk has moved some way towards meeting ANC terms for restarting talks, while senior figures on both sides are concerned by the impact of the stalemate on tensions in South Africa. Discussions are continuing between the business community and trade union leaders in an effort to avert a general strike due to start on August 3. The Chamber of Mines' gold mine members and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) have agreed a 1992 wage review.</p>

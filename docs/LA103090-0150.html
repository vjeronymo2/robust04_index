			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SUIT COULD RESTORE DRIVER TRAINING  </P> <P> Huntington Beach Union High School District officials have said they sympathize  with parents in the district who want to restore hands-on driver training in  high schools, which fell victim to budget cuts in Sacramento.  </P> <P> But they also told the parents that the best hope for restoring the program to  all California schools is a legal suit brought by a Monterey County school  district that is scheduled to be heard Nov. 9.  </P> <P> Last week, a group of parents urged a meeting of district trustees to allow a  nonprofit organization to raise money to restore driver training.  </P> <P> Schools still have state money for in-class instruction, called "driver  education." But the laboratory for such classes, called "driver training," was  not funded this year by the state budget. Parents say driver instruction is  incomplete without behind-the-wheel experience.  </P> <P> But Dick Plum, coordinator of alternative education in the district, told  parents that the legal case in Monterey County could solve the issue for all  school districts.  </P> <P> Salinas Union High School District in Monterey County is legally challenging  the state's cutbacks because state law earmarks a portion of some traffic fines  solely for the use of driver training in high schools. The school district  questions the legality of using driver-training money for other purposes.  </P> <P> "If the court rules in favor of the schools, it's a simple matter," Plum said.  "All the high schools in the state will get their money back, and we can  reinstate driving training."  </P> <P> Plum said that about 3,000 students in the district are enrolled in driver  education. The district lost $363,000 in state funds when the current budget  excised money for driver training. BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

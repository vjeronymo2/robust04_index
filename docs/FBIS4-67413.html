			<p>BFN     [Text] A total of $32.71 million worth of assistance to  the country's environment sector has been approved by the  European Community (EC) for 1994.    In a report to President Ramos, National Economic and  Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito  said the assistance will go to the preservation of natural  parks, integrated protected areas and industrial pollution  abatement.    Habito said EC assistance will not only boost the  government's environmental protection program but also enhance  institutional linkages, investment promotion, agrarian reform  implementation and coconut processing.    He reported to the president that a high-level business  conference is expected to be held in Europe in September or  October this year.    "This will explore possible business opportunities between  the Philippines and EC countries," Habito said. "Hopefully, the  conference will bear fruitful results in upgrading Philippine-EC  trade relations."    The EC infused a total of $75.37 million in the country last  year which mostly financed rural development projects in Western  Samar, Catanduanes, Aurora, Guimaras, Biliran, Bantayan, Camotes  and Pitogo.    "The private sector also received grant financing for a  packaging center and assistance to the computer software  industry, which reflected greater private sector access to  official development assistance," Habito said.    Habito informed the president that the EC has expressed  interest in initiating regular high-level consultations to  review pipeline projects as well as its ongoing projects. The  first consultation might be held this May, he said.</p>

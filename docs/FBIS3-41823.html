This is fundamentally different from the existing  method of breaking up DNA by radical cutting, and its most  unique characteristic is that cutting is done by hydrolysis, the  same as with natural enzymes. It is predicted that this can be  used as "scissors" that can cut human DNA at any desired  location by bonding lanthanide complex to nucleic acid  recognizing molecules. If it can be given concrete form, this  will have broad application in research on the treatment of  cancer and AIDS, and future advances in research will be  carefully watched.    In recent years, advances have been made in research on  man-made materials that will selectively cut DNA and RNA. There  are many restriction enzymes in the natural world that cut DNA  and RNA, but while restriction enzymes uniquely recognize the  base sequence of DNA and hydrolyze efficiently, cutting location  is limited by type of enzyme and cutting cannot be performed at  specified locations.    So far, however, artificial restriction enzymes that will  cut  DNA by the hydrolyses method used by restriction enzymes have  not been developed. This is because DNA phosphodiester bonding  is extremely stable, with a half-life of about 200 million years  (under pH7, 25C conditions; RNA is about 130 years), and  the artificial enzymes developed so far break up DNA, and in  effect cut them through radical generation.    The Komiyama group and others have been conducting research  on cutting DNA and RNA phosphodiester bonding by hydrolysis. In  the case of RNA, success has been achieved by using a cobalt  complex as a catalyst, but research had not made progress in the  case of DNA, which has an extremely long half-life.    Based on knowledge gained thus far, the Komiyama group  conducted research with lanthanide, a trivalent ion like cobalt,  and as a result, confirmed that cerium and other lanthanide ions  hydrolyze DNA at a very rapid speed.    Specifically, in a pH7, 50C buffer solution, cerium and  the other lanthanide base cyclic complexes in Figure 1 were  added to dimer DNA (TPT). The reaction product was measured by  high-speed liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the cutting  reaction was studied. TPT peak went down in a few hours and a  peak was formed for thymidine. There was no formation of thymina  through radical action, and it was confirmed that hydrolysis was  proceeding.    Other lanthinides also displayed cutting action vis-a-vis  the  TPT, but inversion rate after 1 week was only a few percentage  points. No progress was made with ions of iron, zinc, magnesium,  etc., and it was made clear that this is a unique characteristic  of the ions of rare earth elements.    Additionally, the electrophoresis result during experiments  with cutting 35 mer DNA (under the following conditions: 10  milli-mole concentration cerium complex, pH7.2, 24 hours) was  that the fragments were consistent with Maxam Gilbert's  migrating band, and it is assumed that the cut ends formed  complexes and became equal to phosphomonoesters.    From these research results, it is predicted that with  cerium  and other lanthanide complexes, DNA cutting action can be  controlled by ligand selection, and if these complexes are  bonded with nucleic acid recognizing molecules, cutting by means  of hydrolysis at any desired location is possible. If the  technology can be refined, it is expected that there will be no  limit to the expansion of its use as "scissors" for DNA cutting  for human and other advanced organisms and cancer.</p>

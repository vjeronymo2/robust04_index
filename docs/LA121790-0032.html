			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> On the Right Track: Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Jason Miller, who was  arrested in October for being disorderly on board a plane flight, says he's  getting back on track by completing an alcohol rehabilitation program. Miller  issued a statement in connection with being fined last week after he and a  companion pleaded guilty to public intoxication and disorderly conduct.  </P> <P> The charges against Miller resulted from an Oct. 22 incident when he was flying  from South Bend, Ind., to his home in Scranton after attending the Miami-Notre  Dame football game. Miller, 51, said both men are sorry. "This incident made me  realize that I had a problem and I have taken steps to get back on the right  track," Miller said. He is scheduled to begin rehearsals Jan. 2 for a Los  Angeles production of "Inherit the Wind," in which he will play Clarence  Darrow. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

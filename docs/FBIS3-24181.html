Kyasova: "KBR Judicial Body </F> Presents Results"]    [Text] Last Friday the work results of the KBR  [Kabardino-Balkaria Republic] People's Courts during the first  half of 1993 were given at an extended meeting of the Ministry  of Justice board and the KBR Supreme Court Presidium. The KBR  Minister of Justice, A. M. Batyrbekov, who gave a detailed  report, noted the particular significance of the activity of the  People's Courts under circumstances in which crime issues in the  republic are becoming more complex. During the period in  question, 7,681 crimes were committed, a significant portion of  which were classified as grave offenses. The number of  infractions related to narcotic substances increased by 63  percent. Persons convicted of crimes involving the use of  firearms and ammunition totaled 132, while convictions for  personal property theft grew by 12 percent. Also, 221 juveniles  were brought to trial for various illegal acts. These statistics  are more than just disconcerting, radical and decisive actions  on the part of all law-upholding bodies are needed in order to  turn the situation around and stop the rise in crime. How ready  are our courts for this? As was explained, there is no simple  answer. While giving proper due to the positive results attained  in judicial proceedings, the minister of justice noted that the  professional training and legal competence of certain  judiciaries was cause for doubt. As a consequence there are  delays, and dangerous criminals are released without  consideration being given to the graveness of the crimes they  have committed.    A. M Batyrbekov directed the attention of those gathered to  shortcomings in the work of the marshalls of the court, and  noted the necessity of increasing efforts in the area of legal  education.    The deputy chairman of the KBR Supreme Court and chairman of  the Board for Criminal Proceedings, A. S. Gelyakhov spoke on an  analysis of criminal cases based on data from appellate courts  and courts with supervisory authority. In his opinion, the  Mayskiy People's Court was deserving of the most praise, as it  had not even had one judgement reversed; a statement that could  not be made about the Nalchik Municipal Court (presided over by  V. Vybornov), the rulings of which were cited as "least stable."    In the opinion of A. S. Gelyakhov, cases in which citizens  are wrongfully convicted, and equally, those in which the guilty  are acquitted, do not further judiciaries' authority, but give  rise to justified social protest.    The acting KBR Supreme Court chairman, Georgiy Alekseyevich  Mamilov paused to discuss neglect in how civil cases are being  reviewed. According to his information, virtually every third  ruling on these types of cases was reversed in appellate  proceedings. Viewing this kind of regard for one's work  unacceptable, Mamilov spoke in favor of conducting a review and  immediately releasing judiciaries noted for neglect.    Chairmen of Municipal and Rayon People's Courts S. A.  Klyuyeva (city of Prokhladnyy), V. T. Vybornov (city of  Nalchik), I. Kh. Topalov (city of Zalukonoazhe), V. M. Khushtov  (city of Terek), A. F. Khazhnagoyev (city of Baksan), and  several others talked about problems in need of attention, as  well as their own views on how to resolve them.    The acting chief of the KBR MVD Investigation Directorate,  Mukhamed Mussov answered a number of questions that arose during  the exchange of opinions that took place, and pointed out the  importance of close cooperation between judicial bodies, the  militia, and the prosecutor's office.    We are all responsible for one thing, stressed KBR Minister  of Internal Affairs Kh. A. Shogenov. He called on judiciaries to  approach those who break the law and infringe upon the lives,  honor and dignity of other men with the utmost strictness. In  spite of differences of opinion on how to conduct the fight  against crime, KBR Prosecutor R. I. Abazov said, the strategic  focus of both judicial and law-upholding bodies is one and the  same: to protect the population from criminal acts against them.  It is in acknowledging this truth that we must proceed.    KBR Vice-President G. S. Gubin, having made a number of  serious critical remarks directed at the the republic's courts,  suggested the Minister of Justice demonstrate more consistency  in selecting personnel and utilize the services of the  qualifications commision more fully.    In spite of the impartial tone of the discourse, the finale  was marked with a pleasant announcement. Gratitude was expressed  for the results of the courts' work in 1993 and a monetary bonus  was awarded in the sum of 100 thousand rubles by order of the  republic minister of justice to the following judiciaries: A. A.  Makoyev, L. A. Shapkinaya, V. S. Khashkutovaya, M. I. Olmezov,  I. K. Borokov, L. A. Lesnykh, Kh. V. Kudryavtsevaya, V. B.  Dogov, L. M. Martynovaya, G. I. Gorislavskaya, I. Kh. Topolov,  B. Kh. Malbakhov.    KBR Prime Minister G. M. Cherkesov participated in the work  of the meeting.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] threatened Thursday [3 February] to  pull its six members from the cabinet unless the government  amends its plan to impose a 7 percent "national welfare tax" on  goods and services from 1997.    At a meeting of the party's central executive committee, SDP  leaders agreed to demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  insert into the tax legislation a provision that all the revenue  from the proposed tax be used to finance welfare-related outlays  only.    The SDP also decided to demand the setting up of a  consultative body to study the rate of the proposed tax and the  timing of implementing it.    Unless these demands are met, the SDP, the largest party in  the coalition, will pull its cabinet ministers from the Hosokawa  administration, SDP officials said.    The SDP decision came on the heels of Hosokawa's comments  that items of government outlays to be financed by the "welfare  tax" would not be specified in the tax legislation.    Koken Nosaka, an SDP executive, told reporters Thursday  morning, "we would not be able to help withdrawing from the  cabinet" unless the premier dropped his plan to replace the  current 3 percent consumption tax with the 7 percent "national  welfare tax."    Sadao Yamahana, minister in charge of political reform, and  five other SDP ministers met Hosokawa on Thursday and urged him  to reconsider his new tax program.    Hosokawa responded by instructing the leaders of the seven  coalition partners to band together for a meeting later in the  day to work out a consensus on the tax measure.    The tax, whose mechanism is almost identical to that of the  current consumption tax, is to be imposed on most goods and  services sold in Japan from April 1, 1997.    The SDP, which was in the opposition camp for 38 years of  the  postwar Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) rule, succeeded in  placing six of its legislators in the coalition cabinet last  August, after the LDP was ousted from power in a general  election.    The SDP had since lent vital support to the coalition  government.    The party holds 76 seats in the 511-member House of  Representatives, where the coalition now has a combined strength  of 261, only five seats more than a simple majority of 256. The  LDP has 222 seats in the lower chamber.    In a predawn news conference, Hosokawa said the government  decided to impose the indirect tax to offset a revenue shortfall  from planned income and corporate tax cuts and to finance the  cost of increased welfare expenditures stemming from the rapid  graying of society.    The government is expected to include a 6 trillion yen tax  cut as a major pillar of a 15 trillion yen pump-priming package  planned to be decided before Hosokawa's meeting with U.S.  President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11.</p>

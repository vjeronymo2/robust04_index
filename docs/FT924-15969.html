			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Betacom falls to Pounds 3.23m loss BETACOM, the telephone equipment supplier which is now 71 per cent owned by Amstrad, said that it was rationalising its product range and refocusing its business on the UK market as it reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.23m for the six months to June 30. It compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 129,000, and came on turnover of Pounds 4.25m, down from Pounds 6.12m. An exceptional charge of Pounds 1.97m was included in the loss; that related to the cost of restructuring and product rationalisation. Mr Ken Ashcroft, chairman, who moved in July to Betacom from Amstrad where he was corporate finance director, said the restructuring and rationalisation were necessary to regain lost market share in the UK. Because of financial difficulties 'the company could not invest in products in the early part of the year,' he said. It was doing so now by reducing the number of products it offered and ensuring that it had the most up-to-date range. Following a difficult trading period, Betacom's bank had refused earlier this year to continue supporting it without a capital injection. Amstrad, which already owned 29.5 per cent of the shares, agreed to underwrite a rights issue and subscribe to further shares. In order to refocus its efforts on the UK market, Betacom had sold its 49 per cent holding in a German joint venture and was looking to wind up its operations in Holland. However, on the positive side, net asset value had increased significantly, the liquidity problem had eased and there were adequate cash resources for the foreseeable future, it said.</p>

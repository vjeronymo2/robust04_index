			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Opening statement by Czech President Vaclav Havel at a news </F> conference on the results of a meeting of seven Central European  presidents at Litomysl Castle -- live]    [Excerpts] At the beginning of our talks I thanked all our  guests, the presidents, for accepting this invitation and for  coming to Litomysl. It appears that all of them were pleased to  come and that they regard this meeting as meaningful. [passage  omitted]    Our discussion was very intensive, and when it was over it  seemed to us that it was, in fact, a very short discussion. We  do not consider it to be the culmination of the meeting but only  its beginning. We will have many more discussions before  tomorrow afternoon when we leave.    In the conversation we just had, each of the presidents  delivered his own opening statement in which he contemplated the  position of the Central European region, above all in connection  with the processes of European integration. We have arrived at  the consensus that while we met precisely in this setup, it does  not mean we are colluding against someone else, or even that we  consider ourselves better or more advanced than others. We are  meeting as representatives of countries that feel their mutual  closeness, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of  values, cultural traditions, and history.    No differences between individual participants appeared in  the opening statements we gave. It turned out that there was  complete accord among us as far as the most general topic was  concerned. So much for the brief opening. The presidents can  speak for themselves when answering your questions. [passage  omitted]</p>

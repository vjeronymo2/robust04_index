			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Balint Magyar, executive </F> member of the Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not  given: "Full Publicity Is a Guarantee for Both Sides"]    [Text] Balint Magyar is certain that the coalition  agreement will be approved at the convention of the Alliance of  Free Democrats [SZDSZ] to be held on 26 June. Magyar, who is a  member of the SZDSZ's negotiating delegation, said that the  planned agreement maximally meets their prior expectations.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What will be the structure of the planned  coalition agreement?    [Magyar] It will have a relatively short introduction that  lays down the coalition's goals and substance. This will be  followed by three big blocks: The first one lists the  governmental guarantees, the second deals with issues related to  the government's structure, and the third will contain the  materials coordinated in the special committees. This last  section is the longest, making up almost three-quarters of the  full text. The coalition's government program is based on the  coordinated materials of the special committees. The appendix  of the section on structural matters contains the list of  ministers. Finally, there will be a brief clause that states  that the agreement has to be approved by the congresses and  conventions of the two parties.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Will you make public all the points of the  planned agreement?    [Magyar] Naturally, the 150- to 160-page coalition agreement  will not have any secret clauses. As a matter of fact, full  publicity is a guarantee for both sides because a possible  violation of the agreement cannot be punished through legal  means. At the same time, the public will be able to question us  about implementing the contents of the agreement. In my view,  the agreement of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the  SZDSZ will create a precedent in Hungary because this kind of  political agreement has never been made before. I find it very  important that the document deals with all the important issues  in great detail. I believe that this agreement will also have a  beneficial effect on Hungarian political culture. Public  attention has mainly been directed to the work of the main  delegations, while 50 to 60 people on each side took part in the  joint work of the special committees. It is extremely important  that, through this, the parliamentary groups and the experts of  the parties can fully identify with the coalition agreement.  People who will later have to act together in the government's  work have, perhaps for the first time in their lives, worked  together on the special committees.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What do you expect from the SZDSZ's  convention on 26 June?    [Magyar] I am certain that the majority of the delegates  will accept the coalition agreement. I would remind people  that, at the last convention, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto said that  only those people should vote for entering the coalition talks  who really want the coalition. Even then, the proposal on  entering the talks received 80 percent support. I believe that  the coalition agreement that is to be signed today maximally  meets our prior expectations.</p>

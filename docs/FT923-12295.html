			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / UK Gilts: Yields rise on Bundesbank move GILTS lost ground due to widespread worries about possible Bundesbank moves later this year to push up German interest rates, possibly leading to a tightening of monetary policy across Europe. The concerns spilled over into the bond markets on Friday, with German government securities (bunds) seeing significant price falls and the effects spilling over to gilts. During the week, yields on short-dated UK securities climbed by up to 0.2 percentage points (20 basis points), reflecting the reduced prices. The yield increases were less marked for longer maturing bonds. The Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to increase its discount rate by an above-expected 0.75 percentage points was the main trigger for the increased gilt yields. While the German central bank resisted the temptation to increase its more internationally important Lombard rate - this staying at 9.75 per cent - a move along these lines cannot be ruled out over the next few months. Accordingly, the UK money markets were convulsed with speculation on Friday that base rates may have to rise by the end of the year because of the effects of a Lombard rate increase on the level of sterling in the exchange rate mechanism . The Bundesbank move overshadowed good news on UK inflation earlier in the week which had driven gilt prices higher. The index of average earnings across the economy rose in the year to May by an underlying 6.5 per cent, after 7 per cent in April and 7.5 per cent in the previous month. While the level of price increases for manufactured goods in the year to June remained at 3.6 per cent, the same as in May, factory output fell by 0.6 per cent in May compared with April, indicating weak demand and a continuation of the recession. Meanwhile, Britain's public sector borrowing requirement jumped to a higher than expected Pounds 4.23bn last month as the recession depressed government revenues and boosted spending. It brought the total borrowing requirement in the first three months of the 1992-93 financial year to Pounds 10.8bn, fuelling fears that the government will not be able to keep borrowing within its Pounds 28bn target. That is likely to have repercussions on the gilt market - which fears higher gilt issues will depress prices and push up yields. In the context of ways of managing the high PSBR, an intriguing suggestion has come from Mr Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu, a leading gilt broker, on how the Treasury could both help help economic recovery and get the gilt market out of its difficulties. Mr Bootle says that rather than fund all the PSBR - which Greenwell expects this year to reach Pounds 33bn - via gilt issues the government should deliberately underfund. That boils down to financing the deficit partly by sale of short-term Treasury bills, which feed into the money supply and boost economic activity. By reducing gilt issues, such an option would also put a floor under prices. According to Greenwell's arithmetic, total gilt issues this year under full funding would need to be Pounds 35bn. By under-funding by Pounds 10bn, that would release Pounds 10bn into the economy to stimulate growth.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Russian MPs want end to Serb sanctions Russia's new parliament, in which communists, conservatives and extreme nationalists outnumber moderates, yesterday called for the lifting of sanctions against Serbia and opposed threatened Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. The State Duma (parliament) passed a pro-Serb motion by 280 votes to two, warning that the use of force by the western powers would not only fail to end the war, but could raise the conflict to 'a higher level of ferocity and confrontation'. Meanwhile, France and the United Nations mediator, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, yesterday followed the British government in staunchly defending Lord Owen, the European Union's representative in the deadlocked Bosnian peace talks, after the European Parliament demanded his removal. The French Foreign Ministry said France, which has the largest contingent of peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia, fully backed Lord Owen's efforts to negotiate a peace settlement between the three warring factions. 'He is acting with great perseverance in accordance with the directives of the European Union countries,' the ministry said. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, was consulting his European colleagues by telephone on what steps to take after the latest failure of the Bosnian peace talks in Geneva and will review policy with Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Paris on Monday. In a statement issued in Geneva, Mr Stoltenberg said that 'nobody has put more effort or been more committed to finding peace in the former Yugoslavia, over a longer period than Lord Owen. He cannot be criticised for the situation that exists today.' Lord Owen admitted in London on Thursday it was 'an open secret' that he wanted to quit, but said that he had no intention of abandoning his job while EU foreign ministers wanted him to stay on. Mr Hans van den Broek, the European Commissioner for external affairs, has also distanced himself from the European Parliament's demand for Lord Owen's resignation, but called for a suspension of the international mediating efforts in Yugoslavia. In a speech to the parliament in Strasbourg on Thursday, the former Dutch foreign minister said the real responsibility for policy on Bosnia lay with the European Union itself. Since the conflict in Bosnia broke out two years ago, Mr van den Broek has urged the west to punish Serb aggression and to avoid forcing the Moslems to conclude a peace deal leaving them without a viable country. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, in a radio interview in London, said there was no question of British troops being pulled out of Bosnia during the winter months. Nor was there any likelihood of Britain pulling out its forces unilaterally. 'What we are talking about is whether the UN as a whole should continue to be in Bosnia.' Laura Silber adds from Belgrade: Croatia yesterday announced the imminent restoration of telephone links with Serbia, cut off during the six-month war in 1991, following the agreement to normalise relations in this week's Geneva talks.</p>

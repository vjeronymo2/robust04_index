			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: German banks Next month's launch of money market funds in Germany will not only raise questions about redefining the money supply but also promises to put pressure on the earnings of commercial banks which stand to lose cheap retail deposits to the new funds. The extent of the squeeze on margins is hard to gauge but it is unlikely to be as severe as that facing French banks when money market funds were launched there in the late 1980s. That was a period of high short-term interest rates, which made the funds particularly attractive to individuals who received very little reward on their bank deposits. Still, there were large flows of German savings into Luxembourg last year when money market funds where permitted there. That suggests a reasonably high proportion of bank time deposits are footloose. The banks recovered many of these deposits when German tax rules were changed at the start of this year. The risk is that they will now lose them again to the money market funds. Broker Fox-Pitt Kelton suggests that some 40 per cent of retail time deposits could move into money market funds over the next couple of years. Though the big banks would be able to offset some of the higher funding costs with commission income from managing the new funds, they would still experience a shortfall of some 4 per cent in net earnings. The natural response of larger banks would be to compensate by adding volume. They are well placed to take business away from regional institutions which will find it harder to establish money market funds of their own. The new funds could thus accelerate consolidation in the German banking industry as well as changing the way business is done.</p>

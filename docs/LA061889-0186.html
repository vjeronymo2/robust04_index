			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CITO GASTON IS GETTING JOB DONE AS TORONTO MANAGER  </P> <P> The first 45 years of Clarence (Cito) Gaston's life were conducted  unobtrusively enough. It's a stretch to recall that he hit .318 for the San  Diego Padres in 1970, with 29 home runs and 93 runs batted in, and that he made  his only All-Star team that summer. It's a more distant reach to recollect that  he played eight more National League seasons -- earning a living and making a  pension, but ultimately drifting off into the anonymity of baseball card  collector's heaven and eight years as a hitting instructor. He came to like it  that way.  </P> <P> Two springs ago, in the roiling wake of The Campanis Affair, Blue Jays General  Manager Pat Gillick approached Gaston and asked if he would be interested in  managing. Not the Blue Jays quite yet, but winter ball. It would be an  apprenticeship, servicing both the Jays' belief that Gaston might make a useful  manager someday and baseball's fresh demand for minority candidates. No matter,  Cito Gaston wasn't hot on the idea. His father was ill, his second marriage  (with two children added to his own two) was just getting its sea legs and life  as a coach wasn't at all intolerable. So he said no.  </P> <P> "I think he wanted to manage," Gillick said, "but he just didn't know when the  opportune time was for him to do it. From some of the discussions we had, I  think Cito was worried about the life expectancy of managers. He knew the  mortality rate could be pretty high."  </P> <P> Gaston said, "It wasn't something I wanted to try at the time. I didn't need  it. I don't have that kind of ego."  </P> <P> Cut to 1989. Gaston has become the fourth black manager in baseball history,  the second (after Frank Robinson) since Al Campanis awkwardly and accidentally  thrust on baseball the issues of minority competence and opportunity. It is an  ironic twist on progress, for in a time when others (Bill Robinson, Bobby  Tolan) have voiced their aspirations and still others (Harry Edwards, chiefly)  have policed the sport's hiring, the Blue Jays have chosen the most reluctant  of symbols. A man who has always preferred to stand in the background now  stands for something. Something alive and current and important.  </P> <P> To say nothing of handling the Blue Jays, who for all their latent talent, have  at times in the past two seasons seemed dead and outdated and insignificant.  </P> <P> "Cito's in a tough situation," Jays veteran catcher Ernie Whitt said. "It's  hard enough to come in and take a last-place club and turn it around. But he's  a minority, too, and the microscope is always going to be on him, on every move  he makes. It's unfortunate that's the case, but that's the way it is."  </P> <P> For instance: The announcement that Gaston, interim manager since Jimy Williams  was fired on May 15, would be the permanent manager was made on May 31, when  the Jays were in Toronto. They returned to Toronto last Monday, to a crush of  450 media members. They were there principally for the opening of the SkyDome,  but as long as Gaston was there and he the fourth black manager in baseball  history . . . So Gaston was inundated. "That part," he said, "has been a little  more than I expected. That will calm down."  </P> <P> He is a pleasant man, with a deliberate, resonant voice, tinged with remnants  of a twang from his native Texas. The uniform still fits him in most places (in  many more than, say, Don Zimmer's does) and if the job isn't quite so snug,  he'll give it time. Patience is one of his virtues, so he understands the  madness of representing his race and saving his team all in the first two  weeks.  </P> <P> "After the Campanis thing happened," Gaston said, "organizations -- this one  has always been good -- started to go out and hire minorities. But nobody's  going to force anybody to do something they don't want to do, because that's  bad business and this is a business. I want to be judged as a manager." And if  that opens more doors? "That's fine, too. But in the meantime, I'm just trying  to give off positive vibes all the time, have a winning attitude every day at  the ballpark. If we lose, we'll get them tomorrow."  </P> <P> Some of Gaston's humility could grow from the manner in which the Blue Jays  conducted their search. After Williams was fired and Gaston was named interim  manager, Gillick said it was "99% certain" Gaston's appointment would not be  made permanent. When Bobby Cox left after the 1985 season, the Jays stayed  within the system by hiring Williams, their third-base coach, to replace him.  That decision had eventually produced a team in turmoil and in last place in  the American League East.  </P> <P> "Not that it was Jimy's fault," center fielder Lloyd Moseby said. "We just  didn't play for Jimy. We didn't make him a great manager."  </P> <P> Still, the Jays didn't plan to test the in-house theory again with Gaston. They  went after Lou Piniella in a big way, but refused to meet George Steinbrenner's  demand for a starting pitcher in return for letting Piniella out of his  contract. White Sox coach Terry Bevington was considered, along with Bob  Bailor, manager of the Jays' Triple-A team in Syracuse. At least two teams  reportedly wouldn't let the Jays interview their coaches. So on the last day in  May, it came back to Gaston, no better than fourth choice. But by then,  coincidentally, the quiet man had decided he was ready for the job.  </P> <P> The Blue Jays were 13-24 when Williams was fired, 7-7 with Gaston as interim  manager. They have a winning record since he was named manager for the season.  "I had always felt it was better for them to go outside, because of what  happened (with Williams)," Gaston said. "But as time went on, I just found it  to be a challenge. A lot of us have been here for a long time, trying to take  this thing all the way."  </P> <P> Gillick is still terse on the matter. "Piniella is the guy we really wanted,"  he said. "But we saw that whole deal fall apart. So we've got this hot seat and  nobody seems to really want it. So we felt we needed somebody who knows the  players. Cito does. He can't worry about whether he's our second or third  choice or whatever. He's our manager."  </P> <P> At least until the end of the season, which is as long as his contract runs.  </P> <P> In the ninth inning of last Wednesday's 4-2 victory over the Brewers, Jays  pitcher John Cerutti lost his shutout on a two-run homer by Rob Deer. He struck  out Greg Brock for the second out of the inning, but then gave up consecutive  singles to Charlie O'Brien and Mike Felder. Gaston walked out to talk to  Cerutti.  </P> <P> "He asked me how I was," Cerutti said. "I told him I was fine."  </P> <P> With the tying run on first base and the Jays suddenly facing the possibility  of going oh-for-Dome in the first series in their $500-million stadium, Gaston  left Cerutti in. Why? "I wanted him to get the complete game," Gaston said.  </P> <P> Maybe he also wanted to rest his bullpen, which has been hammered of late. But  that's not the point. By leaving Cerutti in and letting him finish his game  (which he did, for only the fifth time in his five-year career), Gaston put his  signature on the game. He will be a players' coach. Hitting instructors are  often the players' confidants, a buffer between the manager and his personnel  problems. Gaston was tight with many of the Jays and that was a concern in  hiring him.  </P> <P> "It still is," Gillick said.  </P> <P> But the alternative -- a man like Williams -- had failed terrifically. Williams  was largely uncommunicative and irreversibly at odds with temperamental slugger  George Bell. "When Jimy was here, it seemed to be uptight all the time,"  pitcher Jimmy Key said. "Jimy tried to shut himself off from the players all  the time. Cito's with them."  </P> <P> Gaston said, "I'm close to the players, sure I am. But I'm close enough to know  that if I have to do something that's a little different, I'll do it."  </P> <P> He has assumed a franchise in a state of flux. The chassis of a team that won  99 games and a division championship in 1985 remains. But the engine has  slowed: They lost their last six games to blow the division in '87 and last  year only a cosmetic 22-7 finish got them 12 games over .500 and within two  games of the Red Sox. Moreover the SkyDome, with its deep power alleys and  heavy air (when the roof is opened) is showing early signs of being a pitcher's  park. Gaston must subtly alter his team -- which relied much on long balls in  Exhibition Stadium -- to squeeze any last success from this generation of Blue  Jays.  </P> <P> "To me," pitcher Jimmy Key said, "this team is not as strong as the one Jimy  Williams took over. But it doesn't need to be totally rebuilt and it's not a  club that can't win." Especially in the woeful American League East. Some of  the Jays' re-tooling will be visible (Bell and Moseby have been offered in  trades); but much will be manipulative.  </P> <P> "This team's got talent," Whitt said. "But it hasn't gone out on the field and  proved it. You've heard of underachievers and overachievers. We're looking for  some overachievers."  </P> <P> So start with Cito Gaston, The Coincidental Manager. Pushing through his placid  softness is a knowing pause. Life is different, now.  </P> <P> "I get here earlier," he said, scanning the Dome, "and I stay later."  </P></p>

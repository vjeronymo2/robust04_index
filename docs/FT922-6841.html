			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock calls for re-think on 'opt-outs' THE PROMOTION of 'co-ordinated expansion' during the UK presidency of the Community was urged on the government yesterday, by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader. Opening the debate for the opposition, Mr Kinnock argued that such an approach was the only way 'to ensure vitality and confidence in western Europe and to promote stability, hope and strengthened democracy in Eastern Europe'. The certainty of growing interdependence between EC countries made it essential, he said, for the government to work towards promoting balanced development and social cohesion. He called on the prime minister to abandon his 'opt-out mentality' and re-emphasised Labour's broad support for the treaty, He also emphsasised its opposition to opting out of the social chapter and economic and monetary union. These 'opt-outs' are at the heart of the party's 'reasoned amendment' to the bill. But if that amendment fails, Labour policy is to abstain on whether the bill should proceed. That policy came under fire during the debate from some Labour backbenchers. Mr Kinnock called the terms in which minsters had attacked the social chapter 'absolute fantasies' and warned that the government had indulged in such fictions because it needed the false threat of disruption to cover up its desertion of duty in failing to secure better rights for British workers. He said Britain was the example that poor labour conditions did not mean necessarily superior economic performance, and called on ministers to end efforts to make Britain 'the labour market bargain basement of Europe'. Turning to economic and monetary union, he warned the government that as early as 1994 it would have to make specific proposals so that preparatory decisions could be taken. 'They won't be able to opt out of that', he said. While Mr Kinnock was heard in a crowded Commons with little interruption, there was discomfort for the Labour front bench from Mr Peter Shore. The former Labour cabinet minister called the party's apparent readiness to let the EC decide the future size of public borrowing under a Labour government 'a total disgrace', and warned that opposition MPs had a duty to vote against the bill itself. He ridiculed the briefing from the party's Treasury frontbench team that the mention of goals of sustainable growth and high employment early in the treaty put those aims on a par with the aims of economic and monetary union, and price stability in particular. Mr Shore said the government had evaded the central issue of where Britain should go when a majority of other EC member states wanted a different - federal - destiny. Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) said it would be absolutely wrong for a step of such magnitude to be taken without consulting the people who - because of the transfer of more decision-making to Brussels - would lose democratic rights. Mr Austin Mitchell (Lab Great Grimsby) said the Bill would get a second reading tonight not because the argument had been won but because the Labour leadership had 'allowed it to go through'.</p>

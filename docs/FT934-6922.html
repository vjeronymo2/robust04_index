			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Rightists on the march in Cape Town A small group of right-wingers marching on parliament in Cape Town yesterday as South African MPs started a three-week session summoned to adopt a transitional constitution which will end white rule in April next year. President F W de Klerk said the session 'might in all probability be the last session of parliament constituted as it is at present. . . We have a constitution. . . which once and for all will get rid of the albatross we have had around our necks for the past 300 years, namely that we did not have a fair and just system.' Legislators from the ruling National party had earlier closed ranks behind Mr de Klerk after a four-hour meeting.</p>

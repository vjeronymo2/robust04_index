			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat concurrently with determining a species to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered or threatened. Furthermore, the Service is to designate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available after taking into consideration the economic and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant impacts of specifying an area as critical habitat (16 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1533(b)(2)). In the case of the tidewater goby, critical habitat is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presently determinable. A final designation of critical habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires detailed information on the possible economic effects of such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation. The Service does not currently have sufficient information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to perform the economic analysis. A delay in the determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to list the species to gather additional information and perform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses would not serve the needs of the species. Information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed on actions that may be proposed within tidewater goby habitat and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the degree to which a designation of critical habitat may affect these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions over and above effects associated with listing the goby as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered (i.e., the jeopardy standard alone). It will also be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to determine how and to what extent application of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction/adverse modification standard will change various Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions. These data will be used in the economic analyses to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the economic effects of critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of Federal agencies or departments control lands that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support the tidewater goby. These include the Department of Defense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marine Corps), Department of Agriculture (U.S. Forest Service), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of the Interior (National Park Service and U.S. Fish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wildlife Service). Federal actions that may be affected by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination would be the funding or authorization of projects within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the species' habitat, including the construction of roads, bridges, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dredging projects subject to section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 1344  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and special use permits. Other Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions that are subject to environmental review under the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Policy Act would also require consultation with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service. Projects on federally owned land would also be subject to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

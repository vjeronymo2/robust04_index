			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Lebanon rejects poll monitors Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid al-Solh, in an interview published in Paris yesterday, rejected suggestions that international observers monitor forthcoming general elections in Lebanon, the first in 20 years, Reuter reports from Paris. 'The whole international press will be present and nowhere more than Lebanon is it free to observe. All the embassies will also be busy,' Mr Solh told Le Monde. He was answering questions on suggestions that monitors check the elections in August and September, as part of the polling is to be in areas held by Syrian troops.</p>

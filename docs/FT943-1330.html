			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: If you were a loser . . . - Paul Cooper tells what to do Sales of risky home-income plans late in the 1980s have led to a flood of compensation claims. If you were advised to borrow for speculative investment, and could not afford the risk of losing money, you should have a valid case. Here is what to do: Was the person who gave the advice authorised to do so? If so, compensation should be available - but there is no compensation for unauthorised advisers. You could sue but, in most cases, this is not worthwhile. Negotiations with the mortgage lender might help; so might professional aid. Ask Age Concern for its list of specialist lawyers. Some advisers practised before their application for authorisation was approved. The Investors Compensation Scheme (ICS) excludes pay-outs even if the advisers qualified later - unless you can show advice also was given after authorisation. Was the salesman authorised by Fimbra or Lautro (the regulatory bodies)? If the answer is Lautro, you are lucky. You will get more compensation, faster, because the Lautro/insurance ombudsman bureau guidelines have a clear procedure for such cases. The insurance ombudsman normally makes distress awards of up to Pounds 5,000 (the average is around Pounds 1,500), especially where the life company has taken a year or two dealing with the complaint (although this is normal). Since Lautro members in breach of the rules must ensure that clients are not worse off because of their investments, the ombudsman does not subtract money spent by investors when they were led to believe there were no risks attached to doing so. Investors spent the money they received believing it was interest on their home's capital. In reality, they were consuming the capital itself. If, however, the adviser was authorised by Fimbra, you are likely to receive less since there is a compensation ceiling (of Pounds 48,000 per claim) and there is no obligation to return people to the position in which they would have been had they not invested. What should I do? Having established whether the person giving the advice was authorised or not, make a complaint about the advice received to the insurance company or the Fimbra firm, asking for compensation. What are the pitfalls with a Lautro firm? It might resist your claim or take a lot of time investigating it. If there are no results after two months, take your claim to the insurance ombudsman or the recently-started PIA ombudsman. Do not accept any offer without insisting on a review by the ombudsman. What are the problems with a small Fimbra firm? There is a danger that it might not exist, given the number of firms which Fimbra has de-recognised over the past few years. Call Fimbra (071-538 8860) to check, giving the firm's postcode. If the firm has ceased trading, ask if the ICS has declared a default. If it has, write to the ICS at 2 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8SR, registering your claim. Expect compensation within nine-18 months. If not, tell the ICS your problem and ask for a default declaration. Expect compensation within two years. What are the problems with a larger Fimbra firm? If the firm is still trading and disputes liability, you can either get legal aid and sue; apply to the PIA ombudsman; or, in certain cases, apply for Fimbra arbitration. What are the risks of arbitration? It is a binding legal procedure and awards cannot usually be appealed. Paul Cooper is principal of CLAIMS, which investigates cases of bad advice.</p>

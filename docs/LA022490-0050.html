			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARAFAT OKS AN OFFSTAGE PLO ROLE IN PEACE TALKS;  </P> <P> MIDEAST: HE ACCEPTS THE OFFER OF SUCH TALKS AND AN ACTIVE ROLE FOR PALESTINIANS  IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.  </P> <P> In a letter made public Friday at a conference of Jewish peace activists, the  chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, endorsed an  active role for Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in peace talks  with Israel.  </P> <P> The statement was the first direct indication from Arafat that he accepts the  offer of such talks and that Arabs in the occupied lands would take the lead in  them. Egypt, which has been working with the United States and Israel toward  setting up Israeli-Palestinian talks, had been pressuring the PLO to give West  Bank and Gaza leaders a prime role.  </P> <P> In his letter, Arafat said that Palestinians in exile also would take part, a  proposal that Israel rejects.  </P> <P> "The PLO once more leaned over backward and approved the idea of a dialogue  between representatives of the Israeli government and representatives of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories and the Diaspora," the letter  said.  </P> <P> Arafat demanded that the talks be aimed at reaching a "comprehensive and final  settlement" of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on an election proposal  put forth by Israel, as well as ideas endorsed by Egypt that include a  withdrawal by Israel from territory occupied in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.  </P> <P> He insisted that the participation of local Palestinian leaders did not mean  the demise of PLO influence. He suggested that Palestinians will accept only a  settlement endorsed by the PLO. For the Palestinians, he wrote, "the only  guarantee of their own security and their political future lies in the full  participation of the PLO in all stages of the peace process."  </P> <P> It is expected that if Palestinians from abroad take part, they would be the  most direct conduits for PLO authority.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the letter from Arafat appears to accept an offstage role by the  PLO at least in initial stages of talks. This willingness may put pressure on  Israel to accept an invitation from Secretary of State James A. Baker III to  hold preliminary talks on the formation of a Palestinian peace panel. Baker  wants to convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt to  work out a list of Palestinian delegates.  </P> <P> Arafat's letter provided a surprise finale to a three-day international  conference on peace sponsored by the Tel Aviv-based International Center for  Peace in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Rita Hauser, a peace activist from New York, told reporters that the letter was  received Thursday by telefax from Tunisia, where the PLO is based. She said it  was kept secret until Friday because organizers of the conference were unable  to "get it fitted in" the conference's agenda.  </P> <P> However, other sources at the conference said that organizers had worked for  weeks to get such a letter sent. They had backed off at the last minute out of  concern for appearing to interfere in sensitive diplomatic affairs. But the  letter, dated Feb. 17, arrived anyway and the organizers had no other recourse  but to make it public.  </P> <P> In 1988, Hauser played a role in persuading Arafat to make pledges to renounce  terrorism and recognize Israel's right to exist. The pledges, made by Arafat in  Geneva, led to the opening of a dialogue between the United States and the PLO.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today, "The government is  not interested in the PLO's position in peace talks."  </P> <P> Israeli politics are convulsed over the issue of whether to enter peace talks.  Shamir's Likud Party is badly split over the prospects. Many of its members  feel that negotiations will inevitably lead to the loss of the West Bank and  Gaza, which the rightist Likud views as part and parcel of Israel.  </P> <P> In an interview published Friday in the Jerusalem Post, Shamir rejected any PLO  role.  </P> <P> "The only thing (the PLO) should do is dismantle itself," Shamir said, "because  its minimal demand is a Palestinian state, and a Palestinian state cannot  coexist with Israel."  </P> <P> The center-left Labor Party, which is the other pillar holding up Israel's  coalition government, has set a two-week deadline for movement on negotiations.  Party leaders have threatened to pull out of the government, a move that will  lead either to a new coalition headed by Labor or Likud, or a general election.  </P> <P> The talks also hold risks for Arafat. A back-seat role for the PLO could give  unprecedented prestige to West Bank and Gaza Palestinian leaders.  </P></p>

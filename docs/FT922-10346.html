			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Differences remain on cocoa price stabilisation COCOA PRODUCING and consuming countries will today wrap up the first round of negotiations on a new international cocoa accord without any formal agreement on the main issue dividing the two sides, the nature of measures needed to stabilise prices, which are at the lowest level for 16 1/2 years. However, officials said the export quota system favoured by African producers was not a runner because consumer countries had made clear at a meeting of the International Cocoa Organisation in London that it was unacceptable. Though the Africans, led by the Ivory Coast, which produces one-third of the world's cocoa, have yet to withdraw their proposals, officials said export quotas had scarcely been discussed during the past two weeks of talks. Most attention had been devoted to refining consumer country proposals for an export withholding and production management scheme. 'Producers are anxious to have an agreement at almost any price,' one official said, predicting that export quotas would not survive to the next round of talks on the new pact scheduled for July 6-24, also in Geneva. The present International Cocoa Agreement, which has a buffer stock mechanism as its principal means of influencing prices, expires in September next year. The talks, involving 18 producing and 22 consuming nations accounting for about three-quarters of world production and consumption, are taking place against the gloomy background of plunging cocoa prices, chronic oversupply and unprecedentedly high stock levels. Consuming countries argue that export quotas would not impose sufficient restraints on total production, needed to bring supply and demand into better balance. Under the export withholding proposals, producers would be obliged to store surplus cocoa when prices were falling and release it when they were rising. But export withholding would be coupled with a 'production management scheme', under which each producer would have an output quota. Producers dislike output quotas on sovereignty grounds because they constrain domestic production decisions. They are also worried by the possible expense of withholding exports. While the detailed sums have yet to be done, one major producer calculates that the cocoa price would have to rise by Dollars 300-Dollars 400 a tonne to finance the scheme. Brazil, which has taken considerable steps to increase domestic demand in recent years, is also anxious not to be penalised on that account. The other major issue, though barely touched on in this first round of talks, is what to do with the present cocoa buffer stock of about 240,000 tonnes. Some countries, notably Brazil, are anxious to find ways of gradually releasing the stock, which they believe depresses the market by its mere existence. Others would prefer to sit tight, so as not to exacerbate the existing glut. Operation of the current cocoa agreement, which dates from 1986, has been hampered by the US, the world's biggest consumer, deciding not to join, and similar decisions by Malaysia and Indonesia, the fourth and eighth biggest producers. There is now some prospect that the East Asians could agree to involvement in a successor accord but the US has said it is not interested in any pact with price stabilisation provisions.</p>

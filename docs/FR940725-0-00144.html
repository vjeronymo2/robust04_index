			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted earlier, in paragraph (a)(1), OSHA is continuing the previous requirement (in &sect;1915.12(c)(1)) for competent persons to test atmospheres of specific spaces that may contain oxygen-deficient atmospheres. The following paragraphs describe each of the spaces itemized in paragraph (a)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1)(i) of final &sect;1915.12 lists spaces that have been sealed, e.g., those that have been coated and closed up and those that have been painted and that lack ventilation. OSHA has combined the spaces listed in paragraphs (c)(1) (ii), (iii), and (iv) of the previous &sect;1915.12 into one paragraph because OSHA considers the hazards within these spaces to be similar. The primary hazard of these spaces is the lack of proper ventilation and the resultant possible lack of oxygen. OSHA considers the consolidation of the previous paragraphs into one paragraph to be an editorial change for clarity because none of the spaces currently listed have been deleted nor have any been added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1)(ii) lists spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained combustible or flammable liquids or gases. Paragraphs (a)(1)(iii) and (a)(1)(iv) list spaces and adjacent spaces that contain or have contained liquids, gases, or solids that are toxic, corrosive, or irritant or that have been fumigated. These three paragraphs refer to spaces that were included under the previous &sect;1915.12(c)(1)(i), which reads as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Spaces in which the test[s] required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section indicate that no flammable or toxic contaminants are present in the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this previous provision, spaces that require flammability and toxicity testing must also be tested for oxygen deficiency. In revised subpart B, OSHA has simply named the spaces that are covered under the previous &sect;1915.12 (a) and (b) in lieu of specifying them by reference. Additionally, the final rule requires these spaces to be tested for oxygen regardless of whether they are found to be safe with respect to the hazards of flammable and toxic substances. Under the previous standard, which implied that the flammability and toxicity tests were performed before the oxygen test, once a space was found to be unsafe due to the presence of flammable gases or vapors or toxic air contaminants, further testing for oxygen deficiency was unnecessary. Under the final rule, tests for oxygen content are conducted first and must always be performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1)(v) lists spaces containing materials or residues that could create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. The previous &sect;1915.12(c)(1)(v) covers only cargo spaces containing cargoes or residues that can create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere. The corresponding paragraph in the proposal (proposed &sect;1915.12(a)(viii)) also addressed only cargo spaces. The proposed and previous language also provide examples of cargos that can absorb oxygen and create an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (scrap iron, fresh fruit and molasses, and various vegetable drying oils).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted in the summary and explanation of final &sect;1915.11(a), earlier in this preamble, the scope of subpart B is being expanded to address all confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres throughout shipyard employment. While the previous standard recognizes that the hazard of oxygen deficiency may be found in cargo spaces, many other confined and enclosed spaces in shipyard employment also pose this hazard. OSHA believes that it is essential that all such spaces be tested for oxygen content before entry to assure their safety. Therefore, the Agency is eliminating the reference to cargo spaces and is requiring all spaces containing materials or residues that could create an oxygen deficiency to be tested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(2) requires spaces that have been tested and found to contain oxygen-deficient atmospheres to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers.'' Spaces found to be oxygen-enriched are required to be labeled ``Not Safe for Workers_Not Safe for Hot Work.'' If employees are to enter a space that has an oxygen-enriched or oxygen-deficient atmosphere, then ventilation must be provided to maintain the oxygen content of the atmosphere at or above 19.5 percent and below 22.0 percent by volume. After the ventilation produces an acceptable level of oxygen, the warning signs may be removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The previous &sect;1915.12(c)(2) only requires ventilation for spaces containing less than 16.5 percent oxygen by volume. It does not require spaces with oxygen-deficient or oxygen-enriched atmospheres to be labeled, nor does it address oxygen-enriched atmospheres. Additionally, it requires ventilation to be provided only when the oxygen content in the space is below 16.5 percent by volume, rather than below 19.5 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike either the proposal or the previous rule, the final rule addresses hazards associated with oxygen-enriched atmospheres. Oxygen-enriched atmospheres create significant risks to employees entering confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres, and precautions must be taken before entry into such atmospheres. The proposal would have required atmospheres to be tested for oxygen content rather than for oxygen deficiency alone. No rulemaking participant objected to this requirement. NFPA 306, in Section 2&hyph;3.1, sets the criteria for compartments and spaces to be found ``Safe for Workers.'' The first criterion listed in this section is that the oxygen content of the space be ``at least 19.5 percent and not greater than 22 percent by volume.'' Thus, OSHA is consistent with the existing national consensus standard which has adopted provisions restricting entry into oxygen-enriched atmospheres.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Why Jerry Brown is so popular: America I confess to a sneaking admiration for Mr Jerry Brown's presidential campaign. I should not say this because the former governor of California is deeply unpopular in left-leaning political circles in Washington. The pundits who count regard him as an unscrupulous and unelectable crank. They hate him for mercilously exposing the charac-ter weaknesses of their 'anointed' candidate, Mr Bill Clinton, the Arkansas governor. And they are shocked by some of his policies - such as his advocacy of a flat rate income tax. Mr Brown may have been inconsistent over the years. But the central point he is making today - that economic and social reform is impossible so long as politicians are bought and sold by rich individuals and powerful interest groups - is surely of vital importance. US politics is horribly corrupted by money: the average senator has to raise Dollars 4m to defend his seat. Mr Brown has courageously restricted campaign contributions to Dollars 100 a head. He has dispensed with the pomp of a campaign such as Governor Clinton's, which includes hordes of paid advisers and pollsters - not to mention a posse of secret service agents. Mr Brown, once a Jesuit monk, relies on a skeleton staff of volunteers, sleeps at the homes of supporters and appeals to the public mainly through a free 1-800 telephone number. According to the conventional rules, this should have spelled oblivion. Instead, the Brown campaign is gaining momentum, having defeated Mr Clinton in Connecticut last week. At first blush, Mr Brown's advocacy of a 13 per cent flat rate tax on personal incomes and business value-added appears a crass error. It turns traditional Democrat fiscal theory on its head. Most Democrats are obsessed with the need to reverse the Reagan tax cuts, which favoured the rich. Mr Clinton, for example, has made redistribution in favour of the middle classes a central theme of his campaign. The Washington Post dismissed Mr Brown's plan as 'cruel and reactionary'. Mr Michael Kinsley, a liberal columnist for the New Republic magazine, described it as 'brain dead'. Yet in some ways Mr Brown's iconoclasm is admirable. After all, here is a Democrat proposing something that even former President Ronald Reagan, a fellow Californian, lacked the courage to implement. In the mid-1980s, the Reagan administration considered a flat rate tax, but decided it was politically too risky because it would shift too much of the tax burden onto the poor and middle classes. Some pundits say Mr Brown does not understand the implications of his plan. This seems unlikely: Mr Brown may be eccentric, but he is not stupid. He has also experienced a baptism of fire in fiscal affairs. As governor of California in the late 1970s he initially opposed - but was later forced to support - the Proposition Thirteen property tax revolt. He would not be advocating a flat rate tax today unless he felt it would appeal to the majority of Americans. Critics should remember that he has a knack of anticipating public opinion: a couple of decades ago, he was one of the first US politicians to take environmental arguments seriously. Mr Brown rightly emphasises the simplicity of flat taxes. In TV debates, he tells the audience that his plan would replace voluminous tax returns with a postcard-sized form that children could complete. Grinning, he says he would put hordes of lawyers and accountants out of business. He is on less solid ground when he claims that high earners would enjoy only modest gains because the transparency of the new rules would prevent them exploiting loopholes. The rich would gain substantially from flat rate taxes, just as they gained from cuts in the top rates during the 1980s. If Mr Brown has any sense, he will backtrack a little and offer larger exemptions for those at the bottom of the income distribution (his scheme already allows for the deduction of rent - an important quid pro quo for the huge mortgage interest deductions allowable for the highest earners). But he may be shrewd in guessing that the politics of envy is losing its bite. The world is changing so fast that it may be wrong to assume that electorates will always support redistribution through the tax system, which is anyway a surprisingly recent innovation. It is not so long since somebody as level-headed as John Stuart Mill could describe progressive taxation (taxes that rise more than proportionately with income) as a 'mild form of robbery'. Prussia introduced the first progressive tax only in 1891; the US did not follow suit until 1913. Within 30 years, the US top rate had reached 91 per cent. But the tide began to turn fairly quickly. From the late 1950s, reformers were arguing for lower marginal rates to boost incentives. President John Kennedy cut the top US rate to 70 per cent in the early 1960s. During the 1980s, top rates plunged almost everywhere. By advocating flat rate taxes, Mr Brown is thus only extrapolating a recent trend. Once again, this derided devotee of Zen Buddhism may have glimpsed the future before the rest of us. If so, he is laying the ground for a politics that cuts through party lines. Mr Brown is green, favours low, simple taxes, supports national health insurance, and wants to cut the nexus between money and politics in the US. You may distrust the messenger, but the message is undeniably potent.</p>

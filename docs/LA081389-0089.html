			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN A HOUSE HAS A MAJOR DEFECT;  </P> <P> STATES, REALTY BOARDS CAN HELP HOME BUYERS FACING UNDISCLOSED, HIDDEN PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> A young couple moved into their first home, only to discover a false wall in  the basement foundation hiding crumbling cinder block. Repairing the damage,  the couple knew, would cost thousands of dollars -- money they didn't have  after cleaning out their savings accounts for the home purchase. They felt  certain the seller knew about the basement problem, and possibly the realty  agent, too.  </P> <P> Given that they'd already closed on the property, do they have any recourse?  Real estate specialists across the country respond with an emphatic "yes."  </P> <P> The most obvious avenue would be to take the seller to court with a civil suit,  staking a claim for fraud (though in the young couple's case, the seller had  moved out of state, leaving no forwarding address).  </P> <P> In addition, if the couple truly believed the realty agent failed to disclose  his knowledge of the basement defects -- or ought to have known and didn't find  out -- they could also sue the agent or file a complaint with the real estate  commissioner in their state.  </P> <P> In many states, such as California, disgruntled buyers, such as the young  couple, can win monetary damages through state "recovery funds" if they prove  the real estate agent failed to tell them all he knew about problems with the  property.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buyer's Own Tough Luck  </P> <P> Other state commissions go even further -- taking complaints and paying damages  simply because the realty agent failed to seek out information about problems  with the property.  </P> <P> The strict notion of "buyer beware" in realty transactions -- that it's the  buyer's own tough luck if he unknowingly gets stuck with a lemon of a house --  is declining quickly. More states are becoming consumer oriented, says James A.  Edmonds, California's real estate commissioner.  </P> <P> As an example, he cites a California law, effective since 1987, that requires  all home sellers to fill out a detailed questionnaire covering defects in their  property. Potential buyers can review the document before they make up their  minds.  </P> <P> Realty brokers also have disclosure obligations under the new law, including  the requirement that they carefully inspect a property they have listed. A  study on the results of the new law is due out in six months.  </P> <P> "To our knowledge, the law has been very effective," Edmonds says. "We don't  have too many cases where the real estate broker doesn't comply with the  disclosure requirements. They bend over backwards to protect their liability."  </P> <P> One state whose commission is eager to hear the complaints of disgruntled  buyers is Maryland. Under Maryland law, says Charles S. Colson, executive  director of the state's real estate commission, agents are responsible both for  what they know and should have known about a property. That includes problems  with any major components of a house -- a leaking roof or basement, a central  air-conditioning or furnace defect or an electrical or plumbing problem.  </P> <P> If disgruntled Maryland buyers chose to lodge a complaint with the commission  -- and the investigative unit finds the claim solid -- the matter could go to a  hearing. Then if the hearing panel finds the agent in the wrong, strong action  can be taken. The agent could face a reprimand, find his license suspended or  revoked or confront a heavy monetary penalty.  </P> <P> The good news is that through the Maryland commission, a wronged buyer could be  compensated for the defects -- in the young couple's case for the basement  problems -- from the state's Real Estate Guaranty Fund. The buyers could  collect up to $25,000 from the fund, after which the agent would have to  reimburse the state for its payout.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints to Boards  </P> <P> In addition to a lawsuit or a complaint to a state commission, buyers can press  their claim through a local realtors' board. Realtors are licensed agents who  -- through their local boards -- are also members of the National Assn. of  Realtors.  </P> <P> "It may do the buyers some psychic good if they feel they're bringing the  realtor to justice," says Chicago-based Robert Butters, deputy general counsel  for the realtors' national association.  </P> <P> Realtors must abide by certain ethical standards and their boards have  formalized methods for being sure they do. Assuming that in the young couple's  case a realtor was involved, the couple could bring a complaint against him  under Article 9 of the association's code of ethics.  </P> <P> Among other things, the code says a realtor shall "avoid misrepresentation or  concealment of pertinent facts related to the property or the transaction."  Still, it adds that "the Realtor shall not, however, be obligated to discover  latent defects in the property."  </P> <P> To activate the realtors' complaint process, your first step is to write a  letter to the board in the area where the property is located. A grievance  committee will then investigate your complaint.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conscious of Ethics  </P> <P> If the committee believes there is reason to proceed, the matter will go before  a hearing panel of other realtors. Then, if the panel finds a violation, it has  a number of options. It can warn or reprimand the realtor, suspend him or expel  him from the organization, or fine him up to $1,000. However, the complaining  party has no claim to the fine.  </P> <P> With more customers becoming aggressive in pressing their complaints, agents  are becoming more conscious of their ethics, according to Gerald Matthews,  executive vice president of the Florida Assn. of Realtors. "Realtors are very  careful to do things exactly as they should to avoid lawsuits," he says.  </P> <P> For the young couple with the basement problem, a basic method of recourse is  obviously to sue the seller, though "these are tough cases," cautions Douglas  M. Bregman, a real estate attorney in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> When it comes to settled properties, it's of no help legally under most state  laws to show that the seller broke the sales contract, because the contract is  effectively dissolved at the settlement table, Bregman says. Instead, the buyer  has to prove actual fraud on the sellers' part.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formidable Defense  </P> <P> The young couple, for instance, must show that the seller knowingly deceived  them by erecting the false wall to conceal the faulty foundation and then  deliberately failed to tell them.  </P> <P> But even in so seemingly blatant a case as that, the seller can mount  formidable defenses -- for instance, that he bought the house after the false  wall was put up or that he hired a contractor who he believed fixed the  problem.  </P> <P> Even though such cases are tough to win in court, Bregman says that buyers can  often be effective in winning out-of-court settlements. And he says you  shouldn't be discouraged that a seller has moved out of town. All the buyer  needs to do is obtain a forwarding address. Keep in mind, however, that it's  far easier for a home buyer to press his claim before settlement than after. In  virtually all cases, buyers should consider making their sales contracts  contingent on completion of a bona fide home inspection. That way, many defects  will become apparent before the property is settled, allowing the buyer to  demand changes or renegotiate price before the deal has gelled.  </P> <P> Because an increasing number of sellers are being sued these days, Bregman  believes an inspection is also in the seller's interest, since it shows he  willingly opened his property to scrutiny.  </P> <P> Says Bregman: "Whether I'm representing the seller or buyer, I always push for  a thorough inspection by a reputable inspector because that gets everybody off  the hook."  </P> <P> Distributed by the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service.  </P> <P> </P></p>

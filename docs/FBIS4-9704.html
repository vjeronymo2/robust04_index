			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign  Minister Celso Amorim has assured his Argentine counterpart  Guido Di Tella that Brazil will exceed its commitment to  purchase a minimum of 2 million tonnes of wheat from Argentina  during 1994.    In a note sent yesterday and disseminated today, 24 March,  Amorim reiterated his government's willingness to maintain  regular contacts with Argentine officials to follow up  developments on wheat imports.    Amorim added that the Brazilian Foreign Trade Secretariat is  investigating Brazilian wheat purchases from Canada and Germany  in terms of GATT provisions concerning "dumping" and subsidies.    Amorim described the imports of Argentine wheat as  "strategic" for the implementation of the Program for  Integration and Cooperation developed by the two countries since  1986.    Amorim said that Brazilian mills "were the first to  acknowledge that the purchase of Argentine wheat is more  advantageous in light of tariff reductions provided under the  Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the exemption of other  duties, and lower freight costs stemming from the fact that  Argentina and Brazil are neighbors."    Amorim noted that the estimated amount of wheat Brazil will  have to import this harvest year to meet domestic needs stands  at 5.6 million tonnes.</p>

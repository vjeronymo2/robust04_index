For a long time, the German  company Schering was the only one with a Siemens/Fujitsu machine  in its Berlin Lab. Now Bayer AG (also German) has ordered a  computer from Cray Research. A two-processor, air-cooled Cray  C92A system featuring very large DRAM memory capacity is  scheduled to be installed in first-quarter 1994 in Bayer's  Central Research Facility in Leverkusen, Germany. Terms were  not disclosed.    Bayer is global player in the chemical industry. In Germany  they are producing at five different sites, but they are also  producing in Japan, they have a big affiliated company in the  United States of America, and they will invest more than ECU150  million in China, Bayer plans to use the new system to solve  large, computationally intensive problems in process simulation  -- such as planning and laying out of production facilities --  and to optimise plant operations for safety, environmental  factors and cost-effectiveness.    Virtually all supercomputer producers were competing for the  business and Bayer's decision followed extensive benchmark  testing, said Wolfram Wagner, director of technology resources  in the Central Research Facility. These test runs showed that  by simulating complex processes, Bayer would be able to reduce  costs and time in process development and gain a clear  competitive advantage, by optimising plant operations worldwide.    "The Cray system, in conjunction with high-performance  software, will open a new dimension in process development for  us," he said. "Process simulation means designing the production  facility on the computer system, optimising it dynamically, and  speeding up its operations. It seems that we can reduce the  production costs with more than 10 percent."    Bayer and Cray Research also have agreed to collaborate  extensively on developing and optimising computer-aided steady  state and dynamic plant simulation. The focal points of the  collaboration are:    -- Analysis and performance optimisation of plant simulation  software;    -- Optimisation of application software, through the  introduction and testing of specialised software tools;    -- Development and testing of new computer-aided methods for  simulating complex chemical plants on the T3D, Cray's parallel  system;    -- Porting and optimisation of applications software on  multiprocessor systems, in collaboration with Cray Research and  established software vendors;    -- Testing of parallel computers for the use of this  application software on real production problems.</p>

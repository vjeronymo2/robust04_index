			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUTES NEEDED OVER ENCINO HILLS  </P> <P> I am writing to refute the misrepresentation and misinformation in the letter  "Paving Over Isn't Answer" by Bill Crane of the Sierra Club.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has not informed the Encino  Hillside Traffic Safety Organization, of which I am president, that "opening up  new routes for traffic alleviates a situation for a maximum of about two  years." Rather, the Department of Transportation has recommended multiple  cross-mountain routes -- including a connection of Reseda Boulevard with a  paved Mulholland Drive -- as the only viable solution to the traffic problems  in the Encino hills.  </P> <P> This conclusion was the result of a Department of Transportation in-depth study  of traffic in the Encino hills 11 years ago when the traffic conditions were  serious but not as horrendous as they now are. The Southern California Assn. of  Governments has also recommended the connection of Reseda Boulevard to a paved  Mulholland Drive as one of several solutions to relieve the traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Yet our Councilman Marvin Braude and our City Council have done nothing to act  on the recommendations of these costly studies, even though they know that the  highway traffic on the narrow, steep and winding Encino hillside streets poses  danger to the residents and their property.  </P> <P> Crane is again incorrect when he says that paving of Mulholland Drive will  stimulate development in the Santa Monica Mountains. The three-mile strip from  Reseda Boulevard to Encino Hills Drive that the Encino Hillside Traffic Safety  Organization wants paved is in an area that is almost totally owned by the  federal, state and county governments, so that private development is  impossible.  </P> <P> The West Valley is developing regardless of the availability of roads, and the  existing phenomenal growth is taxing existing roads beyond endurance. A  cross-mountain route in the West Valley to accommodate the growth in the West  Valley is only fair and necessary.  </P> <P> Crane seems to be touting the new rhetoric of the so-called environmentalists,  who profess sympathy with the traffic plight in Encino yet vigorously fight  remedies for its solution in order to preserve their own agenda. Those truly  concerned with the environment know that idling cars damage the environment  more significantly than paving a three-mile strip on Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> MADELINE DeANTONIO, Encino  </P></p>

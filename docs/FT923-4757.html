			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Daishowa Paper to pass payout DAISHOWA Paper, the Japanese paper manufacturer lead by Mr Ryoei Saito, the controversial art collector, said it would not pay its interim dividend for the six months to September. It had scheduled an interim dividend of Y3 per share, but has been forced to suspend payment due to the continuing slowdown in the Japanese economy, and the sluggish paper and pulp market. To reduce its mounting debt burden, Daishowa has been struggling to off-load assets, including cross-shareholdings. The company said yesterday it had agreed to sell its pulp plant and lumber mills in Canada to its joint venture with Marubeni, a leading trading company, for Y110bn (Dollars 895m). Daishowa also warned that results for the full year could be worse than forecast. For the year to next March, it initially estimated a pre-tax loss of Y20.9bn and an after-tax loss of Y4.5bn on sales of Y416bn.</p>

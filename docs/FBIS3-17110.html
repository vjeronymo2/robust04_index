Zhigalin: "Hopes of Regional Independence </F> Melt in Greater Kiev"]    [Text] As an example, one fact revealing the industrial  infrastructure of our region. Despite its powerful production  potential, Donetsk Oblast works for itself only 9 percent, the  rest--production of the means of production. In today's economic  chaos, when relations with other regions of the former Union  have been severed, we are colossally vulnerable. It is now  essential to move away from single-commodity works, introduce  the latest technology, and switch to the region's self-support.  But how is this to be done?    The idea for the development of a model of regional  government, namely, economic independence, which would make it  possible to extricate the oblast's national economic sectors  from the crisis, was born in the latter half of 1992.  Approximately 200 of the best minds, not just of our region,  embarked on this work. About 40 academic higher educational  institutions and research and planning institutes were plugged  into this effort. A comprehensive program of social and economic  development for the Donbass was prepared in a very short space  of time. It passed expert evaluation at all levels and gained  high marks. It seemed that the life of our region would now be  running in a different channel, in which, thanks to the region's  independence, industrial potential and agricultural and, what is  most important, social potential would begin to operate anew.    "But today our program is 'spinning its wheels,'" V.L.  Nakonechnyy, first deputy chief of the oblast administration and  president of the Foundation for the Support of Progressive  Reforms, said at a news conference. "Kiev is still reluctant to  give the regions even a piece of independence, which would  enable us to resolve our problems ourselves. All our hopes are  'drowning' in offices of the capital, where people are keeping a  firm hold on power. We, however, want just one thing--give each  region its rights, and each region should live on its own  earnings. These are normal living conditions in world  practice...."    For the comprehensive program to start to work it is  essential that today the Supreme Council adopt a whole number of  legislative documents. Its old composition is not that ready to  agree to this. For this reason the Foundation for the Support of  Progressive Reforms has resolved to form in the course of the  present parliamentary elections its own team which undertakes to  finish what has been started. The developers of the program have  nominated candidates for deputy....    In the course of the news conference V.L. Nakonechnyy and  I.P. Navka, executive director of the Foundation, told  journalists how introduction of the program is being promoted,  for all that. There are already potential investors, who will  invest money in a restructuring of the economy of the Donbass.  And nothing would be holding them back were there a law both  protecting the investors' money and determining regional  independence. But Kiev does not have the time for this. It does  not want to understand that only strong regions will benefit  Ukraine.</p>

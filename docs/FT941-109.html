			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Caradon After a tumultuous year of disposals and acquisitions, Caradon's annual results appeared a tame affair in comparison. Rather like Tomkins after its purchase of Ranks Hovis McDougall, Caradon was tight-lipped about the newly-acquired Pillar, apart from suggesting that its striking two-month contribution would not be indicative of this year's full performance. That reticence is understandable, as Caradon still grapples with what it has bought. But, in the absence of fuller information, the market was left to worry over the sizeable fair value provisions for potential environmental liabilities and some chunky reorganisation costs. To be fair, Caradon has always presented the Pillar acquisition as a slow margin burn rather than a quick explosion. Some reassurance can be drawn from Caradon's fine record of delivering on its promises. Structural market changes affecting its security printing business in the US and Caradon's exposure to depressed markets in mainland Europe may take some of the shine off this year's progress. But longer term, Caradon offers an enticing mix of volume growth on the back of increased UK housing transactions and steady margin gains at Pillar. The broader worry concerning Caradon, though, is the same as that afflicting the building materials sector as a whole. Much of the sector's rating depends upon a return of price inflation. Many companies, including Caradon, are now itching to play that game. But if inflation really does take off with a vengeance, it may only spook the market as a whole.</p>

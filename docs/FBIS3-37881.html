			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by V. Kuts: "From Mutual Rights to Mutual </F> Obligations"]    [Text] A draft agreement on border issues, which was  discussed by the heads of Russian and Belarusian border  departments [as published] in Minsk in mid-February, can become  a basic document for further regulations of relations between  both countries, including the issues concerning the external CIS  borders.    If the internal CIS borders are to block a free transfer of  goods and services, then the economic union proclaimed by CIS  state heads will be devoid of all sense. With regard to this,  the need for safe protection of the CIS external borders  emerges, thus providing relations between both countries with a  greater mutual responsibility. Now, while protecting the  borders with the non-CIS countries, Belarus will protect not  only its national interests, but also Russian ones. The Russian  Federation will commit itself to analogous obligations. The  question regards a quite different type of relations between the  two states. These relations, as is assumed, will evolve from a  system of mutual rights to a system of mutual obligations, which  will help to save significant material means.</p>

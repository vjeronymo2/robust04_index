			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories to break financial silence THE CONSERVATIVE party is to take a first step towards increasing the amount of information published on its finances. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, is to be consulted on the feasibility of publishing a similar amount of information as in companies' annual reports. That could include, for the first time, detailed figures on debts. With the government determined to fulfil its pledge to reduce Whitehall secrecy, Mr Tim Smith, the Tory vice-chairman with responsibility for party finances, hopes he may be able to make the changes before 1992-93 accounts are published next summer. However, he has ruled out publishing a breakdown of donations. In spite of occasional controversy surrounding gifts - such as from companies within the collapsed Polly Peck empire of Mr Asil Nadir - the party argues that donors have a right to confidentiality. At present, the Conservative party only publishes a limited set of annual accounts, audited by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. These show income and expenditure but not full figures on assets and liabilities. A move to greater accountability would follow pressure for more openness from the 'Charter' Group of Conservative activists who want greater democracy and accountability within the party. Sir Norman Fowler was appointed Conservative party chairman last month with a brief to shake-up party organisation. Senior Tories recognise that Conservative Central Office needs to restore confidence among constituency associations that finances are effectively and efficiently used at head office. Coopers &amp; Lybrand's conclusions are likely to increase the pressure on Sir Norman to publish more financial information.</p>

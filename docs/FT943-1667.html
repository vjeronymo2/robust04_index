			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Tokyo's aim of boosting demand remains uppermost: Longer-term outlook sees a shift from direct to indirect taxation - but that could threaten the outcome The tax changes announced yesterday started life a year ago as an uncomplicated fiscal stimulus intended to breathe life into the ailing Japanese economy. Through a tortuous series of political and administrative twists in the last year they came, for a while, to represent rather more. Some proponents even claimed that tax reform was part of a broader strategy of social and economic reform that would help Japan's economy to open up to the consumer and to the world. But the final formula suggests that the overriding aim in the end was the same as ever - to boost demand. The key element remains the fiscal stimulus. The economy is benefiting from income tax cuts of about Y6,000bn (Pounds 39bn). The average family this year will be more than Y100,000 better off as a result. The main effect of the package is to maintain that injection of demand for the next three years at least. Fiscal retribution, if and when it comes, in the form of higher consumption tax, is deferred. That could normally be expected to boost consumption. But in the past, Japanese taxpayers have tended to save a very high proportion of their extra revenue from tax cuts - up to half by some estimates. That limits the benefits to the economy of any fiscal stimulus. Worse still, some economists fear that if consumers believe the benefits of the tax cut will be removed in three years' time by an indirect tax increase, they may choose to set aside even more of the extra money in savings. But the inclusion of a clause in the tax proposals to allow the government to reconsider the consumption tax increase in the light of prevailing economic conditions is crucial. It is likely to make consumers feel a little less uneasy about the delayed tax rise. Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute, argued that the opt-out clause was crucial. 'The income tax cut will only raise consumption significantly if the taxpayer does not think he will have to pay higher consumption tax in the future, regardless of the economic conditions,' he said. Higher consumer demand should also translate into good news for the world's trade imbalances. There have been signs in the last few months that the high yen has started to stimulate imports; that process has been assisted by the current year's tax cuts and is likely to be accelerated by the new fiscal stimulus. But in the longer run, Japan's trading partners may be less optimistic that the changes will radically alter the structure of Japan's economy. If the consumption tax increase goes ahead as planned, it will represent a significant shift in the burden of taxation from direct to indirect tax. It is unlikely that will encourage Japanese consumers to spend more and save less. In fact the shift from direct to indirect taxation normally has the opposite effect, since it raises the real cost to the taxpayer of spending relative to saving. However, the scope of fiscal policy, and of this particular fiscal package, was not intended to be so wide. As Ms Mineko Sasaki Smith, economist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, pointed out: 'This was never intended to do more than give an immediate stimulus, while remaining revenue-neutral in the long run. Real economic reform still awaits the opening-up and thorough deregulation of Japan's economy.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT) on Wednesday [6 April] sought government  understanding on its plan to raise some telephone charges. NTT  did all it could do to streamline its business, including man  power cuts and a reduction in facility expenses, Masashi Kojima,  president of the telecommunications giant, told a biweekly news  conference.    Kojima also tried to justify NTT's rate hike plan submitted  to the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry last week by citing  a cumulative 1 trillion yen in rate discounts made in the recent  past. NTT plans to raise monthly basic charges from October by  an average 18 percent per household and double a directory  assistance service rate for two or more uses for any one month  from the same telephone number from 30 yen to 60 yen per call.    The step, designed to improve the battered financial  standing  of NTT, would yield additional revenue of 93.2 billion yen to  the company for fiscal 1994 started April 1. But the government  is considering postponing enforcement of the increases  apparently in response to a barrage of public criticism of the  recent rate hike plans for utilities, public transportations and  telephones.    NTT, privatized in 1985, should not be treated equally with  other companies providing services with public nature, Kojima  said.    Kojima criticized the office of the U.S. Trade  Representative  (USTR) for citing unsatisfactory American access to NTT business  in its latest report on foreign trade barriers. Under the  current business conditions, it is impossible for NTT to expand  equipment purchases from U.S. makers, Kojima said.    Rather than focusing on purchases of foreign products, NTT  is  willing to form a joint venture with U.S. companies to create  new business chances both for NTT and foreign firms, Kojima said.    The annual USTR report released last week urged more efforts  by NTT to expand buying of telecommunications equipment from  U.S. makers, claiming the American share was unfairly small in  view of the international competitiveness of U.S. products.    On a new portable phone system now on a test run, Kojima  said  NTT plans to offer the service at more reasonable charges than  the current pay telephone rate of 10 yen per minute for local  calls. Kojima said the government should not impose strict  business licensing and other regulations on the new service and  other multimedia-related business expected to burgeon toward the  next century.</p>

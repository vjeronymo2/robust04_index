			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Norbert Burgner under the rubric "Aerospace </F> Journal": "Route Tests Successfully Concluded. Airbus 330 Flies  More Economically Than Expected"; first paragraph is an  introduction]    [Text] Testing of the efficiency and reliability of the new  Airbus 330 in daily scheduled use was the focus of the route  tests that the European consortium conducted in cooperation with  Malaysia Airlines and Air Inter.    The first phase of the so-called route tests as the  concluding part of the certification program for the new Airbus  Wide-Body Twin A330 began at the end of August in Kuala Lumpur  in conjunction with the Asian first customer, Malaysia Airlines.  By 6 September the aircraft had passed in a total of 30 flights  just under 103 flying hours on the Asian airline's domestic and  international route network. In addition, in more than 40,000  nautical miles (74,000 km) to Perth in Australia, Johannesburg,  Tokyo, Kuching, Bangkok or Hong Kong, the Airbus offspring  achieved 100 percent reliability, according to the company's  data.    The second phase from 14 to 17 September with the  short-route  test on the routes of French launching customer Air Inter was  just as successful. Equipped in a single-class configuration  with a seating capacity of 412, the maxi-twin's so-called  high-density/high-frequency qualities above all were challenged  here. Its ground handling characteristics--from docking at the  gate and the passengers getting off, to new passengers getting  on, and leaving the gate position--had to prove themselves  during an average of five to six flights per day over routes  with a time in operation of between 60 and 80 minutes--like, for  example, from Paris-Orly to Toulouse, Bordeaux, Marseilles or  Nice.    The company says that there were striking results during the  route tests, but above all even for the efficiency data obtained  during flight. "The total weight of the A330 is approximately  1.5 tons below the airline guaranteed values of 217 tons  maximum. Not least, its take-off and landing properties could be  improved because of this. But it is much more important that the  fuel consumption was able to be lowered once again by a good two  percent," stated G&eacute;rard Guyot, head of Airbus Flight  Division's testing and development department. In comparison  with its competitors--the Boeing 777 and the McDonnell Douglas  MD-11, the A330's fuel burn on a 2000-nautical-mile (3704-km)  segment is between 17 and 21 percent more favorable, according  to Airbus statistics. This would represent a saving of between  $600,000 and $1 million per year per aircraft. Lastly, for  operating costs even a reduction of up to $3.1 million per year  is realistic. The two U.S. manufacturers are doubtlessly of a  different opinion in this matter.    Last but not least, in addition the A330 also successfully  passed the certification test for long over-land and over-water  flights by twin-jet aircraft. These ETOPS (Extended Range Twin  Engine Operations) certification flights are for proving the  safe continuation of a flight in case of an engine failure with  multiple system failures at the same time--depressurization and  failure of the electrical system and the generation of fumes,  for example. Airbus Industrie will be supplying the A330 version  furnished with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4168 or with Rolls- Royce  Trent  700 engines with 90-minute ETOPS certification for the time  being. Aircraft with the now proven General Electric CF6-80E1  are being offered with 120-minute ETOPS certification, which  means that, with the problems named above, an alternate airport  has to be reached within two hours.    Certification for the new Airbus is to occur some time in  October after lastly approximately 1000 hours in flight testing.  The delivery of the first of a total of 15 aircraft to Air Inter  is to take place towards the end of the year. Malaysia Airlines  is to receive the first aircraft from the middle of 1994, at an  estimated price of about $115 million apiece.</p>

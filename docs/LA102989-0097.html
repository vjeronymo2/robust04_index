			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CHIP BANKS TRYING TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK  </P> <P> Chip Banks has won his battle to get back in the National Football League. Now  the Indianapolis Colts linebacker is trying to win his private war to stay in  the league.  </P> <P> Five days after he joined the Colts, Banks played in his first NFL game in  nearly 22 months. The former All-Pro started and was on the field for 49 of 64  defensive plays and made a significant contribution to the 23-12 upset of  defending AFC champion Cincinnati last Sunday.  </P> <P> Banks, 30, is a two-time loser under the NFL's drug program and faces a  lifetime suspension if he tests positive again.  </P> <P> But, opposing linemen, runners and quarterbacks concern him more than anyone's  nagging doubts over his drug rehabilitation.  </P> <P> "I don't expect to be treated any differently than anyone who makes a mistake.  For me, I feel that I just have to concentrate on my priorities . . . stick  with the program and I'll be fine. . . . My actions will speak a lot harder  than my words will."  </P> <P> Banks was obtained by the Colts from San Diego on Oct. 17 for a future  undisclosed draft pick. The next day he practiced with Indianapolis for the  first time and five days after the trade he was playing a football game for the  first time since Dec. 27, 1987 -- following a suspension and a season-long  contract dispute that was not resolved until the day of the trade.  </P> <P> "I never doubted I could play. I kept myself in condition and studied the play  book intently after I arrived," said Banks.  </P> <P> "I spent about 20 hours studying the Indianapolis defense," said Banks, adding  that teammate Duane Bickett, who was also his teammate for one year at USC  tutored him intently during that time.  </P> <P> "I don't think I could have done it, understood the system, so quickly without  Duane," said Banks, who made three solo tackles and was credited with four  quarterback pressures -- making him the team leader for the season.  </P> <P> "There's no question Chip was a significant reason we performed so well  defensively," Coach Ron Meyer said. "We knew he would play some, but quite  frankly, were surprised he played as much as he did."  </P> <P> The Colts, who took a chance on Tony Collins last year only to see him fail an  NFL drug test and eventually become hospitalized, know they're throwing the  dice again on Banks.  </P> <P> "I believe you have to acknowledge statistical facts that relapse is  prevalent," said General Manager Jim Irsay when he announced the acquisition.  </P> <P> "I don't worry about that," said Banks. "There are always going to be critics  and skeptics about my situation or anybody who made mistakes."  </P> <P> Banks' mistakes include being arrested four times in his native Atlanta on  cocaine and marijuana possession charges between February 1988 and June of this  year. On Oct. 11, an Atlanta judge sentenced him to five years probation on a  cocaine possession conviction. The probation term runs concurrently with a  five-year probation for a March marijuana conviction.  </P> <P> He was released from a drug rehabilitation center earlier this month and is  working with therapists in San Diego and here. In addition, he must subject  himself to random urinalysis tests.  </P> <P> "I'm just glad that the powers to be saw fit to give me this opportunity to let  me play again and to reinstate me to the league. That's what counted for the  most part, being reinstated and playing ball this year. Those were big hurdles  I made over. Those were the most important things I had to deal with," Banks  said.  </P> <P> On the field, Banks has always been impressive. At Lucy Laney High School in  Augusta, Ga., he played linebacker, tight end, quarterback and also punted  while receiving prep All-America recognition. He started two games as a  freshman for Southern Cal, led the Trojans in tackles as a junior and senior  and received All-America honors in his final year.  </P> <P> The Cleveland Browns made him the third pick overall in the 1982 college draft  and he was a Pro Bowl starter as a rookie. Another Pro Bowl start followed in  1983, along with selection to The Associated Press All-NFL first team. Banks,  who has started all 86 of his NFL games, also was selected a Pro Bowl starter  in 1985 and a first alternate in 1987.  </P> <P> "I've had the talent and I still believe I have it. I felt I was in pretty good  shape and I went out Sunday wanting to make my assignments crisp, do those  well, create some havoc and be an impact," he said. "I surprised myself  somewhat in the way I what I was able to accomplish."  </P></p>

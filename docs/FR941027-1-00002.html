RELRA amended several provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) (RE Act), and mandated a restructuring of the telephone loan program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 13, 1994, REA adopted its interim rule as a final rule (59 FR 17460) with one exception, 7 CFR Part 1751, Telecommunications System Planning and Design Criteria, and Procedures. Because of the overwhelming response and concerns regarding the requirements of the State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (Modernization Plan), REA is proposing to amend 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As revised, this Rule would require that Modernization Plans, at a minimum, apply to all REA borrowers. If a Modernization Plan is developed by the PUC or the State Legislature, REA encourages, but does not require, that the Modernization Plan's requirements apply to the rural service areas of all Telecommunications Providers. A State's decision not to include non-REA borrowers will not prejudice REA approval of their Plan. The PUC or the State Legislature may also, at its option, extend coverage of the Modernization Plan to all service areas of all Telecommunications Providers in the State. In addition, while requirements contained in &sect;1751.106 apply only to wireline services, the State Legislature or PUC, at its discretion, may extend coverage of Modernization Plans to wireless or other communications services in a State as it deems appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is REA's policy that every State have a Modernization Plan which provides for the improvement of the State's Public Switched Network. If the Plan Developer is either the State Legislature or the PUC, such entity must submit for REA approval its Modernization Plan by a date one year from issuance of the Final Rule. After this date, if a State or its PUC declines or fails to submit for REA approval its Modernization Plan, eligibility to develop the Plan passes to a numeric majority of the Borrowers within the State. While there is no time limit requiring States to have an approved plan in place, REA, as required by RELRA, will not approve any direct loans in States without such a plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the comment period, REA received 81 comments regarding the interim rule, and these comments were taken into consideration in preparing the proposed amendments. Comments were received from the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Alaska Public Utilities Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

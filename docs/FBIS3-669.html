			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "PM News Wrap" program, presented by Dennis </F> O'Donnell]    [Text] [O'Donnell] News just in is that there may be a coup  or a mutiny in Ciskei. On the line is Andrew Trench in  Grahamstown. Andrew, can you confirm this?    [Trench] Yes. What I've heard is that in fact it is not a  coup that has taken place, but that there has been a mutiny at  one Ciskei Battalion in Bisho. What people are saying is that  450 soldiers there went on strike this morning, demanding that  they be paid their pensions. I've also been told that senior  officers that went to negotiate with them were taken hostage and  that the officers and the soldiers there are demanding that  [Ciskei leader] Brigadier Gqozo come to the base and negotiate  with them.    [O'Donnell] So, how have the authorities been handling this?    [Trench] It seems as though they have tried the negotiation  route. The second in command of the CDF [Ciskei Defense Force],  Commandant (Matjila), went to negotiate with the soldiers  earlier, and it seems from military people that I've spoken to  that he was taken hostage when he did that. The line from the  Ciskei government at the moment is that they are going to  attempt to carry on negotiating whth them, although I've also  been told that they will, if necessary, go to the supreme court  for an interdict against the strikers.    [O'Donnell] Have there been any incidents?    [Trench] That we do not know yet. All I've been told at the  moment is, the only incident to report is that senior officers  have been taken hostage and that the soldiers have armed  themselves.    [O'Donnell] And you'll be keeping an eye on what's going on  there and you'll let us know during the program?    [Trench] That's right. Some information that we've just got  in now is that Brigadier Gqozo is at the base now and he is  negotiating with them, we understand.    [O'Donnell] Right. That's Andrew Trench.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Eastman Kodak suffers from Dollars 597m charge EASTMAN KODAK, the biggest maker of photographic equipment, reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 400m following a Dollars 597m after-tax charge to cover the cost of an early retirement programme and further restructuring moves. Kodak, in the throes of its fifth restructuring since 1983, warned in December that it would be taking a Dollars 495m charge, but said yesterday a Dollars 102m had been added, mainly to cover additional employees who might seek early retirement. It said that some 6,750 employees had elected to retire early and a further 2,000 would be eligible this year. The company also took a Dollars 435m charge in the third quarter, some Dollars 200m of it for the retirement programme, which produced a Dollars 118m net loss. Kodak said yesterday that in the absence of the charge, fourth quarter net earnings would have been Dollars 197m, or 61 cents a share, compared with Dollars 326m, or Dollars 1.01, in 1990. For the year, the company reported net earnings of Dollars 17m, or 5 cents a share, following after-tax restructuring charges of Dollars 1bn. Excluding the charges, net earnings would have been Dollars 1.05bn, compared with Dollars 1.27bn, or Dollars 3.91 a share, in 1990, before deducting the damages won by Polaroid in litigation against Kodak. Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman, said: 'Despite concerns about the economic background, we expect 1992 to be a time when benefits of what was done last year will show in category growth, higher sales and better earnings'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leon Brittan, EU commissioner for external </F> trade, by Lluis Bassets in Brussels; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bassets] Are you campaigning  for the Commission's presidency?    [Brittan] I am not engaged in an election campaign, because  it is not decided in an election. It is the heads of government  who decide this. It is no secret that the British Government is  supporting my candidacy. It would be an honor and a source of  satisfaction for me to receive the Community governments'  support. Of course, everybody knows that my viewpoints are not  the same as those of the British Government.    [Bassets] So the purpose of your visit to Madrid is to make  known your ideas for the eventuality of a candidacy for the  presidency.    [Brittan] No, the main purpose of my visit is something  else.  Over the past few months, while I was directing the GATT Uruguay  Round negotiation, I had to visit the United States and Japan on  several occasions. Now it is natural that I should wish to  visit the European Union [EU] countries in order to explain the  GATT agreements and to see their subsequent developments.  Naturally my aim is also to set out my ideas on the EU's  everyday affairs.    [Bassets] You and Mickey Kantor have presented the GATT  final  agreement very well, but the agreement on services is not  substantial. Audiovisual products have been excluded. One  might say it is like the Maastricht Treaty, with more exceptions  than rules.    [Brittan] I do not accept this description and do not  recognize this analysis, because it is incorrect. In the  services sector, we have laid down strict rules which are very  useful for Europe. In the case of audiovisual products we had  an insistent demand from the United States that we dismantle the  limited protection we have for our culture and commit ourselves  to go no further. We have not dismantled our system of  protection, and we have not committed ourselves for the future  or made it our duty to do so. I believe that in this respect  the Community can be very satisfied. More generally, this is  the greatest dismantling of tariff and nontariff barriers in  history. Therefore it cannot be said that it is an empty shell.    [Bassets] But it is, in services.    [Brittan] That is not true in services either. You have to  look at the agreement as a whole, which means an extensive  reduction of tariffs and the removal of many barriers. The  trading system's operating rules have been strengthened, and  this prevents the Americans or anybody else from adopting  measures unilaterally. We are going to set up a world trade  organization -- a central concern of the EU, which met with U.S.  opposition. All this has been achieved, including the services  sector in this; in some cases through specific agreements and in  others through agreements on the negotiating framework within  new rules.    [Bassets] Allow me to contradict you. You and Kantor took  up the negotiation when an attempt was being made to avert  catastrophe, and you succeeded, but you cannot deny that many of  the chapters have been shelved and that the expectations which  were aroused have not been satisfied.    [Brittan] It is the first time that services have been  included in an international agreement, and so it is not strange  that the agreements are not as spectacular as was hoped. What  was achieved in addition to goods -- in intellectual property,  which is especially important for Europe -- must also be taken  into account. But I insist that it is not true that there is no  substance in services. Considerable progress has been made, but  it is true that much more could have been made.    [Bassets] Do you deem it a priority now to tackle social and  ecological dumping, as Clinton and Delors believe, for instance?    [Brittan] The priority is to complete the formalities of the  Uruguay Round, implement it, and begin dialogue with European  manufacturers to see how the maximum benefit can he derived from  it. Then comes the opening of new areas of negotiation. One of  the first is undoubtedly the relationship between trade and the  environment. Another is the rules of competition policy,  insofar as it can affect trade. Yet another is social issues.  In fact, there are no disagreements on the issue of social  dumping. It is necessary to distinguish what has to do with  human rights, such as trade resulting from the activity of  prisoners or children, from the economic issues. We must be  very careful about matters connected with the cost of manpower.  Depending on which criterion we apply, Spain, for instance,  would not be able to export to other European countries owing to  the lower cost of its manpower.    [Bassets] There is a certain fear in the southern countries  of a loss of weight and influence. Do you believe that this is  well-founded?    [Brittan] There are two different points in your question.  One is the aim on which the Community should concentrate now,  and the other is the specific countries' rights and influence.  The Commission has traditionally supported the small countries,  and I believe that it is right that it should continue to do so,  but Spain is not a small country. It is a large and influential  country, and I would even say one with increasing influence in  all fields, and so I do not believe that it should be concerned  about loss of influence as a southern country. The other  problem is what the EU should now concentrate on. I believe  this is where the greatest changes have occurred with the end of  communism. There should clearly be a balance with respect to  the southern countries, a balance which should mean a greater  development of our own Mediterranean policies and particular  care in relations with the southern Mediterranean countries.  Not, as is said, in order to stop immigration to Spain or  wherever. It is a broader issue than all this. I do not wish  to express my disagreement with current policies but rather to  support strongly a balance of policies, also aimed at North  Africa.    [Bassets] Spain's weight in the European institutions is  less  than is appropriate in terms of its size, principally in key  posts, if it is compared with countries such as France or  Germany, which have played the leading role in European  building. Do you believe that things should change over the  next few years?    [Brittan] Curiously, the United Kingdom shares the same  impression. This happens not because there is unfair  discrimination with respect to certain countries. It is a  result of history and of national cultures and traditions. We  should encourage the people in the less represented countries to  submit their candidacies, and then they must be supported in  order to adjust the current situation.    [Bassets] You present yourself as a perfectly orthodox  commissioner with respect to the current institutional  framework, and say that you disagree with the British  Government, but the latter is supporting you in your candidacy.  Are you the antifederal candidate?    [Brittan] My stance cannot be identified with that of the  British Government. I have been an explicit and persistent  supporter of economic and monetary union. I believe that it is  economically desirable and that it is a basic aspect of European  integration. This is no secret, and it is not for me to explain  why the government supports me more or less. Nor have I changed  my views or intend to change them. Whether or not I undertake  new responsibilities, I will continue to work for the creation  of a single currency and of economic and monetary union, as I  have done so far.    [Bassets] So how would you explain the nuances in your views  on the British plan for a huge trading area in which you people  would occupy the central place?    [Brittan] No, no. Perhaps that is some people's aim, but  not John Major's. The British Government's view, which I share,  is that the Community is now a union -- not just a free trade  area.    [Bassets] But Delors himself has said that the British idea  is prevailing and the Franco-German idea of a more federal and  united Europe is receding.    [Brittan] I do not believe that the future of building  Europe can be presented as a matter between two extremes. There  are many qualified stances, and, moreover, there is no question  of dividing Europe into two blocs again.</p>

Ambassador Mondale is  scheduled to pay a courtesy call on Governor Ota on 10 April.  After receiving his courtesy visit, Governor Ota plans to  petition him for the solution of those issues.    Director Takayama said: "The Okinawa Prefectural Office  heartily welcomes Ambassador Mondale's visit. In fact, we would  like to arrange a meeting with him aside from his courtesy call.  However, since his itinerary is crammed, we want to call on him  to solve the issues immediately after receiving his courtesy  visit."</p>

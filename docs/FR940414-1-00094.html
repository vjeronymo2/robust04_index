			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XVIII. Solicitation of Data and Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA invites and encourages public participation in this rulemaking. The Agency asks that comments address any perceived deficiencies in the record of this proposal and that suggested revisions or corrections be supported by data where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA particularly requests comments and information on the following issues:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The data collected during the study of this industry demonstrate a great potential for reusing residual wastewater in products. EPA is concerned that there may be some circumstances in which some residual wastewater volume may need to be disposed primarily through incineration. We believe these volumes will be small, however some large production facilities may have relatively large residual volumes. EPA solicits data on the magnitude of volumes, their sources, their pollutant concentrations, what actions have been taken or will be taken to reduce their volume and the amount of reduction that the action has or will accomplish and the cost of achieving such reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Early in the process of developing regulatory options, EPA gave some consideration to the option of allowing an exemption from regulation if a facility were able to comply with a ``deminimus'' volume. EPA was unable to develop this option beyond conceptualization because there was no real basis on which to make the determination what constitutes a ``deminimus'' volume. EPA solicits the same type of data from facilities as described above and from POTWs on the volumes, and pollutant concentrations which could be representative of a ``deminimus'' volume,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  whether PFPR loadings have caused harm to POTWs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) EPA requests comment and suggestions on the best approach for notifying the PFPR facilities affected by this rule about the best practices, equipment and process changes observed at facilities that lead to pollution prevention, recycle, reuse and water conservation. EPA is presently considering publishing in conjunction with the promulgated rule a separate report dealing with pollution prevention practices or perhaps producing a videotape to broadcast the message. EPA invites comments and suggestions about what would be the most effective approach, content and format to publicize the best pollution prevention practices that are used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) EPA made a number of assumptions to calculate how much wastewater would either be reused in product, treated and reused as wastewater, or sent for off-site incineration. As discussed in the ``Cost Estimates'' section of this preamble and in the technical Development Document, if volumes of interior wastewater exceeded 50% of the total volume of inert ingredients EPA estimated the excess would either be treated and reused or treated off-site at considerable expense ($8.13/gallon). Given that this assumption does not in any way account for water conservation practices which EPA believes could be applied in many cases, (but did not attempt to apply given that site-specific information was not available), do the assumptions in the cost analysis tend to understate or overstate the costs of EPA's preferred option? Could the actual costs differ enough to suggest adoption of a non-zero discharge approach?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) In this proposed rule, EPA does exempt from zero discharge requirements exterior wastestreams from sanitizer pesticides. This exemption is based, in part, on the small amount of discharge that occurs from these wastewaters, the toxicity of these active ingredients, and the disproportionate impact regulating these wastestreams would have on small business. EPA solicits comment on whether any individual active ingredient, any other class of active ingredient or any sector of the pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging industry merits consideration of an exemption from the zero discharge standard based on any or all of the above characteristics. An example of a sector is a group of firms with a minimum 50 percent of pesticide revenue from a particular market, for example agricultural, non-agricultural professional use products, industrial, etc. as described in Table 5 of this preamble and the cost effectiveness report. Commenters are encouraged to provide additional information or data that supports different approaches for different pollutants, including information on quantity of pollutants discharged and costs to affected parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will conduct additional analyses of the amount of discharge (including estimating the total number of pound-equivalents removed) and any disproportionate impacts on businesses for individual active ingredients, classes of active ingredients, or sectors of industry as feasible and appropriate. Where appropriate EPA will announce the availability of this analysis in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

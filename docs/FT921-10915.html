			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Christiania Bank to seek further aid CHRISTIANIA Bank, Norway's second biggest bank, will have to seek additional support from the state-backed bank insurance fund to meet new equity capital requirements, the bank's president said yesterday. Mr Borger Lenth said it would be clear how much additional capital would be needed once the bank's 1991 accounts were published on March 5. However, the state bank insurance fund, established last year with capital of NKr5bn (Dollars 789m) and later boosted by NKr6bn, is depleted after supplying cash to prop up the country's top three banks. The bank was taken over by the government last December, and provided with a NKr5.14bn injection of state funds following massive trading losses. According to the Norwegian Bank Association, the commercial banks will suffer combined losses of NKr15.9bn in 1991, compared with combined losses a year earlier of NKr4.3bn. Combined credit losses are estimated by the association at NKr12.3bn, up from NKr8.2bn in 1990. The association forecast that its members would return to profit by 1993.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / NBC seeks partners for fifth TV channel NBC, the US network television broadcaster, is expressing serious interest in applying to run a new national Channel 5 in the UK. The US company could not by law control such a venture but it is starting to look around for potential UK partners, including national newspaper groups. NBC has been planning to expand into the European market for some time and last year it bought control of Super Channel, the pan-European satellite television channel. The channel, renamed NBC Super Channel, carries top network programmes from the US and has increased its business and financial news programming under the chairmanship of Mr Patrick Cox. NBC executives believe they could bring a new programme dimension to Channel 5, which three-quarters of the UK population could receive. Last week the Independent Television Commission said it considered there was a strong case for re-advertising the single national licence for Channel 5 . The commission warned, however, that before taking a final decision it needed confirmation from the government that the necessary frequencies would remain available. The issue is whether a conventional analogue Channel 5 would be incom-patible with developing digital terrestrial television in the UK. Critics of the idea of a fifth channel using existing technology say the frequencies it would use should be devoted to digital. That could make as many as 100 television channels available in the UK, although special decoders would be needed to watch them. As the ITC continues its work developing a transmission plan for Channel 5, the government has decided to use the interval 'to take stock' on Channel 5 and the present state of digital television. It is likely to be two or three months before a decision, considerably longer than the ITC would have liked. The Department of Trade and Industry is believed to be particularly interested in the prospects for digital television. The possible involvement of NBC means that there should be competition if a Channel 5 licence is advertised. Last month MAI, the television and financial services group, Time Warner, the US media giant, and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, said they had formed a consortium to bid for the Channel 5 licence if one were to be advert-ised. In December 1992 the ITC rejected the only bid for the licence on the grounds that the business plan was not robust enough and that shareholders were not sufficiently committed.</p>

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Finance ministers told EC economy is 'on the way up' THE European Community has passed the low point of the recession, the EC's economic affairs commissioner said yesterday. Mr Henning Christophersen said at a meeting of EC finance ministers in Luxembourg if projections of German recovery next year were accurate, the EC economy would grow faster than the Commission had forecast. 'We have seen the bottom and we are on the way up,' he said. His comments provided an upbeat start to a busy week for the community, which ends on Friday with a summit of EC leaders in Brussels. Ministers agreed they should maintain efforts to promote growth and employment. Last night French president Francois Mitterrand said he would be proposing at the summit an Ecu100bn (Pounds 77.6bn) bond issue to finance public infrastructure to spur the European economy. According to EC forecasts, even if the German economy lives up to expectations next year, the EC economy will not expand enough to put very many of the community's 18m jobless people back to work. A report from Germany's six leading economic institutes published yesterday says the German economy should grow 1.5 per cent next year. This year it is expected to shrink 1.5 per cent. Brussels has predicted the EC economy will grow 1.25 per cent this year, and by 1 to 1.5 per cent in 1994. But Mr Christophersen said if German forecasts were accurate, the EC economy could grow 2 per cent next year, heralding the end of recession. At Luxembourg ministers also discussed increasing the number of infrastructure projects eligible for funds from an Ecu8bn temporary lending facility from the European Investment Bank. They approved a range of secondary legislation to allow the setting up of the European Monetary Institute, a precursor of the central bank, from January 1 1994, and endorsed the EC central bank governors' recommendation that Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy be the first EMI president. Speaking of plans for this Friday's EC summit, Mr Mitterrand acknowledged he was picking up an idea of fellow socialist Mr Michel Rocard, who suggested that the EC borrow Ecu50bn for public works. Mr Mitterrand said the Brussels commission had told him yesterday it would be feasible for the EC to borrow and spend twice that amount. Labour fund call, Page 13</p>

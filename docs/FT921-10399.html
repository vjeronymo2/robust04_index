			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ATTEMPTS by the March stock index futures contract to break through the 2,600 barrier petered out yesterday after Wall Street's failure to extend Tuesday's record run, writes Joel Kibazo. March opened strongly, on the back of the firm performance on Wall Street and soon gained a premium of 35 to the underlying cash market. However, 2,596 proved a resistance level and the contract drifted lower, pulling the underlying cash market with it. The poor opening on Wall Street served to bring out more profit-taking in March with sizeable selling just before the official market close. March closed at 2,567, down 16 on the previous session but some 7 ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of 16. Turnover reached 5,730 contracts. In LTOM, dealers reported one of the dullest sessions in recent days as turnover reached a meagre 18,099 contracts, well short of the 30,000 break-even level. The FT-SE 100 Index traded 6,337 contracts. Dixons and BP each traded 1,217 lots. The June 240 puts were particularly busy in Dixons while, in BP, the April 280 options were busy in the calls and puts. BTR, Forte and Ladbrokes were also active.</p>

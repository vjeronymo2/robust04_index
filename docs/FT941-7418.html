			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Futures selling hits European bond and share prices Heavy selling in the futures markets pushed European government bond prices sharply lower yesterday and sparked a fall in share prices. UK government bonds, known as gilts, posted the biggest losses, with longer-dated issues falling by more than 2 1/4 points. Wednesday's slide in US Treasuries, combined with fears that UK interest rates would not fall further and could even rise, triggered early selling in London that was later exacerbated by weakness on the continent. The Liffe March gilt futures contract dropped by 2 23/32 points to 111 13/16 . After European markets closed, fresh declines in US Treasury prices prompted heavy selling of equities in New York, where share prices were already weak on news that the multi-billion dollar merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications had been abandoned. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 51.78 down at 3,839.90. Investors were unnerved by another big decline in Treasury prices, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond up to 6.738 per cent. The fall in European bond markets prompted the largest one-day fall in UK equities for the past 16 months, although trading volume in the stock market was not unduly heavy. The FT-SE 100 Index fell 74.4 to 3,267.5, closing near its low for the day. The FT-SE 100 is about 7.7 per cent below its trading peak of 3,539.2 at the beginning of this month. Other European government bond markets also fell heavily, with traders reporting heavy selling by US hedge funds. 'The markets are dominated by overwhelmingly negative sentiment - looking for rational explanations would be misleading,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. Nervousness in the bond mar kets has been sparked by the recent rise in US short-term interest rates and worries about a pick-up in US inflation. German government bonds fell sharply on concern at potential turmoil in Russia and the prospect of unfavourable economic data. The March Bund futures contract on Liffe had dropped by 1.31 points to 96.65 late in the afternoon in London. French bonds also fell sharply after the Bank of France trimmed its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 6.1 per cent, on disappointment over the size of the cut. The March French bond futures contract on the Matif exchange dropped by 1.04 points to 126.94. In European equity markets, Germany's Dax index of the 30 most traded stocks lost nearly 2 per cent to 2,090. In France, the CAC-40 index slid about 2 per cent to 2,208.

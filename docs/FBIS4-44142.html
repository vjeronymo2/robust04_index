			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Gungor Mengi: "Have We Taken Opium?" -- </F> punctuation as published]    [Text] Does Turkey stand to gain from obstructing or  postponing the demands of the people in southeastern Anatolia?  No, it does not. On the contrary, that approach harms its  interests. The dissolution of the Democracy Party and the  removal of its deputies from the parliament has come at an  unfavorable time. While the Government moved to persecute the  struggle it has waged against the Workers Party of Kurdistan  [PKK], it created the impression internally and abroad that  Turkey may deny "the reality of Kurds" at the first opportunity.  That impression has to be corrected. The countries that we  have persuaded to describe the PKK as a terrorist organization  and to outlaw it must not feel that they have been deceived.    We should keep in mind the following: Turkey is a democratic  country. Seeking rights through the use of arms cannot be  explained. Each and every trend of thought must be represented  in parliament, provided that legal boundaries are not exceeded.    That approach persuaded several foreign countries that had  had a skeptical attitude toward Turkey in the past to agree that  a legitimate struggle is waged being against the PKK. However,  the action that has been taken against the Democracy Party and  its deputies will endanger the support Turkey has received from  those countries. Meanwhile, foreign pressure will be  intensified.    The U.S. House of Representatives recently moved to make  U.S.  military aid to Turkey conditional. That was a warning. The  promise that the U.S. Senate will rectify this state of affairs  does not seem to be realistic, because a Senate subcommittee has  adopted a draft resolution which is even worse. It says that  Turkey must not use the arms and military equipment it acquires  from the United States for internal security purposes. The  Senate will approve it next week. Obviously, another critical  stage will emerge in U.S.- Turkey relations.    It is not difficult to predict a storm in Western Europe  judging by this gust of wind from the other side of the Atlantic  Ocean.    However, an opportunity exists to resolve the Kurdish  problem  without harming Turkey's unity and territorial integrity. Our  Kurdish citizens only want to have their ethnic identity  recognized and to live as citizens of Turkey.    An effort is currently being made to establish a new party,  which will be known as the People's Democracy Party. It will  replace the Democracy Party. Serafettin Elci is working to have  it established. Meanwhile, former People's Toil Party Deputy  Ibrahim Aksoy is also trying to establish a new party. The  founders of the two parties wish to secure the support of the  masses. They have concluded from their research that the  grassroots of their parties will not support the establishment  of a separate state.    Continuing the military success that has been achieved  against the PKK is only possible if the terrorists and the  people are regarded separately. That is how the PKK can be  crushed. In view of that, political tolerance and democratic  freedoms must be broadened as Turkey draws closer to achieving a  military victory against the PKK. Otherwise, it will not be  difficult to predict what may happen. The state and  administration will cause indignation in the people.  Consequently, they will react by supporting the Prosperity  Party. In fact, they have already begun to do so. That state  of affairs exists not only in southeastern Turkey but also in  the other parts of the country, including Istanbul. The people  are using the Prosperity Party against the system and the  administration, which are reluctant to replace inefficient and  unsuccessful politicians. However, no one seems to realize  that. Have we taken opium?</p>

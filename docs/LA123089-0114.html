			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN RAFAEL;  </P> <P> WRIGHT BACKERS CRITICIZE JAIL PLAN  </P> <P> Frank Lloyd Wright supporters have asked Marin County officials to redesign a  proposed $23-million jail rather than "denigrate" the memory of the renowned  architect. The two-story, 219-cell jail would go up in front of one of Wright's  most famous works -- the Marin County Civic Center, whose pale pink arches  sweep across three small knolls along busy U.S. 101. It is the only government  building Wright designed. Former colleagues of Wright wrote to the county Board  of Supervisors last week, saying they were appalled by the rectangular jail  design and asking that it be redone to harmonize with Wright's building. County  supervisors called it unlikely that the design will be significantly changed.  </P></p>

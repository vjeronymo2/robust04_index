			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WRIGHT PAID OFF DEBTS, FORM SHOWS;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS RELEASE THEIR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS  </P> <P> House Speaker Jim Wright, under fire for allegedly using his position for  personal gain, climbed out of debt last year, according to a financial  disclosure statement released today.  </P> <P> The forms showed that the Texas Democrat paid off debts of between $105,000 and  $200,000 and now has no liabilities, but his assets also declined. He listed  1988 assets of $31,005 to $100,000 -- compared with between $155,000 and  $435,000 the year before.  </P> <P> House members and senators must annually report their outside income, including  speaking fees -- known as honorariums -- gifts, assets and liabilities. The  reports of most of the 435 House members were released today; the Senate's were  released last Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TV Comedy Careers  </P> <P> The forms included those of two members of the House who had previous careers  in television comedies and a former baseball player.  </P> <P> Former actor Fred Grandy (R-Iowa) reported $20,021 in residual income from "The  Love Boat," the long-running series in which he played Gopher, a skirt-chasing  officer on a cruise ship.  </P> <P> Ben Jones (D-Ga.) reported $11,212 in residuals. Jones appeared on the "Dukes  of Hazzard."  </P> <P> Republican Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a former pitcher, got a $350 royalty check  from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Assn.  </P> <P> Hank Brown (R-Colo.) listed not only his own income but that of his wife and  three teen-age children. Christy Brown, 19, made $1,600 working in another  congressman's office and $295 for baby-sitting and yard work. Her sister Lori,  17, worked in a movie theater for $1,547 and earned $367 for baby-sitting and  16-year-old Harry got $370 for yard work.  </P> <P> Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.) earned $5,000 for his jewelry designs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ethics Rules  </P> <P> Speaker Wright has been charged with violating House ethics rules for  activities that include getting abnormally high royalties from bulk sales of a  book and for his financial relationship with Ft. Worth developer George  Mallick.  </P> <P> Wright reported no more book earnings last year, but he paid off a note worth  between $50,000 and $100,000 from Mallightco, Inc., the partnership he formed  with Mallick.  </P> <P> He listed owning less than $5,000 worth of stock in Jewell Enterprises, a  nursing home operation that has also drawn the attention of the House Ethics  Committee.  </P> <P> Investments and $30,000 in speaking fees brought Wright's income up to a range  of $188,183 to $203,579, nearly doubling his Speaker's salary of $115,000. He  reported receiving no gifts.  </P></p>

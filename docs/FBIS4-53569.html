			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prosecutors demanded Friday  [20 May] former Chief Cabinet Secretary Takao Fujinami be  sentenced to three and half years in prison for allegedly taking  bribes in a shares-for-favor scandal involving Tokyo-based job  information firm Recruit Co.    The Tokyo District Court is expected to hand down a ruling  by  the end of the year after Fujinami, 61, and his lawyers deliver  their final submissions July 14, court officials said.    He is the first suspect from within the political circle to  face a ruling in the series of Recruit scandals that jolted  Japanese politics in the late 1980s.    Fujinami was charged with receiving 10,000 unlisted shares  and 20 million yen in checks from Recruit in exchange for  political favors.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: A Little Night Music - Theatre If Plymouth's Stephen Sondheim is less appealing than Leicester's, the fact is that A Little Night Music is in itself a less enticing proposition than Merrily We Roll Along. It came some nine years earlier in the Sondheim oeuvre, and the idea of setting Ingmar Bergman's romantic film-comedy Smiles of a Summer Night to waltz-time got a brittle realisation, one that needs all the stage help it can get. Roger Redfarn's Plymouth production has its merits. There are pretty sets by Martyn Bainbridge: a decayed proscenium arch, trellises, a large mock-rococo fresco, shadowy trees outside Grandmamma's chateau (far too many bright stars, though, for a midnight-sun night). Reduced to two pianos and a cello, all commendably expert, the score sounds brittler than ever - pastiche operetta, even G&amp;S, with ingenious rhymes over mildly queasy waltz-harmonies. One misses the original string ensemble. The one surefire number, 'Send in the Clowns', comes near the end; there is nothing so memorably apt and infectious as 'Old Friends', midstream in Merrily We Roll Along. The real trouble, however, lies with the adaptation (by Hugh Wheeler and Sondheim). In Bergman's comedy, quite naturalistic and slightly cruel, a weary, unglamorous lawyer, with a still-virgin bride of 11 months, competed with an icily formidable Count for the favours of a famous actress (the irreplaceable Eva Dahlbeck). In the musical the Count is only a blustering dunderhead and the equally icy Countess a lachrymose Wronged Wife; the lawyer becomes a mature romantic hero - attractively played here by Gary Raymond, sung at variable pitch. Rula Lenska puts a credible face on the actress, and Richard Lyndon and Deborah Grant do their best for the sadly declasse aristos, but the tense class-divisions go for nothing, leaving the story lamed. Worse, for Broadway the ultra-dignified Grandmamma - once a famous courtesan - was turned into a raunchy old dame, a coarse Lady Bracknell. Though Hermione Gingold just about got away with it, this gross cartoon lies well outside Eileen Page's more delicate range. Kate Arneil's lusty maid is fetching, and Dermot McLaughlin makes something of his under-written role as the lawyer's greenstick son (piety sabotaged by rampant adolescence). The child-bride is Lisa Hollander, who sings and smiles charmingly, and delivers each new line as if it had nothing to do with her last one. Plymouth Theatre Royal. Runs until 2 May.</p>

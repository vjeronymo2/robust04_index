			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: A thrilling clash of poets - London Theatre What happens when two artists enter each other's orbit? Total Eclipse, Christopher Hampton's play about Rimbaud and Verlaine, is now 25 years old, and it stands up well. As a narrative of what happens when an older and more formally conventional artist is confronted by a young genius, it is a lot less windy and ranting than Peter Shaffer's Amadeus. And it is also the story of an infatuation. The two poets prey upon each other; and Verlaine is reduced to pleading, bullying and even attempting to shoot Rimbaud. As a study of destructive passion, Hampton's play makes us set these two late-19th-century French poets alongside Antony and Cleopatra (Dryden's more than Shakespeare's), and Don Jose and Carmen. It is much too narrow to be a great play, but it rivets attention and illuminates the past. This Greenwich staging works powerfully, thanks to the central performances of Greg Hicks as Verlaine and 19-year-old Oliver Milburn as Rimbaud. Milburn, in his first professional stage performance, has complete assurance and absorption in the world onstage; you often watch him when he is not speaking. He has Rimbaud's fixity of purpose - whether fixed on Verlaine or on expressing his own vision - and he is completely natural in the tricky long speeches in which Rimbaud communicates his poetic ambition. His is not a performance of virtuoso technique - in particular, he has much to learn about vocal projection  - but I congratulate the director, Lisa Forrell, for casting him. He has such obvious talent, and is so plainly right for this role (the play shows Rimbaud between the ages of 16 and 20), that you want to see him in a quick succession of precocious young rebel roles. Greg Hicks has the theatrical experience and wisdom to make Verlaine a completely different order of being from Milburn's Rimbaud: weaker, but more complex and more articulate. He catches not only Verlaine's cowardice but also his anguished awareness of it; and not just his bisexual dilemma (caught between gorgeous wife and thrilling boy-wonder) but also the raging despair that underlies his whole life. Whether in the very funny, bizarre long speech about the foetuses of his three siblings, or in the hysteria with which he tries to keep Rimbaud, he is compelling. Only in the solo passages that start and close the play is he too restrained and contrived. Julian McGowan's designs economically convey a succession of different scenes beneath a vast wild grey abstract and an unmoving row of empty absinthe bottles. The heart of Lisa Forrell's staging, properly, is in the natural force generated by the two poets. At the Greenwich Theatre, until May 29.</p>

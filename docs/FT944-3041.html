			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Nuclear waste project faces delay Proposals for a Pounds 2bn underground nuclear waste repository project may face further delay, after a recommendation to Cumbria county councillors not to approve the scheme's next stage. In a report published yesterday, Mr David Cole, the county council's director of economy and environment, advises councillors not to grant planning permission at a special meeting next Tuesday for an underground rock laboratory near Sellafield. Nirex, the nuclear industry's waste agency, wants to construct the Pounds 120m rock characterisation facility (RCF) 650 metres underground, to gather geological and hydro-geological data before deciding final plans for a repository. Nirex has already spent more than a decade searching Britain for a suitable disposal site for intermediate-level and low-level nuclear waste - arousing fierce opposition. In mid-1991 it decided to focus its investigations on a site near the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing plant where 60 per cent of the waste is produced. It had hoped, if geology proved suitable, to have the repository operational by 2005. Technical changes and planning wrangles about test boreholes have set back this target to 2010. If, as seems likely, Cumbrian councillors decline or defer permission for the RCF, a long public inquiry may result. In his report, Mr Cole says that the RCF application conflicts with Cumbria County Council's strategic planning policies as a result of its adverse environmental and amenity impact on the surrounding rural area and also the impact on the nearby Lake District National Park. Nirex, he says, has not to date provided sufficiently convincing reasons to override these policies. The outcome of the government's review of the UK's nuclear industry, including waste management policy, is still awaited, says Mr Cole. Further geological information from Nirex on the site is also expected shortly. Nirex, he says, has not provided information to convince the council there are 'compelling reasons' for choosing the Sellafield site in preference to alternatives.</p>

What the three presidents discussed and documented in Moscow  is not an agreement, Chairman of the parliamentary Commission  for International Affairs Dmitriy Pavlychko told journalists.  "Therefore, for the moment we can only state our attitude to  this document," he said.    Pavlychko believes that the Moscow statement cannot replace  the Ukrainian parliament's resolution. Such a resolution can  only be replaced by an agreement, not by a protocol of intent,  he said. "We can only ratify an agreement," he added.    Pavlychko also believes that the final decision on the  problem will be made by a new parliament. He said that Leonid  Kravchuk shared this belief.</p>

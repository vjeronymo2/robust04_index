			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TCHAIKOVSKY PROGRAM AT PASADENA CIVIC AUDITORIUM  </P> <P> On Saturday night, Rostropovich led the National Symphony in a Tchaikovsky  program at Pasadena Civic Auditorium. On balance, the results gratified the  thinking listener, without sacrificing any of the requisite passion and  sentiment one expects in this music.  </P> <P> Revealing a deliberate and thoughtful reading of the Piano Concerto No. 1,  Alexander Toradze displayed a wide range of articulation and tone quality:  powerful and bright in the opening movement, limpid in the second and fiery in  the Allegro con fuoco finale. Negotiating even the most treacherous octave runs  with rarely a blur, Toradze's technical command affords him the luxury of  de-emphasizing the purely virtuosic aspects of the work in favor of artistic  considerations.  </P> <P> Rostropovich's conducting of the Fifth Symphony continued along a similar  interpretive path. Only in the Andante cantabile did the director lean toward a  more heart-on-sleeve approach. But in the outer movements the tempos and  transitions were persuasively gauged, while the third movement Waltz possessed  a soothing lilt. Throughout the work the combination of expert playing from the  first-chair members, and a collective sound that never turned strident even in  the largest climaxes, was alluring.  </P> <P> The evening began with an appropriately virile reading of the "Coronation  March" (1883), and concluded with two encores: a sassily played "Promenade" by  Gershwin, and a vibrant and explosive Overture to "Russlan and Ludmilla" by  Glinka.

That is, the fact is that  the package of drafts [narabotki] of the Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet Committee for Defense and Security Questions and  of other committees which devoted attention to the Army will be  set in train. Although corrections are undoubtedly inevitable.    Sergey Yushenkov also voiced the hope of close contact with  the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense on questions of  lawmaking. This is necessitated, in particular, by the recently  adopted military doctrine, which is in need of a "legal  superstructure."    The Duma members spent Tuesday afternoon clearing up  questions of the standing orders. Once again, just as on the  previous day, a proposal was made to "set free" Aleksandr  Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov. Precisely 145 deputies came out  in favor of including this item on the agenda, with 151 against  it. The proposal did not pass. Nor did the next one -- to  examine the reasons for closing down the well known "600  Seconds" news program. But the Duma members were unanimous on  the proposed construction of a new parliamentary complex costing  $500 million -- such costly construction is not timely. Yegor  Gaydar ("Russia's Choice") and Valentin Kovalev (Communist Party  of the Russian Federation) made a corresponding statement in the  lobby, thereby setting an example of factional unity "on  fundamental issues." It is proposed to resolve the State Duma's  housing problem by redistributing the capital's administrative  buildings.    In fact, the incident with the parliamentary complex may be  regarded as the first challenge to the government, as a test of  the strength of the opposition members' coalition.    On Wednesday the Duma members examined and approved the plan  of the State Duma's law-drafting work. It was proposed and  defended by Mikhail Mityukov, under whose leadership the plan  was drawn up in the Legislative Proposals Commission under the  Russian president.</p>

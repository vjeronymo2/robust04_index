			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Liberation Army dons a business suit: The PLA's corporate moves prompt western worries IN THE early 1980s Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, sent shivers down Hong Kong's collective spine with his comment that Beijing would station units of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong after 1997. Four years away from Britain's handover of the colony to China, the PLA is already in the colony and in force. However, the uniform it wears is the business suit. In the past week, China's military-industrial complex has taken majority interests in two Hong Kong listed companies, raising concerns among military analysts and Hong Kong government officials about the intentions of the PLA in the colony. Last Wednesday Mr Wang Jun, son of the late Wang Zhen, one of China's leading 'long march' revolutionaries, was in town to tell investors and the press of his plans for Continental Mariner, an investment company. Mr Wang is Continental's chairman, a position he holds by virtue of his chairmanship of China Poly Group Corporation, the controlling shareholder of a syndicate which in turn controls Continental. China Poly is the vehicle used by the equipment procurement department of the PLA's general staff to sell Chinese-made arms abroad, and to acquire technology useful to China's weapons development. The president of China Poly and deputy chairman of Continental is Maj Gen He Ping, director of the procurement department and a son-in-law of Mr Deng. On Wednesday night this week, China Aerospace Industrial Corporation (CAIC), China's manufacturer of military and civilian rockets, bought 51 per cent of Conic Investment, which produces liquid crystal displays, televisions and telecommunications equipment on the mainland. The interest was previously owned by Bank of China and China Resources, two of the mainland's leading corporate groups in Hong Kong. Until March, CAIC was part of the aerospace ministry. At the National People's Congress in March the ministry was dissolved and its aviation and astronautics arms hived off into two separate corporations responsible to the State Council, China's highest governmental body, or cabinet. CAIC manufacturers China's 'Great Wall' rocket which is used to launch commercial satellites. But according to military analysts in Hong Kong, CAIC is also closely connected with the PLA's 2nd Artillery which controls China's nuclear capability: it manufactures the delivery vehicle for China's intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles. According to Stockholm's Peace Research Institute, China sold weapons with a value of Dollars 7.8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) in the five years to the end of 1991. Analysts in Hong Kong say that sales have fallen sharply since the Gulf War of 1991 because of the poor performance of Chinese military hardware, especially tanks, under Iraqi command. As export revenues have come under pressure the PLA has had to look at more creative ways of making money. Under China's foreign investment rules a Hong Kong company, no matter what its ownership, is classed as a foreign investor. It is able to go into partnership with its mainland parent and receive large tax breaks in addition to operating outside the rigid rules applied to Chinese state industries, including welfare subsidies and permanent employment. Both Continental and Conic said they would focus on business on the mainland. Analysts also expect the parents of the two to inject mainland assets into the two companies in due course, a transaction which would lead to a flow of hard currency to the parent. Although analysts see the reason for the acquisitions as primarily financial, many believe there may be security issues involved as well. Under rules devised by Cocom, the Paris-based organisation that vets the west's sales of high technology, it is illegal to sell 'dual use' technologies to China. However, last May the US lifted restrictions on such exports to Hong Kong, with the exception of night vision technology, super computers and cryptography equipment. A Hong Kong government official, noting CAIC's purchase of Conic, said: 'We hope their interest is purely financial. We won't let this (acquisition) escape our attention.' As one military analyst pointed out, the PLA has acquired, through perfectly legal means, Hong Kong registered entities. They could act as conduits for technology transfer to the mainland.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / US group wins Nordic snack bid KRAFT General Foods Inter-national, part of the Philip Morris group of the US, yesterday won control of more than 50 per cent of the capital in Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's leading chocolate and snacks producer. Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest publicly quoted company, which controls 44.1 per cent of Freia's shares together with its pension fund, yesterday accepted the offer which values the company at Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 882m). It also accepted on behalf of Procordia, the Swedish food and medical group, and Paulig Services, a Finnish company. 'Consequently, a total of 54.9 per cent of the shares of Freia Marabou is covered by the acceptance,' Norsk Hydro said. The move virtually extinguishes any hope held by Hershey Foods of the US to acquire the company through a rival bid which it was considering with Orkla, the diversified Norwegian food group. Hershey controls 18.6 per cent of Freia's capital. KGFI needs a two-thirds majority to push the deal through and the many small shareholders could pose an obstacle to a rapid conclusion. KGFI subsidiary Jacobs Suchard on September 28 offered to acquire Freia Marabou for NKr450 a share. Freia Marabou's B-shares closed NKr5 up to NKr435 yesterday on the Oslo bourse, but news of the Norsk Hydro acceptance came after close. If the bid is successful, the company is to be called Freia Marabou Suchard. The offer offer expires on November 11. KGFI promised Freia's shareholders it would ensure the company's growth and expansion. With the help of Jacobs Suchard, Freia's exports could rise by 5,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes within five years. It said Freia's activities, board and management would remain intact and the company would take over responsibility for Jacobs Suchard's chocolate and sugar confectionery in the Nordic region, as well as in Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the Baltic states. Norsk Hydro stands to gain pre-tax profit of NKr2.4bn on the disposal which it says will strengthen the company's financial position. Norsk Hydro's pension fund will receive NKr500m from the sale of its 5.8 per cent Freia Marabou stake.</p>

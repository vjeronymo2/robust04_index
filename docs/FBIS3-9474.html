			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (TANJUG) -- The president of the  Bosnian Serb Republic (RS), Radovan Karadzic warned on Thursday  that the decision to deploy Turkish U.N. troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would create conditions for a major Balkan  war.    Karadzic told a RS parliamentary session in Pale, RS  political centre close to Sarajevo, that if Turkish soldiers are  sent to the Moslem-Croat state in Bosnia, the Bosnian Serbs  would demand that in its territory are deployed the troops of  the neighbouring Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as a U.N.  member, said Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA.    The United Nations has so far operated on the principle not  to deploy troops of neighbouring countries and earlier occupiers  in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.    The region of Bosnia-Herzegovina was for 500 years (until  the  beginning of the 20th century) under Turkish occupation, and  this is still vivid in the memories of the Bosnian population,  especially the Serbs.    However, the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday gave the  go-ahead to a proposal by the secretary-general that Turkish  peacekeepers be deployed in Bosnia and passed on the final  decision to Butrus-Ghali.    The latest reports from the U.N. New York headquarters are  that the Turkish U.N. contigent should be deployed along the  separation lines between the Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who  succumbed to strong U.S. pressure last week and signed an accord  on setting up their federation in Bosnia.    Karadzic informed the parliamentary session about the  outcome  of the peace talks on Bosnia held so far and the proposal to  determine a new platform for their continuation.    Karadzic suggested to the deputies to adopt a platform which  would include a demand for establishing peace, just territorial  delimitation, the rejection of the Serb participation in the  Moslem-Croat federation and which would insist on the Serbs'  right to self-determination.</p>

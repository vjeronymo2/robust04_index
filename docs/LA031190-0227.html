			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Bob Hope's typically predictable and inane NBC "special" hit new lows Feb. 17  with his sexist and stupid monologue on women in combat.  </P> <P> No way could you make me believe an audience would laugh at such sexist drivel.  The other low was the sketch on "We Care Cemetery." Did Bob even consider how  this would sound to a person who has experienced the recent (or not so recent)  death of a family member or friend? He went for cheap laughs but unfortunately  was not funny.  </P> <P> Marilyn J. Hoelscher, Seal Beach  </P></p>

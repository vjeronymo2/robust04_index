			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / MGN stands firm on bid: O'Reilly moves to become largest shareholder in Independent The Mirror Group Newspapers consortium which is bidding for control of The Independent and Independent on Sunday newspapers said yesterday it would press ahead even though Irish publisher Mr Tony O'Reilly had moved to lift his stake to 29.99 per cent. Mr O'Reilly's company Independent Newspapers of Ireland - which acquired 24.99 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the UK newspapers, earlier this month - said yesterday it had agreed to purchase a further 5 per cent for 350p per share, conditional on approval from the Department of Trade and Industry. The DTI must approve any increase above 25 per cent on competition grounds. If approved, the deal will take Mr O'Reilly's holding to just below the level that would trigger a full bid for the company, and make him the largest single shareholder. That will increase the pressure on the MGN-led consortium, whose members include Newspaper Publishing's two largest existing shareholders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, and a group of founders of the newspapers, to make a deal with Mr O'Reilly. The independent directors of Newspaper Publishing are meeting today and are expected to make an announcement about the consortium's offer, which was raised on Sunday from 261.6p to 350p a share, in a mixture of cash and MGN shares. It values the company at Pounds 73.65m. Mr Ian Hay Davison, chairman, held back on Monday from recommending the bid to shareholders until he had further details - which were provided yesterday. The MGN consortium, which owns more than 47 per cent of Newspaper Publishing, made no official reaction to Mr O'Reilly's move yesterday. But members are thought to be strongly opposed to any deal with the Irish publisher, who has twice sought to thwart their plans. Advisers to the consortium denied claims that Mr O'Reilly's move would make it difficult to structure a deal satisfactory to all its members. Members have agreed that MGN would take at least 25 per cent of Newspaper Publishing's equity. But it would hold some voting shares in trust for the continental European shareholders, giving them more than 50 per cent of the voting. The Irish group said yesterday that it was keeping all options open and had not ruled out a full bid for Newspaper Publishing. But it stressed that Mr O'Reilly's aim was to be 'a constructive, significant, minority shareholder'.</p>

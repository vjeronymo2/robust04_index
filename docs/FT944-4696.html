			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Strategy to protect future expansion plans at Sturge Sturge, one of Lloyd's biggest managing agencies, is to set up a new holding company in an attempt to protect future expansion plans against legal action threatened by lossmaking members of the insurance market. The announcement came as the group announced a fall in pre-tax profits, after stripping out lossmaking discontinued operations, to Pounds 3.06m in the year to September 30 from Pounds 4.42m. Sturge Holdings also includes Wise Speke, the private client stockbroker. Last month the Sturge Names' Action Group, representing more than 3,000 Lloyd's members, said it would issue writs in January seeking compensation for heavy losses incurred in the early 1990s on Sturge-run insurance syndicates. SNAG said its claims might eventually total Pounds 1bn. Lord Poole, Sturge's chief executive, said any action would be resisted vigorously and that SNAG had little chance of winning. He said the new holding company could not shield existing businesses from legal action, but Sturge wanted to expand its range of businesses in the financial services sector and the new holding company, Ockham Holdings, would be clearly distanced from the Lloyd's insurance market. He said any 'cunning ruse' to avoid litigation costs would have been stopped by the High Court, which has to approve the transfer of Sturge shareholders' interests into the new company. Separately, Sturge Holdings has increased its provisions against litigation by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 5m. SNAG said it would seek to 'thwart any attempt to stop proper restitution of assets that have been purloined from Names'. The annual figures show the heavy cost of Sturge's discontinued members' agencies, which act for individual members, and recorded an operating loss of Pounds 2.93m against a loss of Pounds 3.28m last time. The on-going members' agencies business was sold in October for an initial consideration of Pounds 500,000. In relation to the disposal, Sturge wrote off Pounds 12m in goodwill and made a provision for future losses of Pounds 3.78m. Turnover on continuing operations fell to Pounds 21.6m (Pounds 27.7m). Earnings per share for continuing operations were 3.9p (7p). Including discontinued operations, losses per share were 31.1p against earnings of 1.5p. The final dividend is maintained at 2p making 3p for the year.</p>

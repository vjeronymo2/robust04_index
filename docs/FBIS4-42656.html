			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial from HELSINGIN SANOMAT excerpted by </F> HUFVUDSTADSBLADET under rubric "Discussion of the Day"]    [Excerpts] HELSINGIN SANOMAT is critical of the president's  hunger for publicity. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Unnecessary Publicity Weakens President </H5>   President Martti Ahtisaari and his advisers are fascinated  by  the idea that the direct election method calls for the president  to exercise power differently than his predecessors did, notes  HELSINGIN SANOMAT (independent), which takes a critical view of  what it calls Ahtisaari's regal tours through the nation. HS  [HELSINGIN SANOMAT] points out that while of course it is good  that the president can signal his responsiveness to the public  through his trips around the country, it will become a problem  if he constantly makes spontaneous offers of help right and left.    "And the problem will just get worse if there are many  unresolved matters that the president is involved in one way or  another. Then it will be hard and in the long run also  impossible to stand above the political parties.    ``Under the Constitution, the president of the Republic is  in  charge of foreign policy. That is the chief of state's most  important task. Where domestic policy is concerned the president  should mainly hold himself in reserve, to cite Koivisto. He  should be ready to offer ideas in situations where the parties  get embroiled in conflicts that cannot be resolved without  outside mediation and an arbiter.    ``Resolving such problems requires a president who has a  natural dignity with the attendant reserve of prestige. It is  precisely this kind of thing that the public has become  accustomed to demanding from the chief of state. In light of  this it is rash to appear on entertainment programs on TV and  answer serious questions that undermine the institution of the  presidency.    ``One of Ahtisaari's problems is his spontaneous reaction,  his desire to take a stand on issues and to answer when he is  asked something. When it is used correctly, this is a good and  important characteristic. Ahtisaari and his advisers must  determine what kind of publicity suits the president. This  involves solving a difficult problem: how to strike a balance  between the institution of the presidency and the demands that a  modern society places on public disclosure.    ``The president cannot make one pronouncement after another.  That is a very short route for political actors regardless of  their nation or era. As strange as it may seem, silence is also  one of the president's resources, especially in the age of  broadcast media.'' [passage omitted]</p>

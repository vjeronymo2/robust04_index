That proposal was prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. This action revises the proposed rule by requiring modification of both the forward and rear seal retention angles, regardless of whether damage is found. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by February 13, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 92&hyph;NM&hyph;157&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That NPRM would have required a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance between: (1) The wing forward pick-up adapter plate and the seal retaining angle on the fuselage side access panel, and (2) the wing rear mounting adapter plates and the seal retaining angle on the fuselage side access panel; and modification, if necessary. That NPRM was prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. That condition, if not corrected, could result in degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received a comment that has caused the FAA to reconsider its position on certain aspects of the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter requests that the proposal be revised to require modification of the forward and rear retention angles and adapter plates, regardless of whether damage is found in the adapter plates. The commenter contends that if the forward and rear seal retainers are not trimmed, they may be inadvertently interchanged with seal retainers from other airplanes in an operator's fleet. The FAA concurs. The FAA has reviewed all available data and has determined that in order to preclude the possibility for installing an untrimmed seal retainer in an airplane that lacks sufficient clearance, the forward and rear seal retainers must be trimmed. Although the referenced service bulletins do not specify trimming the forward and rear seal retainers when the seal retainers are found undamaged, the FAA finds that safety can be best assured when the seal retainers are trimmed, regardless of whether damage is found, to avoid the possibility for inadvertently interchanging seal retainers from other airplanes. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a) of the previously issued NPRM has been revised to propose requiring that Modification 7/2319 (forward adapter plates and seal retaining angle), and paragraph (b) of the NPRM has been revised to propose requiring that Modification 7/2355 (rear adapter plates and seal retaining angle) be accomplished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

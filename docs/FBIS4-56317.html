			<p>CSO     [Text] The proposed Popular Participation Law, which  according to the government will bring development to rural  areas, is seen by Miguel Urioste, the deputy of the government  party, as a juridical instrument that will liberate the  indigenous peoples. In the opinion of Fernando Untoja, leader of  the National Katarist Movement (MKN), the new law will serve  only to register and allocate the land. The head of the CSUTCB  [General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of  Bolivia], Felix Santos, says that "what the administration wants  with its proposal is the support of the peasants to hegemonize  power."    Despite the fact that the indigenous peasant represents more  than 54 percent of the nation's population, integration into the  economic, political, and social life of the country has always  been an unresolved problem because of the social development and  structure in Bolivia from its founding up to the present.    After 169 years of life as a republic, economic and  political  power is still denied to those persons who, for more than 500  years, have demanded the ownership of their lands, usurped in  their opinion by "European invaders and their heirs, who today  enjoy impunity in the command levels of the state."    The recent misfortune of the indigenous peoples, in the  national and continental contexts, and the social injustice in  which they live, was the motivation, according to government  representatives, for the preparation of a law that would channel  the sense of participation that the "people" have always had,  Popular Participation.    The sentiment and the logic with which the administration  rationalizes its proposed law is described by Miguel Urioste,  national deputy of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL), as a  redistribution of the state's resources in order to encourage  rural development.    "It is the first time in the country's history that 20  percent of tax revenues will have been transferred to the  provinces, cantons, and communities through the sectional  townships," said Urioste, referring to the projections for  peasant development.    Fernando Untoja, presidential candidate for the National  Katarist Movement (MKN) in last June's general election,  believes, however, that the Popular Participation Law will not  further social development, much less the economic strengthening  of rural areas, because it does not contain a comprehensive  agricultural policy.    "The Popular Participation project has a single virtue: it  is  designed to register territories and communities, which in the  end will come down to the administration of schools, health  stations, and other public facilities, through the  municipalities and subprefectures," Untoja said.    There is still another view. In the opinion of Felix Santos,  executive secretary of the CSUTCB, the Popular Participation Law  is a plan that will commercialize land ownership, impoverishing  the peasants even more.    "How can there be economic development and progress in rural  areas when the administration itself has in mind to create land  banks and institutes that will establish new rural taxes which  logically further impoverish the peasants?" questioned the union  leader, who is of Quechua origin.    A subject that concerns Fernando Untoja, who recently  proposed an alternative plan to Popular Participation, is the  law's lack of ideas and specific articles related to the  economic development of rural areas. These are areas that suffer  from a lack of markets for their products, and the fact that  agricultural technology has not reached rural areas.    This thought was further developed by Santos, to whom it  seemed "totally incoherent" that the government proposal did not  take into account the economic progress of the indigenous  peoples. Worse yet, it wanted to eliminate education and health  services, transferring them gradually to the municipalities.    "I do not believe that the reallocation of the budget will  aid the development of rural areas, especially when the money  will come out of the pockets of impoverished urban families and  of the peasants themselves, while wealthy businessmen will  continue to benefit from our labor," he emphasized.    Urioste, vice presidential candidate for the MBL in 1993,  defended the government's proposal, saying that "this is just  the beginning" of a series of changes that, in the long run,  will restructure a state that still preserves hidden forms of  colonial domination and ethnic-cultural exclusion.    Urioste recognized that juridical equality for Bolivians,  embodied this time in the Popular Participation Law, will not be  sufficient to close the immense gap that exists between the  poverty of rural areas and the opulence of the privileged social  sectors in the cities.    "We must keep in mind that this is an important plan but not  the final one. I believe that this juridical instrument will, in  a sense, initiate the liberation of the indigenous peoples,"  Urioste said.    In Santos's opinion, the worst thing that could happen to a  poor person is to be a peasant, without access to political and  economic power, without any real opportunity to take part in  governing the state.    "We believe that one of the ways that rural areas can be  developed is to transfer the administration of natural resources  to the indigenous peoples, so that the proceeds of the  exploitation of these resources can be administered autonomously  by the people of the regions that produce them," said Santos.    The peasant leader's suggestion was converted by Untoja into  an alternative proposal that was recently presented to Congress.    That document proposes drawing the indigenous peoples'  tribal  organizations into the state, which might even make possible a  new system of national departments, based on Bolivia's  ecological zones and ecosystems.    The most important feature of "Untoja's Katarist"  alternative  lies in the state's real ability to distribute land to the  peasants.    "The current Popular Participation Law makes no provision  for  granting land to the peasants, which in this situation is the  most important element for a takeoff in agricultural  development, which is certainly not to be confused with the  Basic Territorial Organizations (OTB's)."    Santos and Untoja, the latter of Aymara origin, agree in  saying that the official document is political in content and  has as its ultimate end taking possession of the rural sector  and municipalizing it by means of the committees of vigilance.    "The government's aim in forming the committees of vigilance  is obvious. These committees will be taken over by movement  groups which will set aside and leave powerless the popular and  communitary organizations of workers and indigenous peoples,"  the principal leader of the CSUTCB charged.    "This is evident. The ayllus, cabildos, jilikatas, curacas  [presumably governing or representative bodies of the Indian  nations] and other communitary organizations will have to give  up their places to the committees of vigilance, which  necessarily will be vouched for by the subprefectures, and in  the final analysis these committees will do the screening of the  OTB's representatives," said Untoja.    But Urioste, the number two man in the social democratic  MBL,  defends the project, saying that "the peasants' ability to  choose, decide, and to administer should not be underestimated."    "I am certain that there will be no political infiltration  in  the committees of vigilance because they will not be handpicked  but will be chosen by each community's individual system," said  Urioste.    However, in Untoja's opinion the government sector already  has a juridical instrument that "will legalize" political  conditioning for each electoral event.    "For example, the community that does not agree with the  government's political line simply will not receive resources to  run its schools or health stations. This fact will produce  divisions in the communities and ayllus, which will fight to be  legally recognized," Untoja predicted.    In any event, and from different perspectives, Untoja, as  well as Santos and Urioste, already knows that the new law will  not produce an immediate economic takeoff in agriculture,  although the MBL leader nourishes a certain hope.</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Reforms help Bombay climb to new peak - The market has welcomed the repeal of a ban on foreign companies After a brief pause earlier this week, the Bombay bourse has continued the extraordinary bull run which started in January, and yesterday achieved its second record high in less than a week. Speculative buying had pushed share prices to a 1992 peak last Friday, prompting the stock exchange authorities to intervene on Monday, with a package of measures to cool the overheated equity market. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India's largest with three-quarters of national trading, banned forward deals in the 86 most actively traded shares, except in the case of squaring outstanding positions. Quantitative restrictions were imposed on brokers on purchases in the remaining 600 stocks. But the effect of these restrictions appeared to be short-lived. After reaching a record high of 2,302.54 last Friday, a rise of 17.6 per cent from the start of the year, the 30-share BSE index fell 29.73 on Monday in response to the trading restrictions. The index has since recovered, reachingits new record yesterday and closing 20.93 up at 2,309.36 on renewed speculative buying. The impetus for Bombay's bull run has come mainly from the continuing industrial and trade reforms started last July by the minority government headed by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, who is governing by consensus, and the more recent decision to open up the economy to foreign investment. Its most recent surge, last week, was fuelled by two important events. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, lifted a 10-year ban on foreign companies opening branches in India, which will allow them to compete with domestic companies. This will enable, for instance, Coca-Cola, which had been ordered out, to return to India and sell its branded soft drinks. Analysts say that the lifting of the ban is expected to allow foreign companies already listed on the BSE to increase their earnings and could encourage more foreign companies to seek a listing. This optimism was reflected in a rise in share values of foreign companies. Nestle has risen to Rs275 from Rs220 in a fortnight, Ponds India, a Unilever affiliate, to Rs460 from Rs330 and Mico, a Bosch affiliate, to Rs2,250 from Rs1,900. Also, New Delhi ended the uncertainty of the past three years by giving statutory backing to the Securities and Exchange Board of India to regulate the capital markets. The optimism of traders has also been supported by buying in ACC, India's largest cement group, and Apollo Tyres by a fast-growing portfolio manager, Growmore Finances Services. The BSE recently asked the youthful Mr Harshad Mehta, who heads Growmore, to explain why he was buying shares in these two companies. He replied that all of the purchases, which began a year ago when ACC was quoted at Rs600 and Apollo Tyres at Rs70, have been for investment purposes only, and that Growmore has no takeover ambitions. Yesterday, Apollo Tyres and ACC closed at Rs252.50 and Rs4,525 respectively. Growmore's Apollo share purchases raised eyebrows in the market, since the Indian automobile industry is in recession. But Mr Mehta has his own logic: Apollo also caters to the replacement tyre market. The present boom is not based on fundamentals, analysts say. It hangs precariously on hopes of rich rewards five years hence when the restructured Indian economy should be set on an export-led growth path. The traders are bullish and many new capital issues are expected to flood the market this month, ignoring pre-budget blues. But the finance minister Mr Manmohan Singh has warned that he is likely to unveil a harsh budget on February 29. The government is committed to the International Monetary Fund to cut the fiscal deficit to 5 per cent of GDP next year from 6.5 per cent this year as part of the stabilisation programme. If Mr Singh prefers a heavy dose of taxes to a cut in capital expenditure, traders' hopes for a soft budget will be disappointed.</p>

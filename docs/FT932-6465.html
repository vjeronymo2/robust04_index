			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Tory right warns Clarke over EC RIGHTWING Conservatives indicated yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, will have to tread carefully if his enthusiasm for Europe is not to create fresh divisions in Tory ranks. As Tory MPs reacted to a cabinet reshuffle intended largely to unite the party after a bruising year since the general election, there were scarcely coded warnings that Mr Clarke should not push for early British re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. One Tory Euro-sceptic said Mr Clarke's appointment was 'like a red rag to a bull'. Mr John Watts, chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, said: 'I think his major handicap is the fear that his European enthusiasm may overcome sound economic judgment.' Mr James Cran, MP for Beverley and a leading opponent of the Maastricht treaty, said Mr Clarke was, 'a realist' and knew that there was a substantial group of backbench MPs fiercely opposed to British ERM re-entry. There was doubt among Euro-sceptics about Mr Clarke's promise that any ERM move was unlikely before the next election. On the pro-European wing there was a recognition that Mr Clarke would have to work within limits set by his backbenchers. Mr Ian Taylor, Conservative MP for Esher, who heads the Positive European group of MPs, said: 'I don't think it is a question of him being more pro-European. I think that he is going to have to deal with things as he finds them.' Privately some backbench MPs believed Mr Norman Lamont could cause substantial damage to the government from the back benches. One Conservative said his sacking had been 'tactically inept'. In public the former chancellor won sympathy from colleagues. Some said he had been a 'scapegoat' and a victim of a 'lust for blood' by a few Tory backbenchers. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary who had been tipped as a possible chancellor, said Mr Lamont, 'had pretty unfair treatment from the media'. Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers, said he could understand those who felt Mr Lamont had reason to feel 'aggrieved', having got interest rates and inflation moving in the right direction. But the careful balancing of factions by Mr John Major left most Tory MPs able to find some reason for cheer last night. There was relief that the prime minister had ended the damaging uncertainty surrounding the chancellorship and other cabinet posts. One MP admitted: 'We had got to the state where we couldn't continue with what we had.' The decision to keep Mr Michael Portillo, a staunch Thatcherite, as chief secretary to the Treasury encouraged Tory MPs that there would be no let-up in the government's determination to curb public spending. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, said: 'We will be looking to Kenneth Clarke to give Michael Portillo his 100 per cent support.' Opposition leader Mr John Smith scoffed at the cabinet changes and likened Mr Major to the 'captain of a ship throwing his first mate off the bridge as they head for the rocks'. Calling for a fundamental change of political direction, Mr Smith said the prime minister was as heavily identified with 'the current economic mess' as Mr Lamont. He urged Mr Major to accept responsibility for past mistakes. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the prime minister had dressed up the sacking of the chancellor as a reshuffle. The cabinet changes were 'just a new coat of paint for a discredited government'.</p>

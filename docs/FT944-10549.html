			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Challenge to Hurd over Pergau funds Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, was yesterday accused in the High Court of acting unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m from the overseas aid budget for the Pergau dam in Malaysia. The World Development Movement, a lobby group for developing countries, is seeking to have his decision quashed, to recover the Pounds 29.6m already spent and to block further payments from the aid budget for the dam's construction. The next instalment is due to be paid next month. The group says that Mr Hurd overstepped his powers under the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act by allocating aid money for the improper purpose of promoting trade with Malaysia. The act says the primary purpose of aid must be the economic benefit of a foreign country or the welfare of its people. Mr Nigel Pleming QC, the group's counsel, said the purpose of the act was 'aid - not trade'. He said the use of aid could not be said to be for the economic benefit of Malaysia because when Mr Hurd took the decision 'Pergau was unequivocally an economically unsound project'. Mr Pleming told the court that the dam could not be 'unbuilt' and added: 'We are not concerned with what happens in Malaysia from now on. What we are concerned about is that British monies which should not have been spent on Pergau should be spent on proper, deserving cases.' He said that Sir Tim Lankester, former permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Administration, had advised that the dam was uneconomic and funding it was an 'abuse of the aid programme'. But he was overruled by Mr Hurd on the basis of 'wider considerations'. A plea by the development movement for the court to order the government to release documents containing Sir Tim's reports to Mr Hurd was rejected by the judge. The government has accepted that if it loses the court case the bill for the dam will have to be met by another government department. The development group has said that the Pounds 234m earmarked for the project is equal to twice as much as all British aid for water and sanitation for the last five years, or half Britain's aid to sub-Saharan Africa in 1992-93. The hearing continues today.</p>

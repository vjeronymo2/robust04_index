Comments on Testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 26. Numerous comments addressed the agency's modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Panel's proposed testing guidelines (43 FR 1210 at 1239 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1240), the agency's statements on final formulation testing (43  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FR 1211, 1224, and 1240), and specific protocols for upgrading an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial ingredient from Category III to Category I (43 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1242 to 1246). Stating that the testing guidelines were unclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in some places and pointing out inconsistencies between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines and the agency's responses to comments at 43 FR 1211  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1223 to 1227, a number of comments requested clarification or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed modifications of a number of items in the guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments requested specific information or submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocols for testing Category III ingredients. One comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that manufacturers be permitted to determine which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocol to follow to establish safety or effectiveness of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient. A number of comments objected to the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of the testing guidelines as final, and urged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions in the guidelines for publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency acknowledges that there were some inconsistencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the testing guidelines for safety and effectiveness proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the previous tentative final rule. The agency does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider the previous testing guidelines as final. The agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying in this amended tentative final monograph that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final formulations will be required to meet the specifications in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final monograph. As stated in section I.N., comment 28, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is proposing testing procedures in &sect;333.470 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating the active ingredient in pure form as well as in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete formulation. The agency recommends that manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use these procedures for testing the final formulations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products intended for health-care antiseptic use. Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may propose other appropriate testing procedures subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency evaluation, as requested. The data from these tests are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not required to be submitted to FDA by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the agency intends to use these procedures for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary compliance testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. Two comments pointed out an apparent conflict in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency's statements concerning safety factor calculations as follows: At 43 FR 1240, the agency concluded that a minimum of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100-fold safety factor should apply to the exposure dose for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients labeled for repeated daily use; at 43 FR 1241, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency stated that if the safety factor is extrapolated from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal species to man, considering surface area, the highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no-effect dose should be used for the multiplier, and in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of complete data, a 100-fold safety factor should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied when translating the animal highest no-effect dose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> man; and at 43 FR 1213 (see comment 19), the agency stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications of the safety factor will be allowed for specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment suggested that a safety factor of less than 100-fold be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable when scientific investigation of good quality shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the test animals used in establishing the no-effect dose are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to humans with respect to metabolism (biotransformation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pharmacokinetics) and/or tissue susceptibility. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment stated that a more reasoned and practical approach would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be to require calculation of certain safety factors as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended, and indicate in a general guideline that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk-benefit ratios based on these factors would determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative merits of the product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency does not find any conflict in the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements included in the previous tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The safety factor calculations were included merely as a general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guideline. The agency's response to comment 19 at 43 FR 1213  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated that the agency would retain a minimum of a 100-fold safety factor applied to the exposure dose for ingredients in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products labeled for repeated daily use. However, the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will consider modifications of the safety factor for specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients where justified by risk-benefit considerations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where requests are based on submitted data. While the 100-fold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety factor was a general guideline in the previous tentative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final monograph, the agency does not find a need to include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general guideline in this amended tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. Numerous comments requested clarification of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria required to establish effectiveness for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial product class. One comment stated that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Testing Guidelines'' section seems to indicate that it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to determine the effect of the vehicle on the active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient. The comment contended that this provision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusing because the preamble discussion in the tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph indicates that vehicle testing will not be necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* where adequate data are available on the active  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredients alone.'' (See 43 FR 1210 at 1224.) Another comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the Cade handwashing test can only be conducted if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the antimicrobial is placed in a vehicle and noted that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial is never used by consumers in its raw form;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, efficacy testing on the raw antimicrobial ingredient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be required. A third comment stated that the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial effectiveness of a topically applied product is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function of the total formulation rather than a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingredient. Another comment added that if an individual product formulation must be tested, and/or the testing of a product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle is considered essential, then such testing requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be specifically described. Citing the definition of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antiseptic in section 201(o) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(o)), one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment asserted that the definition requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial product kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms on the skin. The comment proposed that efficacy can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated by showing that the preparation produces a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative reduction in the levels of normal skin flora and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inhibition of bacterial growth in vitro. Two comments pointed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out that the ``Modified Cade Procedure'' handwashing test (43 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1210 at 1243) specifies a one-log reduction of bacteria, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure fails to indicate how many uses or days of use of test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product should produce the reduction. Other comments requested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no upper limit be set for bacterial hand counts, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lower limit of 1.5&times;106 per hand be the only criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject selection, and that minimal hand count reduction be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in the test protocols for surgical hand scrub and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash products. Another comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that modification of the ``Sampling technique and times''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (paragraph 6) of the protocol ``Effectiveness Testing of Surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hand Scrub (Glove Juice Test)'' (43 FR 1243) was needed because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the protocol did not indicate the volume of sampling solution but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only stated that the volume *&blank;*&blank;* should be ``kept constant'' for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all tests. The comment recommended that the agency specify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of 50 to 100 mL of sampling solution in order to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent and reproducible results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

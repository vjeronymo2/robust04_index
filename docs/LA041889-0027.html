			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BODY OF MISSING GIRL, 13, FOUND IN MARIN COUNTY  </P> <P> The nude body of 13-year-old Jennifer Moore, who has been missing since  Thursday, was discovered Monday evening at the side of a local highway, police  said.  </P> <P> "It appears . . . that she was probably killed elsewhere . . ," police  spokesman Scott Sibbald said. "She was in some garbage bags, partially in and  partially out. Part of her face and head were still concealed in the bags."  </P> <P> Some of her clothes were found nearby, the spokesman said.  </P> <P> Sibbald declined to elaborate on the condition of the body. An autopsy was  scheduled by the Marin County coroner's office.  </P> <P> Sibbald said a motorist driving along Novato Boulevard, about half a mile west  of the city limit, spotted debris alongside the road, stopped to check, found  the body and contacted police.  </P> <P> Sibbald indicated investigators have a lead on "a suspect or suspects," but  declined further comment.  </P> <P> The popular eighth-grade student was last seen near a local shopping center,  where she had gone to get an ice cream cone, her mother said.  </P> <P> More than 20,000 posters appealing for help in locating Jennifer were  distributed over the weekend.  </P> <P> Family friend Jan Shippey called Jennifer "the sweetest; just a good girl."  </P> <P> Jennifer's disappearance was the latest in a series of cases involving missing  Bay Area girls. Ilene Misheloff, 13, disappeared Jan. 30 on her way to an ice  rink in Dublin; Michaela Garecht, 9, was abducted outside a Hayward market last  November, and Amber Swartz-Garcia disappeared while playing in the front yard  of her Pinole home last June.  </P> <P> However, investigators have said there is no evidence that the cases are  connected.  </P></p>

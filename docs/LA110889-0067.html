Waco said he may file a lawsuit against  Officers Nicholas Titiriga and Gregory Baltad and Van Nuys Superior Court Judge  Raymond T. Mireles. Waco said he also may file complaints with police and  judicial authorities over the conduct of Mireles and the officers.  </P> <P> "I want to see that this sort of thing never happens again," he said.

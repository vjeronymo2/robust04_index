			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report ZINC closed near seven-week highs on the LME, largely reflecting technical factors. The early breach of chart resistance around Dollars 1,030 a tonne for three-month metal triggered fund short covering and further buying. Talk also circulated of production cuts, centred on Pacific Rim countries, although no news had emerged by the close. Three-month COPPER was firmer, as the market staged a recovery from last week's five-year lows and moved above Dollars 2,050 a tonne. But business was not particularly active, while volatility levels in traded options eased, reflecting calmer conditions. Trading on the London bullion market was thin after the holiday weekend, with few new fundamental factors to sustain prices. Chartists said both GOLD and SILVER were consolidating above recent lows but forecast renewed weakness near term. Early firmness in Europe was attributed to the overnight rise in the Nikkei index and the unrest in South Africa after the weekend slaying of Communist Party leader Chris Hani. But these factors were played down later as New York opened mixed. Compiled from Reuters</p>

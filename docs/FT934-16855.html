			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Peace in, peacekeeping out: Europe When the world's most important politicians gather at the United Nations to make speeches about the future of the world, we are unaccountably seduced into hoping for uplifting guidance. Usually, of course, we are disappointed by the gap between rhetoric and reality; but sometimes the rhetoric seems actually to be the exact opposite of reality. Take President Bill Clinton's expose of his administration's foreign policy at the United Nations in New York last week. Some people had started to fear that the Clinton administration was beginning to seem worryingly inward-looking, potentially even neo-isolationist. So Mr Clinton went to New York to reassure the world that these fears were unfounded. America would continue to lead, he said, and America would remain engaged. 'We cannot solve every problem,' he admitted, 'but the United States must and will serve as a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace'. Moreover, America had developed a new foreign policy orientation to replace the containment of the cold war: it is called 'enlargement', meaning the encouragement of democracy and market forces in an ever larger number of countries. He said he would work to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction; he would seek to strengthen the UN's peacekeeping capabilities; and he would promote the objective of sustainable economic development in the third world. As an expression of high-minded aspirations and laudable values, President Clinton's UN speech showed that his heart is in the right place on all the conventional issues of the day: in favour of democracy and market forces, in favour of Gatt, and free markets, against terrorism, against the spread of nuclear weapons. There is just one problem: his speech does not amount to a serious description of a foreign policy, let alone the foreign policy of the superpower that proclaims its intention to lead the free world. Some passages are trumped up with mushy or even meaningless rhetoric. It is unnerving to be told: 'This is a moment of miracles.' And how does the US propose to go about being 'a fulcrum for change and a pivot point for peace'? It sounds quite uncomfortable. But even where the president's aspirations are relatively comprehensible and precise, it remains unclear how he proposes to act. The new catch-phrase is 'enlargement': but what exactly does the administration propose to do to increase the number of countries that are market-based democracies? Apart from reiterating his support for freer international trade, Mr Clinton is careful not to tell us. The speech scarcely mentions Russia or China; except to claim that 'a thriving, democratic Russia makes the world safer', and that 'the growing economic power of China could bring great benefits to Asia and to the world'. Surely the UN General Assembly deserved something more serious than that. In short, it appears that Mr Clinton is on the side of the angels, in a moderate and reasonable way, and he appears to be a thoroughly nice man. But he does not seem to have a foreign policy, in the sense of an articulated set of goals, strategies and tactics. The usual explanation is that his experience and priorities are domestic, and that he feels no urgent need for an original approach to foreign policy. This may not be a true picture. But anyone who saw Mr Clinton preside over a TV talk show on his healthcare proposals on Sunday, and then heard him expound his foreign policy at the UN on Monday, could not fail to be struck by the extraordinary contrast in his passion and apparent conviction. A second version is that the pace of change in the world is so great that it is not yet possible to frame a coherent foreign policy. The world expects the US to lead, President Clinton feels the US has a duty to lead, and he is reluctant to admit that he is floored by the pace of change. So he says the US will lead, but gives us mush, which he pads out with motherhood and apple pie. If there is a clue to the truth, it probably lies in President Clinton's back-handed proposals for the UN itself. He praised its peacekeeping achievements in Namibia, Bosnia, Somalia and Cambodia, and he said he wanted to strengthen the organisation's peacekeeping capabilities, which have not kept pace with its rising responsibilities. But his primary aim is clearly to curb all future UN peacekeeping operations. He would give the UN a proper planning staff, a logistics unit, access to intelligence, and a modern operations centre. But new peacekeeping operations would have to meet tough criteria: Is there a real threat to international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an end point to UN participation be identified? How much will the mission cost? These are questions which are designed to be hard to satisfy for any American contribution to a peacekeeping force in Bosnia, or anywhere else. The excessive euphoria of 1989 is now over, and President Clinton's hard-nosed criteria are just representative of the increasingly sceptical tone of voice of the realpolitik community in other western capitals. Mr Clinton's realism was echoed brutally the next day by the UK foreign secretary. Sudan, Somalia, Bosnia, Angola, said Mr Douglas Hurd. were not crises for the international community, because they were not threats to world peace. They were just tragedies which, by implication, did not require the intervention of the UN. That's the new western policy: no more peacekeeping.</p>

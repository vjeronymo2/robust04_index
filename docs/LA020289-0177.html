			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FIRM SUED OVER LOAN AND ALLEGED LEASE DEAL  </P> <P> The chairman and chief executive of Gradco Systems Inc. has been accused in a  $6-million lawsuit of trying to help negotiate a "usurious" loan and then  backing out of a proposed real estate deal when the loan was rejected.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was filed Jan. 25 in Orange County Superior Court by Richard  Boureston and Alton Laguna Partners, a limited partnership set up to develop  office property for Irvine-based Gradco. Boureston is a general partner in  Alton Laguna.  </P> <P> An attorney for Gradco, Lance Cote of Irvine, said Wednesday that the lawsuit  is "factually and legally meritless. The only reason it was filed was to coerce  Gradco into leasing . . . space."  </P> <P> The complaint contends that Gradco, a manufacturer of paper sorters and  collators for office copiers and printers, backed out of an agreement to lease  office space after Alton Laguna would not agree to a usurious loan that  involved an unusual "facilitation fee."  </P> <P> According to the lawsuit, Gradco Chairman Keith Stewart told Boureston early  last year that he would sign a long-term lease with Boureston's company if  Boureston were to build an office to fit Gradco's needs.  </P> <P> Alton Laguna found a land parcel in the Irvine Spectrum area, which Stewart and  Gradco agreed to lease, the lawsuit states. Gradco negotiated lease terms with  the plaintiffs, who were spending money on the project, the complaint added.  </P> <P> In May, Stewart allegedly told Alton Laguna that Stewart and his attorney  wanted a company called CBB to invest in the development. But Alton Laguna's  lawyers advised against a direct investment for tax reasons and instead  suggested that CBB loan construction funds to Alton Laguna.  </P> <P> Eventually, Gradco's attorney recommended that CBB loan Alton Laguna $3 million  as a portion of the temporary construction loan for the project, the suit  states. When a permanent loan was obtained from traditional lenders, CBB was to  get back its $3 million plus a "facilitation fee" of $1.8 million, or 60% of  the loan amount, according to the suit.  </P> <P> Alton Laguna ultimately decided that it did not need CBB's $3 million. But by  that time, conventional lenders who had been told of the proposed loan "were  suspicious that Stewart had a personal interest in the CBB transaction," the  lawsuit states.  </P> <P> Stewart told Boureston that the Gradco lease of the new building did not hinge  on the CBB loan, the lawsuit states. Even so, shortly after Alton Laguna's  rejection of the loan, Gradco Secretary Newton Lee Jr. told Boureston that  Gradco would not enter into a lease for the new project, according to the suit.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that Gradco, Stewart and Lee acted in bad faith in dealing  with Alton Laguna. It also alleges that Stewart, Lee and CBB conspired to  "suggest that plaintiffs borrow money from CBB for a usurious fee . . . to  acquire new space for Gradco. The fee, once paid, would personally benefit the  individual defendants as well as CBB."  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed by the Irvine law firm of Layman, Jones &amp; Dye, seeks  damages for alleged breach of contract, intentional interference with potential  business advantage and loss of the parcel's increased value. Attorneys for the  plaintiffs declined to comment.  </P></p>

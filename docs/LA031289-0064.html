			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Palestinian uprising cost Israel $666 million in 1988 and nearly wiped out  its economic growth, and it may exact a similar toll this year, a Cabinet  minister was quoted as saying. Gad Yaacobi blamed the losses on higher military  spending, reduced production, lost tourism and a fall-off in foreign  investment. Yaacobi, of the left-leaning Labor Party, was economics minister  until November, when he became communications minister. Israel Radio quoted  Yaacobi as saying that Israel's $35-billion economy grew 1% last year instead  of a forecasted 2.5%. In 1987, it grew 5%. An aide to Yaacobi said the minister  believed the 1988 pattern could be repeated next year.  </P></p>

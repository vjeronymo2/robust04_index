			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV AND SOVIET REFORMS  </P> <P> It never ceases to amaze me just how ignorant our so-called "experts" are when  it concerns current activities within the Soviet Union. Someone who certainly  should know better, RAND-UCLA Soviet study center's Arnold Horelick, is of the  mistaken mind-set that the Soviet Union is a single country. His statements are  to the effect that Gorbachev "is responding to the growing chaos . . . to get  some stability and order into the country" (my emphasis). If Horelick did his  homework, he would know that there never existed any stability at all since  Russians forced themselves into their neighboring countries. I know that  Horelick is referring to rising nationalism. But this is nothing new. Since  1917, when the new Russian empire emerged, there have been nationalist  uprisings continuously -- some on a large-scale and some on a small-scale. Our  well-informed Western press chose not to publicize this.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union was established on an extremely shaky foundation. Frankly,  there is no foundation at all. Because this "union" consists of forceably  unwilling participants, chaos is simply the nature of things. The more  restrictive the Russian government gets with their charges, the more massive  the nationalist demonstrations. The Russians can use more powerful tear gas or  truncheons, but this just results in a better organized demonstration.  </P> <P> If the Russians had any smarts (and they don't), they would stop beating the  proverbial "dead horse" and give up control of those who will not respond to  their bidding. If they do respond, it will be with stronger demonstrations and  violence.  </P> <P> STEVE RITTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

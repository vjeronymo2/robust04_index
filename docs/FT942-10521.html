			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Transamerica in Dollars 200m share buy-back move Transamerica, the San Francisco-based financial services group, is planning to buy back 4.5m of its shares in a deal worth more than Dollars 200m. Like other financial services stocks, Transamerica has been hit by rising interest rates in recent weeks. Its shares ended last week at Dollars 51 1/8 , down from a high of Dollars 62 3/8 . News of the buy-back spurred a rise in the stock in New York yesterday morning, to Dollars 52 5/8 . The company announced a Dutch auction for the stock, under which holders are being invited to tender their shares at between Dollars 48 and Dollars 55. Transamerica will then pay a single price for the stock it buys, set at the lowest level which allows it to reach its target of 4.5m shares. The offer remains open until June 6. Standard &amp; Poor's, the ratings agency, said the company's capital structure would remain strong even after paying out cash for the shares, and reaffirmed its single-A senior debt rating for the group.</p>

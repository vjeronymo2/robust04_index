			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Queens Moat move surprised banks QUEENS Moat Houses, which on Wednesday suspended its shares because of its concerns that it had run into financial difficulties, had given no inkling to its bankers of problems only a week ago, when it was negotiating a new DM750m (Pounds 320m) borrowing facility. The astonishingly rapid reversal in Queens Moat's view of its financial prospects emerged yesterday, as the group's banks appointed Grant Thornton, the accountants, to investigate why the hotel group has run into financial difficulties. The banks have asked for a report in seven days from Grant Thornton's investigators, who went into Queens Moat's offices at 8.30am yesterday. A full meeting of the hotel group's 45 banks, led by National Westminster and Barclays, will be held as soon as the initial report is completed, probably at the end of next week. 'I have never known a corporate crisis erupt so quickly,' a banker said. Another banker said he was still waiting for a 'cogent explanation' from the company. Bankers said yesterday that they would insist on management changes at the company. They were negotiating with Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman, and Mr David Hersey, finance director, on the terms of a new DM750m borrowing facility, called a multi-option facility. A banker said that there had been no indication during these talks that the group's 1992 profits might be different from analysts' forecast of around Pounds 80m before tax. However bankers now fear that the group may have made no profit at all last year. One banker said that the change in the group's view of its prospects was the result of work by its founder and chairman, Mr John Bairstow. He had started to become more actively involved in the group last summer, having had a less direct involvement for a period. Mr Bairstow is understood to have reviewed the group's accounting policies and the valuation of its assets. Queens Moat did not tell its merchant bank adviser, Charterhouse, that it was in financial difficulties until Tuesday afternoon. The following day, its shares were suspended on the stock exchange and the group cancelled the payment of a dividend on preference shares. Queens Moat has debt of more than Pounds 1bn, including an off-balance sheet exposure which at the end of 1991 was Pounds 133m. The group has to repay Pounds 658m of its debt within the next year. Bankers said they would probably insist that Queens Moat comes up with a plan to reduce debt by selling assets. Background, Page 18</p>

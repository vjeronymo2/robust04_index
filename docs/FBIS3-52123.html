			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Dec (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has revealed that the security forces thwarted many  dangerous terrorist operations that were supposed to be  implemented on New Year's Eve, including an attempt to  assassinate about 12 political, media, information, and police  figures. Some current ministers were among those targeted.    In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM that will be  published tomorrow, Friday, al-Alfi said the security forces  seized some maps and sketches of the routes followed by the  individuals the terrorists were told to assassinate and the  methods of attack, which have been thwarted.    Hasan al-Alfi said that New Year's Eve was supposed to  witness huge explosions near eight large economic centers. He  explained that one of the masterminds who planned and arranged  the implementation of these operations was the amir of  al-Badari, who was killed in a confrontation with the police  yesterday.    Commenting on the role of foreigners in planning and  financing these terrorist operations in Egypt, the interior  minister referred to four foreign and Arab countries, without  identifying them by name. He said these countries remain silent  about terrorist training courses given inside camps on their  territories, help in collecting donations, and conduct  clandestine and coded communications with the persons in charge  of carrying out operations inside Egypt.    The interior minister asserted that no less than 10 of the  most dangerous al-Jihad and Islamic Group leaders plan,  organize, and give orders to implement the operations. Al-Alfi  added that there are intensive contacts with those countries to  settle this dangerous situation. He explained that the training  courses last at least six months and that every member who is  instructed to carry out an operation is financed with $5,000,  rising to $15,000 for some operations which have been uncovered.    At the conclusion of his interview with AL-AHRAM, the  interior minister affirmed that no indiscriminate arrests have  been made. This is proved by the fact that the defendants who  were tried recently had rulings handed down against them. They  are all active in terrorist operations and their confessions are  full.</p>

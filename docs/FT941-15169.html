			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / MPs to probe aid offer and arms sale The Commons public accounts committee will today investigate a controversial deal signed by the government in the late 1980s to construct a power station on Malaysia's Pergau river. It will investigate why ministers overruled advice from civil servants and spent Pounds 234m helping to build a 600MW hydro-electric power station. The aid package was the largest amount ever spent by the government on a single overseas development project. Last October the National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, reported that the 'the economic viability of the project . . . was marginal' and that it was 'a very bad buy'. It also revealed that ministers had overruled the advice of Sir Timothy Lankester, the permanent secretary at the Overseas Development Agency, who had advised against supporting the project. MPs will today question Sir Timothy about why he advised ministers not to agree to the deal. In particular, some MPs have expressed concern that the aid project might have been linked to a sale of military equipment to the Malaysian government, which would have been illegal. At roughly the same time as the aid package was agreed, the Malaysian government agreed to buy Pounds 1bn worth of Tornado jet fighters and other military equipment from the UK. Under the 1966 Overseas Aid Act, it is illegal for ministers to use aid as a means of securing defence sales. In July 1988 Mr George (now Lord) Younger, then defence secretary, sent a memorandum to the Malaysian government emphasising that there was no linkage between the arms deal and the offer of aid. The Foreign Office has also repeatedly denied that there was any link between the two deals. It is understood though that, prior to the memorandum, documents were exchanged by the the British and Malaysian authorities linking the arms deal with a general offer of aid. Committee members doubt that they they will be able to question Sir Timothy today on whether there was any link between the deals. Its rules allow members to ask questions requiring a factual response, but they cannot ask ministers or permanent civil servants about broad policy issues.</p>

			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Inter-union row simmers at GCHQ - A Labour election victory might spark a dispute over the intelligence centre's staff GCHQ, the Cheltenham intelligence centre where the government banned unions in 1984, might be the centre of an embarrassing inter-union dispute if Labour won the general election and restored the right of union membership. The four Civil Service unions, which would again be free to recruit - and probably to negotiate for - the 3,000-plus staff, would be likely to face a challenge from the EETPU electricians' union, which has a close relationship with the GCHQ staff federation. Mr Brian Moore, chairman of the GCHQ staff federation, said at the weekend that if the federation faced political pressure to dissolve itself and make way for the returning Civil Service unions, it would 'seriously consider' joining the EETPU. The staff federation receives support from the EETPU for services such as training and the printing of its magazine. It has been warned by the government not to create a formal link with the electricians. If Labour lifted the union ban the staff federation, which claims 54 per cent of staff as members, would be in a strong position to retain the loyalty of many GCHQ civil servants, especially if it had the backing of a highly professional, national union. The federation has been refused a certificate of independence as a trade union because its activities have to be approved by the management. If that no longer applied, it would probably receive a certificate and might try going it alone with only a 'consultative' relationship with the EETPU. The EETPU is outside the TUC but is likely to rejoin as part of its merger with the AEU engineering union. There is little love lost between the GCHQ staff federation and the TUC-affiliated Civil Service unions, which on Saturday held their eighth annual protest in Cheltenham against the union ban. An inter-union dispute after a Labour victory would be an embarrassment to a Labour government, especially if the Civil Service unions were given negotiating rights but then failed to recruit many members. The Civil Service unions would probably have a better chance of recruiting more members from the rather conservative GCHQ staff if they could agree that only one Civil Service union would return to the intelligence centre. That idea was floated by some of the unions but has broken down after a disagreement between the NUCPS and IPMS, the two biggest recruiters of GCHQ grades. Those two unions, the CPSA and FDA will probably all claim negotiating rights. The Civil Service unions have also failed to agree whether to offer a no-disruption guarantee to a Labour government, in spite of having made an verbal offer to that effect to the Conservatives. Labour remains strongly committed to restoring union rights at GCHQ.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD ALPINE SKI CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> AMERICAN PAM FLETCHER FIGURES AS THREAT IN DOWNHILL  </P> <P> It's all downhill at the World Alpine Ski Championships for the rest of this  week.  </P> <P> Competitors from every major skiing nation in the world -- and some not so  major -- made their first official training runs down the high-speed courses at  Vail and Beaver Creek Tuesday, and as usual, it was difficult to tell which  racers were going all out and which were just trying to get the feel of the  best line, or applying the brakes at the bottom to sandbag their times.  </P> <P> However, Pam Fletcher of the U.S. ski team, who obviously likes the course on  Vail Mountain, showed that she will be a threat in the regular women's downhill  Sunday when she posted the second fastest time in the afternoon, after being  eighth in the morning.  </P> <P> Fletcher, who turned 26 Monday, won a World Cup downhill here in 1986 and  finished third in '87. She broke her right leg in a collision with a course  worker just before the '88 Olympic downhill at Calgary and has been slow in  regaining her form.  </P> <P> However, she said Tuesday: "I'm skiing the best I can right now. The knee isn't  perfect, but it's not really bothering me either. I'll just give it all I've  got."  </P> <P> The men's course at Beaver Creek drew conflicting comments from the Swiss  skiers who finished 1-2 at Calgary. Peter Mueller, the silver medalist, said  that the organizers had taken out too many bumps since last March's World Cup  race and claimed, "It's too easy now."  </P> <P> But Pirmin Zurbriggen, the Olympic gold medalist, disagreed, saying, "It's  good, I like it. They took the bumps out of the flats, but there are still  plenty of other jumps."  </P> <P> Zurbriggen hopes to be able to ski faster than his main rival, Marc Girardelli  of Luxembourg, in the men's combined downhill Friday and take the combined  medal, although Girardelli holds a comfortable lead after Monday's combined  slalom. Girardelli was third in the slalom and Zurbriggen 11th, but the  difference in their times was only .78 of a second, not an insurmountable  margin under the complicated scoring system used to determine combined  placings.  </P> <P> The two will also be among the favorites in the regular men's downhill  Saturday.  </P> <P> In the women's combined event, which will wind up with the combined downhill  Thursday, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, who has been nearly invincible in  World Cup technical events so far this winter, will be trying to hold off the  challenge of America's Tamara McKinney.  </P> <P> They were 1-2 in the combined slalom, separated by just .12 of a second, and  were relatively close to each other in Tuesday's downhill practice times.  </P> <P> Downhill training will continue today for both men and women.  </P> <P> A huge turnout of spectators is expected to make the trip through the  Eisenhower Tunnel and over Vail Pass from Denver for the two regular downhill  races this weekend.  </P> <P> Then, the schedule calls for the women's slalom Monday, the men's super-G  Tuesday, the women's super-G next Wednesday and the men's giant slalom next  Thursday, followed by an open day. The women's giant slalom and the men's  slalom are set for the final weekend, Feb. 11-12.  </P> <P> The organizing committee announced Tuesday that no safety violations were  involved Monday in the accidental death of the Duke of Cadiz, Alfonso de Borbon  of Spain.  </P> <P> However, Eagle County Sheriff A.J. Johnson refused to support or refute those  contentions until he completes his investigation of the accident. Johnson said  that the investigation would take about one month.  </P> <P> The duke, 52, a first cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain and an official of  the International Skiing Federation (FIS), was killed when he skied into cables  supporting the finish banner at the bottom of the men's downhill course at  Beaver Creek.  </P></p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Fears on jobless training scheme CONCERN that recently unemployed people who want training in skill shortage areas are to be denied access to the government's new training and work experience scheme has been expressed in a report by Full Employment UK, the consultancy and training company. The Training for Work scheme, announced last month by Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, will combine Employment Training and Employment Action, the work experience scheme. The report, drawn up after consultation with Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and Wales, broadly welcomed the new scheme. It said the eligibility rules were relatively wide, but it criticised the exclusion of people who had been unemployed for less than six months - currently 18 per cent of entrants to ET. The report also said that the new Jobplan workshops, which will be run by the department's Employment Service and which people unemployed for 12 months will have to attend, could be used to dump people on the new scheme. The level of awareness in the leisure industry of the new national vocational qualifications is generally poor, a survey of over 70 companies employing 260,000 people says. In the survey, conducted by consultant Mrs Janet Salmon between July and November, 35 per cent of respondents were implementing pilot NVQ programmes and 24 per cent had plans to introduce them. But 41 per cent said they did not intend to implement them. Reasons included the 'prohibitive costs' of certification and claims that existing training was at a higher, more comprehensive standard.</p>

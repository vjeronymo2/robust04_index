			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Caution on 'grey area' in tendering: Guidelines on contracting out GOVERNMENT departments have been advised to take legal advice every time work is put out to tender to determine whether the contract will be covered by European Community laws protecting the jobs and conditions of employees in mergers and acquisitions. The Cabinet Office expects to issue guidance in the next few months on the application to market-testing of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) 1981 regulations. The regulations implement the EC's 1977 acquired rights directive that decisions in the European Court of Justice extend to contracting out of some public services. When the Tupe regulations apply the contractor must take over employees on their existing terms and conditions. The 50-fold increase in the government's market-testing programme has led to widespread confusion in departments over when the regulations apply. The Cabinet Office guidance will seek to clarify when the Tupe regulations apply to contracting out. It is also co-ordinating the legal advice given to departments through a group of departmental lawyers meeting under the aegis of the Treasury solicitor. Officials believe there remains a grey area in which it is difficult to predict whether the regulations apply. The Cabinet Office therefore recommends that legal advice be sought on each department's market-testing programme case by case. There are no plans to indemnify contractors who win contracts believing that the regulations do not apply and subsequently find they do. Lawyers specialising in employment law have recommended such indemnities to protect contractors from uncertainties over the regulations' scope. Britain's largest local authority, Strathclyde regional council, has decided to specify that the Tupe regulations apply to all contracts compulsorily tendered competitively. The Department of National Heritage has signed an agreement with Sema Group to provide all the information technology for the new department. The Pounds 3m a year contract is believed to be the first time a government department has completely out-sourced its IT function.</p>

			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / CAA chief attacks airline subsidies THE CIVIL Aviation Authority yesterday opposed calls for more state aid for financially-troubled European airlines, adding its voice to the growing debate over government subsidies for the industry. Mr Christopher Chataway, CAA chairman, said state subsidies were against the consumer's interest and threatened to undermine the European Commission's 'open skies' policy. A committee of EC 'wise men' is investigating the problems facing the industry and is expected to make recommendations by the end of this year. The UK is fighting against proposals from other European countries, including France and Belgium, to provide EC funds to assist airlines in the recession, as well as a temporary freeze on capacity and fares. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, has also attacked efforts by some EC member countries to re-regulate the European aviation market. Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman, recently told the wise men that restructuring should be allowed to proceed so that airlines can either improve efficiency and competitiveness or, if they fail, go out of business. 'Clearly some further transitional help is going to be given to some airlines who are faced with the need to make big cost reductions,' Mr Chataway said. 'What is important is to ensure that any further short term aid has only a short term effect.' Strict conditions and limitations should be introduced to ensure that any state support to an airline did not distort the longer term future of EC aviation, he said. The liberalisation of the market had already yielded some tangible, though limited, results and had acted as an incentive to many airlines to reduce costs, Mr Chataway argued. The EC reforms, in the longer term, would help stimulate competition. But this would not happen if subsidies were allowed to distort the market. Even when Europe emerged from its longest post-war recession, Mr Chataway believed any increase in competition was unlikely to be on a comparable scale with what occurred after airline deregulation in the US.</p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> SITE APPROVED FOR COMMUNITY CENTER  </P> <P> The City Council this week unanimously approved the southwest corner of Casa  Loma Avenue and Imperial Highway as the site of a $5.2-million community  center.  </P> <P> The center, which was proposed in 1987, was originally planned for the grounds  of the Yorba Linda Middle School.  </P> <P> But after objections from the Placentia Unified School District, the council  decided to search for another site.  </P> <P> A report by Steve Rudometkin, director of parks and recreation, said the plan  for the center calls for the expansion of the adjacent Hurless Barton Park onto  the four-acre site.  </P> <P> Councilman Irwin M. Fried said including the park expansion into the plan "is  an imaginative, innovative approach."  </P> <P> "This is an exciting project, and I am very pleased with it," Councilman Roland  E. Bigonger said.  </P> <P> The 26,000-square foot community center is being designed for the use of senior  citizens, nonprofit organizations, the Yorba Linda Woman's Club and city  recreation classes. LINDA M. HICKMAN  </P></p>

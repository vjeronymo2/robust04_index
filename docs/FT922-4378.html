			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / Miners offer pit buyout plans REDUNDANT miners from Thurcroft Colliery in South Yorkshire, which closed in December, will today present British Coal with plans for a buyout to save the pit. The proposal follows an employee buyout of Monktonhall colliery in Scotland last month. If the Thurcroft plan succeeds, it will be seen as confirmation that buyouts are an option for doomed pits.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A loan for a struggling son MY SON recently qualified as a medical practitioner. Like many students he ran up bank debts while studying, and is still struggling to meet them. His grandmother wishes to help by paying off these debts and replacing them with a family loan, to be repaid at a low rate of interest. How would the tax office view such an arrangement? Is there a better way of helping him? The sum in question is Pounds 4,000. Your mother (or mother-in-law) will be assessable on the interest, subject to the oddities of the preceding-year basis if the loan lasts for more than about four years. Your son will get no tax relief for the interest. The terms of the loan (including the fact that it is repayable on demand) should be set out in a letter in duplicate, one copy of which your son should sign and return to his grandmother for safe keeping with her personal papers (so her executors will be aware of the loan if it is still outstanding at the time of her death). She may wish to have a formal loan agreement drawn up by her solicitor. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFICA: THE LISTENER IN THE HEARINGS ROOM;  </P> <P> RADIO: THE NONPROFIT BROADCASTER IS THE ONLY OUTLET TO CARRY THE 'KEATING FIVE'  PROCEEDINGS FROM BEGINNING TO END.  </P> <P> Pacifica Radio's Dennis Bernstein says that when he got into the thick of  investigating the savings and loan scandal, he was followed through the streets  of Houston by an unmarked car and received death threats after broadcasting  reports in San Francisco and New York.  </P> <P> Now the reporter and commentator is on the air daily with the story, as  Pacifica, a Berkeley-based nonprofit community broadcasting organization that  owns and operates KPFK 90.7 FM in the Los Angeles area, is broadcasting live,  gavel-to-gavel coverage of the "Keating Five" Senate Ethics Committee hearings.  </P> <P> This time, Bernstein's critical commentaries reach not only Pacifica's typical  eclectic audience, but people throughout the political spectrum -- who are  listening to the hearings on Pacifica because there's nowhere else to hear  them.  </P> <P> The senators under investigation -- Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of  Ohio, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, and Dennis DeConcini and John McCain of  Arizona -- are accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators in  favor of Charles Keating, the owner of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and  other thrifts who contributed heavily to their campaigns. Keating has been  indicted for fraud in connection with the failure of his thrifts.  </P> <P> The Pacifica coverage, which also includes interviews with committee witnesses,  has attracted participants from staunch Republicans to avowed leftists to its  call-in segments.  </P> <P> "I think (Pacifica) serves a very useful purpose," said William Drummond,  professor and associate dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC  Berkeley, who specializes in radio. "In the Berkeley area where we have KPFA, I  run into people all the time who are talking about what they heard on those  Keating hearings."  </P> <P> Pacifica, which calls itself "free-speech radio" and broadcasts to a network of  five owned and about 30 participating stations, broadcast the Watergate and CIA  oversight hearings in the 1970s, and in recent years the Iran-Contra hearings  and confirmation proceedings for Supreme Court nominees William H. Bork,  Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.  </P> <P> Currently, about 15 stations across the country are pre-empting regular  programming to carry the hearings, including North Hollywood-based KPFK, WBAI  in New York, KPFA in Berkeley and KPFT in Houston.  </P> <P> "I think people living in a democracy need to know how their government works,"  said Lucia Chappelle, program director for KPFK. "Hopefully, more people will  go to the ballot box if they can really understand how this think works day to  day. I really think (running the hearings) sparks more active participation."  </P> <P> Besides C-Span, the not-for-profit cable television service that covers  Congress, Pacifica is the only outlet to broadcast the hearings from beginning  to end.  </P> <P> "The only network there on a regular basis is CBS," said anchor Larry Bensky.  "The rest come depending on who the witness is."  </P> <P> According to Bensky, the coverage has broadened Pacifica's typically narrow  listener base and might account for increased financial contributions to its  admittedly shoestring operations.  </P> <P> During the Iran-Contra hearings, for example, listener contributions went up  $500,000, nearly 25% of its $4.2 million budget.  </P> <P> "We don't always (participate in ratings services like) Arbitron, but because  we're listener-sponsored, it's easy to tell when the audience increases,  because revenues go up directly," said David Salnicker, Pacifica executive  director.  </P> <P> The current budget is so low that Bensky, a winner of the George Polk Award who  lives in Berkeley, must stay with friends and pay all of his own expenses while  on assignment in Washington. The broadcast booth is a makeshift operation. In  order for callers to hear the answers given by guests and host to their  questions, Bensky and others in the booth must hold a microphone up to the  telephone.  </P> <P> During a program last week which involved listener call-ins and several  prominent guests, the telephone was passed around the room from person to  person for guest responses.  </P> <P> Founded in 1949 by Louis Hill, a disenchanted network journalist and poet,  Pacifica was set up as a pacifist -- hence the name, Pacifica -- alternative to  commercial radio. "There are a lot of Pacifica veterans who are now part of the  broadcast establishment," said UC Berkeley's Drummond.  </P> <P> "(Pacifica) is thought of as being free-form and they never have the money to  do anything, but the content is more in line with what public broadcasting was  intended to do," Drummond said. "They are much more 'alternative' than National  Public Radio."  </P></p>

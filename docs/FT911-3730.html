			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Prokofiev symphonies - Royal Festival Hall One of the most interesting features of the current 'Russian Spring' series on South Bank is the programming on two weekends of all seven Prokofiev symphonies. This is much rarer than it ought to be; and even individually, the fortunes of the symphonies are mixed - the First ('Classical') and Fifth are played a lot, the Sixth slightly less often, and the remaining four very little. In addition, the chance to hear the seven given in chronological order, as the two BBC Philharmonic weekends allow, tells one a great deal not only about the development of an important composer, but much that is central to the whole notion of a 'Russian Spring' in music. For, while Prokofiev may not have been a revolutionary composer in any committed ideological sense, it is in his brilliant, audacious, and copious musical outpourings that we come to appreciate most fully the trends of the immediate pre and post-Revolutionary period. The BBC Philharmonic under Edward Downes played the 'Classical' and the Second on Saturday evening (separated by Nikolay Demidenko's superlatively fine account, technically impeccable, formidable, sparklingly witty, of the First Piano Concerto) and the Third and Fourth on Sunday afternoon (the rest follow, in similar programme divisions and timings, next weekend). The 'Classical' (1916-17) is a jeu d'esprit indicative of the saucy wit and love of 18th-century forms and counterpoint that would stamp Prokofiev all his life. But from there to the Second is a big, fascinating step; and under Downes's sympathetic and knowledgeable guidance it was rewarding to be able to take it. The following three works, all scored for gigantic forces, are stepchildren of the repertory; the Second (1924-5), a piece of steel-and-smoke musical machinery unparalleled in Prokofiev's output, is the most neglected and misunderstood of the trio - unsuccessful at its Paris premiere, apt to be dismissively viewed even now. The title of Mossolov's notorious short ballet, Iron Foundry, could with some aptness serve as its subtitle, though in the second movement, a set of theme and variations, there is relief, of a quietly and mysteriously beautiful kind, from the pounding, braying and chains of dissonances (all of which Downes and his orchestra clarified with masterly patience). The Second is not exactly a decorous or tidy piece of symphonic construction (Prokofiev never got round to revising or re-scoring it, as he planned). But in a carefully considered performance such as we heard on Saturday, the wealth of combative, rhythmically intricate, densely vibrant material it contains can knock an audience sideways. The next two symphonies gained their existence via a different route: both are re-thinkings of existent material, the one operatic, the other balletic, and so it is understandable that both, while no less thunderous at climaxes, should be cleaner and trimmer in their proportions. And both, in their different and more mature ways, seem to mark the most artistically striking point of balance between the 'iconoclastic' Prokofiev and the 'popular'. Both contain extraordinarily rich and exciting invention: their blends of sounds and harmonies - intense, pungent, and sweepingly lyrical by turns - are like no other I know. The Third (1928) is the symphony that Prokofiev drew from the opera The Fiery Angel (which Downes will be conducting - happy news] - at Covent Garden in two seasons' time); the Fourth (1929-30, revised 1947) is an adaptation and extension of material from the ballet The Prodigal Son. Whether or not Prokofiev was a symphonist in the traditionally understood sense is a question that has been hotly debated before, and will no doubt be again; but it seems to me that, particularly in the Third, with its depiction of worlds earthly and demonic, of states of mind 'normal' and wildly out of kilter, a discourse of confronted opposites is very much in the fabric of its four movements. While the Fourth does not grip the listener in quite the same way, the diversity of its sound-worlds - comic-pastoral, sparkishly jazzy, and broadly melodic - is even more immediate in its appeal. I formed the impression, perhaps unjustly, that of all the works on the bill of the first BBCPO weekend, the Fourth had been the one least precisely prepared. There were patches of scrappy ensemble, and it was here that one noticed most often the orchestra's relative narrowness of string tone (the brass played expertly throughout). But in Downes's hands, lack of orchestral inflation was an interpretative feature, and a wholly positive one, of both concerts: while performances of more extravagantly virtuosic, or 'Russian', characterisation are easily imagined, those of more musicianly style and substance can hardly be.

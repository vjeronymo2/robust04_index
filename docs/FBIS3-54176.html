He added that this outcome will  reflect on the overall Middle East peace process as well as on  Syrian-U.S. ties.    Kuriyah went on to say that the outcome of the summit will  also pave the way for the resumption of the peace talks on the  basis of the land for peace principle and UN Resolutions 242,  338, and 425. High-level Syrian sources have informed AL-ITTIHAD  that the next few days will witness intensive meetings in  Damascus. The meeting due to be held between Presidents al-Asad  and al-Hirawi today is expected to be followed by a visit to the  Syrian capital by King Husayn of Jordan, the sources added.    In response to a question by AL-ITTIHAD on the Syrian  position regarding the U.S. proposal to deploy U.S. troops on  the Golan, the sources said that this position is contingent on  Israeli's acceptance to withdraw from all occupied Syrian  territory.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney Sentiment towards Euro Disney has turned so negative in recent months that there is little shock left in its forecast yesterday of a net loss in the current year. All the same, the omens are at first sight scarcely encouraging. Attendance levels may be up on that achieved by other Disney theme parks at a comparable stage, but the company faces an uphill struggle meeting its target of 11m visitors in its first year. That depends on the winter having only a limited seasonal impact on attendance levels, an unlikely prospect when Euro Disney also runs the risk of being caught up in any European economic slowdown resulting from upward pressure on interest rates. This only increases the need for the company to match its expenditure to the level of business it eventually manages to attract. Costs were always bound to be high in the early stages when Euro Disney had to be ready to receive any number of visitors. Only when they have been cut and a clearer pattern is established for visitor levels will it be possible to evaluate earnings prospects and thus the share price. Original expectations look optimistic. But with the shares 40 per cent below their peak in March, there is also a danger of overdoing the pessimism.</p>

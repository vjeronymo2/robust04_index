			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Artesian to seek market listing Artesian Estates, a residential landlord specialising in assured tenancies, yesterday announced plans to float on the stock exchange. It will be the first property company specialising in this type of flexible tenancy to seek a listing. Artesian will have initial assets of Pounds 13.5m, comprising 28 residential properties in London and the south east of England. Most of its properties are let under assured tenancies which give the landlord considerable freedom to increase rents and regain possession. The biggest quoted residential property company is Bradford Property Trust, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds 280m. However, Bradford's business centres on buying properties let under more restrictive regulated tenancies - usually at a discount to reflect the sitting rights of the tenant - and selling when the property becomes vacant. Set up in 1989, Artesian recently came to the end of its five year qualifying period under the Business Expansion Scheme. In all 10 companies bearing the Artesian name have been set up under the BES, the last at the end of 1993, raising Pounds 42m. Initially only the first three companies will be grouped together under the listed holding company. The directors said it was possible that other companies could be reversed into the listed company at a later date. They added that Artesian would consider buying other BES companies where investors were looking for an exit. Falling property prices mean that many similar companies have seen their asset values tumble over the last five years. Artesian has just clawed its way back to the asset value of 1989.</p>

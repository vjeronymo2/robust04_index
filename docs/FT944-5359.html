			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (24): An hour with a lawyer, or do it yourself - Wills In Victorian times, will-writing was one of the great pleasures of old age. Merely the threat of leaving a child, grandchild, nephew or niece out of one's will was enough to guarantee devoted attention - at least temporarily. Sadly, the art of creative will-writing seems largely to have died out. Now, only a third of Britons has a valid will, but with the spread of home ownership and complicated family relationships, this can cause trouble. Wills these days do not have to be gothic structures designed to reward or punish relatives for their actions during your lifetime. They can be simple affairs, involving an hour or so in a lawyer's office, to make sure that your property is passed on to those family members who need it most, and that no unnecessary tax is due. A will also allows you to make guardianship arrangements for your children if both parents should die, appoint executors of your estate, specify any gifts of small items, and say what kind of funeral you want. Making a will is a good idea for everyone, but it is particularly important for certain groups of people: Unmarried couples - under current laws, an unmarried partner has no right to inherit anything. Parents with children from more than one marriage, or stepchildren to whom they would like to leave something. Owners of investments and property (including their home) worth more than the current inheritance tax threshold of Pounds 154,000. Anyone with dependants who have special needs, such as incapacitated elderly parents or handicapped children: particular provision must be made for them. A will should be reviewed regularly every few years, but particularly if you have recently married, separated, divorced, acquired children or grandchildren, or experienced a significant change in your financial circumstances. Making a will is not expensive - but dying without one can be. A simple will should cost about Pounds 50; expect to pay more if you need trust arrangements or other more complicated services. Who should write it for you? The obvious choice is a solicitor - most local firms will have drawn up hundreds of wills and can deal with most requests. Ask family and friends for recommendations if you do not have a solicitor. There are many will-writing services which offer to draw up a will for less than a solicitor would charge. However, no qualifications are necessary to run this kind of service, and training is sometimes rudimentary - so using a qualified lawyer is generally safer. Do-it-yourself forms from stationers are the cheapest method, but cannot cope with anything but the simplest circumstances. And it is only too easy to make mistakes which may not be discovered until after your death. Banks, building societies and insurance companies sometimes also offer will-writing services, but these can be accompanied by a hard sell for life assurance, or pressure to name the bank as executor of the will, which can prove extremely expensive.</p>

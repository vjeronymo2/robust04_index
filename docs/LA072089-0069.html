			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE COUNCIL AGAIN DEFERS ZONING CHANGES  </P> <P> After about an hour of deliberation, the Glendale City Council on Tuesday  postponed for the 12th time acting on a zoning ordinance that would reduce the  size and require more landscaping and amenities at all new apartments and  condominiums in the city.  </P> <P> Council members have embarked on their third item-by-item review of the draft  ordinance. Mayor Jerold Milner said the council is being "extra careful in  making sure we don't leave any loopholes for the developers to beat the  system."  </P> <P> The proposed ordinance was drafted in September by the city's planning staff.  After a lengthy public hearing process, it was introduced in the council in  February.  </P> <P> All five council members have said they agree in principle on the ordinance,  but as of Tuesday they were still instructing the staff to consider making  minor changes.  </P></p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Simpler - and less risky - Personal Equity Plans UNIT and investment trusts at last got the concession they wanted from the chancellor this week. Personal equity plans based on the two types of collective investment will now qualify for the full Pounds 6,000 annual allowance instead of the previous Pounds 3,000 limit. Although the change was not in the Finance Act, the government used its powers to push through this measure, which will come into force next month at the start of the new tax year. A change in Pep rules might not win any votes but it certainly seems one of the chancellor's most sensible moves. It seemed strange for the government to encourage small investors to take the risk of buying a small number of individual equities, rather than obtaining the built-in spread of a unit or investment trust. Any trust with 50 per cent of its funds in shares in EC member states will now qualify for the Pounds 6,000 allowance. This will slow the stream of investment trust launches, which were designed to take advantage of the fact that new issues were previously the only means of qualifying for the Pounds 6,000 allowance. Why put Pounds 6,000 into a new issue trust and pay 100p for what, after costs, could well be 95p or 96p of assets? If you buy an existing trust on a discount to its asset value, you can pay 90p for, say, 100p of assets and can keep all the tax advantages. This might take some of the shine off M&amp;G's present offer for its Recovery trust. Admittedly, investors have no less incentive to put Pounds 6,000 into the trust to cover this year's Pep allowance. But the incentive to put in a further Pounds 6,000 to cover the 1992-93 Pep allowance is much reduced. There might also be a decline in the popularity of managed Peps where stockbrokers or other plan managers pick a Pounds 6,000 portfolio of shares for investors. Performance records for such Peps are difficult to come by, unlike unit and investment trusts where statistics are available widely. 'It will make comparing performance a lot easier,' says Roz Barder of Chase de Vere. Nor will there be much need for the 'top-up' Peps in which a sprinkling of blue chips was added to a Pounds 3,000 holding in a unit or investment trust to make full use of the Pounds 6,000 allowance. 'I expect a lot of managers will just offer a full Pounds 6,000 unit or investment trust Pep and not bother with shares,' says Barder. The change will also simplify the over-complicated Pep rules. There will in future be only three annual limits: Pounds 6,000 for the vast majority of Peps; Pounds 1,500 for 'non-qualifying' unit and investment trust Peps (those with less than half their funds in EC member states); and Pounds 3,000 for the single company plan, which can be taken out in addition to another Pep. Sadly, this still means that the biggest investment trust, Foreign &amp; Colonial IT, will qualify for only a Pounds 1,500 allowance because of its heavy non-EC weighting. But investors will now be able to put Pounds 6,000 in Foreign &amp; Colonial's German Investment trust and its Eurotrust. Other unit and investment trust companies were quick to announce their plans to take advantage of the Budget change. SGTR (Societe Generale Touche Remnant) said at least three of its unit trusts would be on offer: European Special Situations, General Growth and Income Growth. Schroders said it would offer a 1992-93 Pep allowing investors to put Pounds 6,000 into up to three of a range of six trusts. Fidelity will be offering nine Peps, each linked to a unit or investment trust. None will have any additional charges, and Fidelity will not make a charge for accepting transfers of existing Peps. The nine trusts are UK Growth, Special Situations, Recovery, Growth &amp; Income, Income Plus, European, 1992 European Opportunities, European Values Investment and the International Pep. Fund managers' reaction to the Budget generally was positive with Philip Warland, director-general of the Unit Trust Association, describing it as 'a great boost for the industry.' In recent months, the stream of investment trust new issues had rather left unit trusts on the sidelines. There could be benefits for investors, too. Haydn Green, of the Nottingham-based Pep Shop, says: 'Extending the unit trust limit to Pounds 6,000 will enable unit trust management groups to reduce their costs substantially. 'Our initial feedback indicates that very many unit trust groups are prepared to reduce their bid-offer spreads to under 1.5 per cent, providing the broker cedes his commission. After April 6, front-end loads will rapidly become a thing of the past as far as Peps are concerned.'</p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 10 (CNA) -- Chang Hsiao-yen, minister  of the cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC),  said Thursday [10 March] that the commission will place emphasis  on coordinating the economic strength of all Chinese and  strengthening service to overseas Chinese communities.    Chang made the remark during a meeting of the Legislative  Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.    The combined assets of Chinese traders could rival those of  the United States, Japan, and Germany, he stressed. Chang  quoted the economist magazine which reported that Chinese  businessmen outside Mainland China hold US$1.5-2.0 trillion in  liquid assets.    Taiwan's economic development could provide a sound basis  for  business links between domestic and overseas Chinese traders, he  elaborated.    Moreover, he noted, the commission must do its part to boost  cooperation with overseas Chinese in order to deter Beijing's  "united front" tactics, which has drawn more than US$6 billion  worth of investment to Mainland China.    And to meet the growing demand for Chinese-language  instruction among overseas Chinese, the OCAC will set up "Taipei  schools" in areas with large overseas Chinese communities.    The minister said he has visited 112 Overseas Chinese  communities in the United States, Britain, France, Belgium,  Holland, Spain, South Africa, the Philippines, Thailand, Hong  Kong, Macao, and Japan since he assumed his office a year ago,  and is planning to go to Canada, Australia, and Latin America in  the near future.</p>

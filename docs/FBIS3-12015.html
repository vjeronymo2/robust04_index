			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Upon Awakening" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] The PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] has  issued several press bulletins. One of the press bulletins is  on the meeting in Tijuana, Baja California, on the day Luis  Donaldo Colosio was assassinated; another one on the activities  being carried out to choose the new PRI presidential candidate;  and the third issued last night by the PRI National Political  Council. [passage omitted on details of bulletin on incidents in  Tijuana covered by referent item]    The second press bulletin states that the PRI continues to  maintain unity among its sectors, organizations, and members. It  adds that the party is continuing with the various tasks that it  must conduct as a political party. The PRI reiterates that it  has yet to establish the date and hour for a meeting of the  National Executive Committee or the National Political Council  to begin the internal procedures to choose a new presidential  candidate. The press bulletin adds that as soon as the National  Executive Commission decides to begin the internal procedures  for the selection of a new candidate, the people will be  informed through the media. These bulletins were released  yesterday.    Members of the National Political Council issued a third  press bulletin. In the bulletin, the members state that: In  light of the rumors regarding hypothetical changes and reforms  to Article 82 of the Constitution and postponing the date for  the federal elections, we publicly express our disagreement to  said changes. In other words, the PRI National Political Council  bulletin states that they are opposed to possible changes to  Article 82 of the Constitution or other articles dealing with  the possibility of postponing the date of the federal elections  scheduled for 21 August. The bulletin adds: We reiterate our  determination that the electoral process under way be conducted  according to the Constitution and the law in the hopes that the  state of law and the democratic principles that encourage us  will be respected. The members of the National Political Council  add in their bulletin: Once again, we reiterate our firm  determination that the party, despite the sorrow it experiences,  will maintain its obligation and unity to the commitments made  by Luis Donaldo Colosio and supports the Mexican people's  demands that justice be done. Those are the three press  bulletins released yesterday by the PRI.</p>

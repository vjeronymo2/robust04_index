			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Property: Increasing gulf in London commercial market, says survey The recovery of the London market will be marked by a widening gulf between the performance of top-quality sites and secondary properties, according to a forecast by Savills, commercial property agents. Over the next three years, Savills predicts a 15 per cent annual increase in rates for top-grade space in the City to an average Pounds 46 per square foot, and a 12 per cent annual rise in the West End to an average Pounds 51 per sq ft. After 1997, City rents are likely to dip in the face of competition from London docklands, where improved transport links are likely to enhance the area's appeal. Savills' calculations assume a stable economic background. It also assumes that most take-up will result from tenants leaving old offices for new ones, rather than from expansion. The lack of net take-up of space means that overall vacancy levels of about 10 per cent look set to become a permanent feature of the market. 'The London market is becoming increasingly polarised. There is an oversupply of obsolescent secondary space, much of which may not be re-occupied unless redeveloped or converted to alternative use,' Savills said. The agent argues that tenants prefer modern buildings with floor space of at least 5,000 sq ft because such buildings can accommodate computer cabling and therefore improve internal communications. Such grade 'A' space accounts for 43 per cent of the City market, 90 per cent of the docklands market and just 13 per cent of the West End market. Grade 'A' space accounts for only 6.5 per cent of total stock and is likely to fall to 2 per cent within three years. After 1997, the development market is likely to pick up. Improved infrastructure, such as the Jubilee Line extension to docklands and the Paddington/Heathrow rail link, is likely to make docklands and Paddington popular destinations for tenants.</p>

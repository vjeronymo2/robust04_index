			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Sharp rise in company failures BUSINESS failures in the third quarter of this year rose by 53 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year, according to figures released today. They highlight the continuing sharp impact of the recession, especially on smaller companies. According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a business information company, the 46,545 failures in the first nine months of the year means the total figure for 1991 has almost been surpassed already. In the third quarter, 15,823 businesses failed, compared with 10,371 in the corresponding period last year. The total for the first nine months was 39 per cent up on the 33,532 recorded during the January-September period in 1991. Last year saw 47,777 business failures, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet. That itself was the biggest number recorded by the company since it started keeping the statistics in 1980. Since the start of this year, on average, more than 1,220 businesses have collapsed each week. Of the total, two out of three have been bankruptcies of partnerships or traders, indicating how small businesses have suffered worse in the recession than big ones. The rest of the failures have mainly been liquidations of relatively large limited companies. Dun &amp; Bradstreet says many small companies have been forced to go under because of the chain reaction of cuts in orders from large companies and 'harsh competitive conditions' caused by high interest rates and large company debts. It says the weak state of the economy seems likely to 'continue to devastate the small-business community' for some time. The south-east, excluding London, has accounted for roughly a quarter of the business failures so far this year. The total of 10,375 in the region represents an increase of more than 50 per cent on the equivalent period last year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From May 17, PAEVALEHT, p 9; "News Bulletin" No. 94] </F>   [Text] Estonia's most efficient major firms are based on  private capital, Finance Ministry section head Toivo Mungel told  a news conference yesterday.    The fifty most successful firms were chosen according to  seven main indicators, including circulation, profit,  profitability, growth rate and export potential, he explained.  The role of wood processing is increasing while that of metal  trading and processing has started to decrease, Mungel said. He  pointed out that the food industry is stable, but the share of  high-technology production needs to be increased.    The average growth rate of export was 7 per cent per month  in  1993, Mungel told the news conference, adding that the top 50  also included a one-man firm.</p>

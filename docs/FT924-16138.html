			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Schlesinger rebuts British criticism  -The German central bank chief states his case / Then the UK Treasury again joins the fray THE following statement was released yesterday morning by the German embassy in London: Comments by Bundesbank president Professor Dr Helmut Schlesinger on reproaches made by some members of the British government. 1. Alleged indiscretions on the part of the Bundesbank. In my interview with the German economic journal Handelsblatt, I expressly excluded the UK currency from being endangered. (The interview is reproduced in detail in the Handelsblatt of September 17, 1992: 'Schlesinger does not consider the situation of other currencies to be so critical. 'He mentions the pound sterling, which has been under particularly heavy pressure during the past few days. After all, he says, the British have monetary reserves to enable them to defend sterling. Their situation is not comparable to that of Italy. 'It seems to me that the EMS has strengthened following the measures taken last weekend'.') I would also draw attention to the fact that my colleague Dr Hans Tietmeyer expressly supported the pound in public statements. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Dr Tietmeyer said on September 14, 1992: Question: 'Do you consider a realignment of sterling to be necessary at present? Sterling is still the sick man of the EMS.' Answer: 'No. The British have already decided to defend the exchange rate, and have taken the appropriate measures to that end.' (See also the identical Reuters reports of the same date.) The Bundesbank cannot be blamed for anonymous statements, rumours emanating from market participants, inaccurate reproductions of statements by newspapers; I reject all such statements. 2. The charge of lack of support for sterling in the foreign exchange market by the Bundesbank. With regard to support operations in the foreign exchange market, the Bundesbank treated the pound sterling and the French franc alike in all respects. In this context, I may give you the following supplementary information: The Bundesbank agreed to sizeable credit tranches denominated in D-Marks as part of the borrowing operations by the UK Treasury. Moreover, it granted the Bank of England a swap credit and also agreed to prolong this swap arrangement. The Bundesbank invariably agreed, as required under the EMS agreement, to intramarginal D-Mark sales by the Bank of England, and also bought sterling intramarginally in the market itself. The Bank of England did not ask the Bundesbank to take any measures going beyond this. After the UK currency had reached its lower intervention point, the Bundesbank financed the requisite compulsory interventions in full. The total amount of compulsory D-Mark sales in support of EMS currencies during the week in which sterling and the Italian lira temporarily left the system came to over DM44bn, the greater part of which was accounted for by interventions vis-a-vis sterling. The compulsory D-Mark sales in favour of sterling which we financed constitute by far the largest compulsory interventions ever undertaken vis-a-vis a partner currency. With respect to the support granted to sterling, the instruments used were just the same as in the case of the support accorded to the French franc, with the exception of the compulsory D-Mark sales, which did not take place, because the French franc failed to reach the lower intervention point. The high level of intervention in favour of sterling was primarily due to the fact that the UK monetary authorities seem to have been prepared to allow sterling to fall to its lower intervention point. The Banque de France, by contrast, concentrated on keeping the franc rate above its intervention point by means of intramarginal interventions. The Bundesbank drew the logical consequences for its own monetary policy from the realignment in the EMS, and adjusted German central bank rates downwards as early as September 14, 1992. Already on the occasion of its interest rate decisions of last July, the Bundesbank took care not to raise its internationally relevant interest rate (the Lombard rate). Since that time, interest rates in the German money market have fallen by over one-half of a percentage point. The measures designed to reduce tensions in the EMS include, pursuant to the EMS agreement, not only intramarginal interventions and interest rate changes but also the realignment of exchange rates. The Bundesbank applied to the federal government on September 11 for negotiations on such a realignment among the group of EMS partners; the federal government complied with this request by initiating negotiations. The outcome is well-known; it was the devaluation of but a single currency, namely the Italian lira, even though, judging by the divergence indicator of the EMS, sterling had overstepped the 'warning mark' of minus 75 already in mid-August.</p>

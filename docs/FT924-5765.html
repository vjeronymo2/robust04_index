			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Restructuring Europe's steel IT HAS been a good week for the EC steel industry. After yesterday's inconclusive meeting of industry ministers, the European Commission still proposes spending more than Pounds 700m on helping steelmakers shut down their surplus capacity. It also aims to impose duties on steel imports from eastern Europe. A central myth of the Community is thus perpetuated: that steel, like agriculture, is different. Other humdrum industries such as brickmaking or engineering can fend for themselves. Steel has a special and mysterious call upon the public purse. The use of taxpayers' money to make good the steel industry's planning errors seems particularly objectionable at a time when individual EC states are already faced with ballooning deficits. The vexing thing is that the alternative could be worse. Nearly half the EC's steel capacity is state owned. In several member states, closing steel plants risks antagonising regional minorities. In the absence of an EC-wide deal, individual states might respond by stepping up their subsidies. If - as seems not impossible - the most heavily subsidised plants were also the least economic, bad capacity could end up driving out good. But if public money is to be spent, the taxpayer is entitled to certain things in return. When the European economy finally revives, the pressure to cut capacity should be maintained. The forecast for underlying steel demand in the mature economies of the EC is flat. There is also less scope for export to developing countries, which are busy building steel mills of their own. It thus cannot be assumed that the industry, if left to itself, will return to prosperity in the next upturn. Indeed, its brief burst of profitability in the late 1980s may well prove an anomaly, based as it was on a quite abnormal boom in the building industry. The main thing is that EC taxpayers should not find themselves footing the bill yet again in the next recession. The other important quid pro quo for taxpayers is that they should not be denied access to steel from eastern Europe. EC steelmakers claim that dumping from Czechoslovakia and Poland is ruining their market. But the eastern share of the EC market is now running at about 5 per cent, which scarcely seems material in the context of EC overcapacity of 30 per cent. As for dumping, the charge is hard to prove when there is no real means of measuring the true cost of eastern European production. And if, as is sometimes alleged, eastern producers are spoiling the market inadvertently by selling their output more cheaply than they need to, the answer is for the western producers to educate them in marketing. The more fundamental point is that eastern Europe needs hard currency if it is to import the equipment necessary to modernise its economies. Steel, along with textiles and agricultural produce, is one of the few things it can export. Part of the strain this imposes on the market is transitory, since a good half of eastern capacity is reckoned to be obsolete. And after all, the most important single way to stave off disaster in the eastern economies is to boost bilateral trade. Steel seems as good a place to start as any.</p>

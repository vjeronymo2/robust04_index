			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / From knee-cappings to normality: Michael Cassell goes on patrol with the RUC Shankill unit in Belfast, where officers face chilling experiences Sgt Ian McKeown points through the bullet-proof windscreen of his patrol car to a graffiti-smeared sculpture at the heart of west Belfast's Hammer estate. 'Looks fair enough by day. But at night, this is where the boys get a bullet through the knee or the calf,' he says. A Royal Ulster Constabulary colleague, crammed in the back of the sergeant's battered blue Escort, explains that the victims turn up by appointment for punishment after offending their paramilitary minders. Not to appear would result in an even messier fate. 'There's one who is supposed to have telephoned the ambulance before he set out, telling them what time to get there,' he says. Humour, at first, might not seem entirely appropriate in such sickening circumstances but its importance quickly becomes apparent as Sgt McKeown - which is not his real name - proceeds with his extraordinary job. As leader of the nine-strong Shankill patrol unit he has an important role in the 350-strong team based behind fortress walls at Tennent Street police station. It is responsible for a territory which offers a cocktail of everyday urban normality and calculating, murderous extremism. One minute a driving offence or a 'domestic', the next a car hijacking or a punishment beating. Tennent Street's patch includes about three square miles of west and north Belfast, predominantly Protestant territory squeezed into a wedge bordered on both sides by republican ghettoes. The IRA launches sorties from the Ardoyne and the Falls while volunteers from the loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force take their orders from command centres on the Highfield estate and the lower Shankill. Protestant and Roman Catholic paramilitaries pass in the night, launching raids into each other's areas. The RUC is caught in the middle, hated not only by the provos but by the loyalists too if they think it is doing its job too well. The Tennent Street subdivision has seen 280 murders since the troubles began more than 20 years ago, 11 of them last year. Nine of those deaths were in the Shankill Road fish and chip shop bombing last October. Sgt McKeown was among the first on the scene. 'Someone said there was a secondary device but no one cared. We had to get them out. It was total chaos,' he recalls quietly. The signatures of 3,200 local people later thanked the police for what they did on that grisly Saturday afternoon. None of Tennent Street's officers have been killed since 1987, though a colleague from a neighbouring area died last week - the first RUC victim of this year - after a rocket attack in Friendly Street. Everyone is horrified, though 293 RUC officers have died on the streets of Northern Ireland since 1969 and people are no longer so easily shocked. Supt Charlie Robinson, Sgt McKeown's boss, has carried two RUC colleagues to their graves. Armed with his Ruger revolver and weighed down by body armour, the sergeant remains philosophical about the risks. He stresses that his job is as much about the everyday task of community policing as it is about nailing paramilitaries. He drives slowly past the derelict Lawnbrook social club, one-time base for the murderous 'Shankill butchers' of the 1970s. The surviving gang members got jail sentences totalling 2,000 years. Sgt McKeown knows by sight a lot of the hard men. As Supt Robinson puts it: 'We stop them all the time. They know you and they know you know them. We have to treat them absolutely correctly, until we catch them at it.' The sergeant also knows all the alleyways and short-cuts and can match endless locations to countless atrocities: 'That's where a young mother was gunned down in the chemist's shop' - 'A Royal Irish Regiment man was killed there with an assault rifle on his way to visit his mother.' On the Crumlin Road he points out the grounds of a chapel, used by the IRA to launch a recent rocket attack on a police vehicle. 'They stick packets of digestive biscuits in the back end (of the rocket launcher) to absorb the shock waves. Can't buy the damn things anywhere in the Ardoyne'. He checks out an old cottage on the upper Crumlin where a woman was kept hostage overnight to ensure her businessman husband handed over cash to terrorists. 'Have to be careful here. It could be wired up. Wouldn't want to buy it.' Sgt McKeown stops in Ligoneil, a republican enclave on his beat, to watch an army 'rummage search' on wasteland for a weapons cache or culvert bombs. 'Almost certainly find something around here, it's a favourite spot.' So why does he do it? His pay packet bulges from endless overtime and is further fattened by the Northern Ireland allowance - 'danger money in any other language'. He has a pride in his work, a great 'crack' with his colleagues, but above all he wants law and order and decency to prevail on the streets where he was born. Things, believe it or not, are getting better. Crime detection is up and among the nation's highest. Terrorist prevention measures are working and the neighbourhood policing strategy is paying dividends. There are no end of applicants ready to join up. Catholics form only about 8 per cent of the total RUC force. In Tennent Street no one knows how many there are because no one asks. 'It's a very happy place in many ways,' says Supt Robinson. 'We try to keep the place as normal as possible.' In April Tennent Street's 20 women officers will, for the first time, go on patrol armed with guns. In Belfast, normality is a difficult concept to grasp.</p>

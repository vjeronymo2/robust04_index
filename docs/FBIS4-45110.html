			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "IMF Demands"] </F>   [Text] The IMF and other foreign economic agencies have  been putting pressure on Pakistan for a long time to reduce  import duty in order the implement the free market concept. When  Moeen Qureshi became the care-taker prime minister, he accepted  this demand immediately and reduced the import duty by 50  percent. The IMF now is demanding the gradual reduction of  import duty and its termination in a few years. Pakistani  economic experts believe that import duty should not be reduced  more that 5 percent at this time because additional reduction  will result in extraordinary reduction in government revenues,  and taxes will have to be increased to make up for this lose.  Since the taxes are already increasing, this additional increase  will be an unbearable burden for the people to carry. The other  aspect of this problem is that the gradual reduction in import  duty will result in flooding our nation with foreign-made goods,  which will hurt our local industries very badly. Our nation will  be transformed into a market for foreign goods to all practical  purposes. This will adversely effect our efforts to make  industrial progress and make our national economy independent.  It is believed that some important and influential persons  support reducing import duty by 15 percent now and totally  removing it later. These foreign agencies make these suggestions  to protect the interests of the nations that give them grants.  The indebted nations seriously consider these suggestions  because of their needs and economic problems. However, they  should keep their own national interests in mind. Against this  background, we hope that while the Pakistani government  considers the IMF demands, it will also protect national  interests.</p>

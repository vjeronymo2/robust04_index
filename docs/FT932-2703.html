			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: Whirlpool Europe sells refrigerator plant WHIRLPOOL Europe, part of the big US white goods group, has agreed to sell its Barcelona refrigerator plant to IAR/Siltal, the fast-growing Italian commercial refrigeration and domestic appliances group. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the deal is significant for both companies. Whirlpool Europe said it reflected implementation of a strategy to rationalise industrial operations to meet customer needs. The Barcelona plant produces 130,000 units a year with 270 employees, and was considered too small to fit Whirlpool's philosophy of large-scale, highly automated manufacture. Whirlpool Europe said this was its first such deal, but others were not excluded. The US-owned company said it had received more attractive offers for the plant, but the deal with IAR/Siltal ensured continuity of operation. IAR/Siltal will acquire full ownership of the plant at the end of July. It will sell part of its output to Whirlpool for distribution in Spain and elsewhere in Europe under a four-year supply contract. The deal represents a big foreign expansion for IAR/Siltal, which has annual revenues of L240bn (Dollars 162m), employs 1,100 people and operates four plants in Italy. Based near Alessandria, it grew fast in the late 1980s through acquisitions.</p>

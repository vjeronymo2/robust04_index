			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong route to reduce unemployment Sir, With reference to your reports ('The Group of Seven summit', July 11) on the G7 summit in Naples, I very much welcome the fact that measures to bring down unemployment have at last been placed high on the international agenda after being spurned repeatedly during the Reagan-Thatcher years. Some of the G7 proposals for job creation are also to be applauded. However, I am concerned that so much emphasis is being placed, at least by the British government, on deregulation of the labour market as a means of achieving reduced unemployment. All the talk of 'reduced labour market rigidities, lower indirect employment costs and fewer regulations' can be translated as lower pay, more precarious employment contracts, worse health and safety and a weakening of social security. If the UK government hopes to convince the world's most advanced economies to adopt the path of deregulation as a means of creating jobs, its track record must surely undermine its credibility. After 15 years of deregulation, privatisation, anti-union laws, reduced employment rights and the growth of low pay, we have 3m unemployed compared to 1m in 1979. The low pay, low skill, low productivity option simply does not produce results. Moreover, the evidence is that abolition of the wages councils last year has produced lower pay; it has not produced more jobs. Perhaps politicians should reflect on three things before pursuing this argument: 1. The aim of economic activity is to produce decent jobs and a good standard of living - it is not an end in itself. The most successful countries have combined economic success with steadily improving social and employment conditions. 2. How far would standards have to be lowered in Europe so that we can compete on labour costs with Taiwan, Korea and China? 3. Surely, one of the biggest and most neglected issues facing the world is how to produce demand in the Third World which can be supplied both locally and from the G7. This can never happen while countries are hidebound by debt which they cannot afford to repay. The G7 countries will have to be far bolder and more imaginative than their proposals in Naples suggest if they are to break through this vicious spiral of debt and poverty.

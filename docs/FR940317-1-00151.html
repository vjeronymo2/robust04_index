			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Before apparently abandoned claims are forwarded to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USARCS, a certified letter should be sent to the claimant requesting his/her intentions within a specified period, usually 30 days. If no reply is received within a reasonable time, usually 30 days, the files may be closed and forwarded to USARCS, except as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Tort claims under subparts D, E and F. Additionally, a paragraph of the letter should state that failure to respond will result in the presumption that the claim is abandoned. Further, it should be stated that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the action taken, the claimant may file suit in an appropriate United States District Court no later than six months from the date of mailing of the letter, or the claimant's remedy will be forever barred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) In tort claims under subpart C, the last paragraph should advise the claimant that failure to respond will result in the presumption that the claim is abandoned, and that if the claimant is dissatisfied with the action taken, the claimant has a right to appeal the action for a review and final decision. Further, it should be stated that the claimant only has 60 days to submit such an appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Only after each of the above actions has been completed, may a tort claim be considered to be abandoned, and be forwarded to USARCS for retirement.

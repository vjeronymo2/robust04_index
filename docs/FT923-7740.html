			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Golf: Reading the greens, how Faldo does his course work - John Hopkins follows the Open champion on a 5 1/2-hour practice round IF YOU can tell a man by the books he reads, then you can tell a golfer by the way he prepares for a championship. Practice rounds are regarded by most professional golfers as a time for low jokes and high stakes, a bit of light relief before the action begins. If your name is Nick Faldo, however, you prepare painstakingly, leaving nothing to chance. It was hot in St Louis on Tuesday as Faldo set out on his third practice round prior to this week's US PGA championship, though he did not have to contend with the searing humidity of the two previous days when temperatures approached 100` F and humidity was as high. Nevertheless, in the locker room Faldo coated his face and fore-arms with sun screen, munched an apple and placed a banana and several bottles of water in his bag. 'I want to prepare so thoroughly that when I lie in bed I can visualise every hole, every shot I am likely to have to play, every putt, every undulation in a green,' Faldo told me as he practised for the 1981 Open at Royal St George's. In St Louis this week it was not at all the same. 'This course is easy to the point of being boring,' said Faldo. 'There is no element of a links course here at all. There is no wind to take into consideration. It's just a matter of hitting from the tee to the fairway, from the fairway to the green.' Deane Beman, now boss of the American pro tour, was one of the first to start measuring distances by mechanical instead of visual means. In the early 1960s, Jack Nicklaus noticed what Beman was doing, copied it - and refined it to a black art. Soon every pro used mechanical aids to measure distances and Bernhard Langer even went so far as to measure with two wheels, one in yards, the other in metres. Watching Faldo at practice this week was like watching a carver whittling away at a block of wood. Often he played two balls from the tee, sometimes shaking his head with dissatisfaction as his drive veered from its intended course. 'Give me another,' he would sigh to his caddie Fanny Sunesson, holding out his hand. On the third green Faldo stuck a white tee peg in the green and putted towards it. Then he marched to the edge of the green and hit some shots from the straggly grass around the fringe. Sometimes he took a long, slow swing so that the ball flew out in a high parabola, dropped softly and rolled towards its target. Other shots were hit with a firm rap to dig the ball out and it flew low and fast at the flag. On the fourth hole, he must have hit 20 balls from varying positions around the green and from bunkers. As he approached each green he would pull an orange-covered notebook from his back pocket. This showed the size of the green, the likely flag positions, the distances from bunkers to the flag. 'I am just checking the humps and bumps now,' said Faldo. 'This is practically all there is left to do in a practice round. I know what club I am going to take nine times out of ten by the time I have reached the ball. When Fanny tells me the distances left to the flag that just confirms in my mind the club I should take.' As Faldo practised he was followed by David Leadbetter, his coach, the man responsible for the swing changes that transformed Faldo into the world's leading player. From time to time Leadbetter would step forward and from beneath the shadow of a wide-brimmed straw hat and behind a pair of dark glasses he would say something quietly to Faldo. It was almost as if he was adjusting a painting, a hand here, a touch there, a few quick, quiet sentences. 'He's looking awfully good now,' said Leadbetter. 'There are a lot more majors in him provided he remains healthy.' The procession headed by Faldo and his practice partner Mike Hulbert was marching down the seventh fairway when a fan screamed out at Fanny Sunesson. He wanted her autograph. 'No, no, no,' said Sunesson, a blush rising to her cheeks. 'Go on,' said Faldo, walking on and saying over his shoulder: 'It's coming to something when a player has to wait for his clubs because his caddie's signing autographs.' He smiled. 'In Sweden they applauded her on to the tee.' The appeal of Sunesson to Faldo is her professionalism. Her dedication mirrors his own. 'She is a hard worker,' said Faldo. 'She trains physically to stay in shape. Humping a 40lb bag around is not easy, specially for a woman. There are not many men out here who exercise much more than raising their right arm.' The 18th came into sight, a welcome relief from a round that had begun 5 1/2 hours earlier. Faldo's meticulous preparation was completed. He had walked the best part of six miles and, including the hour he spent on the driving range before he began his round, had hit as many as 200 shots. He had done all he could to prepare himself. Whether or not he wins his second major title of the year, and his sixth in all, is now in the lap of the gods. On Tuesday night Faldo fell asleep over dinner with his wife Gill and was in bed by 9.30pm, sleeping the sleep of the just.</p>

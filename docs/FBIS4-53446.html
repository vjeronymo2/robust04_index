			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- A top business leader on  Wednesday [18 May] welcomed the government's decision to shelve  planned hikes in public service charges.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told reporters the decision  will do good for the nation's economy.    On Tuesday, he urged Construction Minister Koji Morimoto to  delay the planned rise in Japan's highway toll fares, saying  public charge increase will trigger hikes in workers' wages and  invite an upward spiral in both wages and prices.    Earlier Wednesday, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata instructed  his  aides to halt "until the end of year" planned hikes in the rate  of domestic telephone charges and in rent for public housing, as  well as taxi fares and highway tolls.    Local governments are to be asked to refrain from raising  fees for buses and subways.    Nagano said, "I am surprised and glad that the government  halted raises in not only highway tolls but also other public  charges."    He was calling for the freeze to last for two years, "but I  won't complain that the suspension is until the end of year,"  Nagano said.    He said he is still willing to testify at a public hearing  over the proposed rise of an average 10.4 percent in highway  tolls if it is held on next Tuesday as scheduled.</p>

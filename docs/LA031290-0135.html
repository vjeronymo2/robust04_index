			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA'S DELTA SUIT ON HOLD  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor, who sued Delta Air Lines for $10 million after she was ejected  from a flight for letting her dogs roam free, has had her lawsuit tossed out of  court for the moment, a federal judge said.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said Gabor's attorneys can refile the  complaint once they fix its flaws.  </P> <P> Gabor sued alleging negligence, defamation and assault and battery after she  was removed from Flight 462 while stopping in Atlanta en route from Los Angeles  to West Palm Beach on Jan. 6, 1989.  </P> <P> A flight attendant and the pilot asked their first-class passenger to put her  dogs Genghis Kahn and Macho Man in her carry-on kennel, but she refused. "You  know Zsa Zsa. She'll speak her mind," said her lawyer, Donald Norton. "She told  the stewardess what she thought of her."  </P> <P> In Atlanta, a Delta vice president boarded the Boeing 767 to ask again, but the  airline said she rejected the requests with "considerable vulgarity" and was  escorted off the flight by a police officer.  </P></p>

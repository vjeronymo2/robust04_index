The  hashish, which was brought in from Russia, was sold in nearby  Helsinki. About 1.5 kg were seized in the arrest. The main  figure in the hashish ring is thought to be Keijo Changklung  (formerly Saira), who was sentenced to a prison term of 32  months for selling 7.5 kg. He will have no chance of early  parole. Petri Niemela received a sentence of 26 months for  having purchased 3.2 kg of the substance from Changklung, and  another 2.7 kg directly from Russia.    Previously sentenced in the case was Kari-Pekka Diomin, who  bought 2.5 kg of hashish from Changklung. Diomin was sentenced  to a year in prison, with no possibility of parole.    The Russian-born Israeli citizen Gay Dagan received a  one-year prison term, with possibility of parole, for having  distributed a shipment of drugs received from a Russian citizen.    The East Uusimaa Area Investigation Unit, which is  headquartered in Vantaa, handled the case, since it was the  first to learn of the drug selling activity. The drugs were sold  in nearby areas of Helsinki, i.e., in the Martina Restaurant on  Hameetie and in the Cafe Miina in Hakaniemi.    Those convicted were also ordered to pay damages to the  state  amounting to a total of 70,000 markkas.</p>

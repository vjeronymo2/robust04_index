			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / French public pressing for action The French government's high-pressure tactics to lift the Sarajevo siege, reinforced by yesterday's dispatch of two ministers and the aircraft carrier Foch to the Adriatic, are rooted in a growing domestic demand for firm action. An Ipsos opinion poll in today's Le Point magazine showed that 70 per cent of the French believe their country's forces should participate in air strikes on Serb positions. Some 54 per cent said Nato should bomb the Serbs anyway, while 55 per cent said France 'should accept the risk of French military losses' in possible Serb reprisals. French forces in former Yugoslavia have already suffered 18 dead and 281 wounded, with about half the casualties the direct result of the war, as distinct from accidents. This toll is not surprising, given that France - in addition to the 2,600 troops steaming towards the Adriatic in the Foch naval task force - has 5,793 in former Yugoslavia, 4,077 of them in Bosnia - nearly half the UN total. Almost as if to remind his frustrated countrymen that they were not going to war, Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, underlined yesterday on his way to Sarajevo that 'there is no military solution to the conflict.' The Nato aim was not to 'throw the Serbs out of Sarajevo, where they have been for centuries. . . but to remove the artillery batteries which are bombarding it'. The overnight shelling showed that ceasefires could 'only be a scrap of paper unless the artillery was removed', he said. France's frustration at its troops being sniped at and humiliated in Sarajevo has hardened into a stronger desire for intervention than was evident in the Gulf war, though the National Front and the communist parties remain opposed to such action. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the left-winger who resigned as defence minister over French participation in the Gulf war, said this week he recognised the need to threaten air strikes in Bosnia. A factor in his attitude, and that of many French, may be that France is now leading the US into Bosnia, in contrast to US leadership in the Gulf.</p>

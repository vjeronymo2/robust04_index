			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Japan recovery doubts THE Bank of Japan yesterday raised doubts about the country's economic recovery, suggesting that the current downturn may be longer than expected, partly because of the 'heightened risk aversion' of banks and businesses. In a quarterly outlook published yesterday, the bank still forecast a recovery during the second half of the fiscal year, ending next March, but noted that the excesses of the 'bubble' era had made banks averse to risk, while the yen's rise hurt business confidence. The report was delivered as the yen appreciated sharply on the Tokyo foreign exchange market, closing at Y106.55 to the dollar, up Y1.73. The Finance Ministry said Tokyo wanted to consult other governments to co-ordinate exchange rate policy and limit the yen's rise. In listing economic uncertainties, the Bank of Japan pointed to the possibility of yen appreciation encouraging an increase in foreign investment by manufacturers wanting to cut costs. 'The current stagnant investment in the assembly industry is a reflection of low profitability in the industry, and the possibility that a further appreciation of the yen could trigger a massive substitution of overseas investment for domestic production cannot be ruled out,' it said. Meanwhile, the Japan Chain Stores' Association said sales at member retailers, covering more than 8,000 stores, slipped by 1.3 per cent in June from the same month a year earlier, the 10th consecutive month of year-on-year falls. Japanese car output figures for the first half of the year indicate that production from January to June fell 7.2 per cent from the same period last year, a fifth consecutive half-year decline, Michiyo Nakamoto adds. Car production in Japan slumped to 5.9m units in the six months to June, falling below the 6m level for the first time in almost eight years, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association.</p>

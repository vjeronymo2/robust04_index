			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: SIB approves unit trust investment in Mexico THE Mexican Stock Exchange was approved last week for unit trust investment by the UK's Securities and Investments Board. The lifting of the restriction means that authorised unit trusts are no longer limited to investing a maximum of 10 per cent in Mexico as an unapproved market. The SIB said it had taken the decision in response to requests from a number of fund managers. 'The SIB approval is a huge relief,' said Mr James Fairweather, manager of Martin Currie's Emerging Markets unit trust. The approval is unlikely to lead to rush of single country Mexico unit trusts but the ruling will give fund managers greater flexibility. The 10 per cent limit applies to investments throughout the fund, a particular limitation on emerging markets funds. 'It had tied our hands in other countries such as Brazil and China, and it now gives us great flexibility,' said Mr Fairweather. Mexican companies placed around Dollars 4.8bn of stock last year and have raised another Dollars 3.6bn so far this year. Most of the Mexican stock sold internationally has been through American Depository Receipts in New York. UK unit trusts funds can now invest directly in Mexican stock. Mr Kevin Carter of Providence Capitol, which has a Latin America unit trust, said the move would improve the liquidity of the market since ADRs represent only a sub-sector of shares in a company's issue. 'Mexico is a large, well-established market, and it was sensible to have it approved,' he said. France plans to reduce by half the amount of tax-free capital gains allowed on money market mutual funds. The measure is aimed at promoting a new long-term savings account product that invests in French equities. Money market funds have experienced strong growth in recent years, at the cost of other investment vehicles.</p>

He emphasised his 4 million dollars aid for  Macedonia is aimed to alleviate losses resulting from the Greek  embargo. Mr. Soros met with top-level politicians in Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and with  parliament groups' representatives. Yesterday afternoon he had  a meeting with President Gligorov, followed by a joint  press-conference. President Gligorov underlines Mr. Soros'  contribution and his readiness to help at these difficult times  in Macedonia. We have very useful discussions, Gligorov said,  primarily on the embargo and possible ways to endure it, as well  as on the media in Macedonia, possibilities on more frequent  programs on minority languages, etc.    Soros condemned the embargo in front of the press, warning  against a possible wider conflict in the region to involve  neighbouring countries, unless the embargo is lifted. Those are  the reasons, he explained, Macedonia presently needs economic  aid to survive.    Asked by Greek paper "Elefterothipia" whether he would send  a  letter to UN mediator Cyrus Vance in the same way Athens did,  President Gligorov answered positively. Mr. Soros stated he had  not had an did not plan any contacts with the Greek government  at present.</p>

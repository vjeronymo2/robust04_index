			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Inflation rise hits rate cut prospects PROSPECTS of an early Japanese interest rate cut were damped yesterday by a slight rise in the inflation rate in Tokyo, which usually leads inflationary trends in the rest of the country. Tokyo consumer prices rose by 0.5 per cent in September, about 2.2 per cent up from a year before, compared with an annual rate of increase of 1.8 per cent in August, according to a report from the Management and Co-ordination Agency. The national annual inflation rate in August was 1.7 per cent, the agency reported. Meanwhile the Japanese cabinet was presented with an official report which warned that the economy was still slowing. The report from the Economic Planning Agency warned that only new housing starts and government spending were providing domestic sources of growth as consumer spending and capital investment were still falling. Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, said there was no need for a change in monetary policy even though the economy was going through a preiod of 'severe adjustment.' The depression in consumer markets was highlighted by a 3.9 per cent fall in Japanese department store sales in August, according to the Japan Department Stores Association. A firmer dollar helped take the wind out of the Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei average closed down lost 215.19 points to 18,394.76, after a 327 point gain on Thursday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Kostenko; from the "Voskresenye" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Kostenko] The situation in  Sevastopol can already be likened to a state of emergency. One  ruble fetches 25 coupons today. For the most part, people get  to work on foot -- there are few cars around, as there is  virtually no gasoline to be found anywhere. These warships have  not left their moorings for several months now. The vast  majority of officers have remained loyal and true to the oath  they swore. And every day, early in the morning, the old  power's navy ensign is raised high above the warship's stern,  and they salute it. It is almost all they have left. The  actual purchasing power of a Black Sea naval officer's wage is  five times lower than that of his counterpart in, say, the  Baltic Fleet. Rubles sent from Russia are converted into  karbovantsy according to the official state exchange rate, and  not the market rate -- that is, at a rate of 4:1 rather than  25:1. The fleet pays customs duties on imported food, fuel, and  various types of equipment -- including things brought in for  the Ukrainian Navy. It pays for the use of land, roads, and  test ranges. The Ukrainian Army is exempt from such taxes.  What's more, according to some statistics, 40 percent of the  strategic reserves in Ukraine have already been used up.  Meanwhile, a Russian officer coming to serve in Sevastopol has  to pay Ukrainian customs officers almost a whole month's salary.  In November, 52 billion karbovantsy deposited in Black Sea  Fleet accounts in Ukrainian banks were frozen. This money had  been sent over from Russia to build homes for naval officers.  It was finally released in December following wholesale price  increases in Ukraine, only to become a pile of worthless bits of  paper. Russia has long borne nigh-on three-quarters of the  expenses of maintaining a fleet on the Black Sea. Ongoing talks  on the future of the fleet and of Sevastopol have in practice  led nowhere. Many people here in Sevastopol believe that the  option of transferring the fleet's main base to Russia on a  leasehold basis should suit everybody. That way, Yeltsin will  not look like an occupier, nor Kravchuk a traitor.</p>

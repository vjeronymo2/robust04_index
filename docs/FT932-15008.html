			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Although no wool sales are being held this week, the last ones held in all main markets, including British wool itself, show that 'the crippling imbalance between supply and demand' remains the dominant feature. Prices are weak and tended to ease at closing auctions. Business further down the wool textile manufacturing line inevitably takes this into account, and small covering orders are held till the last minute. Recession in Europe is damaging and enhances competition, and signs of recovery in the UK are not of sufficient strength to counteract wider weakness.</p>

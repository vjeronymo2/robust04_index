			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KENNEDY OUTRUNS TAFT BY WINNING 11 EVENTS  </P> <P> Although the Kennedy High boys' track team was devastated by 25 academic  ineligibilities several weeks ago, the Golden Cougars still have a talented --  albeit small -- squad. They lack quantity, but not quality.  </P> <P> Kennedy demonstrated quality in a 73-54 victory over visiting Taft on Friday in  a Northwest Valley Conference meet.  </P> <P> Kennedy's victory overshadowed a brilliant performance by Taft's Greg Sheets,  who won the pole vault with a personal best of 15 feet, 1 inch. Sheets, the  runner-up to Jay Bettinger of Chatsworth in last year's City Section  championships, had a previous best of 15-0.  </P> <P> Antiwaun Carter, Jorge Duran, Patrick Blake and Cord Bailey were all  instrumental in Kennedy's win as the Golden Cougars (2-0) won 11 of 15 events  and nine of 10 track events.  </P> <P> Carter won the 100 meters in 11.4 and the 220 yards in 23.5, and anchored the  victorious 440 relay (46.3). Duran won the mile (4:39.8) and two mile  (10:14.7); Blake won the 120-yard high hurdles in 16.9 and the 330 intermediate  hurdles in 44.6. Bailey won the triple jump at 40-6 and placed second in the  high jump (5-10) and second in the long jump (20-0).  </P> <P> In other boys' meets:  </P> <P> Reseda 70, North Hollywood 53 -- Aaron Brumfield won the triple jump and high  jump for Reseda (4-0, 2-0) in the Valley Pac-8 Conference meet at North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> San Fernando 74, Canoga Park 43 -- The host Tigers were led in the Northwest  Valley Conference meet by Ibed Aguirre, who won the mile (4:51.9) and two mile  (10:22.8), and Howard McCrary, who won the 120-yard high hurdles (15.7) and  triple jump (42-3 1/2).  </P> <P> Birmingham 113, Sylmar 10 -- Brian Gastelum won three events for host  Birmingham (2-0) in the Valley Pac-8 Conference meet. Gastelum, a junior, won  the 800 in a personal best of 2:00.6, the 1,600 in 4:50.0 and the 3,200 in  10:29.3.  </P> <P> GIRLS' TRACK  </P> <P> Kennedy 61, Taft 48 -- Taft won seven of 13 events, but the Golden Cougars'  superior depth prevailed in the Northwest Valley Conference meet at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Natasha Como and Lela Lemell helped Kennedy dominate the sprints.  </P> <P> Como won the 100 meters in 13.0, the 220 yards in 27.9 and anchored the  victorious 440 relay (53.0). Lemell, a sophomore, won the 440 in 1:04.3.  </P> <P> Granada Hills 63, El Camino Real 45 -- Shaunte Parker won two individual events  and anchored two victorious relays for host Granada Hills in the Northwest  Valley Conference meet.  </P> <P> Poly 66, Van Nuys 38 -- Tina Means led Van Nuys (2-0) in the Valley Pac-8  Conference meet at Poly by winning the 110-meter low hurdles, the 330-yard lows  and the high jump.  </P> <P> BOYS' VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Chatsworth d. Westchester, 15-4, 15-13, 15-11 -- Greg Weaver had 16 kills and  Chris Gleason added 11 to lead the Chancellors (2-0) in a nonleague match.  </P> <P> Harvard d. Crespi 15-10, 15-13, 15-6 -- Mark Shoptaw had 17 kills and Rick  Osterloh had six kills and six stuff blocks for host Harvard (3-0) in a  nonleague match.  </P> <P> Royal d. San Gabriel, 15-9, 12-15, 15-1, 8-15, 15-5 -- Craig Parker had 21  kills and Matt Brown had 10 kills and eight stuff blocks to lead host Royal to  a nonleague win.  </P> <P> BOYS' TENNIS  </P> <P> Brentwood 14, Chaminade 4 -- Brian Lim recorded a singles victory, and Chris  Bosco and Eric Avakemian recorded a doubles win for host Chaminade (1-2) in a  nonleague match.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCI SUES AT&amp;T, CLAIMS ITS ADS ARE MISLEADING  </P> <P> MCI Communications Corp. filed suit Tuesday against American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph Co., claiming that AT&amp;T was trying to protect its eroding share  of the long-distance market through maliciously false and deceptive  advertising.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said later it will file a countersuit.  </P> <P> The U.S. District Court suit charges that beginning in January, AT&amp;T  launched a counterattack against its competitors to regain market share, and in  July began targeting MCI's new Prime Time, cut-rate long-distance calling plan.  </P> <P> The suit said AT&amp;T advertising "maliciously attacked MCI's honesty and the  value of MCI's competing services by falsely and deceptively representing that  AT&amp;T was superior to its competitors in general, and MCI in particular, in  terms of trustworthiness, quality and price."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outspent Heavily on Ads  </P> <P> MCI Chairman William G. McGowan said AT&amp;T is losing 100,000 customers a  week, and "they are panicking about it."  </P> <P> He told a news conference that AT&amp;T is using "blatantly false and  defamatory" ads to "staunch the flood of customers who are switching to MCI and  other companies."  </P> <P> MCI itself is known for aggressive advertising, such as showing people fainting  when they see their non-MCI long-distance phone bills. But McGowan said MCI now  is being outspent 8 to 1 by AT&amp;T in advertising.  </P> <P> McGowan labeled various AT&amp;T ads as "sleazy" and "ridiculous." He said he  could not estimate the losses MCI had suffered as a result of AT&amp;T ads, but  he said "it's substantial."  </P> <P> AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said: "We welcome the opportunity to discuss who  is misleading whom and will do so in a countersuit. We have been concerned  about MCI's sometimes misleading print and broadcast advertising and have  complained about it directly to MCI."  </P> <P> He cited MCI commercials "that compare MCI Prime Time prices with our basic  long-distance prices instead of our Reach Out America prices."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ongoing Battle  </P> <P> "AT&amp;T stands behind its advertising," Linnen added.  </P> <P> As for claims that AT&amp;T is losing customers, Linnen said "If anyone . . .  chooses a brief moment in time on which to base figures they are going to  mislead, and we are not going to play that game."  </P> <P> Linnen said AT&amp;T's lawyers had written the four commercial television  networks earlier this month to complain that an MCI ad promising that its ad  promising that MCI "always saves you money over AT&amp;T" was false in that  MCI, in certain calling patterns, was sometimes more expensive.  </P> <P> The MCI suit said some AT&amp;T ads featured "alleged research" by AT&amp;T  Bell Laboratories on the effectiveness of MCI's services.  </P> <P> "AT&amp;T knowingly gambled Bell Laboratories' reputation for scientific  integrity in a desperate attempt to obtain credibility for AT&amp;T's crass  commercial defamation of MCI."  </P> <P> The suit is the latest chapter in MCI's long battle with AT&amp;T, which began  in the 1970s when MCI successfully broke AT&amp;T's long-distance monopoly. The  two companies have contested each other in the courts and at the Federal  Communications Commission, which authorizes rates, ever since.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T says it has about 70% of the long-distance market, measured by  interstate and intrastate revenues, or 66%, according to Federal Communications  Commission estimates of the proportion of minutes in all interstate calls  handled by AT&amp;T. MCI is No. 2 with more than 10%.  </P> <P> MCI's suit suit cites AT&amp;T ads that assert that MCI's rate are cheaper than  AT&amp;T's only when calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 p.m., or  that MCI customers "might have had better luck calling Mars" than trying to  reach MCI representatives for an explanation of their bills.  </P> <P> The ads, the suit claims, also claim non-AT&amp;T companies provide slow  telephone connections, that other companies don't operate worldwide like  AT&amp;T and that competing 800, facsimile and WATS services are inferior.  </P> <P> The suit says AT&amp;T "has wrongfully profited and MCI has been damaged by  being wrongfully thwarted from maximizing its sales potential."  </P> <P> It asks the court to enjoin AT&amp;T "from making false or deceptive  representations that any AT&amp;T service is materially superior to any  competing MCI service in terms of quality or lower cost, or that MCI has  misrepresented its services or rates to consumers."  </P> <P> It also asks that AT&amp;T, for a period of 12 months, stop advertising and  promoting its products unless "such information clearly and conspicuously  discloses a court-approved corrective notice that mitigates the lingering  effects of the misrepresentations described therein."  </P> <P> Additionally, it asks for profits "wrongfully amassed by AT&amp;T on the sale  of its products or services during the period in question," plus interest and  legal fees.  </P></p>

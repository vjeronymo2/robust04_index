			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Study of Sanwa Research Institute </F> Shows Increased Domestic Demand More Effective To Reduce  Surplus, Not Strong Yen"]    [Text] On 31 May [1994], Sanwa Research Institute completed  an estimate which indicates a gradually rising yen and expanded  domestic demand would still result in an increase in a trade  surplus with the United States. However, the institute indicates  if domestic demand rises significantly, the surplus should drop  and that there is a need to take actions to provide for greater  increases in domestic demand and market-opening measures to  include deregulation in order to avoid a worsening in Japan-U.S.  friction.    The estimate assumed that the yen would stay in the $1 = 105  yen range or gradually rise to $1 = 95 yen by 1998 while  domestic demand would rise to 2 percent or 4 percent.    The estimate indicates a trade surplus with the United  States  of $71.6 billion assuming a foreign currency rate of $1 = 95 yen  and a 4 percent growth in domestic demand, substantially above  the fiscal year 1993 surplus with the United States of $50.2  billion. If the value of the yen remains around $1 = 105 yen and  domestic demand grows 2 percent, the trade surplus would be  $80.2 billion.    On the other hand, assuming a 4 percent growth in domestic  demand and exchange rates at either 105 yen or 95 yen, the  overall trade surplus in 1998 would fall below the $120.2  billion surplus of 1993. In the event domestic demand is 2  percent, the surplus will be substantially higher. Of special  note is that the surplus will grow at a significantly higher  rate if the yen rises in value, whether economic growth rate is  low or high. The research institute concludes that an expansion  in domestic demand is more effective than adjustments in foreign  exchange rates in reducing trade surpluses because structural  conditions exist in which it is difficult to reduce exports even  if dollar-denominated prices rise because of a strong yen.</p>

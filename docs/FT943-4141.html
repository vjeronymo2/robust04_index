			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Adams likely to be given US visa Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, last night looked likely to be granted a visa to visit the US as he moved to raise his political profile in the Northern Ireland peace process. He said yesterday that he had received 'thousands of invitations' from the US to explain the recent ceasefire declaration by Sinn Fein and the IRA, and he planned to visit as soon as possible. Mr Adams is barred from visiting the US, and his application aims to test how receptive the Washington and London governments are to the recent IRA ceasefire. A State Department official said in Washington last night that no formal visa request had been received. But if his intention was to advance the peace process Mr Adams would probably receive one. The official was also reported to have said that the Clinton administration was considering a request from a unionist delegation to visit Washington. 'I think it's safe to say that the US is going to - as President Clinton said - support this effort of peace in every possible way,' the official said. Mr Adams last applied for - and obtained - a US visa in February in spite of a strong public protest from the British government that the IRA had not renounced violence. On that occasion the White House overruled the advice of State Department officials and agreed to a 72-hour visit by Mr Adams, having become convinced that it would contribute to the peace process. White House officials who feel vindicated by that decision are likely to recommend granting a visa again, although the State Department remains sensitive to the complex issues at stake. The State Department yesterday also pointed out that the US admitted Mr Joseph Cahill, a Provisional IRA leader with a criminal conviction, at the end of last month. Senator Chris Dodd yesterday met Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier and suggested that Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds and Mr John Hume, leader of the mainly nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, should visit the US to participate in a hearing on the future of Ireland before the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Dodd, as chairman of the subcommittee on western hemisphere and Peace Corps affairs, would be one of the senators responsible for inviting Mr Adams on behalf of the Senate committee. Political aides to Mr Dodd said yesterday that the senator believes there should be a role for the US in Irish reconciliation and that 'Mr Adams should sit at the table'. The British government may formally urge President Clinton not to grant Mr Adams a visa until the IRA gives a firmer indication that it has permanently abandoned its military campaign. But officials are aware that the survival of the IRA ceasefire depends in large measure on Mr Adams being able to show his supporters that the 'unarmed struggle' is producing political results. Mr Adams plans to give his next US trip a higher profile than his last one, hoping he will be heralded as a peacemaker and not a terrorist. Will they bid for peace? Weekend I</p>

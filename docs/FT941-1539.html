			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Kenya equities enlivened by economic reforms - But foreigners remain absent Nairobi's stock exchange has suddenly sprung to life, thanks to economic reforms which have opened new horizons for the private sector in Kenya. The NSE index of the 20 most traded shares has almost doubled since early January: itbegan 1994 at the 2,500 mark, and soared to 5,115 in mid-February before gliding down to the 4,700 level this week on a spate of profit-taking. Volume has increased five-fold in as many months and more than 200,000 shares have been traded every day this month so far, boosting daily turnover to Ks15m (Dollars 230,000). As a result of the share price explosion, Nairobi's stock exchange has overtaken Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia and Zimbabwe in terms of market capitalisation. It is currently valued at Dollars 1.8bn, against an estimated Dollars 1.4bn for Egypt, its closest regional rival. It is almost too much excitement for the tiny bourse to bear. The NSE's cramped offices in downtown Nairobi are packed with investors who come to track the progress of their shares during the open-cry morning trading sessions. Sometimes, the mayhem in the visitors' gallery is greater than on the small trading floor, where six brokers conduct all the transactions. Deals are recorded on a blackboard - computerisation, say NSE officials, is still some years away. Several factors have contributed to the trading revival. Over the past year, the government has taken major steps to liberalise the economy: the shilling was devalued and then floated last year; most foreign exchange controls have been lifted; import licenses and price controls have been scrapped. The reforms have radically improved the business environment for Kenyan companies, particularly exporters. In addition, the banking sector enjoyed a good 1993 owing to high interest rates and exceptionally high yields on government bonds. Mr Larry Sutcliffe of the Nairobi stockbrokers, F Drummond, says that investors switched from bonds into equities when inflation, and therefore interest rates, began to fall late last year. He also believes that speculators bid up share prices in anticipation of the imminent entry of foreign investment funds. This has yet to happen. At present, direct foreign investors are free to remit capital and dividends abroad. But foreign portfolio investors require prior authorisation from the central bank and must channel their investments through a local trust fund. These restrictions have kept foreign investors at bay, although several regional and emerging market funds are charting Nairobi's progress. Mr William Chelashaw, who heads Kenya's capital markets authority, says: 'We are confident the market will be opened up in time, but there is no immediate rush to attract foreign capital'. Most analysts believe that foreign funds are unlikely to invest on the NSE until the market becomes considerably more liquid. 'At present, only about 3 per cent of distributed equity is traded,' says Mr Sutcliffe. 'Prices have also risen because of the scarcity of stock'. Price/earnings ratios have climbed to the mid-20s for the most actively traded shares. This, say some brokers, is too high for a bourse which has yet to catch the peripheral attention of emerging market funds. The NSE is also narrow as well as illiquid. Of the 54 quoted companies, eight, including three banks, account for almost 80 per cent of market capitalisation. But they have strong points, according to Middle Africa Investments, a local company of financial advisers. It says: 'Quality management, multinational support, low levels of debt and the growing importance of exports'. BAT Kenya, the largest company on the NSE, has seen its share price rise sevenfold during the past 12 months. Shares in Brooke Bond Kenya, a Unilever subsidiary, have risen fourfold. Both companies are major exporters and have benefited from the economic reforms. The favourite financial stocks, such as Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Diamond Trust of Kenya, have also seen equity quadruple in value. In spite of the NSE's recent decline, there is a sense of anticipation in the air. The NSE will soon move to more spacious premises, which will be enlivened by the addition of newly licensed brokers. The capital markets authority says that it is determined to inject a little competition into the brokerage business, in spite of much grumbling and resistance from the six brokers who own the NSE at present. Still to come are new rules to regulate the market, clarifying relations between client and broker and between brokers. The CMA also wants to tighten market surveillance and introduce more transparency into share transactions. The entry of foreign investment funds could follow. The IFC index of emerging markets has been held over this week.</p>

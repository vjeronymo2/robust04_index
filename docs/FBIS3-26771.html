			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The cross-strait talks concluded yesterday, with a  joint statement citing a consensus reached by negotiators from  Taipei and Beijing.    But government officials in Taipei accused Beijing of  improperly intermingling politics into legal issues.    The joint statement was issued by Chiao Jen-ho,  secretary-general of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF],  and his mainland counterpart, Tang Shubei of the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), itemizing major  agreements reached during the five-day talks in Beijing. Chiao  and other SEF delegates returned to Taiwan last night.    The joint statement said the two sides have reached  consensus  on such thorny issues as repatriation of hijackers and illegal  immigrants as well as bicoastal fishing disputes, adding that  differences remain to be tackled in the next round of functional  talks.    "Both sides made some concessions," Chiao said. "Reaching  consensus during this round of talks is what we call a `win-win'  situation."    In the meantime, however, Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of  the  supervisory Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), told reporters that  the consensus reached in the Beijing meetings "are at best  consensus in principle." He added that the two sides still  failed to find common ground for as many as 10 items.    Even for the issues that both sides have agreed on, "it will  still test our wisdom to put the consensus into words," Kao  said, referring to the wording of a formal agreement.    The MAC ran an overnight meeting until 4 a.m. yesterday,  giving its final approval on the Chiao-Tang statement. A few  changes were made: the SEF and ARATS would only exchange, not  discuss, views on economic issues during the next round of  talks; the statement also left out the discussion for the  arrangement of the second SEF-ARATS summit.    ARATS chairman Wang Daohan has invited his SEF counterpart,  Ku Chen-fu, to visit Beijing in late spring or early summer, yet  the MAC seems less enthusiastic to embrace the idea for fear  that Beijing will use the high-level exchanges to achieve its  political goal.    Both sides have agreed to hold the fourth round of  functional  talks in Beijing at the end of next month. Once formal  agreements are reached on the three issues, Tang will come to  Taipei to attend the signing ceremony, the Chiao-Tang statement  said.    In a written statement, the MAC sharply criticized Tang's  remarks, saying the SEF-ARATS talks should "avoid discussions of  political and legal issues" as ambiguous.    In mid January, Tang said the ARATS would carry out the  principles of "Peaceful reunification-one country, two systems,"  but during this round of talks, he asked the SEF delegates not  to raise political and legal issues, according to the MAC  statement.    "Under the communist doctrine, law, which only serves as a  tool of politics, has nothing to do with social justice and  public welfare," the MAC statement said. It went on to say that  mainland negotiators could hardly understand that "Political  issues belong to politics, legal issues belong to law."    During the next round of talks, the two sides will also  exchange views on issues such as joint efforts to crack down on  the criminal activities of marine smuggling and robbery,  protection of intellectual property, mutual assistance between  the judicial organs, and certain economic and technological  subjects agreed to in last April's summit in Singapore, the  statement said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Indian Navy's New Submarine; Increase in Troops </F> Along Sindh Border"]    [Text] A second indigenously built submarine has been  handed over to the Indian Navy. With this second indigenously  built submarine, India has joined the list of countries that  manufacture submarines. The first indigenously built submarine  was handed over in February. India named the submarine Shankul.  It was manufactured with German technical assistance.    India currently has the largest navy in South Asia and the  fifth largest in the world. India also possesses Russian-made  submarines that can launch nuclear weapons. With the exception  of China, there is no other country in this part of the world  that can match India's military might. India does not face a  military threat from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, or any  other country, but it is constantly increasing its war  preparedness as well as the power of its air, sea, and ground  forces. The objective of this military buildup is nothing short  of asserting regional hegemony, keeping the small countries  under pressure, and maintaining an aggressive military  occupation in Kashmir. Because Pakistan lends moral, political,  and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri demand for the right to  self-determination, India has directed the bulk of its might  against Pakistan.    According to press reports, India has dispatched its 3rd  Tank  Division, which has expertise in desert warfare, to the desert  regions of Rajasthan to conduct military exercises in the acute  heat near the border with Pakistan's Sindh Province. Two corps  of Indian troops are already deployed on the Indian side of the  Sindh border, and the deployment of the (?3rd) Tank Division  tremendously enhances India's military strength in the area.  This is a matter of great concern for Pakistan. There is  another report that along with assembling a mechanized division,  India has commenced work on installing Prithvi missiles in the  area. About 100 Prithvi missiles are expected to be installed  in the area. Defense analysts have expressed apprehensions that  a frenzy toward a "decisive war" with Pakistan is gaining  intensity in India. General B.C. Joshi, chief of the Indian  armed forces, is regarded as a supporter of a decisive war with  Pakistan. India can launch a drive against Pakistan to divert  the attention of its people as well as the world from the  conditions it faces in occupied Kashmir.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPRING FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> FINDING NEW QUARTERBACK A PRIORITY FOR UCLA  </P> <P> UCLA's main objective in spring football practice, which opens Monday and runs  through April 29, is to find a replacement for Troy Aikman.  </P> <P> "The horses respond best to one jockey," Coach Terry Donahue said. "So, it  would be nice to establish that leadership element and be able to say (on April  29), 'This is our quarterback for the 1989 season.' "  </P> <P> Vying for the position will be senior Ron Caragher, junior Bobby San Jose,  sophomore Jimmy Bonds and redshirt freshman Bret Johnson.  </P> <P> "They're all a bit different," Donahue said.  </P> <P> In what ways?  </P> <P> "Ron Caragher probably has a better overall knowledge and understanding of what  we've done here offensively," Donahue said.  </P> <P> "Bobby San Jose is probably the most athletic, or at least as athletic as any  of them. He's got nice feet, he's got good mobility, he's got a pretty quick  release. He's got a lot going for him, physically.  </P> <P> "Jimmy Bonds has the strongest arm of all four. He puts a lot of heat on the  ball. And he has leadership ability and charisma.  </P> <P> "Bret Johnson is very elusive, extremely instinctive, has a very good field  presence and anticipates well. He knows when to unload the ball."  </P> <P> Donahue said the competition is wide open.  </P> <P> Bruin Notes  </P> <P> UCLA signed three more quarterbacks in February. "We want to make sure we have  one," Coach Terry Donahue said. "We're going to have fierce competition and let  the strongest survive." . . . UCLA will also revamp its defense this spring  after losing six starters from last year's team, which was 10-2 and defeated  Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. "We're not as experienced or as deep as we have  been defensively, but we'll be able to put 11 pretty active, fast players on  the field," Donahue said. . . . UCLA lost only three offensive starters. . . .  UCLA's schedule next season includes games in the Rose Bowl against Tennessee,  Michigan, California, Arizona State, Washington and Oregon and road games  against San Diego State, Arizona, Oregon State and Stanford. The USC game will  be played Nov. 18 at the Coliseum.  </P></p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Bombay's foreign banks under fire INDIA'S leading foreign banks were yesterday thrust to the forefront of the Bombay financial scandal when a central bank report claimed that controversial securities market trading had been concentrated in their hands and in those of four brokers now under arrest. The report prepared by a committee under Mr R. Janakiraman, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said that Citibank, Standard Chartered, Bank of America and ANZ Grindlays Bank accounted for 67 per cent of the transactions in the interbank securities market. The report says about two thirds of the transactions went through brokers rather than being handled directly by the banks. Of the transactions in which brokers were intermediaries, a fifth were accounted for by Mr Harshad Mehta, Mr Bhupen Dalal, Mr Hiten Dalal and Mr V B Desai. All four face fraud charges. The report makes no specific charges against the foreign banks. But the Reserve Bank over the weekend ordered a special audit of the four institutions. Citibank accounted for 23 per cent of the 58,000 transactions since April 1991, Standard Chartered 18 per cent, Bank of America 16 per cent and ANZ Grindlays 8 per cent. A senior government official said last night that the report painted 'a black picture' of the role of foreign banks. Another said that the audit by the Reserve Bank was intended to show whether the two American banks - which have maintained that they had a clean slate - had employees who were also involved in questionable trading. The report points to widespread deficiencies in the internal control systems of both foreign and domestic banks. It says that in 20 per cent of the transactions book entries between banks failed to match. The committee makes clear that it thinks this would not have happened if banks had dealt directly with each other rather than through brokers. It says that the mismatching 'could not have occurred if cheques paid and received for transactions in securities and other documents had been directly exchanged between banks and also if bankers' cheques had not been credited to brokers accounts. . . ' ANZ Grindlays has, under Reserve Bank instructions, made provision for more than Rs5bn (Pounds 92m) for a cheque issued to National Housing Bank that it credited to the account of Mr Mehta. Laying the ground for what may emerge as another scandal, the report points to abuses of the government's privatisation programme. It says that public sector shares sold to state owned financial institutions were re-sold in collusive deals between the institutions and brokers. Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said yesterday that the government intended to appoint soon a 'strong' supervisory agency to monitor the banking system.</p>

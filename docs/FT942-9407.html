			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Ward issues Dollars 85m writ against Guinness Guinness said yesterday it would vigorously defend an Dollars 85m (Pounds 58m) writ issued by Mr Thomas Ward, a US attorney, and a Guinness director at the time of the takeover of Distillers in 1986. Mr Ward, who aided Mr Ernest Saunders, the then Guinness chief executive, during the successful Pounds 2.7bn bid battle, is suing Guinness and four executives connected with the takeover for damages on a variety of charges. These include loss of earnings for Mr Ward's law practice, libel and slander. Enjoined with Guinness is Mr Shaun Dowling, a former director. The writ is also thought to cite Sir Thomas Risk, the former governor of the Bank of Scotland, and Lord MacFarlane of Bearsden, who succeeded Mr Saunders as chairman of Guinness and is currently non-executive chairman of United Distillers. The fourth is also believed to be a former Guinness director. The suit, filed in a Los Angeles court, follows Mr Ward's acquittal last year at the Old Bailey on charges of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness. The drinks group said it was an unauthorised payment by Mr Saunders, but Mr Ward maintained it was a legitimate 'success fee' for his services in winning the Distillers bid. Although Mr Ward repaid Pounds 1.3m of the fee prior to his trial, Guinness is currently pursuing Mr Ward for the return of the remainder plus interest, totalling Pounds 9m. Mr Ward's action does not include punitive or exemplary damages, which would be decided by jury if the case against Guinness was proven. Guinness said that a separate action, being brought against Guinness by Mr Ward's legal partners, would also be strongly defended. The company said: 'We have instructed our lawyers in California to take steps to have these actions dismissed.' The company has been granted a 30-day extention before it responds to the claim. It is thought that Guinness will act in conjunction with the four co-named executives. Mr Ward's action is the latest legal fall-out from the takeover of Distillers in which Guinness fought a prolonged battle with Argyll Group.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 29 June Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  received Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of Ministers  of the Republic of Cuba, who paid an official visit to our  country as head of a Cuban governmental delegation. There was a  conversation during which various aspects of Ukrainian-Cuban  cooperation were touched upon.    We highly assess the all-round development of such relations  and strive for their successful development in this direction,  Leonid Kravchuk said. Our people, he stressed, have always  respected the Cuban people.    In the conversation they discussed a number of long-term  trends in Ukrainian-Cuban cooperation.    After the meeting Lionel Soto replied to a number of  questions from journalists. Dwelling on his conversation with  the president he referred to it as very important. We had an  opportunity to exchange opinions with the president on restoring  relations between the two countries and their further  development, already in new conditions, when Ukraine acts as an  independent state. For a certain period of time these relations  were weakened, however at present prospects have become  available for restoring and deepening these relations.</p>

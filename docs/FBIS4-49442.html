			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By station reporter (Su Haizhen); from the "National </F> Hookup" program]    [Text] Jiangsu Province, which captures one-fifth of  China's market of audio and video products, consolidated its  audio and video market by cracking down on piracy of compact  discs. It confiscated over 10,000 pirated compact discs in  April. Early this year, first of all, Jiangsu consolidated  units producing compact discs in the province, sternly  investigated and dealt with manufacturers engaged in piracy  reproduction, established a system for the reproduction  processing manufacturers to report their products to the  authorities for examination, and, meanwhile, publicized the  copyright law by explaining to the masses the knowledge of how  to identify pirated, counterfeit audio and video products. In  early April, Jiangsu conducted a general inspection of the audio  and video market in the whole province. Audio and video  administrative departmeNts in all areas coordinated with  departments in charge of industry and commerce, as well as  public security departments, to repeatedly crack down on piracy  reproduction of compact discs, thereby effectively dealing a  blow to their illegal distribution and sales. An inspection team  formed by relevant state departments praised Jiangsu's audio and  video market, saying it maintained good order while enjoying  brisk sales.</p>

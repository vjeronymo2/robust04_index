			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Producer price index rise triggers sharp reversal AS ONE particularly sagacious technical analyst on Wall Street pointed out last week: 'A tree does not grow to the sky.' This literary flight of fancy was meant to encapsulate the bond market's recent performance. In less elegant terms, what the analyst implied was that prices cannot go on rising for ever; what goes up, must come down. And the bond market last week came down, in no uncertain terms. The benchmark 30-year government issue tumbled almost 1 1/2 points on Friday, pushing the yield up to 6.87 per cent at one stage. Over the week, the yield rose about 20 basis points, 'bringing to an end a string of eight consecutive weeks in which the long bond yield was lower on a Friday-to-Friday basis,' noted Smith Barney's credit market analyst Mr Doug Schindewolf. Why the sudden turnround? The trigger for the dramatic sell-off was the February producer price index, which rose 0.4 per cent during the month  - a bigger increase than the market had expected. The rise in producer prices was broad-based; everything from cars to capital equipment, tobacco and household appliance prices rose significantly last month. Moreover, the core rate of inflation - which excludes the volatile food and energy components - has risen at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent so far this year, not of itself desperately worrying but suggestive nonetheless of an upward trend that could become dangerous if unchecked. Additionally, the announcement of the PPI data came against a background of rising commodity prices, and not too soon after the oil producing countries of Opec agreed to cut production. Comments on Friday afternoon from Mr Wayne Angell, the Federal Reserve governor, to the effect that rising prices reflected economic growth that was probably stronger than realised, did not help sentiment either. Despite all this, the PPI figures and Mr Angell's remarks would not normally have warranted such a dramatic reaction from bond investors were it not for the fact that the bond market had grown too complacent about the inflation threat. Consequently, the news on producer prices served to waken investors from their slumbers with an overdue and not unwelcome shock. No one, however, is ringing any alarm bells, at least just yet. While describing the PPI report as 'one of the most disturbing we have seen in months,' Nikko Securities chief economist Mr Bob Brusca believes that the figures do not foreshadow a quickening in the pace of inflation. He says: 'Money growth trends are still down, worldwide growth is weak and the US economy is again in more uncertain growth territory.' Whether the bond market over-reacted to the PPI figures or not, there is no doubting that this week's release of the consumer price index for February, scheduled for Wednesday, will be more closely watched than ever. If the CPI figure is at or above January's unexpectedly strong 0.5 per cent increase, market sentiment is likely to take another turn for the worse. Analysts, however, are predicting a rise in February consumer prices of between 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent. Their confidence that there will not be a repeat of January's figure is based partly on the belief that that month's increase was fuelled by a variety of temporary price pressures (such as a tobacco tax rise and the end to airline fare breaks), and partly on a faith in historical precedence. A look back over the past decade shows that consumer prices have risen sharply in January, only to slow again in February. It is a phenomenon that no one seems to have a particularly strong explanation for, other than to blame it on adverse weather conditions.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCCAW DEALS SEEN AS EFFORT TO PUT PRESSURE ON LIN  </P> <P> McCaw Cellular Communications Tuesday announced a pair of billion-dollar-plus  cellular telephone deals apparently designed to increase pressure on Lin  Broadcasting to agree to its hostile takeover bid.  </P> <P> Kirkland, Wash.-based McCaw said it agreed buy out Metromedia Inc.'s interest  in a New York cellular telephone system for $1.9 billion. To help finance that  purchase, McCaw said it reached a separate agreement to sell its interest in  several Southeastern cellular systems to Contel Corp. for $1.3 billion in cash.  </P> <P> The New York acquisition hinges on whether Lin Broadcasting, which owns 45% of  the franchise, exercises its right to buy Metromedia's interest by matching  McCaw's offer. Some analysts said the McCaw proposal was another attempt to put  more pressure on New York-based Lin, which McCaw has been aggressively pursuing  since June with a $5.8-billion takeover bid.  </P> <P> "This demonstrates the seriousness with which McCaw is going after Lin," said  John Reddan, an analyst with the investment firm Moran &amp; Associates Inc. in  Greenwich, Conn.  </P> <P> Reddan said McCaw is trying to establish a market value for Lin's New York  assets and is "calling Lin's bluff" on its stance that the overall company is  worth more than the $110-a-share, or $5.8 billion, offered by McCaw. McCaw's  offer for the 45.7% Metromedia interest equals $275 per potential customer, or  what is known in the cellular industry as a "pop." McCaw's bid for all of Lin  is equal to $250 per pop, Reddan said.  </P> <P> As a result, he said, if Lin doesn't match McCaw's offer for Metromedia's share  of its New York partnership, Lin can't credibly argue that the company as a  whole is worth more than the McCaw offer.  </P> <P> Moreover, Lin can't match McCaw's offer "without crippling" its proposed merger  with BellSouth Corp., said Thomas W. Friedberg, a Seattle-based analyst for the  investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Advantage Seen for McCaw  </P> <P> In a move to thwart McCaw's hostile bid, Lin in September proposed merging its  cellular properties with those of Atlanta-based BellSouth, along with  distributing a special $20-a-share dividend to all of its shareholders. As part  of the plan, Lin also said it would go ahead with a spinoff of its seven  televisions into a separate company.  </P> <P> But McCaw now has the advantage in the battle for Lin, Friedberg said. If Lin  buys out Metromedia and still pays the proposed dividend, he said, the merged  Lin-BellSouth organization would likely have far more debt per pop than McCaw,  he said.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Friedberg said, if McCaw acquires Metromedia's stake in the  New York cellular venture, Lin probably wouldn't be able to run the operation  as profitably.  </P> <P> Lin Vice President Michael Plouf said his company doesn't see McCaw's maneuvers  "as being a negative development at all." The company has 45 days to decide  whether it will buy the Metromedia stake, he said, but "the prospect of owning  90% (of the New York venture) is very attractive." Lin previously tried to  force Metromedia to sell its interests in New York and Philadelphia. But a New  York state court ruled that Lin has only the right of first refusal if  Metromedia decided to sell its stake and could not force a deal.  </P> <P> Reddan said he believes that McCaw will increase its cash offer for Lin to  about $120 a share. But in agreeing to sell its properties in the Southeast to  Contel, McCaw has established values for BellSouth's contribution to the  proposed merger with Lin because the Contel properties are in cities where  BellSouth also has cellular interests. That will give Lin's holders a basis to  compare the proposed BellSouth merger to whatever cash price McCaw offers, he  said.  </P> <P> McCaw has also eliminated a potential rival for Lin in coming to terms with  Atlanta-based Contel, Reddan asserted, because Contel threatened to bid for Lin  if McCaw didn't make it a partner in the raid on Lin. Under the agreement,  Contel would acquire McCaw's cellular interests in Memphis, Nashville and other  Tennessee cities; Louisville and Lexington, Ky., and in Birmingham and four  other Alabama cities. The $1.3-billion price equals $205 per pop, Contel said.  </P></p>

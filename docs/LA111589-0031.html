			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORE BAILOUT FUNDS FOR S&amp;LS  </P> <P> "Alan, we hardly knew ye."  </P> <P> "Say it ain't so, John."  </P> <P> If Edwin Gray's (former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board) charges  against Sens. Cranston, John Glenn (D-Ohio), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Dennis  DeConcini (D-Ariz.) prove to be accurate, all four should resign their Senate  seats.  </P> <P> I am especially disillusioned at the possibility that Glenn and McCain are  involved in Keating's sordid Lincoln S&amp;L mess. Glenn has been one of our  national role models. And McCain earned our admiration for his steadfast  courage despite years of torture while a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. How  could they?  </P> <P> If these senators lied recently in denying Gray's account of their closed-door  meeting with him, they have sunk to a new low.  </P> <P> JERRY COWLE  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

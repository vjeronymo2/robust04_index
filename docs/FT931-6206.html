			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: K mart advances 9.5% for year on slow sales growth K MART, the US retail group which operates around 2,400 discount stores as well as several chains of specialist stores, yesterday reported a 9.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits for the year to January 27. However same-store sales growth for the group overall was a modest 2.6 per cent. The company made after-tax profits of Dollars 941m in the 52-week period, up from Dollars 859m in the previous year. After-tax profits in the fourth, and most important, quarter rose by 11.7 per cent, to Dollars 535m. Earnings per share increased more modestly. Due to an issue of equity-based securities in 1991, the figure for the last quarter increased to Dollars 1.15 from Dollars 1.06, while for the year it was up by 2 per cent at Dollars 2.06. Total sales in the final quarter increased from Dollars 10.6bn to Dollars 11.5bn. For the year, there was a 9.1 per cent increase to Dollars 37.7bn. K mart said that its gross margin for the year had slipped to 24.5 per cent of sales, compared with 25 per cent. This reflected 'increased clearance markdowns of spring and summer merchandise lines, especially apparel'. K mart also noted that there was a greater sales contribution from its PACE warehouse club chain, where margins are particularly low. However, K mart added that the margin pressure had been greatest early in the year and that there had been an 'excellent sell-through' of seasonal merchandise during the Christmas season. In the main general merchandise division, comparable store sales rose by a modest 1.5 per cent, although operating profits increased by 11.9 per cent to Dollars 1.56bn. The specialty retail chains overall saw a 5.7 per cent rise in same-store sales, with operating profits rising 10.7 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn. The one problem area was PACE, which saw operating profits fall from Dollars 39m to Dollars 3m. K mart said the profits erosion stemmed from poor performance of new outlets opened in 1991 and 1992, but that it expected an improvement this year.</p>

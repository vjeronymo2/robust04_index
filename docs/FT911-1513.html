			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Keep up communication with your tax inspector YOU stated (Q&amp;A Briefcase, March 30) that it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to check that the right amount of tax has been paid. How long has this been operating? I have always assumed that if the Inland Revenue did not raise an assessment, or under-assessed an individual, one could get away with it. I bought some shares under the Business Expansion Scheme in 1986, receiving tax relief on my investment from the Inland Revenue. I sold some of these shares before the minimum five-year period had elapsed and understand that I am liable to pay back to the Inland Revenue that part of the tax relief that relates to the number of shares I sold. Do I have to advise the Inland Revenue that I have disposed of these shares or can I wait until the Revenue raises a demand for the tax? Section 310 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (which re-enacts the original 1983 legislation) you are obliged to notify your tax inspector of the sale within 60 days. Failure to do so risks a potential penalty of Pounds 300 under section 98 of the Taxes Management Act 1970. The rules are outlined in the free pamphlet on the BES: IR51. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / World Trade News: French coaxed back into farm trade fold - Gunsmoke has cleared but EC divisions remain FRANCE's long-running campaign to secure a more favourable deal on farm exports in the Gatt world trade talks may have been decided in a brief but explosive encounter in the early hours of yesterday morning. Around midnight, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief negotiator, tore into a proposed Franco-German draft seeking 'clarifications' on the EC-US Blair House agreement limiting farm trade exports. Drawing on his skills as a former barrister, Sir Leon coolly picked apart the draft on the grounds that it risked tying his hands in future negotiations with the US. The intervention provoked a furious reaction from Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister. He reminded Sir Leon - a former UK cabinet minister - that he was a mere 'official' who would kindly take his orders from the assembled EC ministers in the Gatt trade negotiations. Around 4am, after more than 12 hours of talks between 35 EC foreign, farm and trade ministers, Sir Leon emerged with a second compromise agreement which he said had cleared the air. 'I hope we can now avoid the atmosphere of drama and crisis, returning to the Gatt to the humdrum plain of normal negotiations. The atmosphere of the OK Corral has disappeared.' A judgment on the outcome of the crisis talks depends on which of the two gunslingers came out on top. The initial reaction in Brussels yesterday was that Sir Leon had bettered Mr Juppe, though the victory is far from final. In the run-up to the Monday 'jumbo' meeting of EC ministers, it was clear that the Belgian presidency of the EC and the European Commission had one goal in mind: to strike a face-saving compromise which appeared to give credence to some French objections to the Blair House accord without, however, seeking a formal reopening of the agreement which could tie Sir Leon's hands in negotiations in other unresolved Gatt areas such as market access, textiles, steel and intellectual property. It was always going to be a tricky balancing act. Not only have the French in recent months made opposition to Blair House a cornerstone of their trade policy, but they have also raised the threat of a veto of the final Gatt agreement which the EC, US and other major trading nations hope to conclude by the December 15 deadline. The Blair House agreement provides for subsidised farm exports to be cut by 21 per cent in volume over six years; the value to be reduced by 36 per cent; and internal price supports to be trimmed by up to 20 per cent. It was agreed with great difficulty, and only after Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's chief farm negotiator, had resigned temporarily because of alleged interference from Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. This same question of how far the EC's trade negotiators should be given latitude to strike deals without having their hands tied by the member states was the dominant issue in the Brussels talks. The conclusions make clear that Sir Leon should be able to retain his room for manoeuvre. It makes no mention of a new negotiating mandate to re-open Blair House; and it only calls for him to follow the Council's 'orientations' in raising with the Americans a number of (largely French) complaints about the contents of Blair House. These include a number of requests: An extended peace clause to prevent the US from taking unilateral action against the EC's farm export regime. Whether to include food mountains and cereal substitutes as part of the export cuts package A mechanism to ensure that the EC can take advantage of growth in world markets, particularly Asia. A 'safeguard' clause which would help to protect the EC against surges in cheap food imports. So-called 'front-loading' which might allow the French and other farm exporters to delay some of the cuts in subsidised exports until some time toward the end of the Blair House target date of 1997. German, British and Commission officials said yesterday that Sir Leon was under orders to raise these problems with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, whom he meets on September 27 in Washington; but this did not amount to an instruct a formal renegotiation of Blair House. 'He only has to discuss these matters,' said one German official, 'if he does not return with results, he does not have to keep going back and forth to Washington.' This interpretation does not square with Mr Juppe's interpretation. Speaking on French radio yesterday, Mr Juppe said that if Sir Leon returned to the next EC foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg empty-handed 'France will not accept the Blair House accord such as it is.' Viewed negatively, the renewed threat of a French veto suggests continuing guerrilla warfare; but a more positive interpretation is that the Brussels compromise offers Paris enough prospect of changes in Blair House to prevent the country slipping into dangerous isolation. 'We kept them in the fold,' said one senior EC diplomat. This presumes, of course, that the US will be ready to compromise too, a prospect by no means clear in the light of the weakness of the Clinton presidency and the strength of the US farm lobby. Some EC officials warned yesterday of possible US counter-demands, further dampening prospects of a Gatt deal by December 15. Early this morning, Sir Leon played down this risk and urged all countries to make additional tariffs offers to keep the Gatt talks on the track. It remains a tough sell in the light of the continuing profound divisions within the EC on trade.</p>

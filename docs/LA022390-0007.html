			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWIMMING;  </P> <P> UCLA WOMEN AIM FOR HIGH PAC-10 FINISH  </P> <P> The seventh-ranked UCLA women's team is on a roll going into the Pacific 10  Conference swimming meet today through Sunday at the East Los Angeles College  pool.  </P> <P> The Bruins defeated USC two weeks ago, 86-54, and Coach Cyndi Gallagher is  hoping for a top-three finish this weekend.  </P> <P> "We hope to equal last year's performance," she said. "We have four girls  qualified (for the NCAA meet in March) and hope to get a lot more. We were  third last year and will challenge (Arizona State) for that again."  </P> <P> Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the nation, and Cal, No. 4, will probably contend for  the team championship. UCLA, Arizona State, and USC will battle for the next  spots. Oregon dropped its swimming program in 1986 so only nine teams will  compete.  </P> <P> UCLA, 7-2 overall and 3-2 in the conference, finished in a sixth-place tie with  Michigan at last year's NCAA meet. The Bruins have five All-Americans and  several other swimmers who can score in championship meets.  </P> <P> For the Trojans, the performance against the Bruins was encouraging, despite  the defeat. Going into the meet, USC Coach Darrell Fick knew that winning would  be difficult because USC was giving away so many points in diving.  </P> <P> UCLA has a much stronger diving program than USC, and because two diving events  are included in dual meets, and scored like the swimming events, the Trojans  were starting with a 14-point deficit.  </P> <P> The 12th-ranked Trojans (9-6 and 0-5) have three All-Americans and several  freshmen who have potential to score at the conference and NCAA meets. They  finished fourth in the Pac-10 meet last year and 25th in the NCAA.  </P> <P> Fick is optimistic that USC will finish in the top five this weekend but will  not be disappointed with a lower placing. Several of USC's top swimmers have  qualified for the NCAA meet and they will not be shaving for the conference  meet.  </P> <P> "We'll be aiming for third or fourth," Fick said. "Cal and Stanford are just  too deep, but we'll be in with UCLA and Arizona State."  </P> <P> Fick thinks the Trojans will improve on last year's NCAA performance, and  expects his swimmers to finish in the top 10. The team was dealt a setback,  however, when Australian distance swimmer Janelle Elford changed her mind about  attending USC after competing in last month's Commonwealth Games.  </P> <P> Elford, the last person to have beaten Stanford's Janet Evans in a distance  freestyle event at a major meet, won a gold, a silver and a bronze at the  Commonwealth games, and Fick was counting on her to help the Trojans in both  meets.  </P> <P> USC's men's team defeated UCLA on Saturday, 69-44, and finished the regular  season unbeaten in 11 meets. The Trojans are ranked second in the nation going  into the Pac-10 meet March 5-7 at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. UCLA, which is  tied with Michigan for fourth, finished its regular season at 9-4 and 3-2.  </P> <P> It was USC's fifth consecutive victory over UCLA. USC had two scorers out of a  possible three in seven of the 11 individual events, including the 1,000- and  200-yard freestyles, in which it placed first through fourth.  </P> <P> After UCLA had swept Cal and Stanford two weeks ago, the Bruin-Trojan meet  looked to be one of the top duals of the year. But the week after the sweep,  UCLA had disciplinary problems and five swimmers were suspended for meets  against Arizona State and Arizona. In addition, freshman backstroke ace Geoff  Cronin missed those meets and the USC meet as well because of poor attendance  at practice.  </P> <P> Matt Biondi and Tom Jager will meet again in 50-yard freestyle match races next  month at Nevada Las Vegas and Iowa. They will swim March 2 at UNLV's Buchanan  Natatorium for $4,500 in prizes, $2,500 going to the winner. That race will be  held in conjunction with the Nevada Short Course championships.  </P> <P> Meet director Dave Marsh, the coach of Las Vegas Gold swim team, has also lined  up a 200-yard butterfly race between retirees Tracy Caulkins and Mary Meagher,  and a 100-yard freestyle race between Rowdy Gaines and Australian Mark  Stockwell.  </P> <P> Caulkins won 48 national championships and Meagher is still the world  record-holder in the 100-and 200-meter butterfly events, and the U.S.  record-holder in each the 100- and 200-yard butterfly. Each won three gold  medals at the 1984 Olympics.  </P> <P> The race between Gaines and Stockwell pits the 1984 Olympic gold medalist  against the silver medalist for the first time since those games. In their last  meeting, Stockwell charged that Gaines jumped the start and should have been  disqualified. Videotapes showed that Gaines did not come to a full stop before  the starter started the race but the result stood.  </P> <P> On March 28, when they meet at Iowa, Biondi and Jager will be joined by Tom  Williams, the 50-meter freestyle champion at the 1987 Pan-American Games.  </P> <P> The race, which will be held in conjunction with the U. S. Swimming Junior  Olympic championships at the Iowa field house, will have a prize of $5,000 for  the winner. As an added incentive, any swimmer who beats 19 seconds will win a  new car. Biondi holds the American record of 19.15 seconds. Jager and Williams  have swum 19.24 and 19.64 respectively.  </P> <P> Biondi beat Jager in the first match race in December at Long Beach.  </P> <P> Swimming Notes  </P> <P> Last month at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand, USC sophomore  Gary Anderson won gold medals in the 200-meter individual medley, the 200-meter  backstroke, and a silver medal in the 100-meter backstroke while competing for  Canada. . . . Also at the Games, Glenn Housman of Australia became the second  swimmer to break the 15-minute mark in the 1,500-meter freestyle, winning in  14:55.25. In the same race, 16-year-old Kieren Perkins, also of Australia,  became the third swimmer with a time of 14:58.08. Vladimir Salnikov of the  Soviet Union holds the world record, 14:54.76.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; Edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Well-informed sources in the Ukrainian cabinet have  informed INTERFAX that President Leonid Kravchuk is planning to  discuss with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday [15  April] the incident involving a Russian hydrographic ship and  the detention of Black Sea Fleet officers by a Ukrainian special  force in Odessa. IF Note: The possibility of a special  Ukrainian-Russian summit was reportedly discussed during a  Monday telephone conversation between Kravchuk and the Russian  Prime-Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. On 10 April some 120  Ukrainian troops stormed a group of conservation ships of the  Black Sea Fleet in Odessa. Several naval officers were  detained. Later they were released at the demand of the Russian  government.    A high-ranking Ukrainian government expert has told the  press  in Kiev that the leaders of the two countries will hopefully  find a way out of the present situation. He said Ukraine  continues to insist on resolving the problem on the basis of  Yalta, Zavidovo and Massandra agreements. (In Zavidovo it was  agreed that the fleet would be equally divided between Ukraine  and Russia while the Massandra protocol implied the surrender of  the entire fleet to Russia -- INTERFAX.)    The expert said it is impossible to drag out the solution of  the situation any longer. He hoped that both sides will have  enough common sense to prevent an open armed conflict.    He said that during the Tuesday talks in Kiev with a Russian  delegation that included the Chief Commander of the Russian Navy  Feliks Gromov and the ambassador at large Yuriy Dubinin no  decisions were made.    The expert believes that the aggravation of the conflict  benefits "pro-imperial" forces in the Russian leadership. He  said that there are people in the Russian presidential council,  in particular Sergey Karaganov and Andranik Migranian, who want  to strip Ukraine of its independence.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman yesterday  evening received a UN Middle East fact-finding mission that  includes journalists from several nations.    The minister spoke about Syria's policy toward the peace  process. He said: We supported the U.S. initiative because it  considered the implementation of UN Resolutions 242 and 338 the  basis for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in  the region.    The minister denounced the policy of procrastination and  maneuvering being pursued by Israel to thwart the peace process.  He asserted that the Madrid conference and the Washington talks  have revealed to the world that Israel does not want peace and  that it seeks instead to take on this or that Arab party on its  own to conclude separate deals away from an international frame  of reference.    Dr. Salman said further that Israel has tried to circumvent  the outcome of the Geneva summit between President Hafiz al-Asad  and U.S. President Bill Clinton by using pressure and launching  a defamation campaign, in cooperation with the Zionist lobby,  against the U.S. President. This is meant to drive the U.S.  Administration to go back on its pledges regarding the  achievement of peace on all tracks of the conflict.    The minister added that the new tendentious campaign against  Syria is part of the schemes of Israel and the Zionist lobby to  mar U.S.-Syrian relations and try to influence Syria's position  that adheres to a comprehensive solution and does not submit to  any blackmail or pressures.    The minister concluded his conversation with the members of  the UN fact-finding mission by noting that the U.S. Government  praised Syria's cooperation with Washington and European and  international organizations in the field of combating drugs.  Israel, on the other hand, is one of the primary countries that  facilitate drug trafficking worldwide.</p>

			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Nissan UK faces Pounds 1.3m damages claim A FORMER senior executive of Nissan UK is claiming damages of Pounds 1.3m for alleged breach of contract and wrongful dismissal three years ago. The action embroils the company in further legal conflict in addition to the current investigation of it in the UK by the Inland Revenue for alleged corporation tax fraud, and its own claim for hundreds of millions of pounds in damages from Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, in arbitration proceedings in Tokyo. The hearing of the alleged wrongful dismissal of Mr Stan Cholaj, former assistant managing director of Nissan UK, is scheduled to begin tomorrow at the High Court in London. It will examine the often controversial management style of Mr Octav Botnar, the company's 78-year-old chairman and managing director. It is unclear, though, whether Mr Botnar will attend the hearing to give evidence, as he has remained abroad since the end of January, when a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Inland Revenue. Mr Botnar was also named in Teesside magistrates court, Middlesbrough, in January in charges brought against the manager of a Norwegian freight transport company, alleging a corporation tax fraud in which pre-tax profits of Nissan UK had been understated by Pounds 100m. The company said at the time that Mr Botnar intended to 'return to the UK shortly', but he has remained abroad. The hearing of Mr Cholaj's action against Nissan UK was originally due to start in late February. It was adjourned for reasons of Mr Botnar's ill health and his incapacity to travel from his Swiss home to undergo possibly stressful cross-examination in London. A few weeks later, Mr Botnar travelled to Tokyo to take part in the preliminary hearings of the arbitration of Nissan UK's claim for damages of hundreds of millions of pounds against Nissan Motor. Mr Cholaj, now managing director of the importer-distributor company for Seat cars in the UK, is claiming that Mr Botnar's behaviour undermined his position as an assistant managing director of Nissan UK. He alleges that Mr Botnar belittled him in front of junior employees, instructed some employees not to deal with him, refused to allow him to attend some meetings within his area of responsibility, and in April-May 1989 took away many of his responsibilities without prior consultation. Mr Cholaj claims that his Pounds 125,000-a-year contract with Nissan UK had a 10-year notice period. He is also claiming compensation for loss of annual bonus of an additional two months salary a year, loss of the use of two company cars by himself and by his wife, and loss of an interest-rate subsidy on his Pounds 80,000 mortgage. Nissan UK denies that there was any breach of contract. It claims that, under the terms of its articles of association, Mr Botnar as managing director exercised the powers of the board of directors. It claims that with those powers Mr Botnar was empowered to assign and rearrange the precise duties of his assistants. Mr Botnar, who holds a German passport, had held the exclusive Nissan franchise in the UK for 21 years. He built up two main companies, Nissan UK, the Nissan vehicle importer-distributor, and Automotive and Financial Group, one of the UK's biggest car retailing groups. The two allied groups, of which Mr Botnar is chairman and managing director, had a combined pre-tax profit in the 12 months to the end of July 1990 (the last audited figures disclosed) of Pounds 142.6m on a turnover of Pounds 1.76bn. Nissan Motor terminated Nissan UK's lucrative exclusive contract to market and distribute Nissan vehicles in the UK with effect from the end of 1991, plunging the Botnar-controlled companies into turmoil. The Inland Revenue raided Nissan UK in June last year. Code-named Operation Bluebird, it was the largest search ever undertaken by the Inland Revenue and involved 135 of its officers and searches of 13 locations. Two weeks ago Mr Michael Hunt, assistant managing director and deputy chairman of Nissan UK, and Mr Frank Shannon, former finance director, were committed for trial at the Old Bailey in London after their arrest at the end of January on charges alleging corporation tax fraud.</p>

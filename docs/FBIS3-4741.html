Recalling that delegates from different countries, regions  and international organizations to the recent 50th meeting of  the UN Commission on Human Rights strongly urged Japan to  approach the settlement of the "comfort women" issue with a  sincere attitude, the article says:    It is an undeniable fact that the Japanese Government is  obviously under obligation to take a legal action against those  involved in the crimes against the "comfort women" and make  compensations to the victims. It is an open secret that the plan  of the "comfort women" system was worked out and carried into  practice by the Japanese military and government in the past.    Nevertheless, none of those involved in the crimes against  the "comfort women" has so far been punished in Japan.    When the international opinion including those drafted as  "comfort women for the army" came in demand of punishment of  those responsible for it, the Japanese authorities tried to  avoid it under this or that pretext.    They allege that those chiefly responsible for the crimes  against the "comfort women for the army" cannot be punished  because Japan has no domestic law on the trial of the "crimes  against humanity" and the period of prescription is past.    This is an open evasion of their obligations under  international law, a shameless mockery of and insult to those  drafted "comfort women" and human conscience.    Facts fully show that the Japanese authorities have no  intention to admit and liquidate the past crimes, the anti-human  crime of sexual enslavement in particular.    It is impermissible for the arrogant Japan which has no  regard for the international law to take a permanent seat in the  United Nations Security Council.</p>

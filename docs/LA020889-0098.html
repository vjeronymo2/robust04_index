			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RESCUING THE S&amp;LS;  </P> <P> THE CHANGING RULES;  </P> <P> DEREGULATION HAUNTING HOME BUYERS, THRIFTS  </P> <P> President Bush's proposal to strip federal savings and loan regulators of their  independence is a vivid symbol of how government deregulation and inflation  have ripped apart the once comfortable order of home mortgage lending in the  past decade.  </P> <P> "In the old days, you had established financial institutions that took in money  at low rates and lent it out at low rates," said David Maxwell, chief executive  of the Federal National Mortgage Assn. "And all of that has changed, and this  is another step in that change."  </P> <P> What Bush wants to do is place the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the principal  regulatory agency for the nation's 3,000 federally insured thrifts, under the  control of the U.S. Treasury as part of a $90-billion effort to clean up  massive, expensive failures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stands for Problems  </P> <P> For several decades, the bank board has served as a symbol of the government's  commitment to housing. The U.S. agency was formed during the Depression to  regulate and foster an industry that was to provide consumers a steady source  of mortgage money.  </P> <P> Today, though, lax oversight by the bank board stands for much of the problems  that now haunt the thrift industry. Though most thrifts do make money, several  hundred are insolvent due to bad loans and must now be bailed out with taxpayer  help.  </P> <P> Home ownership in the United States has long been an integral part of the  American dream -- a key symbol of family well-being, not to mention the  generous deductions at tax time.  </P> <P> Under the bank board's supervision, thrifts played a major role in financing  the housing boom that followed World War II and transformed urban areas across  the country. Thrifts in California grew to dominate the industry by financing  huge housing booms in counties around Los Angeles and San Francisco.  </P> <P> Until the 1980s began, American homeowners were largely a pampered lot,  accustomed to receiving cheap mortgage loans that were fairly easy to get and  had fixed-payments over the life of the loan.  </P> <P> Thrifts had gained an all-American reputation from "It's a Wonderful Life," the  1946 Frank Capra classic in which Jimmy Stewart plays a squeaky-clean character  who heads off a panic at his family's savings and loan.  </P> <P> "Everything about this film gets the blood pumping in the right direction,  straight to the heart," said a review by Motion Picture Guide. "(The film)  deals with middle-class values and around the edges of every problem, and joy  is Capra's personal stamp of sentimentality, or perhaps American  sentimentality."  </P> <P> Those days are long gone.  </P> <P> More typical today is an American public disgusted with the thought of having  to bail out the industry. And homeowners today -- those who can even afford to  buy a house -- pay market rates for home loans and often reel each time rising  interest rates drive up the mortgage payments on their adjustable-rate loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Good Old Days Ended  </P> <P> How housing finance has changed so fast in just one decade is directly related  to deregulation, much of which has been poorly timed and badly handled. As John  Tuccillo, chief economist at the National Assn. of Realtors, put it: "People  wanted deregulation in the worst way, and they got in in the worst way."  </P> <P> The good old days of government succor for American housing really ended the  day that Regulation Q was eliminated.  </P> <P> Regulation Q limited interest rates on savings accounts to 5.5% at thrifts and  5.25% at commercial banks -- below-market rates that allowed financial  institutions to make low-interest loans.  </P> <P> But on March 31, 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed a law that phased out  Regulation Q, raised the maximum deposit insurance from $40,000 to $100,000 and  expanded thrift investment powers. It was to be the first phase of federal and  state deregulation legislation that was to badly disrupt the industry in the  years ahead.  </P> <P> For consumers, the news was both good and bad -- good because savers could earn  higher interest rates on savings and bad because borrowers had to pay higher  rates on home loans. Lenders had to boost loan rates to offset the rising  deposit costs.  </P> <P> The rest is history.  </P> <P> As the decade wore on, the industry's health was gradually undermined by a  combination of factors, including the bank board's lax supervision and  poor-quality lending outside the area of home loans.  </P> <P> The present problems aside, many experts do not believe that housing needs  special government attention any more, arguing that the huge demand for homes  that followed World War II and continued for several decades has subsided.  </P> <P> "The demand for housing is not as great it used to be," said Robert B. O'Brien  Jr., chief executive of Carteret Savings Bank in Morristown, N.J. "I don't know  that we need a special housing finance industry anymore."  </P> <P> Government figures show that housing construction fell from 2.02 million units  at the end of 1978 to 1.62 million units at the end of 1987, the latest year  for which annual figures were available.  </P> <P> Others argue that the old system of favoritism toward housing was simply  unfair. "Since (former President Ronald) Reagan got in, there has been a  feeling that housing is a spoiled brat that has gotten special attention for  far too long," said Sanford Goodkin, a real estate consultant in San Diego.  </P> <P> Today, the nation's housing market is vast, complex and very much dominated by  the competitive market forces. Lenders often sell their loans into the  secondary market to quasi-government agencies such as the Federal National  Mortgage Assn., and customers may go to commercial banks or mortgage bankers if  they do not want to get a home loan from a thrift. Thrifts today make only  about one-half the nation's home loans.  </P> <P> At the same time, though, housing markets in urban areas such as Los Angeles  and San Francisco have become all but unaffordable for most first-time home  buyers because of rising interest rates and soaring real estate values.  </P> <P> What's more, the problem is getting worse, not better, according to figures  just published by the California Assn. of Realtors, an industry trade group.  </P> <P> At the end of last year, only 26% of the state's households could afford a  median priced home of $165,605. To qualify for that loan, the borrower would  have to make more than $51,000 a year, the trade group said.  </P> <P> The outlook is worse in Southern California, where real estate values were  white hot in 1988. In Orange County, it took a family income of $65,672 to  afford a median priced home of $211,402, while it took an income of $55,942 to  buy a median priced home of $180,081 in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Housing for the middle-class does exist, but it is far from the traditional  city centers.  </P></p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Owners' choice boils down brands Owners Abroad, the UK's third largest travel company, yesterday renamed itself First Choice Holidays in an attempt to regain market share. Mr Francis Baron, chief executive since November, said the group's previous unco-ordinated branding and marketing had been the root cause of its poor performance. The group's eight brands - which included Enterprise, Sunmed and Olympic - are being replaced by three. First Choice will be for the mass market, catering particularly for families. The group is retaining its upmarket Sovereign brand. The third brand will be FreeSpirit, for adults without children. The City marked the group's shares down 2p to 107p. Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst at Smith New Court, said this reflected fears that rivals such as Thomson and Airtours would respond vigorously to the launch of First Choice. Both brought out their summer 1995 brochures earlier this month. Mr Jones said: 'Airtours are not the sort of people to say how nice it is to have a strong number three.' He said the rebranding appeared to have been researched thoroughly. 'It's almost a classic business school exercise. Analyse the market, analyse where you are and then bite the bullet.' Mr Baron said that Airtours' unsuccessful bid for Owners Abroad last year had not been the cause of his group's problems but the result of them. Owners Abroad's share of the summer market had fallen from 16 per cent in 1992 to an estimated 12 per cent this year. Operating margins had declined from 5 per cent in 1991 to 2 per cent last year. The proliferation of Owners Abroad's brands meant that none could be supported properly, Mr Baron said. Thomson last year spent Pounds 15m advertising two brands. Airtours spent Pounds 8.3m on two brands. By contrast, Owners Abroad spent Pounds 4.5m on eight brands. The result was a lack of consumer awareness. In a recent survey, only 3 per cent of consumers showed an unprompted awareness of any of the Owners Abroad brands. By contrast, 55 per cent were aware of Thomson. Many thought Owners Abroad was a timeshare company. Mr Baron said a Pounds 5m provision for the change would be taken in this year's accounts. He hoped the move would help win back 1 percentage point of lost market share next summer.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY TRIO DOMINATES L. A. JUNIOR GOLF EVENT  </P> <P> Three Valley entrants swept the girls' division in the 40th Los Angeles Junior  Golf Championships on Tuesday, with 15-year-old Emilee Klein of Studio City  shooting an even-par 72 for a two-stroke victory at the Sepulveda golf courses  in Encino.  </P> <P> Klein, who shot a 75 the first day, had a total of 147. Heidi Voorhees, 16, of  North Hollywood, shot a 78 in the final round of the two-day event and finished  second at 149 while Renee Hunt, 16, also of North Hollywood, had rounds of 76  and 75 for a 151 and third place.  </P> <P> In the boys' division, Chris Tidland, a senior at Valencia High in Placentia,  was an easy winner, compiling a two-day score of 143. His rounds of 70 and 73  gave him a four-stroke win.  </P> <P> Klein, a sophomore at Notre Dame High, began the day four strokes behind  Voorhees. But an even-par round that included three birdies and three bogeys  was enough to overhaul the first-day leader. Klein won the 11-and-under  division of the same tournament four years ago.  </P> <P> "To win is exciting," said Klein, who has played in several national amateur  tournaments. "Winning is important. If I can win here, against this type of  competition, then I know I can win anywhere. This is where the great golfers in  the country come from. This is the place to play if you want to see the best  competition.  </P> <P> "The other girls know I play pretty steady, and that might have put some  pressure on them." Late in June, the Southern California Professional Golf  Assn. will send three junior women and three junior men from the area to play a  team of French junior players at the Paris Country Club. Voorhees, who also  attends Notre Dame, and Klein remain first and second on the girls' list with  four events remaining before the team is determined.  </P> <P> Tidland, 17, was playing in the city's Junior Championship for the first time.  He shot a 70 on Monday but trailed Jim Skinner of Pacific Palisades by a  stroke. Skinner, however, shot an 80 on Tuesday and Tidland was never  challenged.  </P> <P> Tidland carded three birdies and four bogeys Tuesday, scoring all of the  birdies on par-fives after reaching the greens in two shots.  </P></p>

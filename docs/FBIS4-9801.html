			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Bank of  Mexico (central) has started operating as an autonomous  government organization. Its main objective is to contain the  country's inflation at moderate levels, similar to the ones in  industrialized nations. The central institution has, as of this  Friday, the authority to deny loan requests to cover the  government's fiscal deficits, one of the factors which  contributed greatly to high inflation rates. "Sharp and  prolonged inflation rates are closely linked to fiscal  deficits," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in his  legislative effort to give autonomy to the Bank of Mexico on 17  May 1993. [passage omitted]    The Bank of Mexico's autonomy is based on the bank's board  of  directors, which consists of a governor and four deputy  governors who are to be proposed by the executive branch and  ratified by Congress. On 26 March, Congress ratified the  presidential proposal to appoint current Bank of Mexico Director  Miguel Mancera Aguayo as the first governor of the autonomous  institution for an eight-year term. [passage omitted]    According to the law, Mancera will occupy the governor's  post  for three years and nine months, and the deputy governors will  hold their positions in terms that vary from nine months, two  years and nine months, four years and nine months, and six years  and nine months. The deputy governors are Guillermo Prieto  Fortun, who will occupy the position until 31 December 1994;  Ariel Buira, until the same month in 1996; Jesus Marco Yacaman,  until December 1998; and Francisco Gil Diaz, until December  2000. A board of directors position is a solid one, and the  directors can only be removed in case of a serious misdeed.</p>

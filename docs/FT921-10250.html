			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Letter: No failure of national accounts Sir, I was astonished to read your comment ('Save the PSBR', February 6) that the failure to distinguish between current and capital expenditure in the national accounts is more than mere semantics. Current expenditure has been distinguished from capital in the national accounts produced by the Central Statistical Office since the 1940s. Perhaps you were thinking of some other 'national accounts' of which I am not aware. Jack Hibbert, director, Central Statistical Office, Great George Street, London</p>

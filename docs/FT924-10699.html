			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Directors avoid dismissal at Alliance arm Directors at a subsidiary of Alliance Resources, the struggling oil and gas company put into receivership on Tuesday, narrowly avoided dismissal after filing for protection under US bankruptcy laws. Alliance Resources USA filed for Chapter 11 late Tuesday night following a demand for repayment of Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 920,000) by First National Bank of Commerce, its largest creditor. The move came just hours after Manx Petroleum, the unlisted oil and gas company chaired by entrepreneur Mr Algy Cluff, appointed administrative receivers to the Louisiana-based company's USM-quoted parent. Mr John O'Brien, managing director of Manx and former chairman of Alliance, said the receivers had intended to dismiss the directors of the US subsidiary. The action has also thwarted, for the time being, Manx's ambitions to manage Alliance while it is in receivership. The Chapter 11 action leaves little but a shell in London with shares in the US subsidiary. Mr O'Brien, who became Alliance chairman in May, was ousted just two weeks ago following his claims that the company's assets at flotation were incorrectly stated. Manx appointed receivers when talks to reinstate him failed. Manx is claiming Alliance defaulted on the management agreement, which set out terms for a Dollars 200,000 loan and management fees of Pounds 10,000 a month. The total debt claimed by Manx, including Mr O'Brien's expenses and a proportion of the 2 1/2 p rise in the share price to 9 1/2 p since he took over, comes to Dollars 770,000. Manx also said receivers had been called in light of the winding up petition lodged by Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott.</p>

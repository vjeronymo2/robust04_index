			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "State To Focus on Rural Water Projects"] </F>   [Text] The government will accelerate efforts to ensure  clean drinking water in rural areas, a State official said  yesterday.    Better water should improve health standards and boost  economic development, experts say.    Zhou Wenzhi, Vice-Minister of Water Resources, said 300  million yuan ($34.5 million) has been invested this year in  water works projects, aiding 200 million people in 40,000 rural  townships nationwide.    And the amount of money, including 200 million yuan ($23  million) in bank credits and 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in  subsidized loans, will increase, he said.    In the next few years, special funds are to be earmarhed for  large scale water projects and overseas investment is to be  sought.    The move is needed to meet the needs of growing townships.    Over the years the number of farmer-run rural enterprises  has  skyrocketed, attracting millions of surplus labour [as  published] and causing such problems as air and water pollution.    It is estimated the population in such towns will reach 250  to 300 million by the end of the century.    The ministry has completed more than 7,000 water supply  projects in the last few years, improving the quality of life  for more than 15 million people and accelerating economic growth  in rural areas, Zhou said.    Projects this year, an expert said, will provide one ton of  clean running water per month to farmers in areas with polluted  water supply. [sentence as published]    This is vital because polluted water has been directly  linked  to poor health standards and slow economic development.    According to Zhou, many young people from the countryside  fail militaly checkups due to having drunk polluted water.    "It is of vital importance to the government's efforts to  improve the health of the Chinese people," he said.    Over 200 million of China's 900 million people in rural  areas  live in more than 2,000 counties and 40,000 townships.    But only a minority have access to running water. Many must  fetch water from nearby rivers, small reservoirs, ponds and  wells.    Nevertheless, these townships have developed into economic,  political and cultural centres since China's reforms began in  the late 1970s.    Official statistics show the gross value of industrial  output  in rural township enterprises hit a record 1.3 trillion yuan  ($150 billion) in 1992, a third of the country's total.    And the figure has increased 30 times the amount in 1978,  Zhou said.    With such continual development, more water supply projects  for rural residents are needed, Zhou said.</p>

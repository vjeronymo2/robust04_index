			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / QE2 passengers threaten a sit-in Angry passengers on the Queen Elizabeth 2's ill-fated Christmas cruise are threatening to stage a sit-in on the ship in New York tonight unless directors of Cunard, the liner's owner, come aboard and offer them immediate compensation. Mr Peter Ludlow, travelling on the QE2 on a Pounds 7,500 cruise to the Caribbean, said that about 150 passengers, due to disembark in New York, were now planning to stay on the ship. Mr Ludlow said by telephone from the ship last night: 'They are all prepared not to come off until board members turn up to see us.' Passengers have been angered by Cunard's refusal to discuss compensation with them until they return home. Their luxury cruises have been disrupted by the QE2's unfinished Pounds 30m refit. Almost 500 passengers were unable to sail with the ship when it left Southampton on Saturday because work was still going on in their cabins. A further 158 UK passengers due to join the cruise in New York had their holidays cancelled on Tuesday. Passengers on board have complained of conditions resembling a 'building site' - overflowing toilets, 'stinking' swimming pools and closed facilities. Mr Ludlow said a second group of about 80 passengers was planning to start legal action in the US through an American lawyer who is herself a passenger. Mr Ludlow said: 'It is all getting quite factional here, among the passengers. It is getting a bit like Bosnia.' Passengers on the top-of-the-range round the world cruise have formed their own group, but are unlikely to take any immediate action. All three groups of passengers yesterday held their own meetings as well as attending a meeting with Captain Ron Warwick. Mr Ludlow, who is acting as a spokesman for disgruntled passengers, said he was concerned about safety. He said that building materials strewn around the ship were partly blocking some fire escapes. Meanwhile, an undisclosed number of US passengers due to join the cruise in New York had their holidays cancelled yesterday. The New York office of Cunard said that 1,000 passengers would leave New York tonight on the next leg of the QE2's cruise. But it admitted that it had been 'adjusting the inventory' - fewer cabins would be available - and passengers who could not be accommodated would be offered alternative cruises in compensation.

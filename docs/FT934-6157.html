			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Shanghai steel contract for Japanese A consortium of seven Japanese companies has won a contract worth an estimated Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) to Dollars 600m to supply equipment for a new steel production facility at the Baoshan complex, near Shanghai. The Japanese group, headed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Corporation, signed a contract at the weekend, despite a long history of problems at the plant, touted as China's largest industrial project when conceived two decades ago. Members of the consortium say they have been told by the Chinese partner not to release details of the contract, but the companies will supply equipment for a hot-rolled steel sheet facility capable of producing 2.8m tonnes a year. The Baoshan complex produced 6.3m tonnes of steel last year, and is expected to increase its output to 10m tonnes by 2000, as part of a national plan to lift steel production from 80m tonnes last year to 100m tonnes by the century's end. Chinese steel producers have been unable to meet demand over the past two years of rapid growth.</p>

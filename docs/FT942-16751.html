			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Leading Article: The last board Abolishing Britain's Agricultural Wages Board is, on the face of it, hard to justify on either political or economic grounds. A government which has committed itself to an open-minded consultative process will now find it hard to argue that 10 supporters of abolition out of 4,000 responses represents a groundswell of hostility. Opponents of abolition - which include both sides of the agriculture industry - say that farming is different. They argue that introducing annual pay negotiations into farms where employer and a few employees live and work side by side would mean an increase in avoidable friction. And given the trend towards an ever shrinking number of higher-paid, multi-skilled workers, abolition will not create many new jobs in the country even if it does make those farm workers with little clout marginally cheaper. But, as with many such united fronts, outsiders have grounds for suspicion. Agriculture remains rigid with subsidies and cartels. Handing the authority over wage rises to a statutory body is part of a broader pattern which is at last being challenged in everything from the abolition of the Milk Marketing Board to pressures from the Gatt to align agricultural support prices more closely with market prices. Holding on to the wages board could send a signal of tolerance towards a culture which the urban taxpayer has supported for too long. There may, indeed, be a case for keeping pay negotiations outside the farm, but employers and employees can establish a substitute mechanism for wage setting if the existing system is abolished. It is true that removing the statutory basis would make it possible for opportunists to undercut whatever was agreed voluntarily, but the threat of ejection from the the NFU would be one disciplinary lever. A more telling argument against abolition is that it is unfair that farm workers should bear whatever pain may be associated with deregulation before the farmers have to take the medicine. The government might acknowledge that point of equity, and finesse political difficulties, by promising that the wages board will be abolished in 1997.</p>

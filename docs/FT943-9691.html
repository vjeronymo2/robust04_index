			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Israeli trade rights for Jordan Israel is preparing to make a unilateral trade concession worth millions of dollars to Jordan to keep up the momentum of the peace process between the two neighbours, the Israelis said yesterday. The move came as Israel and Jordan resumed bilateral talks about borders, water, trade, finance and banking, saying they had agreed to use the 1922 British Mandate lines as a basis for demarcating the frontier, an apparent concession to Jordan. The resumption of talks on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea, aimed at finalising a formal peace treaty, came a day after the two states opened a new border crossing 3kms north of the Red Sea. Mr Elyakim Rubinstein, chief Israeli negotiator, said the two would open a second border crossing in the north once its exact location was agreed. An Israeli negotiator said Israel would allow Jordanian imports preferential access to the market in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in recognition of Jordan's peace gestures. A list of Jordanian products allowed access to the West Bank would be drawn up soon. Such an agreement would give Jordanian goods access to the much larger Israeli market as there are no formal trade barriers between the West Bank and Israel proper. The pact will last until Israel transfers the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule after Palestinian elections due in mid-December. Trade experts say the impact of Jordanian imports on Israel's Dollars 70bn (Pounds 46.6bn) economy, insignificant initially, will have profound effects on Jordan which last year had a trade deficit of Dollars 2.4bn. Border demarcation and water remain tougher obstacles. Jordan is seeking 380 sq kms of the Arava Desert it claims Israel has occupied. It wants its 'rightful allocation' (a geographical term under international law) of the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers it claims Israel has diverted since 1967. In joint working groups yesterday, both sides made progress on accords for an air corridor for Jordanian flights over Israel, connection of the two countries' electricity grids, crossing points, and prevention of drug trafficking.</p>

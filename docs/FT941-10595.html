			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Indian exports show 22% rise India's exports rose 22.2 per cent to Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.74bn) in December 1993, extending a surge which began in April, according to government figures. The data will comfort the government as it prepares its 1994-95 budget, due to be announced later this month. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who launched economic reforms in mid-1991, hopes rising exports will help fuel broad-based growth in the Indian economy. Exports in the year to March 1993 grew by just 3.6 per cent due to a slump in sales to the former Soviet Union and because of unrest following the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque. In early 1993-94 exports recovered sharply although the underlying improvement was exaggerated by the late shipment of orders initially delayed by the riots. More recent figures indicate exports are continuing to grow and suggest the government's pro-export policies are starting to produce results. For the nine months to the end of December, exports rose 19.9 per cent to Dollars 15.7bn - well ahead of the government's target of a 15-16 per cent rise. However, imports in the same period rose by just 6 per cent because of continuing sluggish demand for imported machinery and other capital goods. Weak demand for imports has lifted India's foreign exchange reserves to the record level of more than Dollars 10bn, helping to stabilise the rupee and to give India a comfortable reserve. It also reflects a prolonged slowdown in industry. Figures published yesterday showed industrial production in the seven months to the end of October, the latest period for which data is available, rose just 1.6 per cent. Manufacturing output was up 1 per cent. Like last year, industry is urging the government to use the budget to raise spending and boost demand. But there are limits to how much the government can increase its own spending to encourage growth because of a sharp rise in public sector borrowing. The fiscal deficit for 1993-94 could be as high as 6.5 per cent of GDP, compared with a target of 4.5 per cent. Economic growth is expected to be about 4.5 per cent, broadly in line with government forecasts, but the management of public borrowing has been hit by lower than expected tax revenues and higher than planned spending, including increased food subsidies.</p>

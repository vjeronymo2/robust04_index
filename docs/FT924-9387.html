			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: R. H. Macy unveils business plan R. H. MACY, the bankrupt New York-based department store chain, yesterday unveiled a five-year business plan which, it claims, will 'return it to profitable growth'. In a 300-page document, essentially a report to creditors, the retailer's management outlines plans to cut expenses by as much as Dollars 356m by 1998. The measures to achieve this would include refocusing advertising and adjusting the media mix, for a Dollars 91m saving in 1998; reorganising the selling organisation saving Dollars 77m; cutting other expense categories saving Dollars 65m; and introducing a single benefit plan for all employees saving Dollars 123m. The store group said that the plan did not anticipate any increase in sales before 1994, and expected comparable store sales to grow from 3 per cent to 6 per cent a year thereafter. The plan projects that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation could total about Dollars 811m in 1998, or approximately 9 per cent of group sales. Without the measures in the document, Macy claims that the underlying earnings figure would be about Dollars 213m. Sears, Roebuck, the troubled US retail and financial services group, said last night it had won a federal court ruling that would allow it to issue Visa credit cards, writes Alan Friedman in New York. The court said Visa had violated federal anti-trust laws by blocking Dean Witter, the Sears financial services division, from issuing the Visa card. Visa said it would seek to overturn the verdict and block Sears from issuing its cards. Sears competes with Visa because it issues its own credit card, called the Discover card.</p>

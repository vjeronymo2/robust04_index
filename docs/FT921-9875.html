			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Labour attack on defence proposal MR Martin O'Neill, Labour's defence spokesman, yesterday attacked the Franco-German plan to create a combined European defence corps, warning that it could drive the US out of Nato. His sharp criticism immediately won the unlikely support of Sir Geoffrey Pattie, a former junior Tory defence minister and a leading backbench spokesman on the subject. It also reflected a bitter attack on French attitudes to Nato by Mr Richard Perle, the former US under-secretary for defence. The Anglo-American front against the Franco-German plan emerged at the annual Wehrkunde conference in Munich, a gathering which assembles some of the top defence analysts and officials from the Nato allies. Mr O'Neill launched his onslaught with a dismissal of fears that US trade protectionism, and the US budget deficit, were the greatest threats to Nato solidarity. 'These are merely signs of the illness, rather than the cause of it,' he said. 'The cause is the uncertainty created in the last 12 months as a consequence of the floating of the concept of the Franco-German force. The problems this will create are of a character which go to the very heart of the Nato alliance.' He accused France of having 'at best, a semi-detached relationship' with Nato, and called for clarification of how the Franco-German command structure would relate to Nato command, who would have responsibility for French nuclear weapons, and whether the force was intended to function outside Europe. The Anglo-American attacks brought an angry response from France and Germany. General Klaus Naumann, the Inspector-General of the Bundeswehr, said Mr O'Neill's criticism was based on inaccurate reports about the Franco-German initiative. In the absence of high-level speakers, France had to be defended by Mr Serge Boidevaix, the ambassador to Bonn. He insisted that France had always been a loyal and trustworthy ally in Nato.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NORIEGA TRANSIT COSTS $363,694  </P> <P> Getting deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega to and from the federal  courthouse from his jail cell 24 miles away has cost taxpayers $363,694 since  January, when he arrived in south Florida from Panama.  </P> <P> Officials attributed the high tab to the "extraordinary costs of security  details" needed.  </P> <P> The $363,000-plus transportation bill, which was obtained by the Miami Herald  through a Freedom of Information Act request, included the cost of Noriega's  removal from Panama to Homestead Air Force Base aboard a C-130 military  airplane.  </P> <P> The transportation figure does not include the expense of housing, feeding or  clothing the former dictator, who was brought to Florida to stand trial on  drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges after the December, 1989, U.S.  invasion of Panama.  </P></p>

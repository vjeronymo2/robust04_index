			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Letter: EC move on direct mail will create problems Sir, Andrew Hill's article on proposed EC data protection legislation ('Data protection raises EC hackles', April 21) covers much essential ground in this debate but misses some vital points. The proposed directive, in part intended to protect consumers from 'junk mail', will have precisely the opposite effect. There is no doubt that a right to restrict the use of data on private individuals should be enshrined in law. People should have the right to know what data is held on them and who holds it. They should also have a right to have their names removed from lists if they want. The draft regulations with regard to direct mail will create far more problems than they solve, however. For example, the Commission's draft directive says that 'profiling' in the use of computer lists will be forbidden. Thus, if an insurance company selling policies specifically geared to women has a list of names and addresses it will be illegal just to select women on the list  - the company must mail to all the men also. This is nothing short of ludicrous. It will add massively to the costs of direct mail and these costs will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. It will greatly increase the annoyance caused by direct mail because it will truly become junk mail. It is to be hoped that the Commission will take note of the European parliament's concerns - and those of the many professionals in data use and data protection who have made their views known - and amend the draft directive accordingly.

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Observer: Abandoning ship Robin Young, head of the local government directorate in the environment department, has made a miraculous escape from the shambles surrounding the reorganisation of local government in England. He's been a keen supporter of the move towards smaller unitary authorities ever since he headed Michael Heseltine's 1991 rethink on local government. This spawned the Local Government Review which, under Sir John Banham, has threatened to abolish much-loved counties such as Somerset and North Yorkshire. Local business interests are up in arms while county and district councils are locked in a debilitating battle for survival. Tory backbenchers want the whole farrago called off. Despite this, Young has been promoted to become Mr London, the capital's first regional director. What sort of organisation promotes the key manager in the middle of radical changes that have run into choppy water?</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Time on ministers' side over Euro-bill THE Government's narrow escape means the Maastricht ratification process will continue. As ministers breathed again, however, it was evident that urgency was the last thing on their mind. In his winding-up speech to the Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, made clear that the government believes there is 'a reasonable chance' that December's Edinburgh summit will agree a package for Denmark. At the same time, language to harden the definition of subsidiarity - the passing down of decision-making to the lowest appropriate tier of government  -is also expected to be hammered out. If that goes according to plan and the Danish parliament approves a second referendum, a new plebiscite could be held by May. Mr Hurd implicitly made clear, however, that both issues might run into snags. But that is a Community concern and Britain should have at least three months to complete the committee stage and reach a third reading. In the short term, the British government's efforts to press on with ratification will be merely symbolic - a goodwill gesture of good faith to offer its Community colleagues at the Edinburgh gathering. Ministers and business managers have hinted that as little as two days of the committee stage will probably be held before December 12. After the summit, there might be a couple more committee days before the Christmas recess. But as the government plans to achieve its goal of ratification by attrition, the real slog will not begin until the Commons returns in the new year. One government minister indicated yesterday that the initial plan is to allow the normal processes to run their course. Labour will harry the government with ambushes, intent on maximising disruption to its legislative programme. There is a wide belief, though, that the filibuster that it is anticipated will be launched by the Tory Euro-sceptics will soon tire the clear majority around the house who favour early nights and long weekends. Furthermore, aware that the Labour leadership will eventually call for abstention on the final vote, the opposition taste for the fight will diminish, too. 'If people start finding that a bunch of single-issue fanatics are beginning to interfere with their chances to take advantage of their daughter's half-term from school, then opinion will harden against them,' the minister said. Nonetheless, it is plain that many of the fiercest 'oppositionists' are planning just that. Mr Bill Cash, one of the most prominent campaigners, will boast to anyone ready to listen that he has 250 amendments to the bill already tabled, with more to come. If the process goes to March, Mr Cash can expect his personal popularity to be wearing thin.</p>

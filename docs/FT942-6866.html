			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper saga ends as El Abra bid is accepted Long and painful negotiations for 51 per cent of Chile's El Abra copper deposit came to a close yesterday when Codelco, the state copper company, accepted a revised offer of Dollars 330m from Cyprus Minerals of the US. Cyprus has also agreed to lend the joint venture, to be called Sociedad Contractual Minera El Abra, Dollars 299m and to guarantee further bank finance of Dollars 699m to develop the deposit and construct an oxide-treatment plant. The original Cyprus offer, in association with Canada's Lac Minerals, which pulled out in April, had been for Dollars 404m plus up to Dollars 151m in investment capital. The lower price - and Lac's withdrawal - came after discovery that the copper grade was 13.4 per cent lower than originally estimated. El Abra, which is scheduled to start operating in mid-1997, is nevertheless expected to produce 225,000 tonnes of copper cathodes a year. The lower grade means production costs are expected to increase from 45 cents to 48 cents a pound and the life of the mine to be reduced from 19 years to 16. Mr Villarzu, Codelco president, said a letter of intent, to be accompanied by a guarantee for 10 per cent of the offer, would be signed soon. Final contracts would be concluded by June 30. Mr Villarzu admitted that Codelco should have obtained a letter of intent when the first offer was made, and that it had prematurely given the impression that the deal was watertight. Nevertheless, he stressed that Codelco had earned the Chilean treasury Dollars 330m plus a 49 per cent stake in profits. In return Codelco would not need to invest 'a single peso', he said.</p>

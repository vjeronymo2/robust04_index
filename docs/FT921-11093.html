			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Perhaps Wildlife On One (BBC1, 8.30) ought to be re-named 'Nature Red In Tooth And Claw'. Tonight, as so often, the programme is concerned with depredation: the annual return of shoals of fish called the eulachon to the coastal waters of Alaska and their attack by humpback whales, bald eagles, seals and sea lions. We are promised that Bye Bye Columbus on BBC2 (9.00) will not be just another chunk of 500th anniversary idolatry, but a sharp, surreal and offbeat drama in which Columbus, played by Daniel Massey, reviews his own achievements in conversation with his parrot. The 50-minute drama is written by Peter Barnes and the starry cast includes Simon Callow, Jack Shepherd as the parrot, Harriet Walter and Timothy West. Channel 4's impressive series documenting The Falklands War reaches its fourth and last part (9.00). In anticipation of a possible hung parliament, Panorama turns its attention to 'The Third Man', Paddy Ashdown, who keeps on talking about people voting for a 'balanced parliament' as though a British voter was allowed to vote for anything other than one person and consequently one party.</p>

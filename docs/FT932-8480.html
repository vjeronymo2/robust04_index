			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: EC urged to curb cement imports THE GERMAN Cement Industry Federation yesterday urged the European Commission to apply anti-dumping measures promptly against east European cement makers to prevent unfair competition in the German market. Cement makers in Germany, together with other European cement enterprises, filed a complaint to the EC last year. Pointing to the continued increase in cement imports from eastern Europe, Mr Jurgen Lose, head of the federation, said yesterday he expected the Commission to issue a ruling soon. Ironically, the largest west European cement makers have been vying to acquire shares of the cement industry in eastern Europe in order to secure cheap production costs close to the Community borders. In the Czech republic, where the cement industry was the first one to be sold to foreign investors, the Belgian Cimenterie CBR, Heidelberger Zement, Germany's largest cement producer, and Holderbank of Switzerland have bought significant equity shares in local cement companies. Heidelberger Zement is also currently negotiating the acquisition of a cement company in Hungary. But the German cement industry federation argues that imports from these countries represent unfair competition for cement producers in Germany and is undermining the local cement industry. East Europeans have been selling one tonne of cement at DM60 (Pounds 24), while German producers offer their products at DM130-DM140 a tonne. East Europe exported 5.4m tonnes of cement to Germany in 1992, up 50 per cent on the previous year. German cement producers sold 33m tonnes of cement in their domestic market last year. The federation wants such imports to be reduced or their increase curbed by higher custom tariffs and quotas. East European producers represented 75 per cent of all 1992 cement imports into Germany.</p>

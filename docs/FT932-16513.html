			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / French adviser seeks big cut in immigrant intake FRANCE should cut its annual intake of around 150,000 immigrants by about two-thirds, according to a controversial newly-appointed adviser to Mr Charles Pasqua, France's new interior minister. In an interview published yesterday by Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Jean-Claude Barreau, a former priest turned immigration specialist, said that in the present economic climate, 'the right floor to aim at would be in the neighbourhood of 60,000 a year'. A tighter control of immigration, both legal and clandestine, is a priority of France's new conservative government. But Mr Barreau said he did not condone any forced repatriation, such as that of a group of Africans who were dispatched back to Mali last year after camping for many months on the outskirts of Paris. The new government, he said, should rather implement more fully decisions taken by its own tribunals. Every year these tribunals ordered about 25,000 people to be deported, but less than 10,000 actually ended up leaving the country. He also noted that quicker asylum decisions by the government had recently had a deterrent effect, halving the number of requests for political asylum from 60,000 in 1991 to 30,000 last year. Mr Barreau has often stirred controversy in a chequered career which started with 11 years as a priest before he married and turned successively author, diplomat in Algeria, and immigration specialist. Two years ago he was sacked as head of the Office of International Migrations by the Socialist government after he wrote a book on Islam. In yesterday's interview he said that Islam, the main religion of French immigrants, mainly from the Maghreb, posed 'a specific problem because it has never existed among a diaspora living in predominantly non-Moslem societies'. He contended that the main problem for immigrant communities in France was 'poverty and unemployment'.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / De Cuellar considering candidature for Peruvian president Former United Nations secretary general Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, pictured above amid supporters at the Villa El Salvador shanty-town near Lima, says he will make an announcement on September 23, on whether to stand in the Peruvian presidential election next April, Reuter reports from Lima. In a statement late on Sunday, Mr Perez de Cuellar said he was seriously considering a request from several sectors of Peruvian society to run for president. 'I will soon resume my pilgrimage around the country and, on September 23, I will formally announce my final decision,' he said. Earlier on Sunday, he had told the meeting at Villa El Salvador that he was 'an independent candidate.' See Observer, Page 13.</p>

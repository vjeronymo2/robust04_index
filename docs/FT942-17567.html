			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Poland A major fall in prices on the Warsaw Stock Exchange saw almost all of its 23 listed stocks down by their maximum 10 per cent daily limit on Thursday, when the WIG all-share index fell by 1,510.2, or 9.4 per cent to 14,536.9, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw The WIG has now fallen by 30 per cent since March 8 when the market first began to weaken. The latest decline, which started on Monday and which looks set to continue for a session or two after the holiday, has taken 22 per cent off the market's total capitalisation - 108,497bn zlotys last Thursday. The week's fall appears to have been triggered by foreign investors anxious to take profits before the end of the quarter. These disposals completed a month or two during which foreigners realised that average p/e's around the 35 mark were too good to last. Local investors have been selling to accommodate a steady stream of new share offers and rights issues. This week, the Securities Commission (KPW) said that it expected to receive up to 20 new prospectuses for approval in the near future, was still examining nine and had received another three in the past few days. The Privatisation Ministry itself announced that it intended to pass nine prospectuses to the KPW before the break. These include the Polfa pharmaceuticals factory in Kutno, the Poznan Brewery, two major foreign trade enterprises Rolimpex and Stalexport as well as the Stomil Debica tyre factory. Four completed rights issues since January have raised 1,413.7bn zlotys while new share offers and rights issues currently on offer are worth a further 1,559.3bn zlotys.</p>

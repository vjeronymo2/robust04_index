			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (12): The consensus is under strain - The spirit which forged Germany's post-war success is changing AT THE end of September, Germany's most powerful employers' organisation, Gesamtmetall, provoked cries of outrage from the country's most powerful union, IG-Metall, by vowing unilaterally to cancel wage and benefit contracts covering 3.6m metal-bashing and electrical workers. Two days later, senior IG-Metall representatives sat down with leading machine-tool manufacturers in Stuttgart to discuss a common strategy for saving jobs and improving the industry's performance. The two events illustrate the contrasting forces at work in Germany's highly structured labour market as employers and unions struggle with recession and with the need to face up to structural change. There is tension as employers' organisations adopt a newly aggressive approach to negotiations on pay and conditions. But there is also a continuing will to co-operate in the search for more flexibility in the organisation of work. Warnings that the 'social partnership' that has kept the peace in German industry since the second world war is under threat are thus premature. The real question is not whether the two sides of industry will continue to manage their affairs largely by consensus, but whether this approach is capable of producing an adequate response to the structural dislocation now facing the German economy. That the labour market is an important component of Germany's problems cannot be seriously in doubt. On the one hand the cost of labour has been rising faster than productivity and than in Germany's main competitors, while machinery running times and the working week are significantly shorter than in most other leading industrial countries. On the other, unemployment and short-time working have been growing rapidly, and an increasing proportion of the jobless total of 3.3m has been out of work for more than a year. What is more, portions of the economy - such as agriculture and, in some regions, construction - are becoming reliant on itinerant workers from such places as Poland and the Czech republic who enjoy none of the protection afforded the German workforce. The result is mounting polarisation between a diminishing but highly-paid workforce and a growing number of people either outside the formal labour market or with little hope of working again. This, of course, is a pattern familiar elsewhere in western Europe. But Germany's problem is more acute. Labour costs - including the social contributions that have been growing especially rapidly in recent years  - are already higher than in any other industrial country. In 1992, the average cost of manufacturing labour in west Germany was nearly DM42 per hour, of which DM20 constituted ancillary costs such as health and pension contributions. The comparable figures in France, Germany's main trading partner, were DM28 and DM13, and in Portugal, DM9 and DM4. Moreover, Germany's system of industrial relations is among the most rigidly organised in the world, subject to a bewildering battery of government laws and centrally- negotiated collective agreements. Restrictions on working time, for example, meant that the average German worked 1,700 hours in 1992 compared with 1,900 hours in the US and 2,080 in Japan. It is a similar story with curbs on machinery running times: an average of only 53 hours a week in west Germany, compared with 74 in the Netherlands and 77 in Belgium. In the good times, this tightly-drawn framework has had the advantage of bringing order and stability to relations between employers and workers, with the result that German industry has traditionally been freer of strikes than any other in the Group of Seven with the exception of Japan. But it can also be a drag on competitiveness. When things go wrong or when the economy suffers an external or internal shock, industry and labour find it hard to adapt. As the economy ministry's recent report on Germany as a business location points out: 'Social peace based on a productive consensus between industry and labour is an important factor in attracting investment. But when more is distributed than is earned, over time more than social peace will be endangered.' That is exactly what has happened with German unification, the consequences of which are still reverberating through the labour market in both eastern and western Germany. In the west, the economic boom unleashed by unification led unions to push for high wage settlements without commensurate productivity increases: west German unit labour costs increased by an average of 4 per cent a year in the last three years, compared with 3.6 per cent in the US, 2 per cent in Japan and 3.1 per cent in France. The disruption was all the greater in the east. Rather than adjusting settlements to the much lower productivity prevalent there, unions and employers agreed to increase wages rapidly towards west German levels, causing an employment shake-out of a scale and speed not seen anywhere in the post-war industrial world. This goes to the nub of the issue confronting Germany's 'social partners'. To what extent is the corporatist approach to industrial relations that grew up during the long years of prosperity in the west now appropriate? Can employers and unions learn to respond more flexibly to the complex and widely varying challenges posed by unification? The omens so far are not all that good. In the east, the agreement to raise wages towards western levels continues to impose a crippling burden on industry, necessitating heavy government subsidies to companies still owned by the Treuhand privatisation agency and causing many others to close. Earlier this year, the employers' organisation Gesamtmetall sought to achieve greater flexibility in the eastern Lander by revoking the commitment to equalise wages between east and west by 1994. IG-Metall furiously denounced the move as an attempt to break the entire national pay bargaining system, and called its members out on strike. Three weeks later, the two sides compromised with an agreement to postpose full wage equalisation until 1996 and to introduce 'hardship clauses' allowing individual loss- making companies to opt out. But unless productivity rises dramatically, a two-year delay in full equalisation will not make much difference to eastern industry's profitability, and the hardship clause is in practice so tightly circumscribed that it has barely been invoked so far. In the west as well, the social partnership is under great strain, but not to the point of breaking the mould. While the squeeze on profits has prompted employers to take aim at wages and perks, the unions are now sufficiently discomfited by rising unemployment to focus more on the need to preserve jobs than on the pursuit of exorbitant wage settlements. The result in coming months seems likely to be another battle over working time and a moderate pay increase more or less in line with inflation. 'If we can reduce working time further and distribute it more widely, that would be an important step,' said Mr Walter Riester, deputy president of IG-Metall. The government, for its part, is making efforts to improve the climate for industry. It has introduced measures to increase flexibility of working time, for example by easing restrictions on Sunday working and allowing longer machinery running times, and has cut generous unemployment benefit payments in order to curb social costs. Whether all this will begin to address the deeper structural problems that many observers have identified in the German labour market, however, is another matter. Apart from bringing in a raft of expensive job-creation schemes in the east, for example, the government has shown little sign of being ready to contemplate radical measures to get the jobless total down, or to tackle the problem of the long-term unemployed. There was a programme last year aimed at getting long-term jobless back into work by offering them to employers initially at lower than normal wages. But although quite successful in its own terms, it was small in scale and has now lapsed pending further legislation. There are strong suspicions that the unions would resist anything more ambitious for fear that lower wages for the long-term unemployed would erode their own bargaining power. As important in determining unemployment levels is the nature of wage settlements themselves, and there are those who worry that in this area, too, the German system is proving insufficiently flexible. Agreements on pay and conditions reached through collective bargaining at national level, say the critics, cannot make enough allowance for differentials between regions and industries, however detailed and multi-faceted they may be. There are in any case considerable impediments on workers' ability to move. More particularly, national pay agreements by definition cannot reflect the ability of individual employers to fund them. With an increasing number of German companies in financial difficulties, there is pressure for more of a profit-related component in wage settlements, or at least for a looser national pay-bargaining framework which would set basic minimum levels but leave employers greater flexibility than at present to fix precise pay scales. Here lies perhaps the most intriguing current pointer to how the German labour market will evolve in the next few years. For one of the biggest sources of stress at present is within employers' organisations such as Gesamtmetall, with small and medium-sized member companies threatening to break ranks. For them, the modest degree of flexibility built into the national pay-bargaining framework is no longer enough. 'Employers, especially in the Mittelstand, are complaining that they cannot afford to pay the agreed minimum,' says Prof Friedrich Buttler of the German labour office's research institute in Nuremberg. 'They are threatening to leave the organisations and make their own wage agreements. This is a challenge for the unions and for the employer organisations.' Some union leaders are already warning of the danger of growing inequality between different tiers of manufacturing industry, drawing what they see as an unsavoury comparison with Japan. 'Look at Toyota,' says Mr Riester. 'It has good relations with its unions, but relations are worse in the supplier companies and worse still in the suppliers of the suppliers. It leads to the pyramid-isation of industry.' Whatever you call it, as the cost squeeze on the Mittelstand companies intensifies that is beginning to look like the shape of things to come.</p>

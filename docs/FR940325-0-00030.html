			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's action amends the credit accounting method used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ABT program such that manufacturers must utilize the credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated in the earliest model years before using later credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to cover credit needs. EPA believes that this accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure is more likely to produce the benefits intended from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ABT program and will avoid the unintended reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program effectiveness that could occur under the current LIFO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit accounting procedure. Forcing manufacturers to average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first with new credits from cleaner technology engines may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actually encourage a manufacturer to continue using dirtier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology in the years when previously banked credits are still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, to avoid the loss of these banked credits through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiration. The current LIFO procedures could therefore have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unintended and adverse impact of delaying the introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaner technology until manufacturers have depleted their bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of credits. That result would be contrary to the goals of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ABT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, today's action extends the time period for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitting corrections to end-of-year reports from 180 days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the model year to 270 days after the end of the model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. This extension will provide manufacturers a more equitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reasonable time period than previously allowed for collecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first delivery information on their engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons for these changes to the ABT program are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained in greater detail in the preamble to the notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published on June 10, 1993 (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32498).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposed these changes to the ABT program in conjunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the NPRM of June 10, 1993 for the Clean Fuels Fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emissions Standards, Conversions, and General Provisions (CFF).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published a second notice on July 1, 1993 which indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a public hearing on that rule would not address the ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the NPRM, unless otherwise requested. No request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a hearing was made, and the comment period for the ABT portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closed on August 2, 1993. Finally, EPA also split off the ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion from the CFF rulemaking in order to expedite a final ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule. EPA will issue a separate final rulemaking for the CFF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This preamble provides a description of today's action and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes a summary of the major comments received on relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the NPRM and EPA's responses to those comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No public hearing was requested on the proposed ABT changes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and no hearing was held. EPA received written comments from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC), Engine Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association (EMA), Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (MECA), the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Lung Association (ALA), and Michael Walsh. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been placed in Docket No. A&hyph;92&hyph;30 (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has carefully reviewed all comments, and the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion addresses all major comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Analysis of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Meaning of 40 CFR 86.091&hyph;15(a)(2)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 86.092&hyph;15(a)(2)(iii) states that: Engine families within a given averaging set may not both generate and use like emission credits in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMA commented that changes to this provision may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, because, as DDC also noted, &sect;86.091&hyph;15(a)(2)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not specify that LIFO credit accounting must be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA believes that &sect;86.091&hyph;15(a)(2)(iii) clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires LIFO credit accounting. This is based on the text of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provision, as well as the preamble discussion of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in 55 FR 30599 on July 26, 1990. The discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addresses the background and context of the provision and very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly states that credits should not be both withdrawn and used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a given averaging set in a given model year. Both EMA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DDC noted that the preamble used the term ``rolling banking'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refer to FIFO credit accounting. Although the term ``rolling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banking'' does not appear in the preamble to the final rule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ABT program, the term ``rolling program'' is addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble and refers not to FIFO credit accounting, but to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-year credit life, which is entirely independent of credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting. In any case, both EMA and DDC oppose imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LIFO accounting procedures. DDC rejected the LIFO interpretation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis that LIFO is ``illogical and inconsistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the ABT program.'' EPA is in agreement with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement and highlights this point as the main reason for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Environmental Impact of the Credit Accounting Change Need for Further Study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRDC, MECA and ALA raised concerns on the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact of the proposed credit accounting change, suggesting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA withhold making any such change until the agency completed a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more thorough analysis of environmental consequences, including a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the whole ABT program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rulemaking only addresses two aspects of the ABT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program_the credit accounting procedures and the timing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual reports. Given the limited nature of this rulemaking, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not believe a comprehensive evaluation of the entire program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is necessary to determine the appropriate accounting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     ["Message from His Majesty the King to Samdech Hun Sen,  second prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia";  dated 18 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] To His Excellency [H.E.] Samdech Hun Sen, second  prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC].    Samdech: I would like to reassure you that I have no desire  to become the prime minister of Cambodia. I am an old man and  suffering serious illnesses.    This year I must stay in the Beijing Hospital for two or  three months. After leaving the hospital, I must continue  receiving medical treatment until January 1995. I must get this  medical treatment in Beijing and Pyongyang. In 1995 I hope to  be able to visit my most beloved children, grand children, and  great-grandchildren, that is, my esteemed Cambodian people.  Moreover, in 1995 and the years to come, I have no desire to  control the state power.    Please, H.E. Samdech Hun Sen, accept my highest regards.    [Dated] Beijing, 18 June 1994    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

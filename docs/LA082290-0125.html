			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'MINNIE 'N ME' TO HELP MERCHANDISE A MOUSE;  </P> <P> MARKETING: DISNEY RECORDS DIVISION HOPES THAT AN ANAHEIM GIRL'S SONGS WILL  CREATE A NEW LIFESTYLE FOR YOUNGSTERS, GIVING THEM THEIR OWN HERO AND THEIR OWN  BEST FRIEND.  </P> <P> "Minnie 'n Me, Songs Just for Girls," the first release from Walt Disney  Records' new live-artist recording division, is due out this week on CD and  cassette.  </P> <P> Accompanied by a massive merchandising of Minnie Mouse-themed product, it's not  just an album, it's a "lifestyle campaign," according to Mark Jaffee, vice  president in charge of the division.  </P> <P> With such titles as "The Girls of Minnie Street," "Funderful, Wonderful  Friends," "Jump Rope Rap" and "Party Slumbering," the songs on the album  feature lyrics about pets, doing chores, future goals, being friends and  "dressing sharp." (There are two classics: "Animal Crackers in My Soup," and  "Swinging on a Star.")  </P> <P> All are sung by Christa Larson of Anaheim, an appealing, 11-year-old veteran  who cut her teeth on a two-year national run of "Les Miserables."  </P> <P> She's the Me in "Minnie 'n Me" and represents all little girls whom Disney  hopes will be attracted to the new Minnie "philosophy."  </P> <P> "It's a little girl's lifestyle," Jaffee said. "The songs, dancing, the upbeat  flavor of the video that we filmed a couple of weeks ago -- in essence, it's an  entire way of looking at little girls, how they think, look and interact.  </P> <P> " 'Minnie 'n Me' gives little girls their own hero and their own person who can  be their best friend," he added.  </P> <P> The video, which begins airing in September on the Disney Channel and  Disney-owned KCAL Channel 9, is "the first ever short-form video for children  made around one song ('The Girls of Minnie Street')," Jaffee said.  </P> <P> In the video, "you can see and feel 'Minnie Street.' If everybody was part of  this lifestyle," he said, "here's what it would look like. It features 60 girls  dancing, all sorts of activities, humor, bright colors, fun and friendship."  </P> <P> Even though he acknowledged that the video will be used "for promotional  purposes," Jaffee objects to its being perceived as a commercial for the album  and related merchandise. "It's not like an ad for products," he said. "The kids  have to be clothed in something. They're clothed in Minnie-type clothing to  create a visual look.  </P> <P> "You're not going to say, 'I need to get this specific item.' It's like any  rock video that uses certain clothing or props." All the polka-dotted bedroom  accessories, decorations and clothing, Jaffee said, "created the look we wanted  to convey on Minnie Street."  </P> <P> Material manifestations of the Minnie lifestyle will be available for purchase  in stunning variety, however. More than 50 "Minnie 'n Me" licensees are selling  everything from clothing to sunglasses, stationery, bags, wallpaper, rugs,  dinnerware, backpacks, posters, buttons, jewelry, toys and more.  </P> <P> Minnie's "best friend," Christa Larson, who is scheduled to use her perky smile  to promote the album during a round of national appearances, is the calm at the  center of the publicity cyclone.  </P> <P> Jaffee described Christa as "natural," and indeed, although she's been in the  spotlight since she was 5, Larson, who lives in Anaheim with her parents and an  older sister, comes across as unspoiled and very much her age.  </P> <P> During a recent interview, when asked how she felt about being a role model for  her peers, she said, "I kind of like it. It makes you feel good about yourself  when people look up to you."  </P> <P> The little girl with the big voice and wide blue eyes doesn't think she wants  to be in show business forever, however. Doing "Les Miserables" eight shows a  week for two years was tiring, and even though "Minnie 'n Me" was a lot of fun  -- "especially the dancing" -- Larson is "not sure I want to do this for the  rest of my life. I've wanted to be an artist since I was little," she said,  "and I also want to be a marine biologist."  </P> <P> She was hesitant when asked for advice for girls her age, but after a moment's  consideration offered, "Have fun and be yourself. Try to reach your goals in  life, keep trying, never give up, and be good to each other."  </P> <P> But despite Christa Larson's engaging presence in "Minnie 'n Me," it's Mickey's  familiar female friend who gets top billing. The album represents Disney's  intent to develop new children's artists, rather than focusing solely on  recordings tied to Disney movies and cartoon characters.  </P> <P> "Christa is our first recording artist," Jaffee said. But, "we're in the  process of signing a number of children's artists who are not children. In  essence, we're creating music that we think satisfies the needs of the  audience."  </P></p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Big quake strikes N Japan A POWERFUL earthquake in northern Japan, measured at 7.8 on the Richter scale, wrecked a small hotel, set hundreds of houses on fire and swept dozens more away with tidal waves last night, agencies report from Tokyo. Police said that 18 people had been killed and 60 injured, while more than 40 were missing. The casualty figures were expected to rise. The quake was followed by several aftershocks in the same area, off the west coast of the northern island of Hokkaido. Among the casualties at least five people were reported killed and about 20 said to be missing after the hotel collapsed on Okushiri Island. NHK television and Kyodo News Service said about 300 houses were burning on another part of the island of 4,600 people, about 50km south of the quake's centre. A number of houses also were washed away by tidal waves. Three hundred troops of Japan's self-defence forces helped rescue efforts on the island.</p>

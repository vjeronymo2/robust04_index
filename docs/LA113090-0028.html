			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> HONDO'S ONLY LOOKS STRAIT-LACED  </P> <P> Hondo's is a batty little place, specializing in fare I'd be tempted to call  nouvelle Southwest. And like Glendale itself, it might look pretty strait-laced  from the outside.  </P> <P> But get a load of all the waiters in those beachy shirts and the buckets that  hang upside down over the tables, pretending to be lampshades. And then eyeball  the fun-loving office crowd that frequents this place. There is something wild  lurking beneath the surface in all this.  </P> <P> We soon discover what that is. If you can tear your attention away from all the  cactus, serapes and plastic flamingos, you discover that Hondo's is actually  attempting something original. Don't be fooled by those tropical drinks with  the plagiarized names like Baja Breeze and Sonora Sunset. The whole menu is  full of creative, wildly bizarre dishes you'll be curious to taste. Some of  them even work.  </P> <P> As in most nouvelle Southwest restaurants, you're given the opportunity to fill  up on chips and salsa before the server has time to take your order. Here,  thanks to a basket of warm, crunchy chips and a dark, smoky salsa, it is a  temptation you won't want to resist.  </P> <P> Appetizers are found under a section misnamed "little Mexican plates," possibly  because the management may have decided that naming this section "little  Mexican, Japanese and Thai plates" would have unglued the faithful.  </P> <P> Perhaps it would have. Thai-quitos is one of the weirdest dishes I've run  across: rolled and deep-fried tortillas filled with minced chicken and  accompanied by spicy wasabi and a Thai dipping sauce. Say what?  </P> <P> Then there is that traditional south-of-the-border treat, chicken satay -- the  grilled chicken skewers you find all over Southeast Asia. Hondo's serves this  dish with a sweet yellow curry sauce and an oddly appealing salsa made from  fresh banana.  </P> <P> Potato rojas tacos are a dish that is original and still fits the Southwestern  context. It's terrific, steamy corn tortillas stuffed with seasoned diced  potato and onion, with a topping of white cheese and roasted tomatillo salsa.  Now that's getting it right.  </P> <P> Mexican pizza gets it right too: chicken jalapeno sausage with jack and Cheddar  cheese plus several Mexican toppings, laid smartly atop a crisp flour tortilla.  If Taco Bell made one half this good, even I would make a run for the border.  </P> <P> The many choices on this menu render a snap decision nearly impossible. If you  want something simple, like a sandwich, you get to puzzle over such  possibilities as blackened chicken, torta de carnitas, even a charbroiled skirt  steak. All of them are unduly complicated by avocado, red onion and a red chili  mayonnaise.  </P> <P> The traditional Cal-Mex side of the menu is more familiar, but many of the  dishes have been gussied up to confuse you. The Hondo is a quesadilla with  smoked chicken, Gouda cheese and papaya salsa (a combination that works like a  charm). How about a veggie burrito? That would be a flour tortilla stuffed with  mesquite-grilled vegetables and black beans.  </P> <P> Actually, the section called "platos Tex-Mexicanos" is my favorite because it  is the most straightforward. And that's where you find monster plates like the  sizzling fajita: a good grilled flank steak and margarita chicken breast.  </P> <P> The best dish in the section is Corona fish tacos, where beer-battered,  deep-fried halibut is served taco-style, dressed with lime and pico de gallo.  The tacos are lightly fried, and the fish is fresh and sweet. They taste as  good as the ones you get at stalls in Rosarito Beach.  </P> <P> The big loser? Easy. That would be the barbecue baby back ribs, honey-glazed  and served with a mushy corn pudding. Everything on the plate is sticky-sweet  and strangely spiced, altogether dreadful.  </P> <P> That's not a shock, upon reflection. The biggest flaw in this kitchen is its  liberal use of sugar. Even the jalapeno fries have been dipped in a sugared  batter to make them brown up uniformly, making a greasy mess. Many other side  dishes -- corn pudding for one -- are just plain too sweet.  </P> <P> Some of the desserts are too sweet as well. Warm bread pudding makes your teeth  hurt, and the Mexican honey flan isn't much better. I do like the traditional  hot fudge brownie, and the good vanilla bean ice cream that comes on top. But  it's awfully . . . well, strait-laced.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: potato rojas tacos, $1.95; Mexican pizza, $3.95; fish  tacos, $6.50; flank steak, $8.50; hot fudge brownie, $3.95.  </P> <P>  Hondo's, 241 N. Central Ave., Glendale, (818) 243-1701, is open from 11 a.m.  to 10 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays, until midnight Fridays and Saturdays.  Full bar. Parking lot. Visa, MasterCard and American Express accepted. Dinner  for two, food only, $15 to $30.  </P></p>

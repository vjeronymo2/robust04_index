			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Royalty loss hits Kewill shares Shares in Kewill Systems fell 32p to 244p on the news that the USM-quoted software group stands to lose Pounds 500,000 in royalty income in the second half, following the collapse of Microway, its main distributor in Germany. The company, which distributed Kewill's CAD-CAM building services systems, was put into receivership last week. However, Mr Kevin Overstall, chairman, said he was confident that 'any sales shortfall will only be short term'. Mr Overstall also admitted that the group's marketing link with IBM was not yet generating the big orders originally anticipated, with lead times longer 'and maybe a year or so out'. Meanwhile, pre-tax profits at Kewill Systems advanced 23 per cent, from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 2.17m, for the half year to September 30. Turnover edged ahead from Pounds 16m to Pounds 16.4m. UK operating profits improved 25 per cent to Pounds 1.49m. Profits in the US were 60 per cent ahead at Pounds 720,000, assisted by the 'strong performance of the US economy', said Mr Overstall. Group operating profits rose 24 per cent to Pounds 2.44m (Pounds 1.97m). Net cash stood at Pounds 600,000 at the period end. A maiden interim dividend of 2.5p is declared on earnings per share of 12.16p (10.15p).</p>

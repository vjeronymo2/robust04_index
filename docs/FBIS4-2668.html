			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 12 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said today he wouldn't rule out the possibility of  expanding American-led air attacks against Serbs in Bosnia.    "If the U.N. forces there were put at risk, as they were in  the shelling of Gorazde, we would offer close air support,"  Clinton told reporters at the White House.    "Every time we have been firm, though, in the end it's been  a  winner for the peace process, and I think it will be here," the  President said.    It was reported that after two days of NATO air attacks on  Serb troops, Gorazde's Muslim defenders were firing at Serbs in  an attempt to provoke a response which could bring more NATO air  strikes.    Clinton cautioned the Bosnian government forces "not to try  to take advantage of this and violate the understandings  themselves."    He stressed, "We have to be firm in our reaction to plain  violations of the United Nations resolutions, and in what we  said our policy would be."    "We have to be firm in pursuing the policy that we say we  have," Clinton said, "it's our only chance for success."    Russia Monday [11 April] vigorously denounced NATO air  attacks against Bosnian Serbs, warning that the move would lead  to an escalation of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Clinton said he had assured Russian President Boris Yeltsin  that the United States had no interest in using NATO's airpower  to affect the outcome of the war.    "But we do want to protect the U.N. mandate and we do want a  negotiation there," he said, "and I think that is what we are  going to get."</p>

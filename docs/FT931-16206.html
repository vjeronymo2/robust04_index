			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Card processor to shed staff FIRST Data Resources, the largest credit-card processing company in the UK and the US, is to cut 460 jobs over the next few months. The company - which processes on behalf of banks 10m credit card accounts, or about half of banks cards - said the losses would be across the board at its Southend and Basildon offices in Essex. FDR, part of the US-based First Data Corporation, whose majority shareholder is American Express, said voluntary redundancies were being sought, but if too few people volunteered it would seek compulsory redundancies. Its workforce will be reduced to about 1,900 after the job losses, it said. The company said it took the decision because of the 'sluggish' economy. 'Although our business during the holiday season was brisk we do not expect that the volumes of 1993 business will support the total staff size that we have employed,' the company said. It said the introduction of new technology had replaced labour-intensive operations. The implementation of new technology has not been without trouble. Last summer a flaw in FDR's software resulted in some customers being double-charged on their credit card bills. Those most affected were National Westminster Bank's 250,000 Gold Card holders. Bifu, the banking union, said the decision was 'a major blow' for the Essex economy. A year ago FDR cut jobs by 320, and that followed the loss of 166 jobs in October 1991. 'The Essex operation was originally set up to process the Access credit card and employment will have halved to 1,800 in three years,' said Bifu. It said a meeting with the company had been arranged for January 15. FDR expanded its UK operations in July 1991 when it bought the Basildon-based Signet card processor. Signet was jointly owned by NatWest, Midland Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Bank.</p>

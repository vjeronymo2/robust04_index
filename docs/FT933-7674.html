			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / 'Creeping crisis' warning for US airlines INCREASING restrictiveness in the world's skies is a 'creeping crisis' that threatens to cripple US airlines and ultimately the US economy, according to Mr Gerald Baliles, head of a federal commission set up to analyse the industry. Formally unveiling the commission's proposals yesterday, Mr Baliles urged the government to work towards increased access to foreign markets and to cut the tax and regulatory burdens on US airlines. He also called for modernisation of the air traffic control system, including the adoption of satellite technology known as the Global Positioning System, to increase system capacity. The National Commission to Ensure a Healthy, Competitive Airline Industry was established in April to look into ways of ensuring the future competitiveness of the US industry, which has lost Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in the past three years. While many analysts believe the airline industry is beginning to revive along with the general economy, Mr Baliles emphasised that the industry would never be sound without substantial structural change. He said he feared other nations would renege on bilateral airline access agreements because the US had become the world's lowest-cost competitor. He urged faster negotiation of multilateral access agreements to keep US airlines from losing business to protected foreign carriers. The commission also recommended that foreigners be allowed to purchase up to 49 per cent of the voting stock of US airlines - a move likely to face opposition in Congress. However, the change might provide the US with some leverage to pry open international skies, Mr Baliles said. Commissioners suggested that the move be contingent upon increased access to the purchaser's home market. The commissioners rejected a return to the tight regulation of the industry that was abandoned in the late 1970s. However, it proposed that a financial advisory committee be established to monitor the behaviour of at-risk carriers. Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, welcomed the commission's recommendations. 'United strongly supports the negotiation of multilateral agreements - as opposed to conventional bilateral agreements - between the US and foreign governments,' he said. Outside analysts suggested, however, that the commission was really just tinkering, because industry problems stem more from overcapacity and a soft economy than from any structural problem. Mr Kevin Murphy, who analyses the industry for Morgan Stanley, the New York investment bank, said: 'The good news from the perspective of Wall Street is that the report still has a laissez-faire bent, it's more fine tuning than reregulation.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jun (AFP) -- On 12 June, Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered the National Defense  Secretariat to maintain a "unilateral cease-fire" in the  conflict in the southern State of Chiapas, where the Zapatist  National Liberation Army [EZLN] rejected official proposals to  reach peace agreements.    A communique issued by the Presidency of the republic stated  that Salinas ordered the Mexican Army to maintain the cease-fire  and continue to patrol the country's southern border to prevent  any gunrunning.    On 11 June, the EZLN, which staged an armed rebellion in  January, rejected the government's offers and virtually broke  off the negotiations by summoning a National Democratic  Congress, whose goal, among others, is reportedly to establish a  provisional government.    "Attentive to the indeclinable determination of the  government of the republic to preserve peace and guarantee the  economic and political development of the region, which is  immersed in a conflict, the president ordered various  institution to continue implementing programs and executing  actions that were previously agreed upon," the document added.    Salinas also ordered Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis  to continue efforts to find a political and negotiated solution  to the conflict in Chiapas. The EZLN rejected government  proposals but also decided to maintain a unilateral cease-fire  and to continue seeking a solution to the "war" in Chiapas.</p>

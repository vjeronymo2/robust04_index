			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Resort Hotels to raise Pounds 20.6m via rights RESORT HOTELS, which concentrates on mid-market, three-star venues, is making its fourth rights issue in less than four years to fund acquisitions. The Pounds 20.6m proceeds of the 1-for-2 issue will virtually wipe out net debt ahead of the purchase of 11 hotels already run by the group. These hotels in the County Resort and Country Resort chains will bring the number of hotels owned by the group to 25, while another 19 are managed. The issue price is 63p. Yesterday the shares shed 7p to close at 76p. The group estimated that pre-tax profit had increased by at least 30 per cent to Pounds 6m in the year to yesterday. Mr Robert Feld, managing director, said turnover would be roughly 35 per cent ahead of the previous Pounds 12.2m. However, additional shares in issue meant that earnings would fall by about 1p to 7.95p. The total dividend is forecast to rise slightly to 3.45p (3.4p). The hotels being acquired are part of the Business Expansion Scheme. Mr Feld said the purchases, which would be completed in 1993 and 1994, would bring in Pounds 24.5m of debt. Resort's latest net debt figure was Pounds 21m, about Pounds 1.4m more than the last year-end, and the acquisitions could have pushed up gearing to 55 per cent. The pro forma debt-equity ratio after the rights, taking account of the acquisitions' debt, was 21.5 per cent. The hotels will be acquired for just over 13m shares, which after the rights issue will further expand the number in issue by 13 per cent.</p>

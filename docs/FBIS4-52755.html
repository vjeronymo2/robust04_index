			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- School textbooks will pay  more attention to moves among foreigners demanding compensation  for Japan's aggression and use of thousands of "comfort women"  in frontline brothels during World War II, Education Ministry  officials said Friday [13 May].    The officials said the ministry screened textbooks for  fiscal  1995 to be used at senior high schools so as to reflect its view  that there is room for considering compensation problems.    A growing number of people, including women who say they  were  forced to become "comfort women," have filed a series of suits  against the Japanese Government, seeking compensation for  damages inflicted during the war.    Many of the textbooks which mentioned the compensation issue  in more detail than in the past passed the ministry's screening  and will be used by students starting next fiscal year, the  officials said.    The ministry's move reflects the government's earlier  statement that problems among states were settled legally after  the war, but it "reserves the right to treat the women's claims  on an individual basis," a government source said.    Then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks last August  that Japan waged a "war of aggression" against its Asian  neighbors also seems to have had an influence in the ministry's  stance on the issue, government sources said.    One publisher shows a list of contents of compensation  demands from war victims in South Korea, Indonesia and the  Philippines, and the Japanese Government's reaction toward each  of the suits.    Another textbook said there could be problems in the future  if individuals seeking compensation for war damages are ignored  on the basis that the issue was settled after the war.    One author said he was surprised that the ministry did not  ask him to cut out or rewrite notes on the compensation issue in  his textbook.    The issues of compensation and "comfort women" are only  mentioned as facts in some of the textbooks that are currently  being used for fiscal 1994, which started last month.</p>

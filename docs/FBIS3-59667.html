			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 26 August, the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry (MITI) announced the outline of the new tax system  required by the 1994 tax system reforms. Five tax incentives  including ones for information management, investments in Japan,  and energy and two reserve fund systems were established. In  addition, the current corporate restoration system for  businesses in the red that was suspended will be revived. In the  long-term depressed domestic economy, these tax incentives are  established to stimulate the recovery of equipment investment.  At the same time, recovery funds for businesses which continue  to be in the red are earmarked as sources of revenue for  restructuring.    The new tax systems established by MITI are the High-Level  Information Management Tax Incentive, the Corporate Investment  in Japan for Opening the Market Tax Incentive, the Senior  Citizen and Disabled Persons Participation in Society Tax  Incentive, the International Joint Research Tax Incentive, the  Investment for Strengthening the Energy Supply and Demand Tax  Incentive, the Reserve System for Investments in Establishing  Small and Mid-Sized Enterprises, and the Thermal Exchange  Reserve Fund System.    The content of the new tax system settled on so far includes  a tax deduction of 7&percnt; for purchasing (including leasing)  equipment or a 30&percnt; special refund system for improved  information management. There is a tax deduction for users of  system integration (SI) contracts. Investments to open the  Japanese market are limited to 10 years following establishment.  When sales in Japan exceed 2&percnt; of the highest previous  total,  the increase is limited to 5&percnt;. In addition, the amount of  one  half of the rate of increase multiplied by total increase is a  tax deduction.    The Senior Citizen and Disabled Persons Participation in  Society Tax Incentive sets up a 3&percnt; special refund system  for  the introduction of support equipment. A 6&percnt; tax deduction  of  research costs is provided in the International Joint Research  Tax Incentive.    The Investment for Strengthening the Energy Supply and  Demand  Tax Incentive promotes advances in energy conservation,  renewable energy, and thermal-electric cogeneration, as well as  providing for the stable supply of oil and natural gas. A  7&percnt;  tax deduction of the total acquisition costs and a special  refund of 30&percnt; for the first year have been approved.    In order to support the establishment of small and mid-sized  businesses by investment, lending, and start-up companies, in  the investment losses in establishing small and mid-sized  enterprises based on the new reserve system, up to 20&percnt; of  the  capital invested annually will not be taxed and a reserve fund  will be accumulated. Depreciation is applied when losses in  investments occur during the establishment of a business. The  remaining depreciation is introduced as profit after five years.    The Thermal Exchange Reserve Fund System is diredcted at gas  companies in small and medium-sized cities (240 companies). The  system allows the expenses required to convert to high-calorie  gas to be accumulated over a five-year period as a reserve fund  and for loss inclusion.</p>

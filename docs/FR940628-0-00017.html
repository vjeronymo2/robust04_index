The ABPO Rule prohibited the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing products in three stages over 7 years beginning in 1990. On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (the court) vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. In a subsequent clarification, the court said the rule continued to govern asbestos-containing products that were not being manufactured, imported, or processed on July 12, 1989. EPA conducted a factfinding and concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories in the ABPO Rule were not being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. This document revises the CFR to conform to the findings of EPA in accordance with the court decision, and requires no notice and public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This document is effective on June 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Susan B.

The court left it to EPA to resolve any factual disputes about which product categories in the ABPO Rule were no longer in commerce on July 12, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, in order to determine which product categories in the ABPO Rule were still subject to the rule, EPA published a document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 2, 1992 (57 FR 11364), that requested information on the commercial status on July 12, 1989, of 14 product categories in the rule that may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported when the rule was published on July 12, 1989. In addition, EPA solicited information on the commercial status of any other product category in the ABPO Rule that also may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989. EPA supplemented the original information in the RIA with the comments received in response to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice and with additional research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA published a document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of November 5, 1993 (58 FR 58964), that announced its findings concerning the regulatory status of the product categories in the ABPO Rule. EPA concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories were not being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. The remaining product categories were being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and are no longer subject to the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, EPA is issuing this document to revise the language of the ABPO Rule in the CFR to conform to the October 1991 court decision that remanded the rule and to the November 1992 factual findings of EPA, in accordance with the court decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 763  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Asbestos, Hazardous substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Victor J.

In &sect;763.173 by revising the section heading and paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (g) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;763.173 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Persons who are subject to the prohibitions imposed by &sect;&sect;763.165, 763.167, or 763.169 may file an application for an exemption. Persons whose exemption applications are approved by the Agency may manufacture, import, process, or distribute in commerce the banned product as specified in the Agency's approval of the application. No applicant for an exemption may continue the banned activity that is the subject of an exemption application after the effective date of the ban unless the Agency has granted the exemption or the applicant receives an extension under paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Application filing dates. (1) Applications for products affected by the prohibitions under 763.165(a) and 763.167(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Applications for products affected by the ban under 763.169(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Applications for products affected by the ban under 763.165(b) and 763.167(b) may not be submitted prior to February 27, 1995. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Applications for products affected by the ban under &sect;763.169(b) may not be submitted prior to February 26, 1996. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 26, 1996, will be either granted or denied by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 26, 1996, will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Agency will consider an application for an exemption from a ban under &sect;763.169 for a product at the same time the applicant submits an application for an exemption from a ban under &sect;763.165 or &sect;763.167 for that product. EPA will grant an exemption at that time from a ban under &sect;763.169 if the Agency determines it appropriate to do so. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If the Agency denies an application less than 30 days before the effective date of a ban for a product, the applicant can continue the activity for 30 days after receipt of the denial from the Agency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) If the Agency fails to meet the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section for granting or denying a complete application in instances in which the deadline is before the effective date of the ban to which the application applies, the applicant will be granted an extension of 1 year from the Agency's deadline date. During this extension period the applicant may continue the activity that is the subject of the exemption application. The Agency will either grant or deny the application during the extension period. The extension period will terminate either on the date the Agency grants the application or 30 days after the applicant receives the Agency's denial of the application. However, no extension will be granted if the Agency is scheduled to grant or deny an application at some date after the effective date of the ban, pursuant to the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Where to file.

If the application is substantially inadequate to allow the Agency to make a reasoned judgment on any of the information required in paragraph (d) of this section and the Agency chooses to request additional information from the applicant, the Agency may also determine that an extension period provided for in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is unavailable to the applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15676 Filed 6&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

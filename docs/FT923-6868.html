			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Delay in recovery to 1994 forecast BRITAIN faces four more quarters of negative growth with a recovery delayed until 1994, Professor Doug McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, said yesterday. The prediction by one of the UK's leading economists - speaking for himself and not on behalf of the CBI - is far gloomier than most published City forecasts. It underlines growing fears about a long period of economic inertia. Prof McWilliams, who has a high reputation at the Treasury, predicts that the economy will contract by 1 per cent this year, after a fall of 2.4 per cent last year. He thinks gross domestic product will be flat next year and expand 2 per cent in 1994. Prof McWilliams said inflation was likely to fall to 2 per cent next year and 1 per cent in 1994. He set out his views in a report published by the Chartered Institute of Marketing - an organisation to which he is economic adviser, a post separate from his role at the CBI. The consensus among City economists for this year is that the economy will shrink by about 0.5 per cent, followed by a modest upturn in 1993. The CBI's latest published forecast is for 1 per cent growth this year, followed by expansion of 3 per cent next year. Prof McWilliams said his prediction of no growth next year followed from what he predicted will be fragile economic activity in the second half of this year. 'Businesses are likely to cut back on spending, while consumer demand will remain weak,' he said. '1993 is going to start with Britain in quite a depressed position, with many companies looking exposed.' Prof McWilliams said growth should start to pick up about mid-1993, with businesses rather than consumers being responsible for most of the upturn. High mortgages coupled with rising unemployment and weak house prices would be likely to put a clamp on spending, he said in the institute's report. Even though businesses faced problems over the next year, three potential sources of growth were likely by 1994, Prof McWilliams predicted. Falling costs would continue to improve companies' cash positions, exports were likely to grow and the privatised utility companies should have large investment programmes coming on stream that would add to demand.</p>

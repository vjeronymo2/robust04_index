			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Strange operatic affairs in New York - Paul Griffiths finds an imp, an icon and a biblical story celebrating New York City Opera's 50th anniversary; meanwhile Boston Lyric Opera put on a spirited 'Puritani' ONE WOULD have to be a very loyal supporter of New York City Opera to get excited about the three works it has just staged in celebration of its 50th anniversary. This week-long event was billed as a 'World Premiere Festival', though one of the pieces, Lukas foss's Griffelkin, had received its first performance back in 1955, when it was a 50-minute television opera based on a tale his German mother had told him - a boy devil is sent to earth to make mischief, but discovers it is much more fun to be human and good. In that form, as a musical entertainment for children, the piece might possibly have had some usefulness, but expanded to double the length, and spread out over three acts before an audience almost wholly of grown-ups, it turned into an embarrassment. Foss did not help his work's case by referring to it as 'American Mozart'. Whatever that might be, this is not it: one might think rather of Bernstein and Menotti, heavily diluted, since the revised score still has a distinctly 1950s sound. One might also think - given that this is the story of an impish boy whose pranks turn sour on him - of L'enfant et les sortileges, though this is to raise the stakes to a point where Griffelkin turns to nothing. It has little charm and less wit, and its deficiencies could not be disguised by the effort and skill in the presentation. Susan Branch provided some cheerful costumes for the things brought to life by Griffelkin's magic; a pair of stone lions, a letterbox, a teddy bear. Diana Daniele did her stuff as hell's grandmother. And Robin Tabachnik gave an outstandingly, sprightly performance as the fooling deamon, though the effect of her bright and unaffected singing was to intensify the wish that we had all been there for the Ravel. Of the two truly new operas, Ezra Laderman's Marilyn had received most of the advance publicity, which is just as well, since nobody is going to be very interested in it afterwards. The libretto was by Norman Rosten, who knew Monroe, and who supplied his composer with a morality play of two-handed scenes in which the central character is seen with others who are mostly types (Photographer, Psychiatrist, Mogul, Senator), mostly male, and, with wearying inevitability, mostly exploitative. Laderman's music slumbered along beneath all this, occasionally making the effort - doomed - to kick itself into life with a ragtime dance or a rhapsodic love duet: perhaps the intention was to convey the dulled senses of one low on barbiturates and alcohol. Once again, a lot had to be supplied by the performers. Hal France, conducting, gave every sign that he at least thought this a great show. Kathryn Gamberoni, at the centre, was given nothing interesting to sing in a long role, but she created a minor sensation as a Monroe look-alike. Set beside its two companions, Hugo Weisgall's Esther was something of a triumph. It worked. It did what it set out to do, which was to project the biblical story straightforwardly and vividly, with music used to give a high definition to each of the characters, through scenes maintaining a decisive musical-dramatic momentum from beginning to end of each of the three acts. There was no pussy-footing about accessibility or eclecticism. Weisgall, at the age of 81 and with nine other operas behind him, goes on writing hard-edged, hard-nosed twelve-note music - the kind of music that maybe Verdi would have written if he had had Schoenberg for a teacher. Charles Kondek's libretto, worded with simple clarity and cunning only in its fluid continuity from scene to scene, evidently had provided the composer with stimulus and support. With three new productions opening on successive nights, it was necessary that all the operas be played on the same elementary set of a few platforms and sliding panels, but the resulting reliance on costume and projection was effective in the case of Esther. Lauren Flanigan was excellent in conveying both dramatic fortitude and close maternal warmth in the title part - 'perhaps the only true heroine I have ever put on stage', according to the composer. But, as so often, much of the best music goes to the wicked. Vashti, the vindictive queen whom Esther has replaced, has a violent solo scene in the first act, backed by an orchestra of steel, and Robynne Redmon gave it a thrilling go. Also excellent was Allan Glassman as the chief courtier and plotter Haman, showing his strong, dark tenor like a sword. While the Opera Company of Boston, long and famously run by Sarah Caldwell, is in the doldrums, Boston Lyric Opera has taken up the torch, at least for three bursts of activity spaced through the season. It shares a music director with the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis - Stephen Lord - and seem seems to have caught too the Saint Louis knack of finding excellent young singers and the odd unexpected piece. Last spring it gave a new chance to Carlisle Floyd's 1958 opera Wuthering Heights; and it has just performed, for the first time in America, the version of I Puritani that Bellini revised for a Naples production that never happened. The point of the show - as surely it is the point of the piece - is the singing. In Mika Shigematsu the company has an Elvira who, though slight of stature, lacks nothing in presence as a voice. She is beautifully in tune, and so expert in the vocal filigree as to be able to take risks in how she phrases and slurs: most she wins; one or two (low-register upward glissandos that slip from Bellini to Kurt Weill) are more surprising. In colour her basic quality is cold and bright - aptly so for a character touched by the moon - but the effect is softened by her musicality and by her restraint. This is virtuosity at work, not virtuosity on display, and the effect is at once touching and admirable. There are also excellent performances from Paul Groves as Arturo and from Raymond Aceto as Giorgio. Groves is a cultivated artist, with a sophisticated tone that seems with him to have become natural; only very rarely can a wide leap catch him off balance. Aceto is a real singing bass, and projects the wise uncle as a singer, a man whose assuring balm is music. This is strikingly right for the piece. None of these characters can be imagined as other than vocal beings. Some imagining along those lines had, however, been going on in Nicholas Muni's production, though thankfully not much, and that generally only at the beginnings of scenes, which then appeared to manage themselves with assistance only from the singers and from Lord's spirited conducting. On the virtues of the Neapolitan version, this production does not have a lot to contribute: the biggest difference is that Riccardo is a tenor, not a baritone, and here he is outshone by Groves's Arturo for the wrong reasons. But with three outstanding and intelligent performers in the principal roles, the opera itself is proudly vindicated.</p>

			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: SAN DIEGO ENTERTAINMENT BRIEFS  </P> <P> Last week's bloody riots in Soviet Georgia so far pose no threat to the "San  Diego Arts Festival: Treasures of the Soviet Union," according to Paul Downey,  spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor. The October-November festival is built  chiefly around the culture of the Soviet state of Georgia. At least 19 died  during last week's rioting, triggered by Georgian nationalists who have  complained that the Soviet government is dominated by people of Russian  descent. Festival organizers were assured last week by officials at the Soviet  Embassy in Washington that "there is no point of concern for the festival,"  Downey said.  </P></p>

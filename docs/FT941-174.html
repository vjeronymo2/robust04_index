			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Treasury optimistic on recovery The Treasury yesterday painted an upbeat picture of the UK economic recovery, and took a sanguine view on inflationary pressures, as it published its monthly monetary report. The report was prepared for the monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, who met yesterday. Analysts believe that the meeting will not result in any immediate cut in interest rates. 'I can't see how they can cut rates now, with sterling so weak and the bond markets extremely jittery,' said Mr Adrian Cooper, UK economist at stockbroker James Capel. The monetary report is mainly a compendium of statistics but it contains some judgmental statements on the health of the UK economy. It says: 'The March CBI Monthly Trends survey was encouraging and suggested that the economic recovery is not running out of steam.' Referring to the recent clutch of economic statistics, it says: 'The latest monthly indicators are again mixed, but still consistent with continuing recovery.' However, there is some acknowledgment of the likely impact of the forthcoming tax increases. Discussing a Gallup survey of consumer confidence in March, the report says: 'The fall (in confidence) may have reflected speculation about the likely effects of the tax rises in April.' There is no indication in the report that the Treasury is concerned about an upsurge in inflation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One of the DCA's requirements is that, before an agency can utilize this procedure, it must have prescribed regulations describing how this will be done. However, the DCA has other ramifications both for public funding, and for the Commission's enforcement process under the FECA. For example, in some situations, section 3717 of the DCA would require charging interest, penalties and processing and handling costs on overdue debts. This could include both overdue repayments and overdue civil penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has an ongoing rulemaking that would revise various FECA enforcement procedures, and is planning to publish an additional Notice in connection with that rulemaking to seek comments on how the DCA might be utilized in both the FECA and the public funding context. Comments received in response to that Notice will serve as the basis for deciding whether to amend the public funding rules to provide for administrative offset, interest and other charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is also seeking comment on the related question of whether, absent implementation of the DCA, it would be appropriate to assess interest on late repayments (those made after 90 days following notice of the Commission's repayment determination) and during extensions of time on repayment determinations, especially those that exceed the 90-day period established at 11 CFR 9007.2(d)(1) and 9038.2(d)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the presidential fund Acts contain no language on interest assessment, federal common law holds that interest may be assessed on debts owed the government, even without a statutory provision granting that power.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Robinson <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Watts Detective Agency, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  685 F.2d 729, 741 (1st Cir. 1982). In particular, a statute is not necessary to compel payment of interest where equitable principles allow this.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Young <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Godbe, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  82 U.S. 562, 565 (1872). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the absence of charges for delinquent payments, debtors have little or no incentive to make timely payments. Without this requirement, debtors may be more likely to pay their private sector debts first, as these generally accrue interest, and their government debts last. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has already established the precedent that it may assess interest when a presidential committee seeks a stay of a repayment determination pending appeal. 11 CFR 9007.5(c)(4), 9038.5(c)(4). One reason cited by the Commission for taking this action was to protect the Treasury ``by helping to ensure that the repayment challenge is a serious one and not a dilatory tactic.'' Agenda Document <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 86&hyph;118, Proposed Revision of Title 26 Regulations (Nov. 26, 1986). Another was that, if the candidate is earning interest on the disputed repayment amount, the Treasury and not the candidate should receive the benefit if the Commission's repayment determination is upheld.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Both reasons are equally applicable to this discussion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another argument in support of collecting interest is that, by agreeing to certain conditions, including an audit and appropriate repayment, the presidential committees have established a contractual relationship with the Commission under which interest assessment becomes appropriate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See West Virginia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  479 U.S. 305, 310 (1987). Also, if a debtor-creditor relationship is established, ``interest is allowed as a means of compensating a creditor for loss of use of his money.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United Drill and Tool Corporation, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  183 F.2d 998, 999 (D.C. Cir. 1950). Such a relationship exists in this context in that, prior to the receipt of public funds, the candidate must agree to repay unexpended funds, money determined to be spent in an unqualified manner, and amounts received in excess of entitlement. 11 CFR 9003.1(b)(6), 9033.1(b)(7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Commission decides to expand the current interest assessment policy, it would seem appropriate that the same interest computation formula be utilized across the board. Under current 11 CFR 9007.5(c)(4) and 9038.5(c)(4), the interest assessed is the greater of that calculated using the formula set forth at 28 U.S.C. 1961 (a) and (b) for computing interest on money judgments in federal civil cases, or the amount actually earned on the set-aside funds in controversy. The Commission welcomes comments on whether this or some other approach should be taken, should additional regulations be promulgated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that there is no specific language in the regulatory text that addresses this situation. The Commission welcomes comments on any aspect of this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

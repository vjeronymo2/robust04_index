			<p>BFN     [Text] Sapporo, April 5 KYODO -- Most of Japan's minority  Ainu remain dissatisfied with their standard of living,  according to a survey released by the prefectural government on  Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. The survey showed  that 33 percent of the Ainu families interviewed on Hokkaido  said they find it "tough" to make ends meet, while another 44  percent opted to characterize it as "somewhat difficult."    A total of 300 Ainu families in Hokkaido, where most of  Japan's Ainu live, were interviewed last June for the survey,  which has been conducted every seven years since 1972. Despite  complaints about difficulties in earning a livelihood, the  survey showed that ratio of Ainu receiving welfare payments from  the government fell from 60.9 per 1,000 population in the last  survey, undertaken in 1986, to 38.8 per 1,000 population in the  current survey.    The survey said Hokkaido's Ainu population stood at 23,830,  or a decrease of 551 over the last survey.    There are few remaining full-blooded Ainu in Japan. Counted  as Ainu in the survey were those thought to have at least some  Ainu blood or those living in families with members who have  Ainu blood.    The survey said the percentage of Ainu children going on to  senior high school increased by 9 points to 87.4 percent, though  it fell short of the 96.3 percent overall figure for Hokkaido  children. A bigger gap surfaced in the figures for those  children proceeding to university or college, with 11.8 percent  for the relevant Ainu population compared with 27.5 percent for  the overall population.    In a questionnaire targeting Ainu aged 15 and older, only  7.3  percent said they faced incidences of discrimination over the  past six or seven years, while 62 percent said they had not.    Officials said the Hokkaido Prefectural Government intends  to  use the survey in planning its future Ainu welfare policies.</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE TEAMS: EL TORO IS TOPS, BUT SEVERAL OTHERS COULD SURPRISE  </P> <P> Four years ago, El Toro High School's football team took its first step toward  an undefeated season by scoring two touchdowns in the final four minutes to  defeat Whitehall, Pa.  </P> <P> When El Toro completed its perfect season 14 weeks later by beating Santa Ana  in the Division III championship game, Coach Bob Johnson looked back to the  season-opening victory as the key.  </P> <P> "It was a storybook trip for nine days and a storybook victory with two  touchdowns in the last four minutes," he said. "We often referred to that game  during the season. A certain charisma was established that carried through the  season."  </P> <P> It marked the last time a county school went 14-0 and Johnson admitted the  prospects of going undefeated are "once in a lifetime." Is it? Could El Toro  relive the dream four years later?  </P> <P> Although predicting an undefeated season for El Toro is foolish, there are some  similarities between this year's team and the 1986 squad that certainly point  toward another banner season.  </P> <P> For openers, El Toro has returned to Pennsylvania, where it will play Wyoming  Valley West in its season opener Friday. The starting quarterbacks have the  same last name. This year's starter is Rob Johnson, younger brother Bret  Johnson, who helped the Chargers averaged 39.3 points per game in 1986.  </P> <P> El Toro has moved wide receiver Bret Sanders to tailback after returning  starter Danny Maestas suffered a knee injury in practice last week. Maestas  will miss three to five weeks with the injury.  </P> <P> Four years ago, starting tailback Ron Chocklet suffered a stress fracture in  his right leg and an unheralded substitute, Aly Diaz, stepped into the starting  lineup and rushed for 1,525 yards.  </P> <P> The '86 team featured a linebacker, Scott Ross (now at USC), and a defensive  tackle, Scott Spalding (UCLA), who helped hold 14 opponents to an average of  11.1 points per game.  </P> <P> This year's defensive standouts are tackle Jeremy Hogue and linebacker Brian  Haas. Both are listed in most preseason publications as can't-miss Division I  prospects.  </P> <P> El Toro, the county's most successful team in the '80s with three division  titles and six league championships, opens the '90s as the top-ranked team in  The Times' Orange County preseason poll.  </P> <P> Of course, just winning the South Coast League championship will be a major  achievement. Two league members, Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo, are  ranked among the top five in the county.  </P> <P> Winning a title in the revised Division II playoffs won't be easy, either.  Seven teams in the division -- Mission Viejo, Capistrano Valley, El Toro,  Paramount, Muir, Santa Barbara and Thousand Oaks -- advanced to the semifinals  in postseason play last year.  </P> <P> If there's a weakness at El Toro, it's at wide receiver after Johnson moved to  quarterback and Sanders to tailback. But for openers, El Toro is clearly the  county's No. 1 team.  </P> <P> Here's a look at the best of the rest:  </P> <P> 2. CAPISTRANO VALLEY  </P> <P> Quarterback Tony Solliday was hotter than the 107-degree artificial surface in  Aloha Stadium last week, passing for 221 yards and three touchdowns in a 29-15  victory over Honolulu Damien.  </P> <P> Solliday was named to the Cal-Hi Sports all-underclassmen team after passing  for 2,377 yards and 20 touchdowns last year. Capistrano Valley's offense  appears to be more formidable than last year when it swept past 10 opponents to  become the county's top-ranked team.  </P> <P> Wide receiver David Poltl showed in last week's game that he's bigger, stronger  and faster; he caught five passes for 48 yards and a touchdown. Free  safety-running back Jeremy Brion had three interceptions and 58 yards rushing  in 10 carries.  </P> <P> The only question is the offensive line, but Solliday said he had plenty of  time to pass and threw to six receivers in Honolulu. "I think our offense is  going to be better than last year's," he said.  </P> <P> 3. ESPERANZA  </P> <P> Keith McDonald, the best quarterback this side of the South Coast League,  returns for his third season. "Keith will throw about 20 times a game," says  Coach Gary Meek.  </P> <P> A bold statement coming from a coach who has used an I-formation, pro set, and,  finally, the Delaware Wing-T in three mediocre seasons. Meek has settled on the  Wing-T and said he expects running backs Mark Parlin and Gerrick Emry to have  big seasons.  </P> <P> Linebacker Mike Burns has recovered from torn ligaments in his ankle and should  develop into an all-county player. Tight end Reid Pullen was most impressive  while catching three touchdown passes against Los Alamitos last year.  </P> <P> "We're going to score some points," Meek said. Esperanza will also be looking  to settle the score with Los Alamitos after losing to the Griffins five  straight years.  </P> <P> 4. TUSTIN  </P> <P> Three top 10 teams -- Capistrano Valley, Edison and Tustin -- played in Hawaii  last week, and Tustin was clearly the best prepared. The Tillers practiced for  six days at Camp Mokuleia, a rustic church retreat on one of the northern-most  locations in Oahu, and the Spartan lifestyle seemed to agree with the players.  </P> <P> Tustin looked sharp in a 37-7 victory over Pac-5. Tailback Ron Goods is the  quickest player Coach Marijon Ancich has coached in five years at Tustin. Goods  averaged 10.6 yards per carry against Pac-5.  </P> <P> Ancich's son, Visko, is a versatile running back who also plays linebacker and  holds on extra points and field-goal attempts. Visko isn't flashy, but he is  solid in every aspect of the game. The same can be said for returning  quarterback Andy Borza.  </P> <P> 5. MISSION VIEJO  </P> <P> Few can match Mission Viejo's streak of qualifying for the playoffs 13 straight  years. But fewer still can match the Diablos' mark of having lost in the  semifinals in postseason play in five of the past six years.  </P> <P> One positive note from last year's semifinal loss to El Toro: Mission Viejo  quarterback Tim Snowden outplayed the county's best quarterback, Steve  Stenstrom. Snowden, who returns for his senior year, passed for 352 yards to  Stenstrom's 178.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Mike Boucher, a big target at 6 feet 4, 195 pounds, teams with  Doug Roberson to give Mission Viejo two excellent receivers. "We should have an  explosive offense," said Mission Viejo Coach Mike Rush.  </P> <P> Strong safety Bill Denny, a three-year starter, is the best at his position in  the county. Denny intercepted three passes last year and returned two of them  for touchdowns.  </P> <P> 6. LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> The Griffins have a 52-9 record over the past five years and have won 20  consecutive Empire League games. Quarterback Todd Gragnano, running back Erik  Mitchell and receiver Chad Millan, the heart of the team's high-octane offense,  have graduated. But there are some equally effective weapons still in place.  </P> <P> Tailback LaQuan Beckton, who played in Mitchell's shadow last year, has grown  to 200 pounds and is anticipating a big season. Split end Tyler Cashman is on  the shopping list of every major college.  </P> <P> Coach John Barnes is predicting that John Collins will be the school's next  outstanding quarterback, following in the footsteps of J.T. Snow, Tom  Williamson and Gragnano. "He looked awfully good this summer," Barnes said.  </P> <P> 7. MATER DEI  </P> <P> A year ago, under first-year Coach Bruce Rollinson, the Monarchs won seven of  its last eight games after opening the year with three losses. Quarterback  Danny O'Neil, running back Kealii Clifford and wide receiver Tino Chavez were  among the county's best players at their respective positions.  </P> <P> This year, the defense is expected to keep the Monarchs in contention for the  Angelus League title. Nine starters, including team MVP Mike Silvey at  linebacker, return on defense.  </P> <P> 8. EDISON  </P> <P> Josh Gingrich hasn't made anyone forget graduated quarterback Donnie Smith, and  J.R. Schusterick will have a tough time equaling the performance of Shane  Sherman at running back. But the Chargers' defense looked strong in a 12-0  victory over Honolulu Iolani last week.  </P> <P> Edison's typically small but quick linemen recorded five sacks and the  secondary intercepted three passes. Danny Steinle, making his first start at  linebacker, was particularly impressive.  </P> <P> The standout of the team is wide receiver-free safety Mike Cunningham, who  caught six passes for 77 yards and returned four punts for 55 yards last week.  </P> <P> 9. TROY  </P> <P> After qualifying for the playoffs the past six seasons, could this be the year  Coach John Turek wins a league title? It's likely to be a championship season  with the pass-catch combination of quarterback Greg Windle and wide receiver  Steve Friedrich returning.  </P> <P> Windle passed for 1,475 yards as a junior and Friedrich caught 36 passes for  633 yards. Fullback Chad Brasington, who scored nine touchdowns, also returns,  as does 255-pound offensive tackle Jeff Dorsz.  </P> <P> 10. SUNNY HILLS  </P> <P> Brian Pizula, the league's most valuable player, has graduated but the Lancers  return two of last year's terrific trio in the backfield. Kenny Overby and  speedy Mike Sullivan should more than pick up the slack for Pizula.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills had won 12 consecutive games going into the Division VI semifinals,  where it was shut out by eventual champion Corona del Mar. Quarterback Jamal  McKenzie is listed in several scouting publications, but the future projections  are based more on his size (6-2, 195) than his passing ability.  </P> <P> Others to watch: Corona del Mar, Orange, Pacifica, Rancho Alamitos, Santa Ana,  Trabuco Hills, Valencia and Villa Park.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY PEOPLE  </P> <P> Delphi Information Systems named Donald L. Lucas as chairman of the Westlake  Village computer concern, replacing Walter F. Bauer, who retired but remains a  Delphi director.  </P> <P> Bauer stepped down because he turned 65 and was at the end of a three-year  contract with Delphi, said Delphi President Richard R. Janssen. Bauer's  departure was not related to Delphi's recent poor performance, Janssen said.  </P> <P> Delphi, which sells computer systems to property-casualty insurance brokers,  lost $710,000 on revenue of $20.5 million in its fiscal year that ended March  31.  </P> <P> Lucas, a venture capitalist and a Delphi director since 1983, also is chairman  of two computer software companies, Oracle Systems and Cadence Design Systems.  </P></p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Travel: A perfect spot, it rains and there's nothing to do - Doug Sager explores the primeval beauty of the Queen Charlotte Islands SOPHISTICATED travellers have been hard hit by the trickling of wanderlust down to the masses, cheap long-haul flights and the opening of borders closed for generations. Where can they go that the neighbours haven't been? Where can they go that has not been 'discovered'? One answer is the Queen Charlotte Islands. There is absolutely nothing to do on the Charlottes. The inhabited part, to the north, is a time warp of small-town life, where the world's largest black bears routinely trash the municipal dump looking for leftovers and where traffic is entertainment rather than a nuisance. Conversely, the southern archipelago, populated by a handful of humans, is a living museum of flora and fauna untouched by the last ice age 10,000 years ago. The world's most impressive totem poles, left standing in deserted Haida Indian villages, are the only guardians of what was once a bountiful and artistically brilliant civilisation. How do you get there? First go to Vancouver on the misty and drizzly western coast of Canada. Then fly direct or travel north to Prince Rupert and take the meandering coastal ferry, 95km across the shallow Hecate Strait, which is racked by some of the biggest tidal shifts on the planet. When you reach the Queen Charlotte airport at Sandspit or cross on the local ferry to the main town of Queen Charlotte City, you will know what rain is. The Charlottes, as everyone calls them, are an arrowhead-shaped grouping of islands breaking up into smaller shapes as they stretch to the south-east. Graham Island, to the north, where the 6,000 people live, is almost as big as the other 150 islands and islets together. Everywhere the climate is wet and fecund. This is a rainforest in the northern hemisphere. Logging is the big business in the Charlottes, with whole islands clear-cut like a Mohican with stubble. Pitched battles were fought over clear-cutting in the 1980s, with mainland environmentalists joining the politically savvy Haida in a coalition against the logging barons and the provincial government. There is still an emotional divide between what locals refer to as the 'hippies' and the 'rednecks.' The Haida, who once flourished everywhere in the southern archipelago, now live in reservations outside the main towns on the northern island. Their artistic tradition has been largely preserved, and they are culturally alert and relatively enterprising. Haida activists have been negotiating aggressively with the Canadian government for administrative rights over the entire southern chain. Haida 'watchmen,' a kind of tribal militia, have travelled to the Amazon to advise Brazilian tribes in their struggles to preserve the rainforest. The Haida call the southern islands of South Moresby 'Haida Gwaii', or 'the place of wonder.' There are no roads and no way to visit these islands except by boat. Helicopters and float planes fly over the islands but are forbidden to land in sensitive areas. Kayak tours are popular with the ecological, bearded crowd, but the waters around the Charlottes are cold and camping is certainly no more attentive to the environment than sleeping on a yacht. The Charlottes are sometimes called the Canadian Galapagos, because of the unique species preserved there when the last ice age passed the islands by. Animals and plants abound. Unique species include senecio newcombei, a yellow flowering perennial daisy, and the world's largest black bear. There are unique types of pine marten, deer mouse, hairy woodpecker, saw whet owl and Stellar's jay. There are also six unique species of moss and liverwort. The world's largest population of Peale's peregrine falcons nests in the Charlottes. Bald eagles perch in house-sized lofts high up 600-year-old trees, waiting for you to toss them a fish for the photo-opportunity of a lifetime. There are more eagles here than anywhere else in Canada. But the more elusive black-footed albatross has an even bigger wingspan, and seems to prefer popcorn, heavily buttered, to fish. Fishing, as I was taught by my boat owner's four-year-old daughter, Charlotte, consists of throwing a line into the water, counting to 10 and pulling it out. Forget the bait. We had a 25kg halibut, barbecued in massive chunks on the boat. As my hosts on the 71ft Darwin Sound sailing yacht were confirmed hunters and gatherers, we ate our own catches of red snapper and the varieties of salmon described to me, in my ignorance of non-frozen seafood, as chum, chinook, coho and pink. We gathered razor clams, rock scallops, pinto abalone and giant Pacific scallops. We tried to shoot a deer, but missed. I am told I ate sea cucumber and goose-neck barnacles. On land, we penetrated 'climax forest' of Sitka spruce, red and yellow cedar. A single Sitka log can have a commercial value of Pounds 40,000, so the argument over clear-cut logging is not just academic. The forest floor is a spooky moss-covered undulation of fallen trees being digested. All 400 former Haida settlements, with their large wooden clan houses, have been reclaimed by the rainforest. But the totem poles survive. All the Haida villages were on the edge of the water. Ninstints, a UN World Heritage site, has the world's largest collection of in situ totem poles. Sailing into this calm and protected harbour, and watching the totem poles emerge from the trees, is affecting. More than anything else, the difficulty of access preserves the romance of the site. Do not look for a visitors' centre. There are other islands with natural hot springs, colonies of sea-lions, curious seals and wary otters. Whales appear and spout off. Negotiating this region, with its sudden storms and wild tidal surges, is best done in as large a vessel as possible. Anyway, nobody is going to rent you a self-drive boat. The western exposure of the island chain is etched with deep fiords, best seen from the air. This is the highest-energy coastline in north America, and Canada's most active earthquake zone. Down around Cape St James, at the bottom - very popular with sea-lions - the current runs at 7 knots and the tidal range is over 8 metres. This water, enriched by the warm Kuroshio, or Japan current, which staved off the ice age, is phenomenally rich in nutrients. An amazing sight is the Burnaby Narrows in South Moresby. Here a channel some 50m wide enjoys alternating north-south tides. At the right time the ankle-deep water reveals crystal-clear spectacles of starfish and curious tropical fish - the single richest collection of biological diversity on the Pacific coast of the Americas. In the shallows, thousands of clams squirt like an ocean of suburban lawn sprinklers. All in all, I cannot think of any place on earth more worth visiting.

British Columbia Tourism at 1, Regent St, London (tel: 071-930-6857) may be able to help, but when I phoned them for information on the Charlottes they said: 'But nobody goes there.' If you do go, do not miss the Haida seafood feasts at the community hall in Skidegate - all the fresh barbecued fish you can eat for Pounds 10.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Debt collectors to seek new legal role DEBT recovery companies are to seek approval to represent their clients in legal cases which are usually handled by solicitors. About 80 debt recovery companies met in Birmingham on Monday to launch the iniative and to form an Institute of Licensed Debt Practioners as a professional organisation supervising debt collection practices. The organisation will ask Lord Mackay of Clashfern, the Lord Chancellor, for authority to launch a legal service so that clients can choose between the traditional route through solicitors and employing a qualified debt recovery company representative. Debt recovery companies see similarities between their position and conveyancers'. It is no longer necessary to employ a solicitor to handle the legal details of a property purchase. The Lord Chancellor's department said Lord Mackay would soon issue a consultation paper on the way in which civil enforcement agents - bailiffs and sheriffs - go about their business and whether any changes in the law are necessary.</p>

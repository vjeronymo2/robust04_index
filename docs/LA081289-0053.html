			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW CYCLING LEAGUE STARTS ROLLING;  </P> <P> PRO TEAMS TRY TO BUCK THE SPORT'S AMATEUR TRADITION  </P> <P> In an obscure shop on Chicago's deteriorating North Side, racing bicycles are  put together that may sell for $6,500.  </P> <P> When Peter O'Neill of Pasadena heard about it, he was scouting for owners,  riders and coaches to flesh out his new enterprise, the National Cycle League.  </P> <P> "Everyone serious about cycling passes that shop's portals sooner or later," he  was told.  </P> <P> O'Neill already had a former Chicagoan aboard, John Vollbrecht of Eagle Rock.  Both were scarred from politics and ready for something new. O'Neill had lost a  bid to unseat Mike Antonovich in the supervisor race, and Vollbrecht had lost  three challenges to Pat Nolan in the 41st Assembly District.  </P> <P> O'Neill was able to interest Vollbrecht in taking the Chicago Fire franchise in  NCL's professional racing circuit, and the new owner returned to his hometown  to get acquainted with Ed Weissler, proprietor of the bike shop. A former  competitor now partly paralyzed by a blow to the head while rescuing a woman  from muggers, Weissler agreed to manage the Chicago team.  </P> <P> If those sound like unlikely ingredients for a new sports program, consider the  Los Angeles franchise. Putting together Team Wings brought in two co-owners who  also had no previous experience with cycling or a sports venture. Robert  Frazier of Chatsworth is the head of Frazier Aviation, a supplier in North  Hollywood, and David Caldwell of Pasadena is an aeronautical engineer.  </P> <P> Executive director of the Wings is Frazier's wife, Susan, who is also a flight  attendant; and the team's prime sponsors are Deryl Lichtenfeld and Tim Robley,  otherwise engaged in marketing their line of professional hair-care products.  </P> <P> The improbable list goes on, with interesting entrepreneurs coming aboard in 14  other cities, and the cycling Establishment has variously branded the program a  pipe dream and its 26-year-old commissioner, O'Neill, a loose cannon.  </P> <P> But prophets of doom were somewhat chastened when, last weekend, the first race  went off as scheduled in Boston. Four teams unleashed riders as a pouring rain  slacked off, and New York blew the rest away with a 174-point finish.  Pittsburgh was second with 50, Boston third with 32 and Atlanta last with 28.  </P> <P> Seven cities are expected for the second race this weekend, scheduled to begin  at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Veterans' Administration Center in West Los Angeles.  Besides the host Wings, teams from Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans, San  Diego, Houston and Seattle will be racing.  </P> <P> Two races remain, Aug. 20 at Chicago and Aug. 27 at Dallas. Each of the 16  prospective owners was expected to field a team in two of the four races.  </P> <P> That's a substantial cutback from the original plan to open with a 10-week  season and 20 teams, with two divisions and a championship race. Now the debut  is referred to as a demonstration and there will be no playoff.  </P> <P> O'Neill, however, remains optimistic that his idea will fly.  </P> <P> High on the list of hurdles is the United States Cycling Federation, which  sanctions amateur racing. Since the fledgling NCL doesn't yet have the  financial base to attract top professional riders, it is getting started with a  lot of good amateurs who suddenly see some hope of enjoying the dignity and  perks afforded dedicated athletes in other sports.  </P> <P> O'Neill has been involved in a running battle with the USCF over sanctioning  and penalties, which has cast a shadow over efforts to recruit riders. O'Neill  threatened a lawsuit, then said a truce was struck in which he agreed to  withdraw it, and Jerry Lace, USCF executive director, agreed not to threaten  penalties.  </P> <P> But Stan Solin, a member of the USCF board and executive committee, said Lace  has received no assurance in writing that the suit was dropped.  </P> <P> Talk of a network TV contract led to another of O'Neill's problems, a mutiny by  some of the new team owners. Described in one report as "the biggest television  deal in the history of U.S. bike racing," it linked the NCL and NBC's  Sportschannel America in a $6-million pact that promised live coverage of the  races -- a first in cycling, O'Neill said.  </P> <P> That news helped bring in some top riders fearful of USCF threats to ban NCL  participants from future USCF events. It also seemed to promise a lot of  financial support from sponsors, but that didn't materialize.  </P> <P> Eventually a huge loan was arranged to get the first season under way, and the  team owners were asked to back it. Many of them were reluctant, O'Neill said,  but most signed. Two of them, however, contacted Sportschannel to request a  delay of the opening weekend.  </P> <P> That apparently spooked the lender and made the cable firm leery, so the  enraged O'Neill kicked the two owners out of the league and went after a new  lender. That effort produced a loan at terms deemed exorbitant by the owners.  </P> <P> Because Sportschannel was insisting that the NCL use one of its producers,  O'Neill said, at $30,000 a race, one of the owners finally suggested, "Why  don't we just put on a four-race season the first year? We can raise that kind  of money ourselves."  </P> <P> Concluded O'Neill: "It's been a good thing. The reality is that the first  season, the owners have to go out and raise support locally, and that's what  the program needs. It makes it truly a people's sport, with the communities  behind each team. We have a new cable agreement that's better, with a family of  three regional networks. It's a three-year deal, instead of the one-year with  Sportschannel."  </P></p>

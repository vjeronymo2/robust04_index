			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Trade News: US and EC still split on farm trade - Negotiators are eager to push Uruguay Round to the fore THE TWO top trade officials of the EC and US yesterday made substantive progress in bilateral talks on the Uruguay Round, but continued to disagree on the farm trade question. At a packed press conference in Washington, Sir Leon Brittan and Mr Mickey Kantor seemed determined to push the Round forward and their dispute over farm trade to the side. There were only 79 days until December 15, the Gatt deadline, they said, and urged the world to get back to business in Geneva to put offers on the table. 'There simply is no time to waste,' said Sir Leon. They then announced that bilateral talks would continue this week on steel, aircraft, aluminium and textiles, and that they would meet again in Brussels on October 13. Under orders from the EC, Sir Leon, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, had dutifully and 'forcefully' presented suggestions for 'interpretations, clarifications, amplifications or additions' to last year's US-EC Blair House accord on farm trade. 'I responded with equal force that we would not reopen or renegotiate Blair House,' said Mr Kantor, the US trade representative. Sir Leon said Mr Kantor needed time to consider his suggestions. Mr Kantor said the ball was not in his court. As one official close to the negotiations noted, although Mr Kantor is showing no flexibility he has a right to believe that a deal signed is a deal done. Mr Kantor is under pressure from farm groups and their supporters in Congress, where he has vowed to be tougher than his predecessors, who often swapped trade concessions for the sale of cold war solidarity. With the North American Free Trade Agreement in trouble in Congress it is no time to be seen buckling under EC pressure. The pressure could increase later this week, however. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, announced yesterday he was to meet Mr Kantor in Washington on Friday. Meanwhile, another key player in Washington yesterday, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, pointed out that the farm trade debate was 'not merely across the Atlantic'. Many Latin American countries have yet to accept the Blair House deal. He has called a meeting of top negotiators in the Uruguay Round for next Thursday. The 116-nation trade negotiations committee is intended to keep up the pressure on negotiators to come forward with better offers in bilateral talks, under way in Geneva, on improving market access for imported goods and services. These negotiations will have to be largely completed within the next four to six weeks to meet the Round's December deadline. Negotiations on services are said to be proceeding well and are putting the finishing touches to the draft general agreement on trade in services, which provides a framework of rules for the continued liberalisation of services trade. The revised draft is due to be presented to negotiators on Friday. But negotiations on goods remain stuck in areas such as agricultural products and textiles, where leading traders have allegedly failed to make adequate offers. Countries are also hoping to complete talks on revised codes of practice for government procurement and civil aircraft by mid-December, to coincide with the Round's deadline.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / UK Company News: And here's to you, Thomas Robinson - Jane Fuller on the thinking behind BM's next acquisition step BM GROUP, the construction equipment distributor and maker which has so far defied the recession, looks set to broaden its engineering activities with the takeover of Thomas Robinson. Shares in both companies were suspended yesterday: BM's at 400p and Robinson's at 12 1/2 p, giving the potential target a market value of about Pounds 20m. The deal being contemplated is thought to be worth about twice that amount, with BM favouring the use of its paper to limit the damage to its gearing. Robinson, which, since August, has been guided by Mr Roy Barber, the company doctor, saw its debt rise to nearly Pounds 64m last spring and it still owes nearly Pounds 40m - gearing of about 100 per cent. BM may also go for a fund-raising exercise to reduce the level of borrowings taken on. Headed by Mr Roger Shute, BM acquired Blackwood Hodge, the ailing international distributor of earth-moving equipment in November 1990. Although the combined group's debt had been brought down from Pounds 110m to Pounds 81m by June 30, the Robinson deal - if completed - comes a little sooner than expected. It remains to be seen whether it would threaten BM's aim of reducing year-end gearing from 68 per cent to less than 40 per cent. Timing aside, such an acquisition would carry out Mr Shute's aim to expand the engineering/manufacturing wing of the business and reduce the dependence on construction equipment which accounted for more than 70 per cent of last year's sales. BM's distribution activities were given a big push forward by the purchase of Blackwood Hodge, which cost about Pounds 55m - mostly in shares which were then valued at 245p each. That deal also accelerated BM's effort to increase overseas sales. In 1988-89, only 15 per cent lay outside the UK; after Blackwood the proportion grew to 65 per cent. BM has grown rapidly to make pre-tax profits in 1990-91 of Pounds 34.1m  - 15 times 1985-86 - on sales of nearly Pounds 400m. This year it is forecast to make about Pounds 43m pre-tax and earnings per share of over 33p. Like Blackwood in the run-up to its purchase, Robinson is losing money. In the first half of 1991, the pre-tax deficit was Pounds 22.3m, just over half arising from the cost of redundancies, reorganisation and stock write-downs. No worthwhile profits were expected until 1993. Robinson was highly acquisitive in the late 1980s under the chairmanship of Mr Graham Rudd, brother of Nigel who heads Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate which has been far more successful with its purchases. At its peak in 1989, when the prevailing share price was 10 times yesterday's level, Robinson made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 25m on sales of Pounds 308m. Since the departure of Mr Rudd, Mr Barber's team has sold the electrical contracting and motor divisions, plus flour milling and one or two other subsidiaries, to reduce debt. What remains turns over about Pounds 150m a year and the dominant parts are woodworking and the Unifix and Nettlefold fastenings businesses. Baking machinery and some specialist engineering companies are also there. Some kinship can be seen between these activities and, for instance, BM's interests in joinery, components distribution and dairy equipment. As with Blackwood, a big rationalisation exercise has had to be carried out, although this time nearly all of it has been done and provided for in the accounts. Mr Barber came to Robinson from fire fighting at Astra Holdings, the munitions and fireworks company which not only needed sorting out at an operating level, but had also attracted investigation by the DTI. BM said yesterday that it expected to make an announcement on Wednesday.</p>

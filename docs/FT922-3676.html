			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Casino to buy rival's food outlets CASINO, the French distribution group best known for its hypermarkets and supermarkets, is creating one of the largest forces in French food retailing by buying the food interests of its competitor, Rallye. The details of the financing have yet to be announced. However, Casino, which has expanded rapidly in France through a series of acquisitions, will pay for the Rallye businesses in shares. After the deal is completed Rallye's present shareholders will own 30 per cent of the enlarged Casino group. The deal forms part of the ongoing trend towards consolidation in the French retail sector. Late last year Pinault, the ambitious distribution company, took control of the Au Printemps group which includes the department stores and the Conforama chain of furniture stores. Casino, which is chaired by Mr Antoine Guichard, is buying the food retailing and restaurant interests owned by Rallye. The combination of the two businesses will create a company with annual sales of around FFr65bn (Dollars 12.1bn) and a workforce of 57,000. The new group, according to Casino, will be the second biggest food retailer in France, after Carrefour. It will include 101 hypermarkets - 44 of which now belong to Rallye - , 480 supermarkets, 2,344 mini-markets and 221 cafeterias. Casino said the addition of the Rallye businesses would give it the size it needs to protect its position in France, before expanding in the European Community. Mr Guichard recently announced that Casino, which made net profits of FFr531m on sales of FFr42.4bn in 1991, planned to invest FFr2.3bn in its distribution activities. The group has embarked on a disposal programme - which includes investments in manufacturing, the Hippopotamus restaurant chain, and petrol retailing - to raise capital for investment. When the deal is completed, Rallye will be left with its clothing shops and sportswear companies, Athlete's Foot and Go Sport.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] NEC Corporation has started the work of choosing  foreign parts manufacturers from which it will import after  concluding that the purchase of parts from abroad is a  centerpiece of its measures to cut production costs. The major  Japanese commercial electronics maker intends to import a  variety of parts used in manufacturing personal computers,  printers, and POS (point of sale system). The Japanese firm,  which aims to reduce production costs by half by the end of  1995, has concluded that with the appreciated yen, the purchase  of parts from abroad is the most effective way to cut production  costs rather than innovation in production lines and design  changes which take a long time. The Japanese firm plans to  develop NEC Technology Hong Kong, its subsidiary in Hong Kong,  into an overseas supplier of parts for it. One staff person from  the Japanese firm is presently stationed in NEC Technology Hong  Kong, but the Japanese firm plans to increase greatly the number  of staff and its subsidiary's technological capability in a bid  to secure the quality of parts that it imports.    NEC's subsidiary in Hong Kong manufactures personal  computers, printers, and hard disk drives (HDD). A NEC  Corporation factory in Japan has already decided to import  substrate for use in manufacturing personal computers from the  subsidiary in Hong Kong beginning this autumn, and the factory  is expected to diversify the kind of parts to import both in  1994 and 1995.    NEC Corporation has yet to decide how high it should raise  the ratio of overseas purchase of parts to the domestic purchase  of parts, but each division of the company will map out a set of  measures to expand the overseas purchase of parts that are  expected to reduce the production costs. The personal computer  division has begun to purchase substrate from Taiwanese makers.  NEC Corporation is thinking of widely purchasing parts from  foreign makers, including NEC-affiliated foreign makers.</p>

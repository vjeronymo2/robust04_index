			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> "Citizen Kane" is headed for the paint pots. Color tests are under way on the  1941 Orson Welles classic, heading it toward full colorization by Turner  Entertainment Co. and American Film Technologies. The Directors Guild of  America has been particularly vocal in protesting the colorizing of past film  classics, and Elliot Silverstein, chairman of the DGA's President's Committee,  says the coloring of "Citizen Kane" is "sickening . . . a gross representation"  of Welles' work. He said the committee would check Welles' contract and if it  shows he had the right of approval of cameraman, art director, costume  directors and the like, the colorizing would be a violation of Welles' original  contract and Turner Entertainment "would be in for some very serious trouble."

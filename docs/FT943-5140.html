			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Quebec warned on independence A growing chorus of Quebec business leaders and other federalists has warned of dangers to the francophone province's economic prospects if the Parti Quebecois presses ahead with its agenda for a quick drive towards independence from Canada after the provincial election next Monday. The warnings reflect the PQ's virtually unassailable lead in public opinion polls over the ruling Liberal party. According to the latest polls, the PQ is set to win about two-thirds of the 125 seats in the provincial assembly. With a PQ win next week all but assured, both separatist and federalist forces have begun to look to the next stage of the struggle, which will determine whether, when and to what extent Quebec severs its ties with the rest of Canada. The PQ's election platform pledges that the assembly will pass a 'solemn declaration' immediately after the election, so as to affirm Quebec's desire to become an independent country. The party has also promised to hold a sovereignty referendum within a year of taking office. In the meantime, it has threatened to shun negotiations between the federal government and the other nine provinces on issues of overlapping jurisdiction, such as welfare and healthcare reforms. A group of 10 prominent Quebec federalists, led by Mr Michel Belanger, former chairman of the Montreal-based National Bank of Canada, warned that the 'solemn declaration' would sow confusion among domestic and foreign investors about Quebec's future. Mr Jean Campeau, former head of the Caisse de Depot public-sector pension fund and one of the PQ's few supporters in the top echelons of Montreal business, insisted the declaration would only be 'a symbolic event', meant to 'inform the Quebec people of the government's desire to hold a referendum to decide whether Quebec should be sovereign.' With only a few exceptions, the business community and federal politicians have kept a low profile during the election campaign. Most have confined their involvement to behind-the-scenes advice to Mr Daniel Johnson, premier and Liberal leader. However, they are likely to become more outspoken about the costs of independence, if and when the referendum campaign unfolds. Federalists have taken heart from polls which show that, despite the PQ support, a solid - even a growing - majority of Quebeckers is opposed to outright independence.</p>

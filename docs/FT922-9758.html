			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian phosphates offer rich pickings - A plan to let foreign investors take charge of exploitation IN THE uncompromisingly barren Sechura desert of northern Peru, where the only relief from moonscape scenery is provided by an occasional scrubby carob tree, lie potentially rich pickings for the astute and adventurous investor. Bayovar, discovered by the International Petroleum Corporation way back in 1964, is one of the world's three principal phosphate-bearing regions - and for the first time in 20 years, Peru is prepared to let foreigners take charge of its exploitation. The investor should not get too excited about the installations - like the scenery, they look unpromising. The road leading to the principal deposit, with reserves estimated at 273m tonnes by Kaiser, the American mining company, was largely washed away in 1983's unprecedented flooding and there has never been the money to repair it. Any one following a map to the site marked 'Bayovar mine' is likely to end up digging his jeep out of drifting sands. The processing plant, more accessibly situated at the water's edge close by Petroperu's northern oil pipeline terminal, looks irremediably obsolete and rusty. Yet the machinery, valued at Dollars 2m, keeps clanking and whirring away to produce some 75,000 tonnes of simple concentrate a year. The mining process is uncomplicated. Bulldozers scoop the 'rock' (in fact it looks more like compressed sand and crumbles easily) from the still-operational smaller quarry while 15-tonne trucks line up to transport it the 20 km (12 miles) to the plant. Basic sorting, crushing, filtration and drying produces a concentrate with up to 31 per cent PO (in the mine the phosphate concentration is between 17 and 22 per cent). Phosphate is an environmentally-friendly fossil-based fertiliser, much used in New Zealand for enriching pasture-land. Bayovar has exported to New Zealand for the past three years - last year's record shipments totalled 28,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes are ordered for this year. Another 35,000 tonnes will go to Chile and Australia, while Brazil is, as yet, a promising but largely unexplored potential purchaser. Bayovar's production costs are about Dollars 26 a tonne. Currently transport to the port of Paita, 170 km to the north, for export shipment adds an uneconomic Dollars 14 to the fob price. But a contract signed in late February between the Grau region (now owners of the deposits) and Cefoisa, a Lima-based construction company, will provide within months a loading quay cutting plant-to-ship costs to Dollars 1.85 a tonne. That is when the phosphates export business becomes profitable. Cefoisa signed in late February a novel contract with the regional authorities that could be a model for future semi-privatised exploitation arrangements. Effectively, the Lima company is leasing the plant and deposits initially for a two-year period. In return, the region will receive 13 per cent of gross sales and 43 per cent of the profits. Together this should provide in excess of Dollars 2.3m over two years for the cash-strapped regional government. The major advantage to the company is that there is almost no capital outlay. Cefoisa takes over the plant and the 44 workers and engineers currently on Bayovar's books, adding a couple of its own people to watch over company interests. Bulldozers and trucks for shifting and transporting phosphates are contracted from outside companies. Cefoisa's confidence about the prospects for making money is illustrated by the fact that it was prepared to take a loss of Dollars 1.22 on each tonne exported from Paita in March so as not to lose its New Zealand and Chilean customers. Yet more attractive, however, is the prospect of superphosphate production. Addition of sulphuric acid to the phosphoric rock - in a ratio of 1: 1 for triple superphosphates, 0.65: 1 for single) enables plants to absorb the fertiliser more easily. Triple superphosphates sell internationally at between Dollars 300 and Dollars 350 a tonne, a handsome profit margin over estimated costs of Dollars 56. A typically grandiose Mineroperu scheme to attract the large investor envisages extraction of 7m tonnes of phosphoric rock a year to produce 1.3m tonnes of single superphosphate, or 870,000 tonnes of triple. This would, according to an estimate by officials of the state minerals' company, involve investment of Dollars 180m or Dollars 300m respectively. But the canny investor might prefer to start on a smaller scale. Last year Bayovar sold some 24,000 tonnes of concentrates to three Lima chemicals companies for transformation to superphosphates. Company production director Mr Cristobal Velazquez, who has 18 years experience at Bayovar, says that he could start producing superphosphates on site with investment not exceeding Dollars 5m. Inadequate supply of sulphuric acid has traditionally been a major deterrent to the move into value-added domestically-produced fertiliser  - in addition to the disincentive of constantly shifting government policies on subsidies for imported fertilisers. But alongside the excess sulphuric acid production of the state-owned refineries at Cajamarquilla and La Oroya, there is now the prospect of additional production from Southern Peru Copper Corporation. Under a recent agreement with the Peruvian government, SPCC is committed to the swift installation of a partial capture acid plant to cut pollution at the company's smelter in the southern port of Ilo. SPCC complains that the project is a financial loss-maker all the way - but its planned production of 155,000 tonnes annually could provide the basis for an interesting foray into superphosphates. According to the Peruvian ministry of mines, President Fujimori discussed the future of Bayovar with potential investors on his mid-March trip to Japan. Local rumours say that Kaiser may also be interested in re-establishing its links with Bayovar and attempting exploitation of currently abandoned Area II - if the flooding problems caused by its position 23 metres below sea level can be resolved.</p>

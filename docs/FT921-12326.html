			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Italians to build Dollars 150m ethylene plant in China HARD on the heels of Chinese Premier Li Peng's visit to Rome this week, Technimont, the plant building subsidiary of Italy's Montedison chemicals group, has won an Dollars 150m (Pounds 82.8m) order for a new ethylene plant in Canton. The contract, signed yesterday with three Chinese state entities, envisages that the new plant, which will have an output of 130,000 tonnes of ethylene a year, will begin production in 1995. Production will be used to supply other facilities on the same site, to produce a variety of petrochemicals products including polyethylene and polypropylene. China's current Five-Year Plan allows for building of 14 petrochemicals and 10 fertiliser facilities and has sparked considerable competition among specialist contracting groups. The latest deal, won against French and Japanese competition, consolidates Technimont's position in China, where it has now either built or won orders for 14 petrochemicals and fertiliser facilities worth around Pounds L720bn (Pounds 333m). The latest deal takes the company's order book to around L1,500bn. Some 15 per cent of the value of the order has been made as a cash down-payment, with the balance coming in the form of a 10-year export credit, dating from the start of production, and guaranteed by SACE, the Italian state agency which provides medium and long-term risk cover.</p>

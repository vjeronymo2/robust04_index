			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moslem Radio Sarajevo reported on Saturday that a  huge column of Croatian military vehicles is leaving from the  Bosnian Croat-controlled town of Tomislavgrad in western  Herzegovina and the town of Prozor towards central  Bosnia-Herzegovina, where fierce Moslem-Croat fighting continues.    It is obvious, the radio said, that a big operation is in  question and that the general staff of the army of neighbouring  Croatia is involved.    Since the beginning of the 21-month-old war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina over 50,000 regular troops of Croatia's Army  have fought on the side of Bosnian Croats.    Radio Sarajevo also said helicopters of the regular Croatian  Army have been flying to and fro throughtout the night between  Friday and Saturday on the course Croatia-western  Herzegovina-central Bosnia despite the no-fly zone over  Bosnia-Herzegovina introduced in October 1992 by the United  Nations.    A woman and three children were wounded on Friday in Gornji  Vakuf in central Bosnia-Herzegovina during Croat fire from  mortars, howitzers, tanks and multiple-rocket launchers on  Moslem-controlled parts of the town, the radio said.</p>

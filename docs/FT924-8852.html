			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Heathrow rail link threatened by track fee dispute PLANS TO build a Pounds 300m express rail link from Heathrow airport to Paddington station are being threatened by an arcane dispute over what BAA, the privatised airport group, should pay for use of British Rail track. The Department of Transport, BR and BAA are to resume negotiations later this month after failing to agree last week. BAA, which will today report its first-half financial figures - expected to show a 30-35 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 200m-Pounds 220m - is anxious to reach a compromise with BR by the end of the month. This would enable construction work on the link to start next spring. The airport group is arguing that it cannot put together a financing package for the project unless it can first secure an agreement. BAA has completed about 95 per cent of the design work for the service which would link Heathrow, the only big European airport still without a direct city rail connection, to central London in 14 minutes. It has just finished a Pounds 1.2m trial tunnel at Heathrow for the planned link. BAA is planning to raise most of the Pounds 300m by selling equity in the new Heathrow Express company to financial institutions, construction companies, airlines and, possibly, foreign railways. But it says it cannot approach investors until it has resolved the issue of track fees, which will represent a significant element in overall operating costs. The project was conceived four years ago as a joint venture between BAA and BR, with the airport operator taking a majority 80 per cent stake and BR the rest. However, this proposal was derailed by BR's financial constraints and the uncertainty over the government's railway privatisation plans, as well as BAA's new strategy of focusing on its core airport activities. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, has made it clear he has no desire to run railways. But he regards the project, in which BAA would ultimately hold a minority stake, as crucial for improving access to one of the world's busiest international airports, used by more than 40m travellers a year. If a deal on track fees is reached with BR this month, BAA expects to complete financing arrangements quickly, enabling the service to open in 1997. BAA expects between 6m and 7m passengers a year to use the rail link.</p>

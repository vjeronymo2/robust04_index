			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer Paul Amar] Let's return to the  deterioration of the situation in Gorazde in Bosnia, because we  now have live with us from Geneva Mrs Berthiaume. Good evening.  You are the spokesperson of the UNHCR in Geneva, so you have  information from Gorazde that we may not have. Can you tell me  this information about what is happening in that town, that has  been surrounded by the Serbs.    [Berthiaume] The latest information we received goes back to  about 1800. Two shells had struck the building where the  employees of the UNHCR are based -- not only them, but also the  forces of the UN military observers, as well as a large number  of refugees. There are dozens and dozens of refugees in the  building, displaced persons, who, I suppose, felt safer in our  building, and unfortunately we have had no news of these people  since then. [passage omitted]    [Amar] Thank you, Christiane Berthiaume, for telling us what  is happening in Gorazde. Unfortunately we don't have any  pictures, simply because the Serbs are preventing international  television teams from filming. No pictures, but we can still  give the news.</p>

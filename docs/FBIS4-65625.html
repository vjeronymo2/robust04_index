			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean-Baptiste Naudet: "France Will Only Withdraw </F> Troops From Bosnia if Negotiations Fail"]    [Text] Is it the result of domestic political  considerations? Is it a warning to UN officials who are not  taking a firm stance in defending the "blue helmets?" Is it a  warning to the warring factions which continue to fight despite  the peace plan theoretically agreed on by the big powers in  Geneva? The announcement in Paris on Tuesday, 17 May, of the  "partial" withdrawal of the French "blue helmets" from Bosnia  caused some dismay among the leaders of the UN troops on the  spot.    The withdrawal of almost 1,000 French troops from Glina in  northern Krajina (territory in the hands of Serbian separatists  in Croatia) by 15 June was planned "to compensate for the  dispatch of French reinforcements to Sarajevo (1,000 men) in  March following the NATO ultimatum. But the announcement of  another "withdrawal," that of the French battalion (almost 1,300  men) from Bihac, a Muslim enclave in western Bosnia, surprised  everybody in Zagreb, the general headquarters of the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Especially those mainly concerned  -- the leaders of the French contingent.    The statement by French Defense Minister Francois Leotard  (full withdrawal from Bihac by the end of the year), then the  qualifying remarks by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe ("if there is  no progress in the peace negotiations"), sowed doubt about  Paris' real intentions.    UNPROFOR "understands the frustrations" of France, "which  has  long been the main contributor of troops to this operation," but  it has not been "officially informed" about France's intention  to reduce its contingent, a spokesman for the force, commanded  by French General Bernard de Lapresle, said on Tuesday.    The leaders of the French "blue helmets" have not been  informed about the intention to withdraw from Bihac, a UN "safe  area," where the military situation continues to deteriorate  under the double blows of Fikret Abdic's Muslim dissidents,  supported to the west by the Krajina Serbs (Croatia), and the  assaults of the Bosnian Serb forces to the east. The statement  came as a surprise although the French have been trying for  months, without success, to be replaced by other "blue helmets,"  especially Malaysians, in Bihac.    Diplomatic and financial circles have speculated that  financial considerations or rather that of "media profile" lies  behind this decision: The French battalion in Bihac is costly.  And although it is popular and has probably saved the enclave  from a Serbian invasion, the press, concentrated in Sarajevo,  says little about it. Some people do not rule out the  possibility that, by overdramatizing the situation, the defense  minister is trying to secure more funding.    Nor is it possible to rule out the possibility that French  officials are trying rather noisily to send a signal both to the  UN civilian leaders and to the warring sides. With regard to  Bihac, incidents took place in March during a Serb offensive  between the French authorities and the UN civilian officials.  France cannot continue its participation in the UN forces in  Bosnia "on a lasting basis" if its soldiers cannot "defend  themselves against aggression," Mr. Leotard said, while the UN  secretary general's representative took a long time to ask the  NATO planes to silence the Serb guns which were bombarding the  French "blue helmets" in Bihac. Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur, who made a surprise visit to Bihac after this  incident, criticized "the excessively long delays, the  excessively cumbersome administrative and political procedures"  for organizing military responses by air in the case of attacks  on the "blue helmets."    The new warning of the "partial withdrawal" comes at a time  when the UN "safe areas" of Bihac, Tuzla, and Sarajevo are once  again the target of Serbian fire, without UN officials reacting.  That cannot "improve the situation" a UNPROFOR spokesman  explained to us.    The cacophony in Paris -- which is not the first -- on all  events is sowing confusion within the ranks of UNPROFOR in  Zagreb. Many people here are simply wondering whether the  French Government has just one policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

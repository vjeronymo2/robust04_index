			<p>BFN     [Text] Berlin, May 28 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiators failed to reach an agreement  with North Korea to determine whether the communist country is  developing nuclear arms and are returning to the headquarters in  Vienna, IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said Saturday.    Pyongyang continues to remove fuel rods and chances of more  talks between the UN nuclear safeguards body and North Korea are  little although IAEA is willing to resume negotiations, Meyer  said.    He said North Korea refused all proposals by IAEA to verify  whether diversion of fuel took place in the past and that this  week's talks in Pyongyang broke down without reaching any  agreement.    IAEA delegates asked various proposals to select, segregate,  and secure fuel standards to verify the reactor core is the  original one installed in 1986, but North Korea refused every  one of them, the spokesman said in a statement.    North Koreans referred to their "unique status" -- a formula  by which they can pick and choose which international safeguards  measures to respect -- and held fast to its opposition to IAEA's  activities to determine whether nuclear fuel has been diverted  to a secret weapons program.    They instead offered some of their ideas, but IAEA turned  them down because they were not "adequate and verifiable" to  determine past operation.    Of five negotiators, two have remained in Yongbyon to report  the process of unloading to headquarters, which means safeguards  are not completely broken down.    The IAEA Secretariat has reported these facts to the board  of  governors and United Nations Security Council, the statement  said.    Meyer said the UN nuclear watchdog is still willing to talk  with Pyongyang, but that the matter was entirely up to North  Koreans. He, however, added that he saw little hope in further  talks.</p>

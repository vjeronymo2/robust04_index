			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Salomon hit by Dollars 250m loss for first two months SHARES in Salomon, the Wall Street securities house and energy trading group, fell yesterday after the company revealed it had incurred a pre-tax operating loss of about Dollars 250m for the first two months of this year. Salomon attributed the loss to its proprietary trading activities, where the company takes long-term bets on a wide range of mostly fixed-income securities. Because those trading positions are directly affected by movements in interest rates, they can be highly volatile over short periods. The actual loss from proprietary trading may have been larger than Dollars 250m, because the figure announced yesterday reflects the pre-tax income from all of Salomon's businesses. They include investment banking, which is likely to have been very profitable recently because of heavy demand for underwriting services from US and foreign companies, and the trading and refining of oil and related products. Analysts believe the loss is related to Salomon's big arbitrage portfolio, which employs several billion dollars of the firm's assets to invest in fixed-income, mostly government, securities. Although the value of the portfolio can change rapidly from one week to the next, Salomon does not sell those positions when they shift. However, the firm has to regularly calculate their value at current market prices for accounting purposes. Analysts warned not to make too much of the announcement. Mr John Keefe, an independent analyst with Keefe Worldwide Services, said: 'For the short term it looks as if they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But for the long term, Salomon remains an expert trader and their proprietary activities should do well for them.' Salomon would not reveal what caused the loss, but there was speculation on Wall Street that the company's traders may have bet that the recent rally in US bond prices was about to end. As one analyst said: 'Solly could have been leaning into the wind and expecting the bond market to reverse itself.' In fact, US bond prices have soared to record levels in recent weeks. Yesterday's announcement was unusual because US companies normally reveal earnings details only every three months. However, Salomon is a regular issuer of debt, and the company is likely to have felt the size of the loss, even if it may be temporary, had to be divulged to potential buyers of its securities. This has happened to Salomon before. In the third quarter of last year the company reported weak earnings following a big drop in proprietary trading profits. On Wall Street, Salomon shares fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 5/8.</p>

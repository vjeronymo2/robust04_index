			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Waiting for Dialogue"] </F>   [Text] Business leaders were so confident that President  Bill Clinton would renew China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN)  status, that its reaction yesterday was almost dismissively  blase. Yet the territory has reason to be thankful Mr Clinton  was prepared to brave the domestic fall-out from his U-turn for  the sake of the larger economic and geostrategic advantages of  continued "engagement" with China.    The President said there were 150,000 American jobs at stake  supporting trade with China. Hong Kong's far smaller economy  stood to lose at least 75,000 jobs -- the rough equivalent in  U.S. terms to putting two million out of work and an immediate  loss of earnings equivalent to more than four per cent of its  Gross Domestic Product. In the longer term, there would have  been some reinvestment in manufacturing here, as industrialists  pulled out of China, but the overall picture would have been  even bleaker. Hong Kong's economic lifeblood comes from its  role as a trade, services and finance hub for China. Remove  that role, and it loses its engine of growth and prosperity and  the importance to the industrialised world that has kept it in  the international eye for so long.    Realistically, the separation of trade and human rights  which  MFN renewal represents means Hong Kong could hope for little  material support from the West if future Chinese rule proved  oppressive. Yet revocation of MFN would have set Hong Kong on  the way to economic and political irrelevance. If that  happened, support from the U.S. would be equally limited.    But if Hong Kong has something to be thankful for, many will  also join human rights campaigners in expressing scepticism at  Mr Clinton's commitment to using engagement to lay the basis for  what he called "long-term sustainable progress in human rights  and ... the advancement of (America's) other interests with  China".    The programme he spelled out -- maintaining the  post-Tiananmen sanctions; banning the import of guns and  munitions from China; increasing Radio Free Asia [as published]  and Voice of America broadcasts; and boosting support for  non-governmental human rights bodies -- falls far short of the  comprehensive diplomatic engagement he promised. He made no  mention of a human rights commission, whether bilateral or  unilateral, to monitor Chinese abuses and bring them to the  attention of the authorities. He was vague about the kind of  dialogue with Beijing leaders that would be effective in  boosting human rights.    It would be sensible to wait before announcing such measures  to consult China and to try to involve it in working out the  detail, rather than engaging in counter-productive megaphone  diplomacy. But Mr Clinton cannot expect to continue  indefinitely without a discernible programme of engagement on  human rights issues. Separating human rights and MFN should not  mean abandoning all commitment to bolstering human liberties  under what remains a repressive regime.</p>

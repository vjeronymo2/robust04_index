			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Clinton tightens screw on Haiti Images of war cemeteries, military bands and proud old veterans have surrounded President Bill Clinton for the last week, but they have done little to change the unfriendly landscape that awaited him on his return from Europe to Washington. Yesterday Mr Clinton announced tighter sanctions against Haiti - an end to all commercial flights and a ban on private financial transactions - but foreign policy difficulties in Haiti still fester as in North Korea and Bosnia. In a Gallup poll conducted for CNN and USA Today, only 49 per cent of those questioned found Mr Clinton honest and trustworthy, although 78 per cent thought him 'a nice guy.' As he approaches three crucial weeks before the July 4 congressional recess candidates from his own Democratic party continue to distance themselves from him, and even the Democratic National Committee's political director acknowledged 'there are clearly some areas of the country where it's not going to benefit a candidate to associate himself with Bill Clinton' - a remark swiftly repudiated by the White House. Next week, the president is expected to unveil his proposals for 'ending welfare as we know it,' a plan built around limiting benefits from the Aid to Families with Dependent Children programme, the cornerstone of the US social safety net, to two years. But the ambitious reform programme is probably stalled until next year as it must take second place on the legislative agenda to health care reform, making only slow progress. Mr Clinton faces a decision on how soon to involve himself in the struggle. Until now, the White House has left the Congress to fight over the details. The battle of health care has not been made any easier by the indictment of Congressman Dan Rostenkowski, formerly chairman of the ways and means committee, on charges of fraud and embezzlement. He was arraigned in court yesterday, and pleaded not guilty. Mr Clinton's own legal travails have not gone away. He will soon have to respond to the charges of sexual harassment filed against him by a former Arkansas state employee. Congressional hearings on his investment in the Whitewater property venture are also expected next month.</p>

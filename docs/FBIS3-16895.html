			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow, March 22 (TASS) -- Russian newspapers  highlight the meeting between Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  and Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, and elections to the  local power bodies.    ROSSIISKIYE VESTI quotes Chernomyrdin as saying about the  results of the talks with Mr Hata that "Russia, when tackling a  solution to the territorial dispute with Japan, will act without  haste. The issue cannot be resolved at a sweep". The newspaper  points out that the Russian premier expressed hope that the  issue would be resolved. "We shall approach the conclusion of a  peace treaty between our two countries in any case. A solution  to the territorial problem is one of prerequisites for such a  treaty".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA remarks in this connection that "it is,  probably, the Russian side that to a greater extent remains  pleased with the results of the talks held in Moscow by Japanese  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Although the meeting with  Russian premier gave certain satisfaction to the Japanese  minister: This time the Russian premier did not make tough  remarks, as he did at the end of last year, about it being  impossible to hand over the Kuril Islands under any  circumstances".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on elections to local power bodies:    "Last Sunday's elections to the local representative power  bodies in the regions of the Russian Federation revealed, on the  whole, the electorate's indifference and passivity.  Irrespective of the final election results, this conclusion  could be drawn immediately after the polls closed."    TRUD on local election results:    "Such outcome of the elections in a number of Russian  regions  can hardly satisfy the federal authorities either. For a low  turnout of voters is indicative of the Russians' low trust in  power in general. And this is understandable. Over the past  several years, there were so many well wishers who promised  people a lot. Meanwhile, the life of the majority of ordinary  citizens has not changed for the better".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on local election results:    "People, having got disillusioned with the abilities of `the  people's elected representatives' to change if only anything in  their life, were not in a hurry to go to the polls.    "Experts explain the passiveness of the population by a  number of other reasons as well. Not of least importance in  this respect is the excessively protracted nature of the  election campaign, and Moscow's insufficient interest in the  electoral process at the local level".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with Colonel-General  Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian deputy minister of defence, under  the headline " The Second Phase of the Reform: What Awaits the  Army".    The newspaper points out that the first phase of the  reforming of the Russian Army and Navy is over. Main organising  measures to create the armed forces of Russia proper have been  carried out.    In response to a question what awaits the armed forces in  the  future, the deputy defence minister said: "The armed forces will  become, firstly, a relatively small but powerful and modile army  provided with the most effective systems of weapons and military  hardware and capable of defending Russia from encroachments from  the outside and be the guarantor of peace and stability in the  country.    "Secondly, this will be an army of a democratic state, which  has fundamentally different relationships with society and the  state and enjoying respect and prestige among the people.    "Thirdly, this will be an important instrument of national  policy, maintaining all the best from the traditions of its  predecessors, everything that was connected with the  accomplishment of exclusively defensive tasks.    "These three positions in point of fact reflect the  principal  meaning of the current process of the Russian Armed Forces  reform", General Kondratyev said.</p>

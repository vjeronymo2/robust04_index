			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 106 NATIONS REPORT ON SANCTIONS  </P> <P> A total of 106 countries have so far replied to a U.N. request for details on  what they are doing to implement sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of  Kuwait, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Friday.  </P> <P> He also said in a report that nine of the world body's 159 members have asked  to hold consultations with the Security Council on resolving special economic  problems they face as a result of the trade embargo.  </P> <P> They are Bulgaria, India, Jordan, Lebanon, Philippines, Romania, Sri Lanka,  Tunisia and Yugoslavia. In addition, Sudan and Yemen had indicated their  intention of requesting consultations with the council.  </P> <P> Under the U.N. Charter, any country that finds itself facing special economic  problems arising from applying U.N.-imposed sanctions "shall have the right to  consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of those problems."  </P> <P> A Security Council committee set up to oversee implementation of the council's  Aug. 6 sanctions resolution has been giving urgent consideration to the request  from Jordan.  </P> <P> Amman said last month it would suffer direct and indirect losses totaling $2  billion a year as a result of cutting its economic links with Iraq and occupied  Kuwait.  </P> <P> Committee chairwoman Marjatta Rasi of Finland told reporters after a meeting  Thursday that agreement was near on recommendations to the Security Council for  assisting Jordan, but she gave no details.  </P> <P> The committee, which meets in private, has also heard presentations by  representatives of several other countries claiming special hardship.  </P></p>

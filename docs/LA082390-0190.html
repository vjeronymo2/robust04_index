			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT ISN'T MADRID, BUT IT ISN'T HOPELESS;  </P> <P> O.C. EATERIES THAT CATER TO THE AFTER-10 CROWD  </P> <P> Let's get real. When it comes to late-night dining, we are not living in Madrid  here. People in Orange County tend to dine at civilized hours.  </P> <P> But though most local restaurants are empty by the time the clock strikes 10,  the situation is not as hopeless as you might imagine. Let's say you've just  seen a meaty performance by South Coast Repertory or a pithy 8 o'clock movie,  and you want to sup in style. Or let's say you've been working until midnight  on that impossible project, you're hot and grumpy, and you just want to roll up  your sleeves and dive into a burger. You've got a baby-sitter you can trust or  you don't have an appointment until 10 the next morning. And things were so  frantic that you haven't eaten a thing since breakfast.  </P> <P> Well, surprise! There are restaurants of all shapes and sizes for after-hours  dining in Orange County, where just about anything that strikes your fancy is  being served. For this story, I've limited the choices to more familiar fare (a  separate story spotlighting Asian restaurants is planned for a future date).  Here is a short list of some noteworthy spots, and a few suggestions about what  to eat in them.  </P> <P> Bennie the Bum's Diner. Let's assume that, for now, the fancy stuff is more  than you can handle. It's after midnight, and you've been working or doing some  heavy partying. So you decide to head for the beach, and one of those oceanside  diners like Edie's, Ruby's or any of the other late-night haunts that line  Pacific Coast Highway clear up to Seal Beach. You clear your senses with a big  whiff of that refreshing sea air, and then you head for Bennie the Bum's Diner.  </P> <P> Bennie's is one of those '50s-style diners with belligerent cooks and singing  countermen, where people sit bleary-eyed in the turquoise booths waiting for  their burgers with fries. Singles sit on turquoise stools at the pink-topped  counter, staring down the giant Coke sign and the pictures of celebrities named  Joey (Joey Bishop, Joey Heatherton) while waiting for service. No one is  holding his breath, by the way.  </P> <P> The food at Bennie's is basic but solid. There are a variety of classic  American sandwiches; the Reuben, Philly cheese steak, hot dogs, burgers, and a  delicious BLT. The chili fries are classic, a giant portion smothered in  Bennie's unctuous chili and gooey melted cheese.  </P> <P> Get there before 11:30 or so and they'll cook you chicken, meat loaf, pork  chops or other short-order specialties. If you request these dishes after  midnight, the counterman had better like you a whole lot, or he'll abuse you  verbally for daring even to ask.  </P> <P> But there are always good milkshakes, a large selection of pies, a few soups  and some soggy omelets. And the rather confused-looking crowd makes a fair bit  of noise. In short, Bennie the Bum's provides all-American, late-night  entertainment, sort of like the Letterman show with catering. But if you're  after a classier establishment, read on.  </P> <P>  Bennie the Bum's Diner, 238 Laguna Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4786. Open 24  hours daily. Visa/MC. Food for two, $8-$18.  </P> <P>  Gustav Anders. My unquestioned first choice for a late-night repast would be  Gustav Anders, a sleek, sophisticated jewel of a restaurant that combines the  spirit of a Paris bistro with the good sense of a Stockholm supper club.  </P> <P> The restaurant is centrally located, close to the Performing Arts Center and  the area's heaviest concentration of movie theatres. Dining there after hours  is a joy. The restaurant's "anytime we are open" menu features just the kind of  light fare that goes down easy in the wee hours: several caviars, various  smoked fish, innovative salads and elegant sandwiches. There is a superb wine  list, full of top-drawer California wines and hard to find French champagnes  like Salon, Cristal and Perrier Grand Siecle. And service, always deft and  casual, becomes more relaxed and soigne when the crowds thin down.  </P> <P> Things are anything but sedate, however. The dining room is softly lit and its  majestic beams recall a Scandinavian cottage. But a suave collection of art and  sculpture makes the surroundings a challenge to the eye. And Thursday through  Sunday, a pianist plays soft jazz, the better to sip champagne by and arouse  your most primal instincts.  </P> <P> Should you desire something stronger than champagne, Maitre'd Bill Magnuson  (Gustav) has added an aquavit bord -- an hors d'oeuvres table featuring several  of candinavia's celebrated, caraway-flavored liqueurs. The sharply lined,  zinc-topped bar has been laden with goodies -- oysters on the shell, carpaccio,  house-cured herring, gravlax, even smoked reindeer -- and the aquavits are  potent and icy cold. It can all be had for one price, $22, a price I'd say was  a steal. Just make sure someone else is driving home. Aquavit is definitely not  for drivers, or wimps.  </P> <P>  Gustav Anders in South Coast Plaza Village, the corner of Bear and Sunflower  streets, Santa Ana. (714) 668-1737. Aquavit bord and bar menu served until  midnight nightly. All major cards. Late supper for two (food only), $30-$60.  </P> <P>  Cedar Creek Inn. Maybe you're after a bouncier setting, one where you can get  lost in the crowd. And maybe the grand dining experience makes you want to gag  at this hour.  </P> <P> Well, at Cedar Creek Inn on Forest Avenue in downtown Laguna, you can sip,  nibble, nosh and boogie to your heart's content, and you don't have to take it  all so seriously. The restaurant is basically a rather conservative dinner  house in the early evening, but after-hours it undergoes a Kafkaesque  metamorphosis. Loud, live entertainment, mostly jazzy rock, is staged nightly.  Don't come here for intimate conversation.  </P> <P> It's a dark, clubby room with lots of beams, Tartan lamps and latticed windows  draped with fussy, flower-print curtains. Sit at the oyster bar where hungry  night owls hunker down, or at one of the small tables adjacent to the stage.  The bar menu is always available after 10.  </P> <P> The menu's basic focus is finger foods -- chicken strips, fried zucchini and  sloppy, spicy nachos heaped with jalapenos. You can also have more upscale  treats like fresh-shucked oysters, sashimi or crab cakes. Portions are  substantial, not for those seeking a light snack. They certainly don't skimp on  oil or batter, the heavier components.  </P> <P> I recommend steamed clams, good and garlicky, or the big juicy burger, wrapped  in paper like you'd get at a drive-in. Sweet tooths are in for quite a ride.  There is a large dessert list filled with homemade goodies; Hershey Bar pie,  boysenberry lush (a fruity cheesecake in a walnut crust), praline ice cream  pie, and a brownie sundae topped with obscene amounts of whipped cream and hot  fudge sauce. If that doesn't get you wide-eyed, the restaurant makes an  intense, artful espresso.  </P> <P>  Cedar Creek Inn, 384 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-8696. Oyster bar  menu served until about midnight. Visa/MC/Amex accepted. Supper for two (food  only), $15-$25.  </P> <P>  Mezzaluna. The artists among you should go for the brash, bright Mezzaluna, a  new restaurant proving to be quite controversial. It's a New York-style Italian  trattoria with New York-style prices, open just over one month, and initial  reports seem to dwell on its noise and inconsistency.  </P> <P> But the late-supper menu -- pizzas, focaccia, salads and desserts -- is a real  winner. The pizzas and focaccia are made in a special, wood-fired oven  constructed of yellow cotto brick, and the two dishes are as delicious as I've  tasted anywhere.  </P> <P> It's an informally colorful place with a tile floor and walls full of  lithographs depicting various interpretations of mezzaluna, half moon in  Italian. Owner Romano Molfetta has tried to infuse the proceedings with some  authenticity (sun-bleached servers make half-hearted attempts to pronounce the  names of the dishes in Italian, while the managers dress like fashion models).  </P> <P> Things quiet down after 10 here. You'll see well-heeled locals airing out  trendy libations like Nonnino grappa (a heavyweight Italian brandy around $16  dollars a shot), and couples exchanging loving glances over the marble-top  tables. Pizzas are the thin-crusted, crispy type, with creative, unusual  toppings. Pizza con scamorza e radicchio, with smoked mozzarella and lots of  bittersweet radicchio, is terrific. Pizza with pancetta and onion is the  perfect blend of sweet and salty.  </P> <P> Focaccia, an oil-rubbed bread with various fillings, is also featured and comes  in eight varieties. Try tonno, pomodoro e cipolla, with tuna, tomato and olive,  or ragu di funghi, a wild-mushroom ragu.  </P> <P> Wildly inventive desserts often miss the mark. A few of them, like melon mousse  and carmelized pear tart, work well. But the house coffee is great, the  cappuccino is foamy and the mood is stimulating. The jury is still out on  Mezzaluna as a dinner house (for a full review, please see Page 24), but for  late-night dining, it's a welcome, sorely needed addition to the local scene.  </P> <P>  Mezzaluna, 2441 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-2004. Late-supper  menu served from 10 p.m. to midnight, nightly. Visa/MC/Amex accepted. Supper  for two (food only), $25-$40.  </P> <P> The Arches. If you're on a really heavy date, ready to move in for the kill  with someone, you'll probably want to sit real close in one of those dark,  intimate booths that you can slide down into and practically disappear. The  Arches, at the not-so-intimate junction of Newport Boulevard and Coast Highway,  has just such appointments. It's been there since what sounds like forever --  1922, when the Romantic Period was still within memory. In case it is food you  are after, the complete menu is available until 1 a.m.  </P> <P> It's a surreal, intimate room that glows a somber red from chandeliers that  would look more appropriately placed in a New Orleans bordello, and the walls  are covered with splashy murals. Waiters wear stiff tuxedoes and do lots of  table-side cooking. After hours, almost everybody's wine bottles are upside  down in the buckets.  </P> <P> Give partial credit to the restaurant's killer wine list (since 1983, The Wine  Spectator has honored the restaurant) and gaudy menu earmarked with refined  elegance. Twenties-style dishes like lobster Thermidor and veal Cordon Bleu  abound, plus exotica like frog legs, shrimp and crab curries, and the gamut of  flambes. French-cut lamb chops are thick and juicy, and there is a luxuriant  Caesar prepared on the cart served with garlic toasts. Most of the meats can be  ordered with sides of Escoffier-style sauces like Madeira, Hollandaise and  Bearnaise. Everybody takes the proceedings with the utmost seriousness.  </P> <P> Now that Chez Cary has cooked its last meal, The Arches is about the closest  you can come to anachronistic dining in Orange County. In the grand days, when  late-night dining was the fashion, this may have been no more than just another  dinner house. Today, it stands alone. An institution.  </P> <P>  The Arches, Newport Boulevard at Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 645-7077.  Service nightly until 1 a.m. All major cards. Late supper for two (food only),  $50-$75.  </P> <P> Belisle's. Finally, the late, late supper: breakfast.  </P> <P> Those few who stay out really late may not be looking for a romantic corner to  swish claret in a crystal goblet, and they may not want to fight a crowd,  either. Maybe they just want some eggs.  </P> <P> Orange County doesn't have a late-night deli for industry hipsters like  Canter's on Fairfax, or terminally cool Hollywood-style hangouts where a dude  in Ray-Bans thumps an electric bass until dawn. But it does have a spate of  all-night coffee shops.  </P> <P> Belisle's is one you won't soon forget. It's a slice of Americana big enough to  satisfy the most fulsome appetite, a metaphor for color and excess. If you can  finish one of their super breakfasts, chances are you've been a very naughty  camper that evening. If you can finish the Texas breakfast, 12 eggs and a  26-ounce steak, the Rams could use another nose guard.  </P> <P> Super breakfasts come with 32-ounce beverages, four eggs, a mountain of home  fries and a choice of oversized hot cakes or biscuits with country gravy. A  choice of meats is included too; like six or seven sausages, or a granite-sized  slab of ham.  </P> <P> If you must stray from breakfast fare, there are giant sandwiches, bottomless  bowls of salad and complete dinners served on platters that must weigh 5 pounds  apiece. I merely nibbled on the hot turkey sandwich, mostly bland sage dressing  blanketed with a pasty yellow gravy. Meat loaf is a better choice, a crumbly,  tasty loaf that you won't put a dent in. The barbecue is tasty too,  particularly the beef ribs. Beef ribs at 3 a.m. are not everybody's idea of a  nightcap. Most of us have to work in the morning.  </P> <P>  Belisle's, 12001 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 750-6560. Open 24 hours,  daily. Visa/MC accepted. Breakfast for two, $25-$40.  </P> <P> </P></p>

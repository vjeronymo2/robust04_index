RDP  has learned that the U.S. ambassador to Angola has been meeting  Jorge Valentim [information secretary and UNITA [National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola] representative at talks]  in Lusaka. UNITA has blamed the Angolan Government for the  fighting in Cuito. Jorge Valentim, of UNITA's political  leadership, told us a few minutes ago about the efforts the  United States is making with a view to ensuring that the  negotiations continue.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] [words indistinct] The  observers are calling for an end to the war. They are appealing  for the war to end.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are the Lusaka talks threatened  at the moment?    [Valentim] Well, the government's bellicose adventures are  not conducive to peace and cause uneasy negotiations. But we  are committed to continuing the talks. [words indistinct] We  do not agree with these militaristic adventures that are  threatening peace in Angola. [end recording]</p>

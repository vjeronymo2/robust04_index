			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Annoucer-read report over video; from the NHK news program] </F>   [Text] Members of peace groups, including local labor  unions, held a peace rally in Kadena Township today, which marks  the 22d anniversary of Okinawa's reversion to Japan. The rally,  called the "Okinawan People's Rally To Protect Peace and  Livelihood," was sponsored by the Okinawa Peace Movement Center.  Approximately 3,000 participants, including members from local  labor unions and other organizations, gathered at the rally held  at Kaneku beachside park in Kaneku, Kadena Township.    At the rally, Zenshun Arakaki, chairman of the Okinawa Peace  Movement Center, which sponsored the rally, first delivered a  speech. He said: Even after the conclusion of the battle for  Okinawa, the Okinawan people have been deprived of their human  rights under U.S. military rule. Twenty-two years have passed  since the reversion of Okinawa to Japan, but damages continue to  be inflicted upon Okinawa due to U.S. military exercises and  accidents. Recently, it was disclosed that there exists a secret  deal which was concluded between the Japanese and U.S.  Governments regarding Japanese approval of the U.S. military's  bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa in case of emergencies. We  cannot allow a situation like this at all. We must now join our  hands to turn Okinawa into a peaceful island.    Later at the rally, representatives from various  participating organizations delivered speeches, expressing  opposition to war and advocating peace. Most of the  participants at the rally were those who started marching on 13  May from various locations in the island in the peace parade,  during which they walked the streets and appealed for peace.  The participants, whose faces were sun-tanned, listened  attentively to the speeches. The rally concluded after the  participants adopted a resolution calling for immediate removal  of U.S. military bases and clarification about the issue of the  secret deal regarding bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: 'HIGH TIDE'  </P> <P> Gillian Armstrong's intense and rich 1987 Australian film continually plays  against expectations of sentimental cliches or programmed heart-tugging as it  tells of the painfully awakened bond between a teen-age daughter (Claudia  Karvin) and the mother (Judy Davis, in a genuinely great performance as a  wasted, reckless, lyrically drunken misfit) who abandoned her years before for  a life on the road.  </P> <P> (Cinemax Wednesday at 7 a.m.)Michael Wilmington  </P></p>

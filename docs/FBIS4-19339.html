			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Karl Otto </F> Gerhard in Bonn -- recorded]    [Text] [Gerhard] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel expressed  the hope that Russia will exert more pressure on the Serbs.    [Kinkel] It is very important and decisive now for the  Russian side to exert massive and urgently needed pressure on  the Serbs, so that the Serbs give up the stranglehold of Gorazde.    [Gerhard] What should the Russians tell the Serbs?    [Kinkel] They must tell them that we have achieved major  progress in the political sphere -- Sarajevo, access to Tuzla,  the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims, and Mostar.  It must be possible to extinguish the other fires in a  mosaic-like manner, which also includes -- in a symbolic manner  -- Gorazde.    [Gerhard] What about the German contribution? Are we only  observers or can we participate actively in the peace process?    [Kinkel] We cannot send German soldiers to the former  Yugoslavia because of our constitution. We are very committed  in the humanitarian area. The political process will be  continued tomorrow by the 12 foreign ministers in Luxembourg. I  am in constant contact with my U.S. counterpart and my  colleagues and friends in the European Union. We are  participating strongly and are trying to help.</p>

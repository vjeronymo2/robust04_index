There had been speculation that Morry might have defected to a neighboring Arab  country. But Maj. Gen. Avihu Ben-Nun, the air force commander, said he believes  that Morry intended to commit suicide by crashing his plane. Officials said  earlier they believed Morry had personal problems.  </P></p>

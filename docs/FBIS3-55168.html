			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Kudakayev report under the "Security" rubric: </F> "Russian Chekists Reorganize Themselves After Western Style"]    [Text] All in all, two weeks have been allotted for the  drafting of a corresponding statute in line with the edict  scrapping the Security Ministry and creating a Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS] (the new name of the Russian  secret service).    It has come to light from sources close to presidential  quarters that work on a regulatory document for the Russian  special service has been completed. It was signed by Boris  Yeltsin yesterday. In accordance with it, the FCS comprises the  very same structure of the former Security Ministry minus the  Investigation Directorate and the so-called 15th Directorate (in  charge of underground towns). Stripping the FCS of investigative  functions makes it look more like a civilized country's special  service. Earlier, a separate presidential edict made border  troops an independent organization.    In all likelihood, the 15th Directorate will be handed over  to the Main Security Directorate -- Mikhail Barsukov's agency.  This, however, will only legally formalize what is already  solid reality. The fate of the Investigation Directorate is  still unclear. There is a possibility of some reorganization of  the former Security Ministry's inner structure, but it will not  be of a fundamental nature.    Former Security Ministry personnel are awaiting a repeat  efficiency rating procedure which, however, no one fears. To  date there are only two men on the payroll of the new  organization -- its director Nikolay Golushko and his first  deputy Sergey Stepashin.</p>

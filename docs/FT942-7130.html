			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of Brazil (9): Faded at the edges - Brasilia / Guide for business visitors Brazil's futuristic capital, laid out in the shape of a giant aeroplane and symbolically placed at the country's centre, is beginning to look a little faded at the edges, writes Angus Foster. The seat of government since 1960, Brasilia is merging in with the surrounding plateau, but it is still a city without a past and with very shallow roots. Most visitors only go to Brasilia for work - nearly all government departments and foreign embassies are here - and as a working environment it is pleasant. There are few traffic jams and it is usually easy to arrange meetings with government departments quickly. There are regular flights from Sao Paulo and Rio although they can get booked up on Fridays - when many people leave Brasilia - and on Mondays, when they return. The Congress building at the end of the 'esplanade' of government ministries dominates the city and when Congress is sitting it is invariably being lobbied by an interest group of some sort. At night, Brasilia often appears very quiet. In fact, it contains some reasonable restaurants and bars, but they are often a long way from the hotel district in residential areas. For those caught in the city over a weekend, Brasilia can be a soulless place. One option is to hire a car and drive two hours west to the sleepy historical town of Pirenopolis. Alternatively, over a long weekend, visit the River Araguaia region further west.

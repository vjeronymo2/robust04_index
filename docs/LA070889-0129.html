			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> A SPECIAL ISSUE OF ORANGE COUNTY LIFE;  </P> <P> THEY FIND THE SILVER LINING IN PEOPLE'S KITCHENS, BEDROOMS  </P> <P> If you are moving to a new home, redecorating or refurbishing an existing one,  or merely giving your house a good thorough cleaning, you will likely be forced  to face one of life's great challenges -- the dreaded shelf lining caper.  </P> <P> Remember the frustrations of the last time you decided to line every shelf in  the house? Measuring -- not quite accurately, as it turned out? Peeling, and  positioning sticky paper that seemed to have a life of its own?  </P> <P> Can your marriage survive another exasperating attempt?  </P> <P> Well, Donna Bradshaw and her sister, Pam Owens, owners of the Santa Ana-based  branch of American Shelf Lining, offer a simple alternative to the  do-it-yourself frustrations that often accompany lining shelves.  </P> <P> Bradshaw, a former corporate real estate executive, and Owens, a former  elementary school teacher, will handle the awful chore for you. Bradshaw takes  care of customer inquires and appointment scheduling, while Owens does the  measuring, banking and bookkeeping. For the installation itself they work as a  team.  </P> <P> Bradshaw and Owens say their lining is unequaled and unavailable in the retail  market. It comes in a choice of eight decorator colors (white, oyster, peach,  sea foam green, pink, blue, dark gray and black). It is a medium weight, high  gloss, patent leather-like vinyl, cut to measure and bonded to a specially  designed backing, which, they say, ensures durability. American Shelf Lining  guarantees both material and workmanship for life.  </P> <P> When a prospective customer calls to inquire about an installation, an  appointment for a free estimate is arranged, at which time all shelves and  drawers are measured. A custom-designed and patented decimal tape measure is  used that allows the team to measure 1/20th of an inch, assuring a perfect fit  -- not only on shelf and drawer bottoms, but on sides, back and front as well.  </P> <P> A hand-held computer feeds the measurements to the factory and then provides a  complete printout of each drawer and shelf to be lined, including size and  cost. The product is custom cut and hand-wrapped at the factory and shipped,  ready to install. (The cost averages about $2.25 per square foot, says  Bradshaw, for a total of anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 depending on the size  of the home.)  </P> <P> Bradshaw and Owens say the advantages of lining shelves this way are  multifaceted. "The material is durable, shelves and drawers are custom fit, you  don't have bubbles or curling edges, and it never needs to be replaced," says  Bradshaw.  </P> <P> Owens adds: "It is water-resistant, so spills wipe off easily, and grit and  grime won't get stuck into crevices."  </P> <P> Customers seem to like it too. Kim Levine, a Yorba Linda homemaker and mother  of three is clearly delighted. "I had planned to do it myself, but I remembered  the time I papered shelves in my last home," she says. "I am a perfectionist --  but no matter how careful you are, you just can't achieve a look like this.  When we bought our new home, we decided to just go ahead and have it done  professionally, and I am very, very glad we did."  </P> <P> Levine's neighbor, Judy Altshuler, recently had her own home done. "I love it!  Every time I open a drawer it looks so clean and bright and shiny -- it's just  great," she says, "but the best part is it was so effortless for me!"  </P> <P> A typical home can be lined in less than a normal working day, depending on how  many rooms are lined. They will do an entire home or just a kitchen, depending  on need and budget.  </P></p>

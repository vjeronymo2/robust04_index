			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Petr Dudek: "The Future: Pressure of Arms </F> Lobbies"]    [Text]  <H5>  Light Arms Are in Greatest Demand </H5>   The Czech Republic cannot boast of having the most perfect  arms systems, but this does not matter in today's world of war  conflicts. On the contrary. A British paper, THE ECONOMIST,  quotes the annual report of the Stockholm International Peace  Institute (SIPRI), according to which only light weapons were  used in the approximately 30 wars last year.    Sophisticated arms systems (such as those used by the  Western  allies in the Persian Gulf war) are in the arsenal of the armies  to divert inimical neighbors from possible intentions to launch  an attack. The combat in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and Angola, as we  can see on our television screens, is conducted with light arms,  not the most modern ones. Rifles, machine guns, and  minesweepers used today may have been used in World War II.    Illicit dealers find potential partners in countries of  Central and East Europe. These countries are traditional arms  producers, and their newly established market economies do not  abound with foreign currency. How does the Czech Republic  control the export of these goods?  <H5>  Industrial Circles Can Deal With Whomever They Want </H5>   At present, the government interferes in the negotiation  process at a stage where the deal is about to be concluded and  not before. In fact, Czech enterprises can negotiate contracts  as they want, with the risk that the export license for a  specific case may be refused. The state administration is  invited in only when the deal is about to be concluded. The  affair surrounding the RDP Consortium Group shows where these  practices may lead.    As of 1 April, a new law on foreign trade in military  material, approved by parliament recently, will come into force.  According to this law, an enterprise will only be allowed to  enter the arms market with a license issued by the Ministry of  Industry, which will be issued after consultations with the  Foreign Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and the Defense  Ministry.    The RDP Consortium Group is one of the best known entities  on  the arms market in the Czech Republic. The weekly RESPEKT no.  8/94 carried information on the intention of the consortium to  export, in cooperation with the Skoda factory, military  technology, including surface-to-surface missiles and spare  parts for T-72 tanks, to Iran--that is, into a politically and  militarily very unreliable country.    By being reluctant to state their clear opinion on the case,  official places have shown that the RDP Group intentions are not  something that should be discussed publicly. Vladimir Dlouhy,  minister of industry and trade, announced to CTK on 22 February  that no one had negotiated the deal, and he refused to comment  on it. All of this activity was initiated by Czech  industrialists. "The Ministry of Defense will not approve of  exports to any country that is politically inappropriate,"  Defense Minister Antonin Baudys told LIDOVE NOVINY on 4 February  on the subject of the possible export of Czech arms to  fundamentalist Iran. At the same time, he admitted that  industrial circles may negotiate with whomever they want.    Lubomir Soudek, director general of the Skoda factory and a  member of the RDP Group Presidium, criticized the publicity the  case had received and indicated that, if the intentions of the  Skoda factory do not materialize, it could cause higher  unemployment. Does that mean that the RDP will export the arms  to Iran?    Dr. Bretislav Gregr is the responsible official from the  Ministry of Industry and Trade who decides on granting the final  license (in the form of an administrative decision), after  preliminary discussion with appropriate ministries. "The  problem of the export of heavy arms to Iran is quite  hypothetical because the Czech Republic is not a manufacturer of  these products. I personally believe that, as long as the  situation in Iran remains unchanged, our country will not step  out of the line of countries that are carefully considering the  possible international impact and will not export military  technology to that region," he told LIDOVE NOVINY on 22  February, and he added that he did not expect that he would have  to decide the RDP Group proposition in the near future.  Nevertheless, should such a situation arise, Dr. Gregr believes  that it is "difficult to imagine" that he would give his consent.  <H5>  Wandering Kalashnikovs </H5>   In Europe, the parties engaged in the Yugoslav conflict feel  the shortage of arms of all kinds. Irrespective of the embargo,  arms are flowing into the former Yugoslavia from all directions.  Estimates for 1993 speak about military material worth some $2  billion. Arms of various origin are being smuggled into former  Yugoslavia. They are coming from at least as many countries as  there are countries forming the United Nations Protection Force  [UNPROFOR]. "It is useless to even ask from where this or that  Kalashnikov has come," Canadian Colonel Oehring, commander of  the South Sector in Croatia, told LIDOVE NOVINY last week.    During the real or faked transactions, the most remote  countries can play the role of the country of destination. The  Czech Republic could quite easily become a source of arms for  the battlefields in Bosnia. A strong enough lobby promoting  arms exports could manage it. Can such a pressure group appear  in the Czech Republic? "The trade in arms is linked to  important financial profits, and this is why it is possible to  imagine a situation where the most important arms companies  could acquire an increased influence on the state administration  (as the signals from the RDP Group have indicated). However, the  newly adopted law will be able to sufficiently resist the  pressure from possible lobbies," Dr. Gregr says.</p>

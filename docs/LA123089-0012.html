			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE CUTS, 'PEACE DIVIDEND'  </P> <P> It's very difficult to muster much sympathy for the "victims" of the massive  spending cuts that will inevitably have to take place in the defense industry  over the next decade.  </P> <P> While the arms makers to the world were busy engorging themselves at the public  trough over the last two generations, the number of environmental and social  disasters that could have been diverted by a sensible and just allocation of  public monies continued to escalate. You can largely blame the rapacious greed  of the defense industry and the cupidity of the politicians it bought for the  creation and maintenance of the Cold War -- along with a stifling of the  national creativity and commitment to true democracy that were supposedly our  twin hallmarks, not to mention the perpetration of monstrous social injustices  at the hands of "banana-republic" dictators supported with U.S. tax dollars  throughout the Third World.  </P> <P> While the massive wallet-hoovering of the American people was taking place  during the Reagan reign, we collectively turned our backs on the needs of our  own permanent underclass -- the increasingly poor women, children, and  minorities who where systematically kept standing in the shadows while Reagan  and his cronies crowed about it being "morning in America" once again. The  not-so-benign neglect that the Republicans in general and Reagan in particular  foisted on this underclass has resulted in an increasingly drug-ridden,  illiterate and culturally anarchic country.  </P> <P> May the 90s see the demise of the arrogance characteristic of the 80s and  America's own version of perestroika, something we so desperately need.  </P> <P> STEPHEN P. WATKINS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Newspaper Publishing The battle for control of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday is currently being fought between paper tigers. We have been treated to the rather rum sight of a group of directors avoiding the rest of the board while they prepared a bid. Now a consortium of the founder-directors, El Pais, La Repubblica and the Mirror Group have announced an intention to bid, yet no firm offer is on the table. The consortium also looks slightly odd given that the continental Europeans will have voting control, while Mirror Group will be a substantial minority shareholder with long term production contracts. The extra cash to be subscribed for promotion also seems likely to be debt, presumably to avoid diluting the founders. That can only be sustained provided cost savings can return the newspapers to cash neutrality. If there is a continuing need for the consortium to inject money, the debt could quickly become equity. Since the Mirror can offer substantial logistical support, there are reasons to believe that its consortium can produce the papers at a lower break-even point than many potential suitors. That may also imply that they can offer a better price. But the rumours of a bid from Mr Tony O'Reilly continue to swirl thickly. Whatever the niceties, the board of Newspaper Publishing will have little to go on but price. Bids have been lost before with the support of 47 per cent of the shareholders. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith has not won yet.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Plan for UN protectorate backed by Bosnian president BOSNIA'S president has backed some form of United Nations protectorate for Bosnia-Hercegovina, in spite of fears that this could consolidate territorial gains made by Serbs and Croats, EC diplomats said yesterday. Mr Alija Izetbegovic supported the idea of a UN protectorate for the first time during talks in Brussels on Friday with Lord Carrington, chairman of the EC sponsored peace conference on Yugoslavia. Although the Bosnian government controls only a small percentage of the republic following territorial advances by Serbia and Croatia, Mr Izetbegovic is determined to see a viable Bosnian republic emerge from the conflict within the former Yugoslav republic. During the talks, President Milan Kucan of Slovenia and President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia also supported plans for a protectorate. An EC diplomat said Mr Kucan supported such an arrangement because it would halt the exodus of refugees to Slovenia, while Mr Tudjman advocated it as a means of offsetting the negative publicity Croatia has gained in supporting its own seizures of territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Although Slovene, Croat, and Bosnian leaders were vague about the definition of a protectorate, the official said it was clear that 'Izetbegovic wants one which will go some way towards reconstituting the Bosnian government, and restoring control over all of Bosnia.' Plans for placing Bosnia-Hercegovina under a UN protectorate were suggested last week by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, and Mr Mate Boban, head of Bosnia's Croats. However, both men were seen as espousing the idea to consolidate their territorial gains, rather than to reconstitute the legal status of the Bosnian government. Western diplomats yesterday stressed that the UN would not be prepared to place Bosnia under any kind of protectorate until a number of conditions were met. These included a ceasefire, the disarming of all fighters, the removal of heavy weapons and the guaranteeing of the right of all refugees to return eventually to the region. 'These conditions will only be realised when all three sides (in Bosnia) are ready to negotiate a political settlement. Maybe we are slowly reaching that stage,' a western diplomat said. An EC official said the Bosnian leader was 'more confident, more buoyant' during last week's EC talks despite an announcement by Mr Karadzic that he had taken control of 70 per cent of the territory in Bosnia, 'more than he wanted'. Mr Izetbegovic told Lord Carrington that he questioned Mr Karadzic's claims. A six-storey hotel housing hundreds of refugees was set ablaze in Sarajevo last night after it was hit by threee mortar bombs. Two people were reported to have been killed and it was feared others might be trapped inside the Europa Hotel. Two members of an ITN camera crew were among those injured.

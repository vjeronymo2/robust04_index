			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> 17-YEAR-OLD INJURED AS CAR, TRUCK COLLIDE  </P> <P> A 17-year-old Westminster youth suffered serious injuries Sunday in a  two-vehicle crash that left him trapped in the wreckage, police said.  </P> <P> Derrek Alexander Enz was in serious condition at Long Beach Memorial Hospital  with head injuries and multiple breaks in both legs.  </P> <P> Enz was a passenger in a Ford Mustang that collided with a Nissan pickup truck  at Bolsa Chica Road and Westminster Boulevard about 7:55 a.m.  </P> <P> Paramedics had to use a hydraulic prying device to free Enz from the car.  Because rain prevented an airlift rescue, he was taken by ambulance to the  hospital, police said.  </P> <P> The vehicles' drivers sustained only minor injuries, police said. Each claimed  to have a green light at the intersection, and police were seeking witnesses to  resolve the conflicting statements. It was raining at the time of the  collision, but police did not know if that was a factor.  </P></p>

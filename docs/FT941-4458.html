			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Christopher visit stirs Beijing rebels The arrival in Beijing today of Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has galvanised Beijing's dissident community into trying to use the occasion to draw attention to its cause. Yesterday's annual session of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, has also provided a focus for dissenters, who have been sending petitions to parliamentary leaders. Premier Li Peng warned that China would resist human rights pressures, saying it would 'never allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs under any pretext'. Documents circulating in Beijing include an appeal by a group of academics for 'release of all those imprisoned because of their ideology and speech'. The academics, among them a couple whose son was killed in the 1989 pro-democracy protests, complained about the recent arrests of political activists. 'People of insight feel shocked and worried,' the petitioners told Mr Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC's standing committee, effectively the parliamentary speaker. Wang Dan, a prominent student leader from the 1989 pro-democracy movement, is reported to have written an open letter to the NPC calling for human rights issues to be placed on the agenda. Mr Christopher's visit is focusing renewed attention on Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident, detained last week and asked to leave Beijing for the time being. Yuan Hongbing, a lawyer, was also arrested last week and accused of being 'involved in unlawful acts in inciting turmoil' and disrupting order. Premier Li told the NPC yesterday that a resolution critical of China's human rights behaviour had failed in Geneva. 'This shows that to attack China by using human rights is unpopular,' he declared. For the second year, the UN human rights commission approved a Chinese motion not to vote on the resolution, which cited reports of execution and torture.</p>

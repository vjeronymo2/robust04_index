			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam and Chan Wai-fong] </F>   [Text] A rising star in the dissident movement has fled  China and made his way safely to the West through Hong Kong.  Informed sources said yesterday that Wang Jiaqi, 34, who was  detained by Beijing police in early March for helping organise a  petition for labour rights, arrived in Hong Kong last Friday.  The sources said the dissident, a graduate student in the Law  Faculty at Beijing University, was granted asylum by a Western  country and left Hong Kong on Thursday.    Wang, a police officer for several years before his  enrolment  at Beijing University, escaped from a detention facility in his  native Tangshan, a city in northern China where he was taken  under heavy guard after his arrest. Chinese sources said the  Miniseries of Public Security and State Security had been  ordered by the leadership to conduct a nationwide investigation  of his daring escape and to take remedial measures to plug the  loopholes.    Sources in the dissident community said that although Wang  joined the pro-democracy crusade after the June 4, 1989  massacre, he was deemed a rising star because of his leadership  qualities. Early this year, Wang reportedly formed a  non-governmental labour organisation of 100 activists to press  for such rights as freedom to strike. Two other leaders of the  unit, Beijing University law lecturer Yuan Hongbing and veteran  trade unionist Zhou Guoqiang, were detained with Wang. Yuan and  Zhou, who are being held incommunicado in Beijing, are expected  to be given at least two to three years of "re-education through  labour", according to Western diplomats.    Aside from his association with the labour movement, Wang  used his legal expertise to help a number of people sue the  Chinese Government and enterprises for infringing their civil  rights.    While in Hong Kong, Wang, who is in good health except for  an  ear infection, reportedly told friends he had great expectations  of the pro-democracy and labour movements. Wang, who is  divorced, expressed confidence that the crusade could be  strengthened in spite of the recent spate of arrests of its  leaders.    A Hong Kong government spokesman said yesterday that it was  policy not to comment on "individual cases."    A spokesman for the Tangshan Public Security Bureau said he  had no knowledge of the Wang case.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Slovak Government is disgusted with RFE  broadcasting. This is what RFE Director Robert Gillette said in  Bratislava today, adding that this is the real reason for the  Slovak side's termination of the agreement with RFE.    According to Transport and Communications Minister Roman  Hofbauer and Culture Minister Dusan Svobodnik, whom Director  Gillette met, RFE broadcasting is biased and is directed against  the Slovak Government. Gillette said that this was  unsubstantiated and added that the RFE hoped to reverse the  Slovak side's decision and conclude an agreement at the next  meeting scheduled for the end of January.</p>

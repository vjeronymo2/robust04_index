			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii expressed concern Tuesday [17 May] that the delay in  getting the fiscal 1994 budget through parliament could put a  damper on the economy, and stressed the need to limit the  adverse effects.    "I can't deny that a long delay in (passing) the budget will  affect the economy," Fujii told a regular news conference after  a morning cabinet meeting.    Diet deliberations for the full 40 trillion yen budget for  fiscal 1994 that started April 1 have been deadlocked because of  political turmoil, and are to resume later Tuesday.    With about two months usually needed for a full budget to  pass the Diet, however, the government decided last week to  supplement for 40 days an already implemented 50-day 11 trillion  yen stopgap budget that expires Friday.    "We must minimize the effects," Fujii added. But he did not  spell out any concrete measures, saying the necessary public  works and other outlays are included in the provisional budget.    The minister said, however, that fresh outlays in  policy-related areas, such as infrastructure spending under the  government's stimulus package, cannot be included in the planned  supplementary budget, just as they could not be in the expiring  stopgap budget.    Fujii said that he emphasized the importance for Japan to  detail deregulatory steps in line with the March market-opening  package during related ministerial talks held before the cabinet  meeting.    Noting that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "strongly" called  for  political leadership at each ministry and agency, Fujii said the  Finance Ministry will positively consider deregulation in  financial services and insurance, which are particularly  mentioned in the package.    But he said deregulation may cause some "pain" such as  unemployment, and called for steadily implementation of the jobs  and other welfare measures included in the full budget.</p>

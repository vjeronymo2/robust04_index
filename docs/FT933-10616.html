			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Group 4 to concentrate on guarding businesses GROUP 4, the private security company, is to sell its cash-in-transit business to the UK arm of Mayne Nickless, the Australian-quoted security company. In return, Group 4 will acquire Security Express Guards, Mayne Nickless's guarding business, which employs about 2,000 people. Group 4 will also receive a substantial cash payment. Mr Jim Harrower, UK chief executive of Group 4, said pressure from the banks meant the cash-in-transit business offered low profit margins and his group had decided to focus on guarding. The cash-handling business being sold by Group 4 employs 1,200 people, with annual revenue of Pounds 25m. Together with its existing cash-in-transit businesses, Security Express and Armaguard, this deal means Mayne Nickless will dominate the cash-in-transit market and should be able to achieve better profit margins. Security Express Guards will be merged with Group 4 Total Security to become the biggest provider of manned guarding services in the UK. Discussions have been held with the Office of Fair Trading and both companies believe the arrangement will not be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Before this deal, which will boost revenue by Pounds 23m, Group 4 Total Security had annual sales of about Pounds 82m, and employed 5,000 people.</p>

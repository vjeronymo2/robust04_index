			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: Reliance group seeks cash for refinery RELIANCE Petroleum, part of the Reliance Industries group, is promoting India's biggest equity issue, a Rs21.72bn (Dollars 691m) offering to be launched on September 23. The company will offer Rs8.61bn to the Indian public, Rs4.34bn to Indian financial institutions, and Rs2.17bn to foreign institutional investors registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The proceeds of the issue will be used to fund a Rs51.42bn 9m-tonne oil refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat. Indian mutual funds will be entitled to preferential allotments worth Rs4.34bn. Shareholders of Reliance Industries, excluding non-residents and global deposit-holders, will be offered shares worth Rs2.17bn. The plant will be India's first private-sector refinery, and will process petroleum crude. The prospectus says that growth in demand for petroleum products in India is expected to be between 5.2 and 6.5 per cent per year. Additional refining capacity is being added to the existing public-sector refineries, after a gap of 11 years. This will help save foreign exchange on the importation of petroleum products. The project, on India's western coast in Gujarat, is strategically located, enabling crude carriers to make a round trip to and from Saudi Arabia in 12 days, should domestic supplies from the nearby Bombay High oilfields be interrupted. Reliance has signed a memorandum of understanding with the government-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation, one of the largest distributors of petroleum products in India, for marketing its products. The proposed Kandla-Bhatinda pipeline will run close to the refinery, making transport of petroleum products economically viable and environmentally safe. Unilever is to merge two subsidiaries, Lipton and Brooke Bond India, writes RC Murthy from Bombay. The deal will be carried out through a share swap of nine Brooke bonds for 10 of Lipton. Lipton India's turnover last year was nearly Rs7bn, with a profit before tax of Rs340m. Brooke Bond recorded sales of Rs7. l4bn, with a profit before tax of Rs640m. The merger is part of Unilever's bid to integrate its food business in India into a single company, the company said.</p>

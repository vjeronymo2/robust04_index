The </F> Kidnapped Chief of the Rukh Secretariat Has Not Been Found Yet"]    [Excerpts] The election campaign in Ukraine, with the  abundance of aspirants for deputy seats, could not do without  manifestations of extremism. And its first victim has been one  of the most powerful political parties -- the Ukrainian People's  Rukh with a fixed membership of more than 50,000, which has  fielded candidates in practically all constituencies.    The Rukh Secretariat's press department reported that  overnight from 15 to 16 January an armed attack was launched on  the secretariat building. [passage omitted]    The central event of that night was the disappearance of  Mikhail Boychishin, 43, head of the Rukh Secretariat, deputy of  the Lvov Oblast Council and Rukh's parliament deputy candidate,  who left three hours before the attack but never got home.  [passage omitted]    Rukh leader and parliament deputy Vyacheslav Chornovil told  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that "we are dealing here  with a system of political provocations and political terror  with the only aim being the disruption of the normal conduct of  the election campaign and the intimidation of Rukh members and  voters." [passage omitted]    The actions by the authorities were glaringly passive. It  was not until Vyacheslav Chornovil's energetic intervention that  the police, prosecution, and security service bodies started an  investigation into Boychishin's disappearance. [passage omitted]    Ivan Makar, a Rukh critic, former human rights activist and  currently an independent member of parliament, holds a different  opinion on what has happened. In his view, there has been a  political provocation. "In all likelihood, Rukh itself has  organized this in order to gain extra points in the elections.  Whoever needed to seize Boychishin in the Rukh building when he  could have been easily captured near his home?" Ivan Makar said.  It should be noted that his view is apparently shared by  representatives of other Ukrainian political parties which are  in no hurry to issue statements in support of Rukh activists.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu Ming (0060 2494): "Hong Kong Is Quite Likely </F> To Have a Better Future--Hong Kong's Future in the Eyes of  Mainland Intellectuals"]    [Excerpts] Amid the hubbub of Sino-British political  disputes, an educated man, who had struggled for decades and  achieved some success in his career in Hong Kong, finally  decided, after a lot of hesitation, to emigrate to the country  of the maple leaf. He said, "I have no confidence in the 1997  changeover. I cannot bet my remaining years on fate." [passage  omitted]    Recently, a mainland scholar came to Hong Kong for a  visit. He was surprised at the anxious expression of his  friends. "What do you worry about?" he asked. "The critical year  of 1997? I am afraid that the Communist Party cannot survive to  that year."    According to this scholar, the Chinese communists' current  policy on Hong Kong, strictly speaking, is Deng Xiaoping's  personal policy, and their rule-by-man tradition is that when  the strong man exists, his policy prevails, and when he is gone,  his policy is no longer valid. Once Deng Xiaoping passes away,  the Hong Kong issue will take a turn for the better. Certainly,  the Hong Kong people need not worry too much, says this scholar.    Currently, all speeches on the Hong Kong issue made by  high-level officials of the Chinese communist regime are  strongly worded, and there appears to be no difference in view  among them. Especially in the recent past when the Chinese  communists were hurling Cultural-Revolution-type criticisms at  Chris Patten, almost all the top leaders came forward to  denounce him, either orally or in writing, sharing a bitter  hatred against this enemy. Nonetheless, as revealed by  mainlanders who are well aware of the inside story, the above  phenomenon in no way means that the Chinese communist leaders  are taking an entirely identical stand without the slightest  difference on this issue.    According to their observation, some of the speeches  did come from a strong nationalist sentiment, but more of them  were a declaration to Deng Xiaoping of the speakers' stance on  the issue.. Declaring your stance on an external issue,  they say, will not involve you in any factional struggle or  rivalry for interests within the party. Since the big boss has  set the keynote, there should be no opponent at the high stratum  in the Chinese communist regime.    Even so, however, some top Chinese communist leaders still  refrain from commenting on the Hong Kong issue, sources in  Beijing point out. The most noteworthy examples are Qiao Shi and  Tian Jiyun, chairman and first vice chairman, respectively, of  the National People's Congress [NPC], both of whom have the  authority to comment on the issue. Yet, since the Sino-British  political dispute began last year, neither Qiao nor Tian has  uttered a single word about the Hong Kong issue. All those in  diplomatic circles in Beijing regard this as food for thought.  [passage omitted]    Liberal intellectuals in Beijing believe that the young  generation of Chinese communist leaders, even including Jiang  Zemin and Li Peng--who are most disliked by the Hong Kong  people--are more pragmatic and know the trend better than old  leaders like Deng Xiaoping. Once Deng dies, they say, adjustment  of the Hong Kong policy may not be an unrealistic illusion.    As they point out, Hong Kong's future is principally  dictated by the changes that will take place on the mainland. In  the next two to three years, or around 1997, with the end of  old-man politics, the Chinese mainland will certainly undergo an  earth-shaking change, and the intensity of this change may even  outstrip the one triggered by Mao Zedong's death. Now, they say,  political circles in Hong Kong are vehemently arguing over the  Legislative Council's through-train issue [meaning that members  of Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may, upon confirmation  by the SAR Preparatory Committee, become members of the first  Legislative Council of the SAR on 1 July 1997]. Their argument  is based on the premise that the present political situation on  the mainland will not change. This is a moderate thinking, but  using it as a premise shows an inadequate understanding of  China's reality and a lack farsightedness about its future  development.    In a very affirmative tone, a liberal intellectual has  made this remark: If the Chinese communist power is  shaken, the Hong Kong Basic Law, which the Hong Kong people have  now been forced to accept, will be radically changed. It may be  even replaced by a new law to conform with the Hong Kong  people's wish for democracy and autonomy.    According to this intellectual, when talking privately,  mainland scholars who are concerned about the Hong Kong issue  look at the Hong Kong basic law drafting and advisory committees  as copies of the mainland's NPC and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. With their operations  controlled by the Chinese communists, they are merely Beijing's  rubber stamps disguised as organizations of voices of the  people. Therefore, some people call them "small NPC" and "small  CPPCC." It is doubtful that they can truly represent the will of  the mainland and Hong Kong people. At least, they are far from  legally sound as lawmakers. The new basic law in the future  should not contain the extremely absurd concept of "one country,  two systems." The gist of the new law should be the protection  of Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, not anything like the  capitalist system remaining unchanged for 50 years. This way,  the dispute over the political system will be automatically  resolved.    Another liberal intellectual says that the main reason for  the Chinese communists' strong stance on the Hong Kong issue is  not that they want to totally control Hong Kong's politics after  1997. It is rather because they are afraid that a Hong  Kong effect will appear on the mainland. The Chinese communists  regard Britain's new policy of accelerating the democratic  reform in Hong Kong as a bridgehead used by the West in laying  an all-out siege to Red China in the post-Cold War era.  [passage omitted]    The Chinese communist authorities and dissident  intellectuals, he says, take diametrically opposite stands on  the Hong Kong issue. The latter view Hong Kong as a forward  position to introduce democracy into the mainland. They have a  very good opinion about Chris Patten and his political reform  package, and support the democrats in Hong Kong.    An academically prestigious magazine on the mainland,  DUSHU, carries an article on the Sino-British Opium War in its  last March issue. The viewpoint of the article is diametrically  opposite to the official stand. It says that the objective  result of the Opium War "was in essence the triumph of  modern society over medieval society and western capitalism over  eastern feudalism." This is a relatively powerful criticism  of the nationalist hysteria that the Chinese communist  authorities have energetically exhibited since the start of the  Sino-British political dispute.    With regard to Hong Kong's future, some mainland academics  studying the Hong Kong and Macao questions hold that the degree  of autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong in relation to the mainland and  the method of autonomy to be adopted will depend mainly on  economic rather than political factors, or more specifically,  the economic link between Hong Kong and the mainland, especially  southern China. Judging from the present situation, they believe  that the Hong Kong and mainland economies are closely linked and  interdependent and are on the road of common prosperity. Because  of this, it is almost impossible for Hong Kong to divorce itself  from China and become independent even in case the Chinese  communist regime collapses.    These academics are rather interested in Hong Kong's legal  system and political operations as well as its fledgling party  politics. They say: As for political construction in the  future, two systems are available for the mainland's reference:  One is to learn from Taiwan; the other is to learn from Hong  Kong. Hong Kong's political system has the same advantages as  the British political system. For instance, it is rational,  moderate, corruption-resistant, and governed by legality. This  can make up for the insufficiency of China's traditional  culture.    According to their forecast, in the future Hong Kong may  have a bipartisan system like Britain, that is, a Conservative  Party and a Labor Party. The present Liberal Party may play the  role of the Conservative Party, while the United Democrats of  Hong Kong may act as the Labor Party. The Pro-China Democratic  Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, though presently  believed to have a great potential, may lose its position and  disappear from Hong Kong's political arena as time passes by.    They further point out that the Democratic Alliance for  the Betterment of Hong Kong now exists by attaching itself to  the Chinese Communist Party. At present, it has the advantage of  acting as a middleman between Beijing and the public of Hong  Kong. If there is a change in China's situation in the future,  this advantage will no longer be available. It appears that if  the Communist Party collapses, the Democratic Alliance may  follow the example of the communist parties in Eastern Europe to  take the road of a socialist party and act as a spokesman for  the working people. Such a road has proved feasible in Europe.  In China, however, because the communist authorities have, for  more than a decade, attached much weight to the capitalist side  in implementing their united front strategy, the Democratic  Alliance, which rose up by developing the worker movement, will  find itself in a dilemma if it takes the above-mentioned road.  Moreover, the United Democrats of Hong Kong, another party which  represents the public at the middle and low strata and which has  the character of a labor party, has quickly grown strong amid  the democratic tide. Even if the Democratic Alliance would turn  around, it would not be able to rival the United Democrats of  Hong Kong.    In contrast, the Liberal Party, though seemingly in  a somewhat awkward position at present, will have a very  promising future, according to mainland academics. In Hong  Kong's modern industrial and commercial society, the middle  bourgeoisie is a strong class. It is a firm supporter for the  free economy. Most people of this class do not oppose democratic  politics, but they may not necessarily approve of the  free-lunch-type social well-being advocated by the United  Democrats of Hong Kong. In view of this, after the Chinese  communists' threat has disappeared, the Liberal Party, which  represents the interests of the middle bourgeoisie as well as  small and medium capitalists, will grow in strength.    Even when there is no threat from the Communist Party,  disparities in culture and systems will still perplex Hong Kong.  This, the mainland academics say, will be a long-lasting problem  difficult to overcome.</p>

This was  noted by Virgilijus Bulovas, the head of the Lithuanian working  group for negotiations with the CIS countries, in an interview  with Lithuanian television, where he commented on a draft  agreement on military transit received recently from Russia.    As already reported, the negotiating group adopted a  decision  at its meeting that the draft submitted by Russia could be  examined only after the Lithuanian Seimas passes a law on the  transportation of military and dangerous loads through the  territory of Lithuania. Bulovas noted that, in the opinion of  Lithuanian experts, only military transit by rail can be  discussed. Transit by road would be unacceptable to Lithuania;  separate international regulations exist for air transport and  permits for flights must be obtained at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs. In the opinion of Bulovas, Lithuania therefore cannot  sign a separate agreement on military transit with Russia.  Regulations are the same for all countries, whether it is NATO  or Russia, said the head of the working group.    According to him, the working group is at present preparing  regulations for the transportation of dangerous loads by rail  through the territory of Lithuania. In addition, Bulovas noted,  Lithuania has no two borders with Russia. Therefore it will be  necessary to conclude either a tripartite agreement among  Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania, or three separate bilateral  agreements. Bulovas also noted that Russia has been lately  making an extensive use of sea transit. According to him, this  is confirmed by the fact that there are fewer transportations by  rail than planned.</p>

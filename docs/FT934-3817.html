			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Castrol sets up new technology centre Castrol, the UK-based lubricants multinational, has established a Bt45m (Dollars 1.7m) technology centre in Thailand to support Asia's fast-growing lubricants markets, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Castrol profits in Asia have been growing at more than 10 per cent a year and the region now accounts for more than a fifth of Castrol's worldwide profits. Castrol Thailand already ranks sixth among the group's affiliates and could soon be more profitable than Castrol UK, company executives say. The new building is Castrol's first major technical centre to specialise in motorcycle lubricant research outside the UK. 'The Thai motorcycle market is showing a steady incline, but the development of more efficient two-stroke lubricants is becoming more vital,' said Mr Philip Prescott Beasley, technical director of Castrol Thailand. Thailand has some 7m motorcycles and more than 1m cars. Castrol, which has more than 20 per cent of the automotive business in Thailand, has found many customers stay loyal to their brand when they move from motorcycle to car.</p>

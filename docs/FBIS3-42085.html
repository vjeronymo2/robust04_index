According to Mr. S.B. Bhoje, director, Reactor Group, the  output would be further raised to 10 MW tomorrow morning and to  10.5 MW in the evening.    `Everything is working very nicely. We reached another  milestone at 3.45 p.m. today, when we completed 10,000 hours of  operation after the FBTR attained criticality in 1985. Much of  the 10,000 hours was achieved in 1992 and 1993,' said Mr. Bhoje.    The IGCAR scientists and engineers would operate the FBTR at  10.5 MW for four days. Later, they would do reactor physics  experiments on the core kinetics and engineering tests on the  plant dynamics.    With today's performance, there was a bright chance of power  from the FBTR being wheeled into the Tamil Nadu Electricity grid  in January 1994.    The latest developments follow the Atomic Energy Regulatory  Board clearance for raising the output after various checks.    The FBTR output would be raised to 12.5 MW in a few months  and it would reach its full capacity of 40 MW (thermal) in two  years, said sources in the Atomic Energy Commission.    The FBTR is a forerunner to India's ambitious Prototype Fast  Breeder Reactor with a capacity of 500 MW (electrical).</p>

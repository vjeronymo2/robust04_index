This was the seventh consecutive year Comrade Deng Xiaoping  joined people in Shanghai to mark the Spring Festival since 1988.    The hall of meeting was decorated with flowers and imbued  with a spring atmosphere. With a smile, Comrade Deng Xiaoping  walked to the front of the comrades in Shanghai in high spirits  and with firm strides. Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai  Municipal party committee, and Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor, stepped  forward to express their sincere blessings to Comrade Xiaoping.    Wu Bangguo said: "On behalf of the 13 million people in  Shanghai, I wish you a happy Spring Festival, health, and long  life; I wish your whole family happiness."    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I wish the leading comrades of  the central authorities with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core a  happy Spring Festival and good health. I wish people throughout  the country a happy Spring Festival, happy family lives, unity,  and greater victories in the new year."    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "I come to Shanghai once a year  to wish the people in Shanghai a happy Spring Festival."    Wu Bangguo said: "This is your encouragement for people in  Shanghai. It shows your concern and support for the work in  Shanghai."    Comrade Deng Xiaoping said happily: "You people in Shanghai  have done a really good job in your work."    During his stay in Shanghai, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed  great concern for Shanghai's material and spiritual  construction. He fully affirmed the successes achieved by  people in Shanghai in the past year. He said: "Shanghai has  accomplished its work very well. Shanghai has special qualities  and character. Shanghai is fully capable of proceeding faster."    On 13 December 1993, Shanghai was engulfed by force 6 chilly  wind and drizzle. The temperature abruptly dropped to about  zero degrees Celsius. On the morning of that day, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, accompanied by Wu Bangguo, Huang Ju, and others,  inspected Pudong and ascended the Yangpu Bridge to view the  teeming construction in Pudong. Having inspected the Pudong  section of the inner ring and the two overpasses over Luoshan  Road and Longyang Road, which were completed last year, Comrade  Xiaoping said with a smile: "Watching these roads with joy  today is better than reading books for 100 years." He told  Comrades Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju: "These words are from the  bottom of my heart."    Standing on the magnificent Yangpu Bridge, Comrade Xiaoping  held the hands of Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of the  construction of the bridge, and praised him: "This is a victory  of the Shanghai working class. I salute the Shanghai working  class!"    On the eve of the New Year, in the company of Wu Bangguo,  Huang Ju, and others, Comrade Deng Xiaoping ascended to the top  floor of the Jinjiang Tower, looking down the brightly  illuminated Shanghai streets. He said: "Shanghai has changed."  Seeing Comrade Deng Xiaoping unexpectedly, Chinese and foreign  tourists marking the holiday at the hotel could not but give him  a long applause and express their respect and best wishes to  him. With a smile, Comrade Xiaoping waved to them in  acknowledgement. This evening, he also went to the congested  Nanjing Road and the bund to enjoy the jubilation of the holiday  with people in Shanghai.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping was very pleased to hear that the  Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant No. 1 generator unit had been  successfully put into operation. This morning, he asked Comrade  Li Peng to convey his congratulations and gratitude to the  builders, scientists, and technicians of Dayawan Nuclear Power  Plant.</p>

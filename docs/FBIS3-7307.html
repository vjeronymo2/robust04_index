"If the (opposition) Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)  persistently refuses to open (Diet) deliberations, there would  be only two options -- whether only the ruling parties  deliberate as an extraordinary measure or Hosokawa takes  responsibility (for the delay)," Makoto Tanabe said in an  address in Tokyo. The LDP has refused for more than two weeks  to start deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, already two  months behind schedule, until Hosokawa gives a full accounting  of a 100 million yen loan he received from the scandal-ridden  Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group.    In past Diet sessions, Hosokawa has repeatedly said he took  the loan to help finance repairs on his residence in Kumamoto  Prefecture and later repaid it to Sagawa Kyubin's network of  trucking and parcel-delivery companies.    Tanabe also said Hosokawa should not dissolve the House of  Representatives. He said he should not call an election under  the current system.    The Diet recently passed a package on changing the election  system, but the bills have not yet taken effect.</p>

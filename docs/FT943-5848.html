			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Defence stocks on alert Defence and industrial giant British Aerospace advanced sharply as speculation that it is to merge with defence electronics group GEC returned to the market. The talk was fuelled by this week's Dollars 10bn merger between Lockheed and Martin Marietta, and shares in BAe closed 20 ahead at 504p, having touched 508p earlier in the day, to make it the best performing stock among FT-SE 100 constituents. However, turnover at 2.7m was modest and several analysts suggested that a merger was unlikely in the near term. Trade in GEC was also light, totalling a mere 2m. The shares held at 308p. One market watcher said: 'I find today's move in BAe surprising; after all, the new merged group in the US is likely to provide stiff comp-etition.' Some dealers put the day's rise down to straightforward catching up following recent underperformance. Others pointed to some switching from Rolls-Royce into BAe. There were also bargain hunters ahead of next week's Farnborough Air Show.</p>

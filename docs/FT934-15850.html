			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Ministers may cut cash for Crossrail THE GOVERNMENT may scrap plans to make an upfront contribution to the cost of the Pounds 2bn Crossrail transport project for London. This comes as part of its drive to meet public spending targets for the next three years. Ministers are considering instead asking private investors to fund the entire cost of the scheme to build two tunnels under central London, while agreeing to subsidise the project once it is up and running. The move would have obvious attractions for the Treasury because it would defer the time when public funds needed to be earmarked for the project until later in the decade and help to resolve the fierce cabinet struggle raging over departmental budgets. Under the present plans, Pounds 65m of public money would be allocated to Crossrail in 1995-96, with a further - as yet unspecified but probably larger - amount required for the period 1996-97. This is the year that is currently provoking some of the most intense wrangling between ministers with the gap between Whitehall spending bids and the agreed targets proving impossible to bridge. Ministers had been anticipating a public contribution to Crossrail of between Pounds 800m and Pounds 1.2bn. This would have left up to 60 per cent of funding to be raised from the private sector. In July, the government announced that another transport project - the Pounds 300m resignalling of the busy London Euston to Glasgow line - was to be funded and carried out by the private sector. There has been mounting criticism of the government's progress in its attempts to involve private-sector finance in public-sector infrastructure projects. Some private companies and critics in government spending departments say that the private-sector initiative has become an excuse for delaying projects such as Crossrail. Crossrail would enable passengers travelling on suburban trains into British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to reach the West End and the City without having to change to the Underground system. The scheme is thought to be at least a year away from full clearance, following the second reading of the parliamentary bill needed for it to go ahead in June. Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said in June that the government wanted the private sector 'fundamentally' involved in Crossrail.</p>

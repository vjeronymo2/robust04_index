			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Collection of essays in reportage: "An Investigative Report </F> on China's Surplus Rural Labor Force; Exploring the Sources,  Part II -- The Land That Cannot Bear More Burdens?"]    [Text] Can Grain and Hogs Keep Peace on Land Under  Heaven--by reporter Mao Hao [3029 3185]    Last winter, Chengdu was bubbling over with the high tide of  grain price increases. However, everything was quiet at the  Hengsheng township, Guangan county, which was several kilometers  away from Chengdu. Guangan is a famous granary in northern  Sichuan. Our reporter visited the Guozi village of the township.  Along the road, what he saw were plots of paddy fields. Peasants  had stored water for winter a long time ago. They only wish to  grow one season of grain crops next year.    Just like in any hilly district in northern Sichuan, 90  percent of the young people in Guozi village left the village to  work somewhere else. The average age of those left behind was 51  years old. Liu Benren, Secretary of the village's party branch,  said: "People always wish to live a better life, while water  always flows downward. Who can tie up their feet?"    He has four sons and two daughter-in-laws working in other  provinces. He himself stays behind to do farming for eight  persons. "I was really upset during the busy farming season. I  plan to call one daughter-in-law back next year. However, which  one should I call? That is a good question," he said. In that  village, calling a young worker back means a considerable loss  of income.    In many areas of northern Sichuan, traditional farming  (particularly grain production) has become a "sideline  production" aimed at providing basic grain for peasants' own  consumption, fulfilling the task in grain production and making  payments for agricultural tax and public welfare funds and other  expenses. He calculated as follows: On the presumption that he  reaps two harvests of crops a year. The per-mu yield of paddy  rice is 1,000 jin and that of wheat 300 jin. He would receive  about 480 yuan for each mu of farm produce. Only 180 yuan is  left after he deducts 240 yuan of production costs, 60 yuan for  tax (not including miscellaneous expenses). "That is why  peasants say that farming would only give peasants rice crusts  instead of rice," he added. Our reporter visited the Hengsheng  post office and found out that the average per capita annual  income of a villager working outside is approximately 2,500 yuan.    It seems that Heaven itself makes special arrangements for  the Guozi village to engage in farming. The gray, brown and  purple soil in its Shaqimiao area is extremely fertile and good  in retaining moisture and fertility. The climate is mild around  the village with an annual precipitation of 1,050 ml, 1,246  hours of sunshine time and 320 days free of frost. There was a  saying in history about "gold Guangan and silver Yuechi" (which  means the local bumper harvest of millet and paddy rice). Thus,  the saying that "grain and hogs can keep peace on land under  heaven" has always been a local creed that make people sincerely  convinced.    Nevertheless, this creed is no longer useful. For the past  40 years since liberation, particularly since the implementation  of the system of production contracted to the household in 1981,  peasants in the Guozi village have greatly emancipated the  productive forces by carrying out farming with a scientific  approach. The per-unit yield of grain (paddy rice) in 1985  registered a five-fold increase over 1949. The fact that  increases in production, but not income, has made peasants  worriless about food and clothing, but they can hardly become  rich. Prior to the exodus of a large number of labor force, the  per capita income of villagers in the Guozi village was  wavering, for eight years, around 400 yuan which is just enough  to cover food and clothing only.    Slack farming season is a good time for building new houses.  About 20 percent of the families in the village have built new  houses since 1989. The majority of the families have people  working outside. On one occasion, our reporter met Xiao Guanghe  who just came back from Guanddong. He worked as a small  contractor with a net monthly income of 2,000 yuan (He does not  have work to do every month.) Right now, he is planning to  build a 30,000-yuan new house. According to the local customs,  men have to leave their family and live separately after  reaching adulthood. Therefore, they often leave their hometown  to start their new life. Their parents often cannot afford to  support them from their meager farming income. It was under this  condition that Xiao Guanghe left the village with a 400 yuan  debt from his marriage. He paid back what he owed in the first  year right after he started working outside.    The loss of creditability of the grain-hog creed is even  more clear on the issue of land. In the past, there were always  disputes among peasants on the uneven distribution of  responsibility fields. Now nobody is willing to accept any  farming assignment. In order to avoid any penalty for leaving  the farmland idle, old people and women often take over the  responsibility for farming. Anyone who wishes to sub-contract a  mu of farmland for farming, he or she has to pay 50 yuan per mu  of farmland to the one who accepts the responsibility for  farming. Someone pointed at a plot of dry land which was lying  idle to our reporter, saying that the person supposed to till  this piece of land is an orphan. He left the village and worked  outside for many years now. No one is paying any tax so far.    Liu Huaifu left the village and worked outside a year ago.  He  is now the deputy manager of the engineering command of the  Chuanhui Group in Guangdong. Perhaps because he is educated, he  can do a better job in doing calculation. In 1993, he  straightforwardly bought grain from a supply and marketing  cooperative and turned it over the state and considered his  obligation to till his responsibility farmland as completely  fulfilled.  <H5>  A String Cannot Hold--by reporter Sun Kai [1327 0418] </H5>   The first person our reporter visited in the Xinzhuang  village was Huang Junfang, who ranked quite low in the Huang  clan in terms of seniority.    From her outward appearance, Huang Junfang was entirely  different from the village girls that our reporter met in the  village. She wore a pair of ankle boots, a pair of jeans and a  fashionable coat and had a fine hair style. In the Xinzhuang  village, Gangu county, this 20-year old girl spoke Mandarin with  a mixture of Guangdong and Gansu accents. She said: "What I  cannot stand here is the lack of changes. Everything here  remains the same as when I was a child." After graduating from a  junior middle school three years ago, Huang Junfang went to  Dongguan, Guangdong Province, and worked in a woolen textile  mill. She just returned home to spend her new year here.    Our reporter talked to many young people in the village.  They shared Huang Junfang's views.    People did farming scores of years ago just like their  grandparents and parents. They still carry out farming in the  same way.    Dozens of years ago, the narrow streets in the village were  full of mud on rainy days. They are still full of mud on rainy  days today.    Scores of years ago, the toilet in their house was  concurrently used as a pig sty. It was so dirty that one could  hardly put one's feet down. It is still the same way now.    Naturally, now they have enough to eat, and they can eat  white bread and meat regularly. Many people can also watch  television. However, as far as the young people are concerned,  they are not satisfied.    After graduating from a junior or senior middle school,  what can they do at home? Tilling a small plot of farmland is no  fun either. Therefore, they just loved to loaf around.  Fortunately there is the billiard. They spend a great deal of  time in the billiard room. The millionaires in the developed  countries will be shocked if they visit the most backward  countryside in China, because they would discover that this kind  of gentlemen's game is everywhere in China's rural areas. They  would perhaps see an unkempt peasant using a cue to hit the  balls just as dexterously as those bigshots in a television  program.    However, young people still seek to leave the village! The  per capita 0.3 mu of farmland to each person is a harsh reality  which pushes the young people out of the village to look for a  new and better life somewhere else.    Huang Junfang said: "It is only when I am outside that I  realize that what kind of a poor life did I live before. It is  just like what the song describes -- the world outside is  wonderful. Right now I earn more than 1,000 yuan a month in  Dongguan. In addition to what I give to my family, I can still  buy clothing and other things for myself."    "I already have many friends in Dongguan. They teach me to  speak Cantonese. Sometimes we went out to sing Karaoke. I feel  that my life there is very happy. Right now, each time I come  home to spend the new year, I feel uncomfortable. Everything is  not right. I am no longer accustomed to this kind of  environment," she added.    "There was a girl in the neighboring village. She is a  senior  middle school graduate. She is good in English. When she went to  Dongguan, she worked as a temporary English teacher in a school.  Later, she stopped teaching because of her heavy Gansu accent.  However, she met another teacher in the same school and married  him. Now she has a son, leading a happy life. Once she visited  us, and all of us admire her immensely," she continued.    Looking at Huang Junfang, our reporter asked her: "Would you  like to settle down there and never come back again?"    "I like to do so, but whether or not I can achieve this goal  is another question," she replied.  <H5>  One Cannot Afford To Build a House If One Needs To Feed </H5> Oneself by Farming -- by reporter Liu Jian [0491 0256]    Moving, an immigrant's aspiration, seems to have been  instilled into the gene of Liu's offsprings. Even during the 30  odd years in which the system of household registration was  mostly strictly implemented in China's history, villagers of the  Liujiaguanfang Village had persistently left the village and  moved to other localities. Gradually less people moved out of  the village after land division in 1981 until the mid-1980s,  because there were high yields of crops several years running,  the price of grain was higher than that of industrial products,  and peasants earned more money by growing crops. In addition,  there was neither fund-raising nor fund retention for other  miscellaneous expenses. Nor was there any "movement." Another  peak of labor force exodus took place between 1986 and 1987,  because the pressure for subsistence had once again increased.    In the vicinity of the Liujiaguanfang Village, peasants  generally grow one season of wheat and one season of peanuts. A  village cadre calculated in such a way. Suppose a mu of farmland  yields 200 kg of peanuts a year (this output is already fairly  high) and the net income from this will be 700 yuan. Peasants  need to invest a minimum of 70 yuan for chemical fertilizer, 20  yuan for insecticide, 20 yuan for plastic film, 60 yuan for  seeds and 20 yuan for tractor plowing. Again suppose the per-mu  yield of wheat is 175 kg (this output is already fairly high)  and the net income of this will be 140 yuan. Peasants need to  spend 10 yuan for tractor plowing, 20 yuan for seeds, 10 yuan  for sowing, 55 yuan for chemical fertilizer and 10 yuan for  insecticide. By adding and subtracting the aforementioned income  and expenses and deducting 6.5 yuan for land tax and 200 yuan  for the grain which peasants need to consume themselves, the net  income will be approximately 340 yuan. After the mid-80s, a "two  fields system" was introduced. The per-capita 1.5 mu of farmland  was split into 0.8 mu of farmland planted with grain for  peasants' own consumption and 0.7 mu of high-priced farmland  which was taxed 100 yuan per mu. If these expenses were deducted  and funds were retained for miscellaneous expenses, the annual  net income from each mu of farmland would be less than 200 yuan.    This was entirely unthinkable ten years ago. An old man  recalled that a bag of compound fertilizer which he paid 70 yuan  now only cost 18 yuan at that time. A bag of ammonium  bicarbonate made in the United States which he paid more than 90  yuan now only cost 36 yuan at that time. There was no  high-priced farmland which we need to pay 100 yuan per mu as  land money. Peasants only needed to pay land tax no matter what  kind of land it was. The prices for insecticide, and electricity  are up. So is the amount of retention for public welfare funds  and miscellaneous expenses.    The highest price increase is wedding. The old custom of  having a family of three or four different generations living  under the same roof is already smashed to pieces. No girl is  going to marry someone who cannot afford independent housing.  Even matchmakers would find all doors shut if the prospective  bridegroom has no house of his own. Straw huts with earth-filled  walls are out of fashion long time ago. Only bridegrooms with  houses built of tiles and bricks and with glass windows will be  considered. No matter how poor a bridegroom is, he must have a  house of high standards, otherwise he would remain a bachelor  for a long time. Several years ago, one must pay 5,000 yuan for  a good house. Now standards are becoming higher and higher, and  the building materials are becoming more and more expensive. Now  it would cost at least 10,000 yuan to build a house. Another  10,000 yuan are needed to pay for the wedding expenses. If the  young people in the village were not hard pressed by the 20,000  yuan they need to get married, there would be less young people  leaving.    College and military service are the two ways for young  people to distinguish themselves. During the 13 years between  1981 and 1993, 12 young people from the Liujiaguanfang Village  passed examinations and entered colleges and graduate schools.  More than 100 years before, the most educated person in the  Liujiaguanfang was Liu Songsheng, sometimes called Yuezhong or  Junfeng, who was a candidate for the lowest degree under the  former civil service examination in 1851 during the Qing  Dynasty. The only goal to study is to enter a college. (People  in Liujiaguanfang regard postgraduate, undergraduate and  polytechnic school students as "college students.") All of them  belong to a higher class. As for those children who are not so  bright and whose academic standards are low, parents usually  dragged them to do farming as soon as they finish their primary  school education. If they have the slight hope to pass the  college examination, the parents would economize on food and  clothing to let them continue to study. When they fail one  examination, they would attend revision classes for another  year. If they failed again, they would attend revision class for  another year.... Among the 12 college students, only one of  them got into college as soon as he graduated from the senior  middle school. All others had to repeat classes or attended  revision classes from one to five years before they passed the  college entrance examination. That means they had to attend the  college entrance examination from two to six times. One of them  had to transfer his household registration to Qihetai in  Heilongjiang Province, because the standard is much lower there  and he had a better chance to pass the college entrance  examination.    Many of the young people in the Liujiaguanfang village serve  in the army, but few of them ever came back to resume farming  again. They often worked hard to distinguish themselves after  joining the army. Even if they do not become cadres, they would  work hard to win the title of "volunteers." In short, they try  one thousand and one ways to change their rural residence  registration to a city or other non-rural resident registration.    Between 1992 and 1993, city or "other nonrural resident  registration" is on sale everywhere in the village. A Linyi  resident registration was worth 5,000 yuan, and that of Junan  resident registration 3,000 yuan. In 1993, five villagers of the  Liuchiaguanfang village used this simple but quick way to move  to the city.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table (II) (By village)                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Item        |Liujiaguanf-|Xinzhuang V-|Huxia Villa-|Guozi Villa-|Dagang Vill-|  |            |ang Village,|illage, Gan-|ge, Jiangxi |ge, Sichuan |age, Jiangs-|  |            | Shandong P-|su Province |            |Province    |u Province  |  |            |rovince     |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |population  |1,115       |1,406       |1,065       |1,119       |1,768       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |per capita  |1.5 mu      |0.32 mu     |1.76 mu     |0.87 mu     |1.1 mu      |  |farmland    |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Degree of M-|24 tractors |0           |3 small tru-|power equip-|315 kw      |  |echanization|            |            |cks         |ment for fa-|            |  |            |            |            |            |rming 170 h-|            |  |            |            |            |            |orse power  |            |  |            |            |            |            |and irrigat-|            |  |            |            |            |            |ion power e-|            |  |            |            |            |            |quipment    |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total Manpo-|400         |350         |633         |771         |980         |  |wer         |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Floating Ma-|210         |over 300    |35          |310         |200         |  |npower      |            |            |            |            |            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Family of a Runaway From Marriage--by Lu Yaogang [4141 6460 </H5> 0474]    I finally met Zou Binzi. When I hurriedly entered the old,  shabby waiting room at the Nanchang Railway Station on 4 January  this year, it was already 2000 hours in the evening. I saw this  dark and lean young man sitting there and reading a READERS  magazine. He was just like a needle in the haystack which I just  picked up.    Zou Benzi was born in the Huxia Village. I stayed in his  house for eight days. I could see that his honest and sincere  parents did not know the true reason for my visit. Nor did they  know that their smart son Benzi had gone to Beijing to look for  a job in order to runaway from a marriage which they had  arranged for him earlier. Benzi was new in Beijing. He slept  under the Jianguomen Overpass at night and looked for job during  the daytime. It was a freezing early spring. Running out of  cash, Benzi was in a desperate position. He was hungry and cold.  He wandered around on the streets in Beijing for ten days. He  was mentally on the verge of a total collapse. It was at the  time that our newspaper's "Hotline for Young People" saved him  on time.    In rural areas, parents also do not lead an easy life. Benzi  has a family of seven including two elder brothers, one younger  sister and one younger brother. His two elder brothers got  married and moved out. So was his sister. The next one in line  for marriage is Benzi himself. However, Benzi who just left the  army did not want to get married according to his parents' wish.  He just ran away, although his parents had already paid 3,200  yuan as betrothal gifts to the bride-to-be. with their son  disappeared and the bride-to-be family refusing to return the  betrothal gifts according to a village custom, the parents  poured out endless grievances.    There were six villagers' groups and 253 families in the  Huxia Village. All villagers were of three surnames -- Zou, Fu  and He. Zou Benzi's family belongs to the lower middle class in  terms of living standards. Three thousand two hundred yuan is an  astronomical figure! Now the money is gone forever. Price  changes every year for wedding. If a man does not have 10,000  yuan now, he has little chance to get married. Zou Pinzi's  family has five mu of paddy rice field and three mu of upland  field. In 1993, a natural calamity hit the farmland sown with  early rice. The family only harvested 4,500 jin of paddy rice,  400 jin of peasants, 70 jin of soybean, more than 30 jin of  sesame and over 100 jin of rape seeds. When all accounts were  settled, the family's net income from farming was only 1,000  yuan after all the expenses were deducted (not counting the  labor cost). Although the purchasing price for 100 jin of grain  changed from over 20 yuan to 40 yuan, peasants in the vicinity  of the Poyang lake only have a slight surplus from their  double-crop paddy rice, even if they have engaged in meticulous  farming, and weather is good for the crops. More serious is the  fact that no one can prevent the price of the agricultural  producer goods from increasing. These price increases would cut  the small amount of surplus even further. The possibility for  peasants to become well-to-do is almost zero. Relying on his  dexterity, Zou Benzi's father has a sideline job of gathering  and selling goose feather during the slack farming season, and  earns about 1,000 yuan to help the family pay bills. However, he  can only save about 200 to 300 yuan after paying all the  expenses and putting aside enough money for preparing farming  for the next year. Then, how many years they have to work hard  in order to save enough money to help Benzi get married?    Under the light of a dim kerosene lamp, Benzi's mother said  to our reporter with a sigh: "There is nothing our family can do  to help Benzi any more in this connection. Let the brothers go  out and blaze their trail."    Nevertheless, Zou Benzi also clearly understands that  although he has finally attained his parents' understanding and  extricated himself from the prearranged wedding, he has not  completely broken away from his predicament in subsistence. This  is the main reason for him to leave the village and work  outside. That was precisely the topic he talked about most when  he made a special trip from Guangdong's Kaiping City to see me.  <H5>  World in Southern Jiangsu Is Wonderful--by Dai Yuanzhi [2071 </H5> 5913 2388]    No highway leads to the village. Nor is there any telephone  in the village. One must cross the two main rivers in Southern  Jiangsu -- the Tongyu River and the Chuanchang River, in order  to go to the Goudun Township in Funing County where the village  is. It takes 90 minutes to travel from Nanjing to Beijing by  ship. However, it takes 70 minutes to ride the only  private-owned passenger boat to travel from the village to the  township.    With an opportune chance, Chen Liang, a young man of the  Jieyu villagers' group of the Dagang Village of the Goudun  Township in Funing County, Jiangsu, left his home village which  was surrounded by water on three sides in the spring of 1993,  travelled to Southern Jiangsu, arrived in the flourishing city  of Wuxi, and worked in a state-owned factory.    A year ago, our reporter, under a moonlight, rode his  bicycle along a narrow path and crossed two rivers and came to  visit Chen Liang's family.    It was a quiet night in winter in the countryside. A thick  layer of frost like snow settled on the ground. We smoked, drank  tea and talked informally.    "Our village is always in the red. However, documents show  that the 1993 per-capita net income in the village is 920 yuan.  Sometimes, it is said to be over 800 yuan. (Some people said it  was only 400 to 500 yuan, while others said 900 yuan.) In 1992,  the village reported its per-capita net income to the high level  as 750 yuan. The report failed to pass the township level.  Finally, it was agreed to be 880 yuan."    Villagers who surrounded the reporter calculated as follows:  There are 1,950 mu of farmland, power equipment for farming  totaling 170 horsepower and power pumps for water drainage  totaling 315 kw in the whole village. There are 980 able-bodied  peasants in the village, but only 500 peasants are needed for  farming. There is a surplus labor of 480 people.    A villager said: "A person who works outside can earn 1,000  to 2,000 yuan a month. Most of the young people like to work  outside and earn more money."    Chen Liang's family of six (including the grandmother they  support) takes care of 10.6 mu of farmland. It raises some hogs  and chickens. It also has a hand-driver tractor, a boat with a  12-horsepower motor and a rice mill. The family is considered as  doing well in the village.    However, Chen Liang's father said, I would have left the  village long ago, if I have no facilities like these. I am  someone who looks good in appearance, but lacks cash at home. My  net income is several thousand yuan, but the money is never in  my hands. People owe me money, and there is nothing I can do  about it. When I went to the southern part of the Yangtze River  last year, I really wanted to leave the village. If I work hard  outside for a year, I would have cash on hand.    He said that right now, Chen Liang and his sister are  working  in Lucun, Wuxi. One works as a "peasant-turned contract worker"  at the state-run Xinsu Machinery Plant, while the other works as  a "contract worker" at a workshop in the Textile Varieties  Research Institute. After the Spring Festival Chen Liang is  going to send his younger sister to Wuxi. If there are suitable  jobs and a place to live, he (Chen Liang's father) and his wife  also plan to leave the village and work outside, and let the  grandparents take care of their home.    Driven by the financial benefits, over 200 of the 480  surplus men and women are working in other provinces, and more  than 100 of them are working as temporary workers outside. With  the development of the market economy today, the manpower is  being used in close connection with tools of production [sheng  chan gong ju 3932 3934 1562 0367) and objects of labor [lao dong  dui xiang 0525 0520 1417 6272] according to the principle of  market allocation. The export of labor force is perhaps one of  the ways to help a less developed area become well-to-do.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, May 13, RIA -- Russian Vice-Premier and  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told a RIA correspondent  here yesterday that restrictions on Russian exports cost his  country up to three billion dollars a year. He said that Russia  lost vast sums of money from restrictions on the sale of  uranium, aluminium, fertilizer and commercial space launches.  In some cases, Mr. Shokhin said, Russia is still considered a  communist country with a centrally-controlled economy, although  more than half of all Russian enterprises are now in private  hands. We have more private enterprises than some other  countries, he said.    Mr. Shokhin said that this year Russia will revise its  entire  tax system and may reduce import taxes. The Russian  vice-premier said that the Russian Government regarded as its  major task the search for non-inflationary methods of containing  production decline, which reached 26 per cent during the first  four months of the year. According to the vice-premier, the  Russian Government is now actively engaged in drafting laws  designed to encourage foreign investment. Some of the bills  have already been submitted to the Russian parliament.    Predicting imminent changes in the investment climate in  Russia, Mr. Shokhin urged Russia's foreign partners to  co-operate more actively with the new market structures rather  than count on the central government guarantees. He reported  that Russia would be gradually adopting new forms of investment  guarantees, such as mortgage, the sale of products for rubles  and guaranteed re- conversion of rubles into hard currency.</p>

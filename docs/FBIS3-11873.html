			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria from Narino </F> Presidential Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota marking his election  as OAS secretary general; broadcast in progress--live]    [Text] ...it has been confirmed a Colombian has been  elected to the post of OAS secretary general. The ideals of  Bolivar, Jefferson, Marti, Juarez, Morazan, San Martin, and all  those who fought to make America a great nation compel us to see  this commitment as the continuation of our liberator's task. In  addition, we see it as a recognition of the common identity and  joint ideals of all Americans. They also compel us to receive  it as an expression of friendship for and trust in a modern and  renewed Colombia, something that fills us with pride and  gratitude.    The community of American nations has considered the  modernization of our institutions, renewal of our social,  economic, and commercial structure, and expansion of political  and civil rights; in sum, the commitment and effort to put  Colombia in step with the times. With the support of all, we  will devote ourselves to the task of starting a new era in  hemispheric relations.    You can rest assured that since we accepted the nomination,  we clearly understood what would entail the challenge of  redesigning the future of the inter-American system. We have an  unyielding and firm commitment to integration. We wish peace,  democracy, protection of human rights, justice, and liberty. We  hope for the expansion of commerce and economic welfare. These  aspirations will undoubtedly strengthen the American union and  will be put at the service of the unavoidable and collective  destiny of all our peoples.    My commitment. Under current circumstances it is to serve  the continent. The time has come in which the OAS has ahead of  it the responsibility of setting new paths within the context of  a changing world, which is demanding the articulation of new  international relations, more egalitarian, with more solidarity  and a higher awareness of the capacities and needs of every  region.    This is one of those rare moments in history in which we are  called to respond with courage and creativity to a great  opportunity. The Cold War is over. It is not sufficient to  talk of a new world order; in fact, this is unavoidable. Our  challenge is to mold it so that the initial euphoria, which has  vanished now, will generate hope and a clear path instead of  yielding to uncertainty and confusion.    I will promote an integrating OAS that joins, unites,  complements, and turns into the catalytic agent that joins the  processes and initiatives of economic liberation and commercial  integration the hemisphere is experiencing.    The Bolivarian dream of unity should also be reflected in  the  creation of a great free trade zone that links the immense  territories from Alaska to Patagonia and shows the world the  greatness of an America that supports itself in its untold  resources and its multiethnic and multicultural nature. From  that prostrate America with an outstretched hand that regretted  its own destiny, we have witnessed a birth, a new and second  opportunity, a new hemisphere that is demanding solidarity and  cooperation, equitable commerce, and development and struggles  against poverty for the sake of equality and dignity.    A conjunction of interests has been born, filled with  autonomy and values, proud of itself and assured of its future,  which is already holding fluid and dynamic talks with the  European Union, the Asia of the Pacific Basin, Africa, and other  world regions. They, the Americas and the Caribbean, recognize  the virtues of mutual cooperation, the need to take  everywhere--on islands and the mainland--the progress and  benefits of new and productive alliances for development.    The new OAS will preserve, defend, and reinforce the  prevalence of human rights, democracy and its freedoms, while  respecting the identity, aspirations, and path chosen by each  people who will have in the OAS an unconditional ally in the  defense of their institutions. Today more than ever, our  countries are legitimizing their institutions, reaffirming their  democracies, and proclaiming new constitutions which reiterate  the American ideal of freedom, justice, and equality.    We plan to transform the OAS into a major forum in which  every nation, especially those truly in need, will be able to  discuss their cultures, achievements, and concerns, as well as  their living conditions, in such a way that it will enrich  cooperation agreements with our hemisphere. This will enable us  to advance together as one, without differences or disputes.  Our primary concern lies in coming closer together with each  passing day and moving toward equitable and dignified standards  of living for all of our brothers in the Americas.    Our natural resources -- including the Latin American  environment that stretches from the tundra, across seas and  rivers, all the way to the pampa -- are entitled to our best  efforts to ensure their protection and conservation. It is our  responsibility to our children and history to exhaust all means  possible to prevent deterioration or uncontrolled exploitation.    In terms of my predecessor Joao Baena Soares, in the name of  the three Americas and the Caribbean, I would like to  acknowledge his relentless efforts over the past 10 years to  uphold this organization's leadership and to transform it into a  forum committed to consultation, overcoming difficult situations  created by new and fragile democracies. All of these efforts  required a man of his temperament and his knowledge.    To my opponent, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus,  as well as to all of the other candidates -- of which I must  mention Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas  and Mr. Carlos Iturralde from Bolivia -- I would like to express  my appreciation for their taking part in this outstanding and  first-rate debate, which will undoubtedly enrich our future  ideas. The final vote shows a willingness to unite and to move  in a direction which, I dare say, demands we head toward action  and renewal.    To my Colombian compatriots, I urge all of you to continue  providing your support, because this new phase of the OAS  represents both a victory and a commitment for us, as both  Colombians and as Americans. Our Foreign Relations Ministry  headed by Minister Noemi Sanin Rubio, who has conducted her  duties with professionalism, devotion, and patriotism, deserves  a warm acknowledgement from all of Colombia. Our diplomatic  corps in Washington, the Americas, the Caribbean, and throughout  the world, as well as all of those officials working abroad for  the good of Colombia, have performed in a praiseworthy manner.  Thanks to all of these people, our country will accept this  honorable appointment which the president will receive once the  constitutional regulations governing this matter are met and his  mandate concludes on 7 August 1994 -- the date up until which I  will direct Colombian's destiny as part of my official duties.    Alberto Lleras Camargo, the first OAS secretary general,  interpreted the organization's commitment to integration,  democracy, and progress with these words: We intend to transform  the hemisphere into man's worthy sanctuary, employing his best  attributes, and defending his liberty. This is our commitment  also, just as it was yesterday, and just as it will continue to  be tomorrow. Thank you.</p>

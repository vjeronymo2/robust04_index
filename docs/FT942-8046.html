			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Customs may take VAT case to Lords Customs and Excise is likely to appeal to the Lords after losing a case in which it claimed value added tax worth Pounds 9.5m from a mail order company selling through agents. Three Court of Appeal judges ruled by a two-to-one majority that agents of Bradford-based Fine Art Developments did not have to declare for VAT purposes what they had sold. Customs and Excise said the case revolved around the fact that VAT was only being paid by agents on the price of the goods sold to them. It was not paid on the full selling price to customers.</p>

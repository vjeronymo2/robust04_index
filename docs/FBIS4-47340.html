Makhonko (Experimental Meteorology </F> Institute, NPO [scientific production association] ``Tayfun'');  received June 9,1993; UDC 614.876:551.510.72]    [Abstract] The article presents results of calculation of  the dose load of plutonium isotopes and [.sup]242[/]Cm  measured at the town of Baryshevka (145 km southeast of the  Chernobyl AES and 45 km east of Kiev), Obninsk (107 km southwest  of Moscow) and the central part of Moscow. Data for Kiev were  not used because observations there only began on May 9. The  highest concentration of radioactive products was observed in  April and early May 1986. In Baryshevka the radiation dose has  shaped by May 1, but in Obninsk and Moscow it kept rising in May  and by June 1 it had doubled in Obninsk and tripled in Moscow.  The main radiation dose is received by bone surfaces it is  approximately four times higher than the dose received via lungs  and liver and ten times higher than the dose received by bone  marrow. Based on the obtained data the number of people that  will develop cancer and the probability of cancer risk in  Baryshevka, Obninsk and Moscow were calculated. Also calculated  was the effective equivalent radiation dose due to inhalation of  the sum of plutonium isotopes and [.sup]242[/]Cm for various  population groups in Baryshevka. The calculated doses are  approximate estimates from above, i.e. actual effective  equivalent doses shall not exceed the calculated values.

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Technology: The challenge of creativity - Philips is seeking to go one step beyond simply coming up with new products THERE can be no doubt that Philips, the Dutch electronics group, is a winner when it comes to inventing successful new products. The music cassette, the video-cassette recorder and the compact disc - to name just three of the company's best-known inventions - were all born in Philips' laboratories in Eindhoven, forming the basis of what was, until recently, a profitable business in consumer electronics. Now, as the company struggles to shake off losses in precisely this field, Philips is seeking to go one step beyond simply coming up with bright new products. The 102-year-old company is searching for ways to identify, evaluate, develop and launch entirely new businesses, ones which will unlock a stream of new revenue and keep Philips ahead of the pack, allowing it to benefit from the profitable early years of a new product's life cycle. The challenge, in short, is to foster a 'business creation' mentality in the labs - and elsewhere in the company - as both a prelude and a component of the decisive 'product creation' stage. At the same time, Philips needs to overcome mistakes of the past, when its research and marketing people were practically strangers to each other, a situation that sometimes prevented the smooth translation of laboratory successes into corporate profits. The man throwing down the challenge is Frank Carrubba, a 55-year-old American with a long background at Hewlett-Packard and IBM, whose appointment in late 1991 was a mini-revolution for Philips, which had prided itself on advancing its home-grown technological talent. Carrubba, an executive vice-president who is responsible for industrial policy, intellectual property and purchasing, as well as for technology, says 'business creation' at Philips will begin in earnest on June 1, when the group management committee forms a new sub-committee, the Technology and New Business Assessment Committee. It is here that potential new businesses will be reviewed at the most senior level in the company. Action may be taken on some of them by the autumn, he says. 'The businesses that have been identified (at the pre-screening stage) have come to a large extent from the younger employees in the engineering and research community,' he says, declining to give any details. 'They've had a whole series of ideas stored up inside them waiting for the company to settle down long enough to listen to them.' Researchers whose ideas move beyond the pre-screening stage will be allowed to make their pitch to the group's senior executives. 'They have to be this excited entrepreneur trying to sell to a venture capitalist,' Carrubba says. The 'Silicon Valley' analogy is no accident. The appointment of a foreigner, such as Carrubba, to the top research and development post at Philips is part of the company's attempt since late 1990 to shake up its lethargic corporate culture. When he arrived from California in 1991, Carrubba found an R&amp;D apparatus that had grown complacent after decades of riding the wave of the post-war economic boom. 'Most companies, and ours was not different, saw challenge and change as frightening things, something you worried about when you saw it happening,' he says. Because of its past successes, Philips had allowed some of its products and businesses to reach maturity before starting to cast around for replacements. One of Carrubba's main goals in business and product creation is to seize upon new ideas more quickly and shorten the time from lab to marketplace. Another is to break down divisional barriers and promote 'technological transfer' within the company. So far, Carrubba believes Philips has made good progress, but more needs to be done. Better communication between divisions, for example, remains essential. His new focus on business creation is the last phase of a wider effort to enhance product creation. This latest challenge comes, however, at a time when the company's research and development people are still recovering from the turmoil that has enveloped Philips so far in the 1990s. Since 1989, the year before Philips slid into deep losses, the number of people who work in R&amp;D has been slashed by more than 30 per cent to 28,017 from 40,752. R&amp;D spending is also down sharply, from Fl 4.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in 1989 to Fl 3.7bn in 1992, a decline of 20 per cent. Less easily quantifiable is the effect on researchers of Philips' decision that it can no longer afford to be in the forefront of developing every type of technology. Nor can it continue to develop and build in-house every significant component that it needs for its products. Both changes were symbolised dramatically by the decision in 1990 by the company's new president, Jan Timmer, to pull out of pilot production of one-megabit static random access memory chips, a field that had meant much prestige, but no profits for Philips. Rather than trying to do everything itself, Philips was signalling it was prepared to make difficult decisions about when to buy in expertise and when to go it alone. Though more open to considering outside suppliers than before, Philips has committed itself to maintaining its R&amp;D command of core components, technologies and competences, Carrubba says. These are, in turn, closely linked to a list of 15 key 'president's projects'. The complete list has never been made public, but it is known to include Philips' three new efforts in consumer electronics (high-definition television, compact disc-interactive and digital compact cassette) as well as high-resolution monitors, cellular radio and active matrix liquid crystal displays. In spite of more limited resources, Philips has clearly been pouring money into LCDs, an increasingly important product module in portable television sets and lap-top computers, so that the company will not have to rely on supplies from its competitors in the Far East. Carrubba says the difference between these components and sub-micron memory chips is that the latter have become 'off-the-shelf items that are available at market prices on the open market and in volume'. Philips also intends to remain the master of its own destiny in all facets of signal processing, such as the manipulation, compression and enhancement of images and sound. 'If we're going to be in businesses like audio, video, compact disc-interactive or interactive media, without having that technology we would be hung out to dry. Because anyone out there that owns those technologies would be direct competitors, most likely, and they would be able to manipulate our future. So we can't let that happen,' he says. One example of a core competence is miniaturisation, an element which Philips believes will be of growing importance to a wide range of products and projects in future. If miniaturisation is central to Philips' business prospects, then so are related technologies, such as the visualisation skills needed to perform sub-miniature board assembly. Miniaturisation is also a good case in point of how Carrubba is setting about trying to break down divisional barriers and shorten the lead time for the manufacture of new products. The focal centre of miniaturisation work is now a prototype assembly line which, until recently, was standing idle within the consumer electronics division in Eindhoven. Researchers from corporate research, as well as technical and manufacturing people from Philips' product divisions, now come to the miniaturisation centre for training, where the prototype facilities allow real hands-on work to take place. For some divisions, miniaturisation may not yet be on the horizon, but in the meantime the goal is to 'infiltrate' people with miniaturisation technology experience into research and manufacturing throughout the company. 'When manufacturing gearing-up begins, there will be 'champions' of that technology in that business,' Carrubba explains.</p>

The potential to emit for each calendar quarter for a stationary source shall be the sum of the potential to emit, including fugitive emissions, for all emissions units based on current Authority to Construct permits, information contained in current Permits to Operate, the pending application, and banked authorized emission reduction credits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of emissions_offsets general.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The emissions change for a new or modified emissions unit shall be calculated by subtracting historic potential emissions from proposed emissions. Calculations shall be performed separately for each pollutant and each emissions unit for each calendar quarter. Negative emissions changes shall be processed under the procedures specified in &sect;52.3002, Emissions Reduction Credit Authorization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calculation of emissions_offsets required for ROC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The cumulative net emissions increase pursuant to paragraph (d)(12) of this section for a stationary source shall be the sum of emissions from each of the following for each calendar quarter expressed in terms of pounds per quarter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The potential to emit including associated fugitive emissions not previously offset, for all emissions units installed after September 21, 1993, based on current Authority to Construct permits, information contained in current Permits to Operate, and the pending application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) All emission increases, including associated fugitive emissions not previously offset, from the modification to emissions units installed before September 21, 1993, as determined by procedures specified in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. Any emissions increase represented by an Authority to Construct, which has been canceled by the EPA or has expired, shall not be included in the cumulative emissions increase calculation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The EPA will collect permit fees calculated in accordance with the fee requirements imposed in the district, not to exceed the costs to EPA to issue permits and administer the permit program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If this section is delegated, the delegated agency will collect fees calculated in accordance with the fee requirements imposed in the district. Upon delegation of any portion of this section, the EPA will cease to collect fees imposed in conjunction with that portion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Monitoring and records.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following records shall be maintained for five years and shall be provided to the EPA upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Emergency electrical generating equipment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Records of operation for maintenance purposes, for actual interruptions of power. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Portable and temporary equipment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Records of operating location and corresponding dates of operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;52.3002  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Emissions reduction credit authorization (Sacramento). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To provide an administrative mechanism for authorizing surplus emission reductions for transfer to other sources as offsets pursuant to &sect;52.3001, New Source Review. Actual emission reductions certified in a district bank shall be reevaluated and authorized under the requirements and procedures specified in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section shall apply to all emissions reduction credits which are to be used for offsets pursuant to &sect;52.3001, New Source Review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Authorization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Only actual emission reductions shall become authorized ERCs. Such actual emission reductions shall meet the following requirements to be authorized as ERCs: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Be certified in accordance with a district banking rule except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Receive written approval of the EPA, as described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If the emission reduction is created from an emission unit where the demand for the services or product could shift to other similar sources in the district, submittal of data to document that such reductions will result in district-wide emission reductions may be required by the EPA. Such documentation must be approved by the EPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Emissions reductions shall be prescribed by enforceable emission limitations contained in Authority to Construct permits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

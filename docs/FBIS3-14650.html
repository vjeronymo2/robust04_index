			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th has said that the  accusations leveled by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  against the PLO about resuming the talks with Israel without  coordinating with other Arab states were unjustified.    He added: It should be noted that the negotiations in which  we have been engaged since the Security Council issued its  resolution are based on the resolution itself. This is an  intensive effort to implement Resolution 904.    Responding to al-Shar', Sha'th said: We insist on Arab  coordination. If there is a problem, it is because in Madrid,  the Arab parties' accepted a phased solution interim period for  the Palestinians. Hence, the Arab agreement was and continues  to be that the PLO should hasten to achieve its phased solution  so that there will be a single negotiating stage with the other  parties over a final solution.</p>

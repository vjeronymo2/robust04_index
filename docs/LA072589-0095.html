Tom Gabor said.  </P> <P> Later Monday, a Culver City police officer arrested a Los Angeles man, Valdez  Wright, 25, in the robbery of a Security Pacific National Bank branch about  12:30 p.m., but police said they were unsure if the two holdups are related.  </P> <P> In the mall robbery, Gabor said, two men approached a guard who was loading the  bags onto the truck in the parking structure and pointed handguns at him.  </P> <P> "One of the guards heard footsteps, turned around and saw the guys with guns  coming toward him," Gabor said. "(The robbers) fired, and the guard returned  fire. He then found cover."  </P></p>

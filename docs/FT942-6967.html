			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Observer: Many holes in one Seve Ballesteros may be miffed that having brought the 1997 Ryder Cup to Spain, the biennial international golf match staged between Europe and the US will not be played on his own Sancti Petri course near Cadiz. But Spain's Foreign Ministry is as pleased as punch. Valderrama, the chosen venue, is home to one of Spain's secret diplomatic weapons in its long-running dispute to retake Gibraltar from the Brits. Sotogrande, the huge Mediterranean luxury estate that surrounds the Valderrama links, is next door to Gibraltar, and is tempting an increasing number of golf-crazy Gibraltarians to desert the British fastness. Moving into a Sotogrande mansion gives immediate access to three golf courses, including Valderrama, and two polo grounds, as well as rubbing shoulders with the Cartiers, Hennessy's and with Valderrama owner Jaime (Jimmy) Ortiz-Patino whose grandfather was the king of Bolivian tin mines. Shares in Sotogrande shot up to a year's high on news of the Ryder Cup win. All that is required now is for Madrid and London to settle their historic squabble and end a ban on domestic flights from Spain to the Rock's airport. It is not only Seve and his golf-crazy father-in-law, Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco Santander, who want to avoid a long drive to the Valderrama links. Expect an early breakthrough on the diplomatic front.</p>

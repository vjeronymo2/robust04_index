			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Arts: Boris Godunov - Opera in Geneva According to Kobbe, which gives a more colourful synopsis than New Grove, 'the background to the story is one of famine and plague . . . the people have deserted the ways of law and order . . . For Russia's misfortunes Boris is blamed - in spite of his efforts to rule wisely and well.' Boris Godunov may not be Boris Yeltsin, but any encounter with Musorgsky's episodic music drama today makes you wonder whether Russia has changed at all in the past four centuries. The new production of Boris Godunov at Geneva's Grand Theatre suggests that the historical Tsar was a good deal more handsome, if no more politically secure, than the present Kremlin incumbent. Geneva's Boris is Samuel Ramey, singing the role for the first time. With his proud mane of hair and pointed beard, he cuts a noble, patriarchal figure, whether in his rich coronation apparel or the bare-chested, bare-footed histrionics of the finale. Nothing is overacted - though we are left in no doubt about Boris's physical strength, violent temper and tormented conscience. Ramey may not be the booming, bulbous bass most often associated with the part, but he sings with well-sculpted, muscular refinement. His Boris is commanding, but not yet charismatic. Geneva opts for the original 1869 version - an austere succession of seven panels which confines music and drama to bare essentials. It makes for a relatively short evening - but the punch seems stronger without the scenic and instrumental cushioning of later versions. Under Edo de Waart, the musical emphasis fell on the dark, introspective quality of Musorgsky's instrumental writing rather than on dramatic excitement - a view justified by the sensitive woodwinds of the Suisse Romande Orchestra and some rapt string playing, particularly in the cavernous double-bass parts. On stage, as in the pit, the mood was one of stark simplicity. Stein Winge's production, designed by Goran Wassberg, unfolded on a steeply-raked wooden ramp curling up into a huge backdrop, which disgorged guards, boyars and coronation procession from a variety of trap doors. The presence of the Fool in each scene, an innocent observer of endless misfortune, provided a further unifying thread. Visual contrast came from Kari Gravklev's richly-coloured costumes, and from the variety and concentration of Hans-Ake Sjoqvist's lighting effects, which dissolved the traditional stage boundaries. The production team was Scandinavian, the cast predominantly Anglo-Saxon. John Tomlinson, who sang Boris for Opera North, proved an equally imposing Pimen, though he sounded stretched by the upper reaches of the part. Anthony Rolfe Johnson, the Fool in the 1981 Geneva production, has now graduated with honours to Shuysky. Kim Begley was the powerful Grigory, Eirian James a credibly adolescent Fyodor. Anne Collins, Henk Smit and Doug Jones made a lively trio in the inn scene. Performances continue until May 24. Radio 3 will broadcast a recording of the production on August 14</p>

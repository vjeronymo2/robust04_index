			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAR RAN OVER VICTIM IN PURSE THEFT, WITNESS SAYS;  </P> <P> HEARINGS: FREDA CRAWFORD, 83, DIED MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER BEING INJURED IN THE  ROBBERY, AND TWO MEN ARE CHARGED WITH HER MURDER.  </P> <P> An elderly Granada Hills woman was dragged by a car for 60 feet and run over as  she tried to keep a robber from taking her purse, a witness testified Tuesday  in a preliminary hearing for two men charged with the woman's murder.  </P> <P> Michael P. Kellet, 21, and Richard E. Phillips, 20, both of Northridge could be  sentenced to 26 years to life in prison if convicted in the murder of Freda  Crawford, 83, who died last April in a convalescent home. Deputy Dist. Atty.  David R. Lopez, who is prosecuting the case, said Crawford's death resulted  from injuries suffered in the robbery.  </P> <P> Crawford was preparing to load groceries into her car outside the Hughes  supermarket at Devonshire Street and Balboa Boulevard when a white Chevrolet  Camaro drove up beside her and the driver grabbed her purse, Cecilia Rivera  testified Tuesday in San Fernando Municipal Court.  </P> <P> "The lady was dragging alongside the car. She was knocked down at the  completion of a sharp swerve," Rivera said. "I saw the left rear wheel go over  her head. The purse went into the car."  </P> <P> Rivera said the car turned out of the parking lot and sped off on Devonshire.  </P> <P> Kellet and Phillips were arrested the next day after a boy who had heard news  accounts of the robbery saw a car that matched the description of the suspects'  vehicle, Lopez said. The boy's father notified police, who stopped the car in  an undeveloped part of Northridge where the men had gone to ditch it, Lopez  said.  </P> <P> Kellet was sentenced in late 1988 to four years in prison after pleading guilty  to two counts of robbery, involving Crawford and an earlier purse-snatching,  Lopez said. Phillips has appealed his robbery convictions in the same case, for  which he is serving a seven-year sentence, Lopez said.  </P> <P> The two were charged with murder after Crawford died more than a year after the  robbery. She was in a coma for three months after the attack and was kept on a  life-support device until her death, Lopez said.  </P></p>

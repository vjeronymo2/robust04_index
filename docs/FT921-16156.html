			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser plans Dollars 344m charge WEYERHAEUSER, the forest products group based in Washington state, is planning to take year-end special charges totalling around Dollars 344m which will push it into an annual and quarterly loss. The company, whose profits have been depressed by a cyclical downturn in the forest products industry, said factors behind the charges included the length of the economic recession, which had resulted in real estate losses. In addition, the withdrawal of the supply of timber from public lands in its north-western heartland would mean some plants would close early and there would be contractual losses. The amount of logging allowed on public lands in the area is being curtailed because of environmental concern over a species of endangered owl. The company is also moving to implement a new accounting standard for employees' post-retirement health benefits, which will cost Dollars 125m. However, new accounting methods for taxation will partly offset that, producing a Dollars 64m credit. Mr John Creighton, chief executive, said: 'These actions should put a number of uncertainties behind us and allow the company to begin 1992 with a clean slate.' The company said it had already cut overhead costs by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent at the corporate level since a refocusing of operations led by Mr Creighton in 1989. It sold or closed nearly two dozen businesses and consolidated operations during the reorganisation. Weyerhaeuser's real estate subsidiary lost Dollars 6.8m in the third quarter, linked to further weakening in the southern California market and the nationwide housing recession.</p>

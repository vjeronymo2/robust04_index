			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix by Gerhard </F> Bitzan; place and date not given: "`No Alternative to Nuclear  Power'; Blix Also Trusts Temelin"]    [Text] [Bitzan] Mr. Director General Blix, the nuclear  power plants in East Europe are criticized by many people. How  do you assess the safety standards of Temelin?    [Blix] You would have to discuss this in detail with our  safety experts. All that I can say is that the Temelin reactor  is not a Chernobyl type. It is a heavy-water reactor whose  construction and design resembles a Western one. Less  sophisticated electronics were normally used for it. As is  known, however, the Czechs entrusted Westinghouse with the  development of additional control systems. I am sure that  Prague's objective is to have a safety standard like in the West.    [Bitzan] Do you think that Vienna's attitude, that is,  massive influence on the nuclear policy of a neighboring state,  is right?    [Blix] I do not want to get involved in a bilateral  Austrian-Czech conflict. Basically, every country is free to  have the nuclear policy that it wants. If Austria -- in  addition to Ireland, Luxembourg, and Denmark -- wants to be  nuclear-free, this is its business. However, I am personally of  the opinion that nuclear power will be indispensable in the  future. Look at the Czech Republic. They know that their only  alternative is more coal power plants. The Greens will tell you  that the future power demand can be met by savings, wind power,  and biomass. However, even such organizations as the World  Energy Conference say that such views of the Greens are naive.    [Bitzan] In your opinion, why does nuclear energy involve  less danger than conventional energy?    [Blix] In the long run, we only have the nuclear option. It  was resolved in Rio to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions to  the level of 1990 by 2005. But the reality is different. If  the world fears the greenhouse effect, only nuclear power can be  the answer.    In addition, safety is today far greater than in 1986, for  example, when Chernobyl happened. As far as nuclear waste is  concerned, its volume is so small that it can be completely  isolated and returned to the soil. This is in contrast to the  enormous amounts of fossil residues that remain on the surface  of the Earth and are forever toxic. They do not even have a  half-life period.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa departs for Washington on Thursday [10 February] for  summit talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton, taking with him  details of a fresh economic stimulus package expected to boost  Japanese imports.    Foreign Ministry officials said the summit, which will be  the  third meeting between the two reform-minded leaders, will also  focus on reviewing the progress of bilateral trade talks and  coordinating foreign policy objectives.    The officials said Hosokawa and Clinton will begin their  talks Friday morning at the oval office in a small group  session, including Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and  U.S. Vice President Al Gore.    The two leaders will then have an expanded session of talks  and a working luncheon, followed by a joint press conference at  the White House.    Hosokawa is expected to brief Clinton on Japan's record-high  15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package aimed at spurring  economic recovery, as well as the country's fiscal 1994 budget  and third supplementary fiscal 1993 budget.    The summit represents the first of four top-level biannual  reviews of the current series of bilateral trade talks, which  began last year between deputies of the two leaders on the basis  of a "framework accord" worked out during Clinton's trip to  Tokyo in July.    Under the accord, the two sides agreed to negotiate measures  to bring about a "significant increase" of imports into Japan.    But the talks have stalled over how to interpret, in terms  of  specific measures, the "objective criteria" referred to in the  framework accord for determining the extent to which foreign  firms are making inroads into Japan.    "We agreed to measure, using objective criteria, either  numerical or qualitative, achievement in implementation of  measures introduced," said a Foreign Ministry official. "That  is what we are doing and the extent to which we can go."    "But what the U.S. Government is seeking right now is a  little bit beyond what we agreed upon," the official said,  stressing that Japan never agreed to set "numerical targets" for  imports.    Officials said Hosokawa will update Clinton on the various  political, administrative and economic reforms he has been  pursuing domestically, considering their global significance.    Hosokawa will also speak about the "renewed role to be  played  (by Japan) in international society" including its increasing  participation in U.N. peace restoration efforts, they said.    Meanwhile, he will stress the importance of a "global  partnership" between Japan and the U.S. as two nations that are  allies, leaders of the world economy, neighbors in the  Asia-Pacific region and members of the Group of Seven (G-7)  major industrialized nations, they said.    The officials said Hosokawa and Clinton may exchange views  on  the situations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where allied countries may  soon carry out air strikes to break the siege of Sarajevo, as  well as North Korea, which faces possible economic sanctions if  it refuses to open its controversial nuclear facilities for  international inspections.    The U.S. decision on whether to renew most-favored-nation  (MFN) trading status for China and its recent decision to lift  its trade embargo on Vietnam will also likely find their way  onto the agenda, according to the officials, who also mentioned  the possible topic of policy coordination on Iran.    After the summit talks, officials said Hosokawa will deliver  "a rather major policy speech" later the same day at Georgetown  University, followed by a question-and-answer session with  students.    On Saturday, Hosokawa will hold a solo press conference and  visit Arlington National Cemetery for a wreath-laying ceremony  at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. An official said he may  also pay his respects at the gravesite of the late President  John Kennedy, for whom he has "some personal attachment."    Hosokawa will leave Washington later Saturday after an  observation tour at the Children's National Medical Center,  arriving back in Tokyo on Sunday.</p>

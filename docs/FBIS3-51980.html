			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 24 and 26  January. Source is listed in parentheses following each item:    Radio Reloj at 2040 GMT on 24 January reports that  accelerated repairs are being made at the Republica Dominican  Mill in Carlos Manuel de Cespedes municipality, Camaguey  Province. Originally, the Rebublica Dominicana Mill was not  scheduled to participate in the grinding in Camaguey this  harvest. It was later decided that the mill would participate  "because of the importance to the nation to produce as much  sugar as possible."    Radio Reloj at 2042 GMT on 24 January notes that production  in Matanzas Province has decreased. According to a statistical  study, the province produced 777 million pesos' worth of goods  in 1993, which was 71 percent of the amount that had been  projected. "In comparison with a similar earlier period,  Matanza's economy showed a decline of almost 21 points, felt  most strongly in the sugar industry."    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 January reports that 400  caballerias of tobacco have been planted in Pinar del Rio. Some  4,000 students are participating in the planting.    Radio Reloj Network at 2030 GMT on 25 January reports in its  30-minute newscast that:    The plant at the Ignacio Agramonte Sugar Mill that produces  the product called "sorbitol," a sugarcane by-product, produced  over 300 tons of the product in 1993. "Sorbitol" is used in  making toothpaste, diet foods, pharmaceuticals, and other  things. The plant has the capacity to produce 10,000 tons a year  in the Villa Clara and Camaguey plants. Also obtained were 217  tons of glucose.    The local industries of Contramaestre municipality, Santiago  de Cuba Province, brought in 5 million pesos for the state in  1993. "Esteban Lazo, secretary general of the Communist Party of  Cuba for the province, urged local industries to improve quality  and design, and to increase prodcution of certain very important  products, such as shoes for school children, workers, and the  population in general."    "Over 13 million passengers were transported within Matanzas  in 1993 thanks to the efforts of the state inspectors, who also  created a favorable atmosphere for moving some 1,000 metric tons  of various types of merchandise. During that period, the more  than 230 men and women commonly known as `yellows' [because of  the color of their uniforms] collected slightly more than 1  million pesos and made use of over 1 million vehicles belonging  to enterprises and organizations." They were assisted by around  70 volunteers.    There have been 42 Basic Cooperative Production Units  [UBPC's] formed in Havana Province to-date: 29 in miscellaneous  crops; 10 in tobacco, and 3 in citrus. Four remain to be formed:  one in Artemisa, two in Alquizar, and one in Batabano. At  present, the Havana Province UBPC's consist of almost 6,600  workers, not a final figure.    There are at present five bicycle factories in Cuba. The  overall goal is to manufacture 300,000 bicycles in 1994. In  1993, 174,700 bicyles were produced by all these plants  together, a figure significantly higher than the 1993 figure of  86,000. Each plant works on its own design, which leads to  competition in making the bicycles and motivates the workers to  do better work. All facilities are trying to improve post-sale  services.    The Tropical Travel Agency in Havana sold over 10.5 percent  more optional activities in 1993 than in 1992. In 1993, this  brought half a million dollars more than in 1992 to the national  economy -- said Juan Emilio Santana, director of the Tropical  Travel Agency. Santana said that the optional activities and  proposals targeting international tourism at the diverse tourist  hubs also increased in 1993, with a view to increasing the  amount of hard currency brought in. The task of the Tropical  Travel Agency is to provide international tourists with all  types of services and information, thus occupying the free time  of travelers while in Cuba.    Cuba Vision Network at 2310 GMT on 25 January reports that  in  Granma Province, workers of the Manzanillo shoe enterprise  produced more than 250,000 pairs of shoes in 1993. They are  increasing efforts to meet the demand of sugar industry workers.    Radio Reloj Network at 1506 GMT on 26 January reports that  the Havana Convention Center obtained more than $3 million in  1993 as compared to the previous year. Adding national and  convertible currency, its income amounts to some 6 million of an  unspecified currency from the various activities in this center  over the past year. More than 12,000 foreign delegates  participated in congresses, fairs, meetings, and other forums in  that center last year.    Radio Reloj Network at 1509 GMT on 26 January adds that the  Cuban Ministry of the Steelworking Industry, the Sime, is  working hard to become self-suffient. Sime's main objectives for  this year are to become an exporting organization capable of  guaranteeing its self- sufficiency, providing financial  resources, and meeting the special demands of the national  economy.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 26 January reports that an  Asturian solidarity group donated office equipment worth $11,500  to the accounting department of the University of Havana.</p>

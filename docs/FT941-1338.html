			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Stronger dollar helps Reckitt rise to Pounds 260m A sharp rise in the dollar helped Reckitt &amp; Colman, the consumer goods group, to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 165m to Pounds 260m on an FRS 4 basis. The 17 per cent appre-ciation in the dollar against the pound, and other exchange rate moves, added some Pounds 16m to Pounds 17m to pre-tax profits. Excluding the Pounds 19m coupon on the group's Pounds 200m of convertible capital bonds, profits rose 51.4 per cent to Pounds 279m up from Pounds 184m, restated for the Indian activities' move from associate to subsidiary status. A proposed final dividend of 11.1p (10.25p) gives a total of 17.55p (16.2p) a rise of 8.3 per cent. Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said the dividend increase reflected Reckitt's policy of progressive increases above the rate of inflation. Group sales rose 8.4 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn, and operating profits were up from Pounds 275m to Pounds 315m. Interest charges, excluding the bond coupon, rose from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 35.6m as sterling deposits fell and attracted lower returns. Strong cash flow cut net debt by Pounds 97m to Pounds 216.5m, excluding the capital bonds, compared with shareholders' funds of Pounds 704m (Pounds 618m). Mr Sankey said that one objective in 1993 had been to increase the proportion of profits from North America, which includes Mexico, and this had gone up from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. Another was to raise the proportion from faster growing economies such as South America and South East Asia, and these had risen from 16 per cent to 20 per cent in spite of hyper-inflation in Brazil. Operating profits from household and toiletry rose from Pounds 188m to Pounds 206m, helped by new product development. Pharmaceutical profits rose from Pounds 42m to Pounds 45.5m, with extensions of products such as Dettol and Lemsip. Food profits were up from Pounds 45m to Pounds 54.3m, in spite of the effect of a soft drinks price war on Robinsons and poor summer weather. Stated earnings per share were 45.02p (25.16p), but the underlying earnings growth was 10.1 per cent to 43.64p (39.62p). COMMENT Although the shares fell 10 1/2 p to 605p yesterday, this probably had more to do with the market than any real disappointment with the numbers. Reckitt's merits lie in its strong cash generation, high margins, strong brand positions and geographical spread, all of which contribute to the regular progression in dividends. However, unlike its mustard, Reckitt never lights the fire of the mass of investors. Hence a low prospective p/e, of around 12 1/2 on pre-tax forecasts of Pounds 310m-plus, and a historic yield of 3.6 per cent which should continue rising faster than inflation. For investors seeking reliability rather than fireworks, Reckitt is a good bet.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Observer: Glad-handing philanthropist Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's energetic new finance minister is slap in the middle of a major reshuffle designed to bring new blood into the economic ministries. Still, he found time to squeeze in a snack this week with George Soros, the peripatetic philanthropist and financier. Oddly enough, also present was Jerzy Osiatynski, himself a former finance minister - from the Freedom Union party, which led the last government - even though his party, now in opposition, poured scorn on Kolodko's strategy in a parliamentary debate. Osiatynski may simply have been putting in a good word for Wojciech Misiag, the hirsute deputy finance minister, whom Kolodko has just sacked. Misiag has a reputation for being the only person in Poland able to put together a budget, handle subsequent probing from the International Monetary Fund, and keep the state purse strings firmly closed against hectoring politicians desperately seeking funds for their constituencies. Misiag served five finance ministers including Osiatynski; all of them felt him indispensable - except Kolodko. Maybe Kolodko was preaching the virtues of Misiag to Soros, who - apart from his philanthropy in central and eastern Europe - has seen his Quantum fund recently invest Dollars 133m in the area. Or maybe Kolodko himself was after a job . . .</p>

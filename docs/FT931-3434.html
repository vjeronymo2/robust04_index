			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wiltshire cuts loss to Pounds 979,000 Wiltshire Brewery, the USM-traded brewer and distributor in which the UB Group of India late last year gained management control, yesterday reported a reduced annual deficit. On turnover at Pounds 2.47m for the the 12 months to November 30 (Pounds 2.5m for 14 months), losses before tax were Pounds 979,000 (Pounds 1.39m), struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 297,000 (Pounds 460,000). Losses per share were 8.58p (15.93p). At the operating level, however, the company returned to the black with profits of Pounds 38,000 (losses of Pounds 207,000). The figures did not reflect December's Pounds 6.9m refinancing and purchase of 37 pubs. Mr Vijay Mallya, chairman, said that gearing had dropped from 354 per cent to 102 per cent on a pro-forma basis. Mr Mallya attributed the improvement at the operating level to the conversion of loss-making houses into tenancies, thereby reducing overheads and generating rental income. Some 83 per cent of the estate is now tenanted. However, the company still has a bad debt problem. The company plans to change its name to United Breweries.</p>

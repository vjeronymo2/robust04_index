			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "Protein Structure and Design"] </F>   [Text] Protein engineering is now a mature technology,  while databases of sequence and structure continue to grow. As  a result, protein design and modelling has become a strategic  science, with important implications for the understanding of  cell receptor function and rational drug design. The  Biotechnology Directorate recently supported a joint N+N meeting  with the German GBF [Biotechnological Research Association] in  Braunschweig, to discuss the potential for collaboration and  envisage future research needs and directions.    One of the key conclusions to emerge from the meeting was  that many of the groups present were independently examining the  three-dimensional structure of proteins, comparing structures  and substructures and investigating protein alignment to define  protein families. For example, Paul Barlow, of the Department  of Biochemistry at Oxford University, described work on the  structure of protein "modules". Recombinant DNA  [desoxyribonucleic acid] technology permits the expression of  protein segments that have autonomous folds and functions, whose  structure can then be solved by multidimensional nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR). Others are predicting structure from  sequence. At the European Molecular Biology Laboratory [EMBL],  in Heidelberg, 700 protein families have been identified, based  on their common primary structure. Using aligned families to  train neural networks, it is now possible to predict secondary  structure with an average accuracy of 70 percent.    Christine Orengo, of the Biomolecular Structure and  Modelling  Unit at UCL [University College London] reported on analysis of  data in the Brookhaven Protein Database (PDB). She has  identified 150 unique folds, and is developing fast automatic  methods for comparing structures. Uta Lessel, from the host  organisation, the Gesellschaft fuer Biotechnologische Forschung  [GBF] in Braunschweig, described similar work based on  calculating intramolecular C distances. This too isolates  structural families from the PDB. Tim Hubbard, of the Cambridge  Centre for Protein Engineering at Hills Road, takes this  predictive approach in a different direction. He pointed out  that the increased number of structures in the PDB allows one to  use pair-wise interactions and H-bonding patterns to build  potential tables for the topology of Beta-strand alignment, a  technique that is sufficiently powerful to distinguish correct  from incorrect alignments. Beta-strands are extended  conformations of polypeptide chains. In modelling, it is  essential to obtain the correct register and alignment of  adjacent Beta-strands, which remains a difficult problem for  anyone who wants to predict structure from sequence.    Gerald Boehm, of the University of Regensburg, is developing  techniques to assess the quality and reliability of model  structures. These include correlation functions, derived from  non-redundant protein structures, that put statistical limits on  the accuracy of a structure. The technique has been validated  against deliberately misfolded models, and is now being used to  investigate proteins from extremophiles to identify their  individual sources of stability.    Although more nucleic acid data, from more diverse sources,  is being collected every year, Rainer Fuchs of the EMBL Data  Library cautioned that the quality of these data is probably  lower. There are more than 100 types of database available  today, and Fuchs called for more logical data structures, with  better relational links between databases, in the future. Some  of this development will take place during the next 18 months,  as the Data Library moves to its new site in Cambridge.    Peter Artymiuk, of the Krebs Institute at Sheffield  University, spoke about the development of two programs, POSSUM  and PROTEP, that ease the comparison of 3-D structures,  detecting new folds and identifying relationships between  structure and function. The programs work at either main chain  or side chain level, and have discovered previously unrecognised  structural relationships between proteins in the PDB.    Paul Wrede, of the Free University in Berlin, has developed  pattern recognitions programs using neural networks, which are  particularly useful for protein design. PROFI, for example,  extracts useful features such as signal peptide sequences, while  PROSID simulates molecular evolution and can be used to design  new cleavage sites. Another approach is to generate artificial  structures by modifying the course of the main chain of a known  structure. Frieder Kaden, of the German National Centre for  Computer Science, explained how this generates a new topology  with the same space-filling characteristics, which can then be  used to create an enhanced database for the development of  folding algorithms.    Putting the proteins and programs together to design new  functions remains a challenge. Dietmar Schomburg explained how  the interdisciplinary group at CAPE in Braunschweig has designed  some very specific proteins, including an elastase inhibitor and  a new dehydrogenase that is designed to work on chiral amino  acids and keto-acids. Jan Pedersen, of the University of Bath,  reported on the development of software tools for protein  design, especially of antibodies and antigens. Docking  algorithms and molecular modelling and simulation allow the  group to target mutagenesis of specific regions of antibodies.    Taking design forward into specific drugs, Ed Hodgkin  described how his company, British Biotechnology Ltd. in Oxford,  chases peptide "leads," small regions that play an active part  in biomolecular interactions, and constructs specific mimetics  based on them. Peptide libraries are increasingly guiding  people to those leads, which have so far been used to design  receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors. Hans-Joachim Boehm,  of BASF in Ludwigshafen, uses a similar approach, positioning  new molecules and substituents on a known lead structure. He  called for more research into methods for "annealing" these new  ligands and receptors.    The final session concerned the forces and dynamics of  proteins. Jim Warwicker, of the AFRC Institute of Food Research,  in Reading, outlined methods of estimating and depicting the  electrostatic surface of proteins, which give insights into  protein function and may, in future, be used to asses the  accuracy of estimates of stability and pH response. Manfred  Sippl, of the University of Salzburg in Austria, explained how  his work uses the frequency of occurrence of secondary  structures to calculate force fields for particular protein  structures. Like Warwicker, Sippl foresees using this kind of  information to assess and validate protein structures. Rod  Hubbard, of York University, is trying to speed up computation  for modelling, for example by simplifying the depiction of side  chains. Protein 3D co-ordinates can be extracted from published  stereo pair images of main chains, and many other tools are  being developed to make it easier to determine structure and to  model interactions.    In all, the meeting was judged a success. It put scientists  in touch, within and across national borders. It also  identified a major area for future collaboration: the use of  comparison and alignment studies to identify protein families.  There is, however, a need for more exchange of software, and as  a result of this meeting a directory of available programs will  probably be made available. One useful suggestion is that the  various programs be put to work on a small number of common  structures, to allow an objective assessment of their relative  capabilities. This may be a project that the SERC's [Science  and Engineering Research Council] EMBnet node at Daresbury could  undertake, in collaboration with the EMBL Data Library. More  post-doctoral visits and exchanges will probably take place  within the groups, and collaborations will be forged to create  partnerships for the forthcoming EC Framework programme.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Awash with uranium: Kenneth Gooding explains the market's poor prospects Nobody has been hurt more by the surge in raw materials' exports to the west that followed the break-up of the former Soviet Union than the uranium producers. Some are bracing themselves for perhaps 20 more tough years because military stocks, built up by the superpowers during the cold war, are becoming available for the first time on world markets. Russia has agreed that the US can convert highly enriched uranium, used in nuclear weapons, to low-enriched uranium. This can be blended with other uranium for use as commercial nuclear fuel. An estimated 500 tonnes of highly enriched Russian uranium are available, equivalent to 150,000 tonnes of commercial fuel - enough to keep the west's nuclear reactors supplied for about three years. As a result, uranium mines have been closing in Canada, the US and even in some former eastern bloc countries. The uranium industry has been in the doldrums for a long time. Prices peaked at Dollars 45 a pound in 1978, when oil costs were rising sharply and demand for nuclear energy was expected to grow. (The only large-scale application of uranium is as a nuclear fuel.) Over-optimistic forecasts of demand contributed to the build-up of nearly 80,000 tonnes of surplus uranium in stocks at power companies in the 1980s. The market deteriorated further when brokers and other intermediaries were allowed to sell some of this uranium to new consumers. More recently, brokers also gained access to uranium stockpiles in the Commonwealth of Independent States, as the new republics became desperate for hard currency earnings. A great deal of uranium is still sold directly by producers to consumers on long-term contracts, but enough is sold in the free market for the US and Europe to worry about the market's over-dependence on CIS material. Some countries have curbed CIS imports. Consequently, a two-tier price system has developed. For countries with no import restrictions, the uranium price is about Dollars 7 a pound, its lowest ever level in real terms. For those with restrictions on CIS uranium, the price is about Dollars 10 a pound. Even at Dollars 10, only the lowest-cost mines (in Australia and Canada) can break even. However, some producers have unbreakable long-term contracts to supply utilities at higher prices, even above Dollars 20 a pound. It has sometimes been worthwhile for them to close mines and buy uranium in the free market. According to the Uranium Institute, an international industrial association, the total supply of freshly produced uranium - from mines and reprocessing of used nuclear fuel - was only 35,000 tonnes in 1992, compared with demand for 53,000 tonnes. The gap was made up from the world's large uranium stockpile. The institute's present forecasts suggest this imbalance will continue. Even if all uranium mines worked at full capacity, they could supply only 55,000 tonnes in 2000 and 49,000 tonnes by 2010. But Mr Peter Wade, managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, a group that controls the Ranger uranium mine in Australia, says mines would not come back into production or new ones be developed until prices moved back to between Dollars 16 and Dollars 18 a pound. Meanwhile, demand remains sluggish. The institute reckons that it will be 64,000 tonnes in 2000 and no higher in 2010. The supply deficit cannot continue indefinitely. Eventually the stockpile of available uranium will be exhausted. Prices, however, are not expected to recover in the medium term. The agreement between the US and Russia for converting highly enriched uranium into power station fuel specifies it should be organised in a way that 'will have no adverse impact on US consumers or the mining and processing industries'. But some producers fear that the existence of the extra stock will give consumers the feeling the world is still awash with excess uranium, and depress prices for years.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Out with the old Like any new, young, energetic manager brought in to rescue a failed enterprise, Mr Tony Blair has begun his leadership of the Labour party by seeking a fresh statement of mission. It is clearly his intention to follow that with a thorough modernisation of every aspect of Labour's work. He is to be congratulated. Voters will not believe that the party is absolutely purged of its former Marxist leanings while its statement of objectives contains Clause IV, which calls for wholesale nationalisation. Labour, Mr Blair told the conference in his first speech to it as leader yesterday, 'requires a modern constitution that says what we are in terms the public cannot misunderstand and the Tories cannot misrepresent'. It was an historic moment. In 1959 Hugh Gaitskell tried to have the clause removed, but he was thwarted by the left. He died a frustrated man. His successors, from the then Mr Harold Wilson to the late Mr John Smith, have all avoided the reopening of the Clause IV debate, arguing that the revision of an antiquated few lines in an old document was not worth the danger of splitting the party. Mr Blair has clearly decided that the balance of advantage lies the other way. He is right. The direction in which he seeks to lead the people's party is away from state socialism, trade union dominance, high taxation, carefree expenditure, acquiescence in inflation, class warfare and some of the expensive but anachronistic traditions of the 50-year-old welfare state. It is towards becoming the party that tackles crime, supports the family, restores civic society, reconstructs the constitution and pursues social and economic objectives that are little different from those of one-nation Tories. In the 76 days since he became leader, Mr Blair has done much to reposition his party. His carefully judged speech yesterday took the project further forward in leaps and bounds. He spoke not to 'comrades' but to 'friends' and 'colleagues'. He answered calls for the repeal of 1980s trade union legislation with a simple No, and set realistic limits to the expectations of the unemployed and the low paid. He insisted, above all, that the party be truthful with itself. That established, he sought to sell Labour as the party of all voters who reject the Conservatives. He did not mention the Liberal Democrats; his strategies could easily steal many of their supporters for Labour. Mr Blair, with his over-arching theme of the individual and the community as mutually supportive ('social-ism'), has laid down principles which many voters may find attractive. Much work is still needed in coming months to turn those principles into practical policies, or even a detailed electoral strategy. There are also plenty of pitfalls ahead - from the precise level at which Labour sets its proposed minimum wage, to the inevitable arguments about tax. But in setting out a broad framework within which the process of change must continue, Mr Blair has made an impressive start.</p>

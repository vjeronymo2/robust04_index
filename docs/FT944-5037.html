			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Figures confirm faltering mortgage market A withdrawal from the mortgage market by centralised lenders contributed to a fall in new net lending in October compared with the corresponding month last year, figures released yesterday show. The statistics published by the Bank of England confirm the faltering state of the mortgage market, with seasonally adjusted figures for new lending lower in October than in September. Centralised lenders sell through intermediaries rather than through branch networks. This year borrowers redeemed Pounds 130m more in loans in October than were taken out. In October last year centralised lenders undertook Pounds 137m of new net lending, more than 8 per cent of the total market. It is the third successive month that the new net lending figures have shown centralised lenders with a 'negative' share of the mortgage market. Overall, new gross lending totalled Pounds 4.85bn in October - a drop of almost 8 per cent on the Pounds 5.27bn equivalent in September, though it is still about 5 per cent higher than in October last year. New net lending - which deducts from the gross lending the loans redeemed by the borrowers - was Pounds 1.54bn in October against Pounds 1.64bn the previous month. The figure represents a fall of more than 8 per cent on October last year. The greater difference between the figures for new gross and net lending this autumn compared with last year suggests that more re-mortgaging is now being carried out. Figures for loans approved but not yet undertaken suggest that the market will remain flat in the immediate future, though they show that in this respect the market has improved since October last year. Total new commitments came to Pounds 4.82bn in October, compared with Pounds 4.86bn in September.</p>

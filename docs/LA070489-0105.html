			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRE HITS ABORTION CLINIC BEFORE RULING  </P> <P> A deliberately set fire caused minor damage to an abortion clinic Monday hours  before the U.S. Supreme Court announced its ruling limiting the right to an  abortion, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said they were notifying federal authorities because of the  circumstances.  </P> <P> "Where it's at a feminist health center and there's been this nationwide thing  involving them (abortion clinics), we felt that we should notify them," said  Jim Moran, director of investigations for the Concord police.  </P> <P> Fire officials received an alarm at 2:20 a.m., said Capt. Jack Davis, fire  prevention officer. The fire, confined to a bookcase in one room in the  unoccupied building, was put out with a portable extinguisher.  </P></p>

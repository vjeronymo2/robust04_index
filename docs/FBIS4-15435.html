			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Vecherskaya, correspondent of the GAZETA </F> press agency, specially for SEGODNYA, from Riga under the  "Latvia" rubric: "Saeima May Fail To Ratify Treaty on Army  Pullout. Opposition Sees Russian Retirees as Republic's  Potential Enemies"]    [Text] The history of the Russian-Latvian treaty on the  army pullout reminds one of a detective story. Even now that  the agreement has already been initialed by heads of government  delegations, a number of questions remain unresolved. One of  them is whether the treaty will be signed at all. At any rate,  the radical opposition in the Latvian parliament is not very  enthusiastic about it and continues to do its utmost to block  the treaty's ratification.    Aleksandr Kirsteins, chief of the Movement for Latvia's  National Independence parliamentary faction and chairman of the  parliamentary international affairs committee, explains: "We do  not oppose the treaty itself. But this is not a single  document; this is a package of agreements, including the matter  of the Skrunda radar and the matter of social safety nets for  retired Russian officers. It is the latter question on which  our faction disagrees. Russia insists that Latvia should take  over the social protection of officers who left service before  22 January 1992. But if we gave in on Skrunda, this does not  mean at all that now we should accept any terms that Russia is  trying to impose on us."    "The Constitution of the Latvian Republic was reinstated as  early as 4 May 1990. It is from that day that we have seen  Russian officers as servicemen of another state. Hence, by  fulfilling this provision Latvia would directly violate its own  Constitution. Even if in the period from 4 May 1990 to 22  January 1992 the army may be considered Soviet, not Russian,  even then the social safety nets for its officers will be a  matter of Latvia's bilateral agreements with Russia, Ukraine,  Belarus, and Kazakhstan, but by no means with Russia alone," he  claimed.    "Moreover, from our point of view, one cannot talk with such  assurance that all Russian servicemen will automatically remain  in Latvia. We cannot accept this, either. We cannot confer the  status of Latvian citizens on officers of a foreign army, that  is, people who are potentially disloyal to the state. Such  people number around 50,000 in Latvia, and they are far from  innocuous lambs. According to our information, these are  officers who served in special purpose units in Moldova, in the  Caucasus, in Afghanistan. Why should we need this contingent --  from professional assassins to specialists in psychological  warfare? Let them practice all that in Russia, not in Latvia,"  Mr. Kirsteins said.    He also thinks that the reluctance to sign the treaty in its  present form cannot give Russia a pretext for blackmailing, such  as: "No treaty, no army pullout." "If Russia is to be a normal,  democratic state, if it is to cooperate with key European  countries, it will withdraw its troops even without any  agreement. If not, no treaty will help."    The parliament's majority faction holds a more cautious view  on the problem. Indulis Berzins from "Latvian Path" said that  the treaty initialed in Moscow is very much based on compromise:  "Of course, I do not like some of its provisions. I do not  think that Russia, either, is pleased with everything." To all  appearances, "Latvian Path" and its allies will advocate the  ratification of the treaty. "Let the Saeima decide whether we  need the treaty or not," Mr. Berzins noted. "But we must  clearly determine right now who will be responsible if it is not  signed. Currently it is easy for the opposition to bring  together rallies and pickets, currently all are heroes. But  whom will the people hold responsible if the army does not leave  on 31 August?"</p>

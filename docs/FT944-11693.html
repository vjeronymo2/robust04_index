			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sparebanken and Fokus Bank fall back A sharp rise in domestic interest rates, which hit Norway's bonds and shares, were behind weaker nine-month results reported yesterday by Fokus Bank and Sparebanken Nor. The banks, however, recorded sharp declines in losses on loans and guarantees. Norway's banks are recovering from the sector's worst post-war crisis and this year have benefited from a strong domestic economy which has significantly improved the performance of loan portfolios. This week Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the two biggest commercial banks, reported strong interim figures and indicated they might pay dividends for 1994. The banks say loan losses will continue to decline and stabilise by next year at normal levels. In contrast, Fokus Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, reported a dip in pre-tax profit to NKr244.3m (Dollars 37.5m) from NKr246.8m as net interest income fell by NKr66m to NKr755m. Non-interest income was almost halved to NKr233.3m from NKr449.2m, reflecting securities losses of NKr36.2m, against gains of NKr113m a year earlier. Foreign currency gains fell by NKr11.6m to NKr35.2m. Losses on loans and guarantees declined dramatically to NKr66.9m from NKr251.1m, but operating profit before loan losses was cut by NKr164.4m to NKr335.6m. Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, reported a steep fall in nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr487m from NKr1.03bn. Net interest income dropped by NKr27m to NKr2.3bn while non-interest income fell to NKr539m from NKr1.56bn. The bank suffered securities losses of NKr282m, against gains of NKr717m, with bond losses of NKr324m, against gains of NKr554m last year. Operating profit, before loan losses, plunged by more than half to NKr887m from nearly NKr2bn. On the bright side, loan losses were cut by 58 per cent to NKr401m from NKr944m and the bank achieved a strong third-quarter net profit of NKr224m, up sharply from NKr39m in the second quarter. Mr Kjell Kran, group managing director, said the positive outlook for the remainder of the year and strong results so far meant the bank will be able pay a solid dividend for 1994.</p>

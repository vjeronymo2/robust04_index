			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Korobova: "100 Days of President Yuriy </F> Meshkov: `I Am Walking Alone. Only a Stony Road Glimmers in  the Haze....'"]    [Text] For Yuriy Meshkov, this date was probably a holiday.  He laughed and joked a lot. Answering a question as to what he  will do if official Kiev adopts a decision to introduce  Ukrainian presidential rule in the Crimea, Meshkov said: "A  wise man acts only one way. A stupid person can make a choice."  Meshkov held out hopes -- referring to a recent visit to the  Crimea by acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy -- that Ukraine has  many sane people and it is up to them to define  Crimean-Ukrainian relations.    As to the recent and unexpected statement by Leonid  Kravchuk,  who stated his personal opinion that the Crimean Tatars, like  other peoples, have the right to self-determination and the  establishment of their own state, Meshkov said that his position  on this issue is different: "Of course, the full volume of  human rights should be observed. The other issue is that of  "satisfying one's ambitions."    With regard to the issue of Crimean Tatars (and the 50th  anniversary of their deportation from the Crimea, the date being  marked these days), Meshkov took into consideration the presence  of foreign journalists and delivered an eloquent speech devoted  to the tragedy of the deported peoples and the fault of all  those (he mentioned the Crimea, Ukraine, Russia, and  Uzbekistan), who did not take the pain of these peoples for  their own tragedy. Later, Meshkov recalled the phrase: "The  bell tolls for you." The president said that not all debts had  been paid and he focused on the issue of the quota of Crimean  Tatars among the Crimean Supreme Soviet deputies: "I am still  of the opinion that political rights are not connected with  national traits."    The president also spoke about his constant desire to keep  his promise and crush the Mafia. However, he made allusions to  something that no one could understand. To avoid any  unnecessary reproaches for imprecision, I am going to cite  Meshkov: "As to the defeat of the Mafia, it was supposed that  the Ministry of Internal Affairs, along with the internal  affairs minister, fully meet the existing demands on them.  However, this is not true. You were present when the BBC  queried the internal affairs minister on 5 September. In his  interview, he declassified the operation which could cost the  lives of his colleagues, my life, and the lives of the members  of my family. The internal affairs minister declassified this  operation. Later, he declared that he will not perform his  duties because he has a president with such and such decrees.  Therefore, we did not do much, however, we planned more.  However, this subject is still pressing and the interested  circles know that this issue will be radically resolved."    This speech resulted in more questions than proposals. What  did former minister A. Plyuta declassify? What has Meshkov's  life -- who marked his first 100 days in office -- to do with  the 5 September interview? Does Meshkov mean his order  regarding the arrest of 100-150 men who were allegedly Mafia  members? However, the evidence of their conniving with the  Mafia had to be searched for during the court proceedings which  were supported by a storm of applause. What hampers the new  internal minister in his fight against criminal groups which are  operating quite openly? Finally, does Meshkov know who is among  his entourage? If he does, with what Mafia is he going to  combat? At the end of his crime-oriented monologue, we  understood: It is not, while it is [as published].    What Meshkov did not mention was even more interesting.  There were plans for a trade agreement with Russia to become  the triumph of Meshkov's first 100 days because we see no other  results at all. However, he kept silent on this subject.  Probably, the reason was that S. Shakhray, Russia's  representative, who, along with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister  Saburov signed this agreement, resigned from his post the same  day (he did not know that Yeltsin had already dismissed him) and  held a news conference.    Meshkov also declared, in fact, avoiding straightforward  statements, that the Crimea had to conduct a step-by-step  demilitarization; that the National Guard of the Republic of  Crimea -- which a new legislature plans to organize -- would  not be a military unit but a department for maintaining public  order; that an extravagant idea of moving the Crimean capital  from Simferopol to Sevastopol was caused by circumstances; that  the deputies' impatience to show the government what is what  will not result in a confrontation between the president and the  legislature; and that Kiev's plausible attempts to repeal the  autonomy cannot be conducted "immediately."    The day when a representative of the Ukrainian president was  nominated to the Crimea, was, in Meshkov's words, the most  depressing day in his 100 day presidential career. He made  assurances that the happiest day is still awaiting him. In  compliance with a request to cite some poetry to demonstrate his  current emotional state, he cited Lermontov's poetry: "Only a  stony road glimmers in the haze...." Then he thought for a  while and added: "And I am walking alone." This, in my mind,  corresponds to the truth.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 21 SAPA -- President Nelson  Mandela appeared on a Johannesburg street on Tuesday [21 June]  to calm 500 angry aspirant soldiers turned away from an armed  forces induction camp. Addressing the crowd outside the African  National Congress headquarters in Plein St, Mr Mandela said he  would not accept them acting like gangsters. He said he had  heard that bread had been stolen from a nearby bakery, and that  a police vehicle had been damaged. Mr Mandela said he did not  want an army of criminals, but a disciplined force.    The would-be army recruits camped outside the ANC  headquarters on Monday and vowed to stay there until the ANC  agreed to talk to them. They said they had been turned away from  the SA [South African] National Defence Force [SANDF] assembly  point at Wallmannstahl, near Pretoria, after being told they  were not on the ANC list of recruits.    They told SAPA: "We registered. Now suddenly we are no  longer registered. Some of us left school and our jobs to join  the army. What are we supposed to do now? We have no money for  food or accommodation."    Bags, luggage and personal belongings were strewn around the  entrance to the ANC head office.    "We have been here since 4AM, and some have been sleeping  out  here for the past two weeks, living on handouts."    A woman said some of them were Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) [Spear  of the Nation, ANC armed wing] members, while others had left  work or school. "We are not going anywhere until the ANC speaks  to us. We want to be part of the SANDF," she said.    "We can't go back to school or tech because registration is  over. We left our schools and now we are just dumped," said a  young man.    MK Commissar Andrew Masondo said on Monday the crowd was  being "impatient". He said MK had submitted a list of its  members to be retrained at Wallmannstahl for integration into  the SANDF, which had to be thoroughly checked.    When it was pointed out to Mr Masondo that many of the crowd  were not MK members and had left school or jobs to join the  army, he said: "The list is for MK members. If the others just  want to join the army, they should apply like everyone else  does. You don't have to join the army via MK."    Officers said that of the 6,200 people who originally  reported to Wallmannstahl, nearly 3,000 had been turned away  because they were not on the ANC's list.    On Tuesday, Mr Mandela appeared and urged the crowd to  follow  proper induction procedures and to approach regional ANC  structures for inclusion in the armed forces.    More exiled soldiers are expected to arrive in South Africa  this week.</p>

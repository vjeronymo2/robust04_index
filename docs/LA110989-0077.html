			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: BALDWIN PARK;  </P> <P> LANZA NAMED POLICE CHIEF  </P> <P> Capt. Carmine R. Lanza, who joined the Baldwin Park Police Department as a  patrol officer 18 years ago, has been named police chief by the City Council.  </P> <P> He replaces Richard A. Hoskin, who was fired last week after three years on the  job. City Council members blamed Hoskin for inaccurate figures that showed a  greater decrease in gang crime than actually occurred and for failure to  communicate effectively with his officers.  </P> <P> Lanza, 41, had been acting chief since Oct. 9, after Hoskin was placed on  administrative leave. The council appointed Lanza to head the 63-officer  department last week. City officials said it had been a "toss-up" between Lanza  and Hoskin in 1986.  </P> <P> Lanza, who holds a master's degree in public administration from the University  of La Verne, is president of the Baldwin Park Host Lions Club and is a member  of the board of directors of the San Gabriel Valley YMCA. He lives with his  wife and two children in Covina.  </P></p>

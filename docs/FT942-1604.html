			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Salary boost for Thorn head Mr Jim Fifield, head of Thorn EMI's music business, is guaranteed to see his basic salary rise from Dollars 3m this year to Dollars 3.5m in April, 1996, and to Dollars 4m in April, 1999. The guarantee is contained in Mr Fifield's service contract, one of the most complex and generous ever awarded to an executive director of a UK public company. It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Fifield last year trebled the worth of his total pay to about Pounds 13.5m. This included a Pounds 5.046m performance-related bonus, of which Pounds 1.5m was paid in ordinary shares. The details came from Thorn EMI's annual report. A summary of Mr Fifield's service contract states that his compensation package is 'to be more than that paid to the next highest paid employee of EMI Music.' Other contractural benefits include: A bonus of up to 50 per cent of base salary, paid in cash, if certain sales and profit performance criteria are meet and another bonus based on EMI's market share in Europe and the US. An entitlement to share options totalling 300,000 in the three-year period from April 1, 1993, and thereafter on a basis no less favourable than other Thorn EMI music executives. A Change in Control clause entitling Mr Fifield to a substantial payoff if he terminates his contract in the event of a takeover of EMI or Thorn EMI. He is guaranteed 36 months notice in the event of termination of his contract by the company. Participation in a Long-Term Incentive plan for the music business. Awards under the plan are made in the form of existing ordinary shares. Thorn EMI announced yesterday to the Stock Exchange that it had awarded Mr Fifield up to 142,200 shares subject to management meeting certain performance criteria over the next three years. The shares last night had a market value of Pounds 1.49m</p>

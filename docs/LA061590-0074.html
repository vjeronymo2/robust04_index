			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION JEOPARDIZES JORDAN RANCH PLAN;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS: THE VICTORY OF SLOW-GROWTH CANDIDATE MARIA VANDERKOLK COULD TIP  THE SCALES AGAINST THE PROJECT.  </P> <P> Ventura County supervisors, reacting to the election of a new slow-growth  member, cast new doubts this week that the board will approve the subdivision  of Bob Hope's Jordan Ranch in the rolling hills of the southeast county.  </P> <P> The supervisors' rejection would not only kill the 750-house project but would,  in effect, veto a complex land swap between Hope and the National Park Service  that would turn 5,700 acres of mountain property in Ventura and Los Angeles  counties into parkland, federal officials said.  </P> <P> Three of the five county supervisors who are scheduled to review the project in  January have either pledged to vote against it or have voted against it in the  past.  </P> <P> "The chances of it passing are slim. If I were the developer, I would feel very  uncomfortable right now," Supervisor John K. Flynn said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Last week's upset election of slow-growth advocate Maria VanderKolk to the  Board of Supervisors may have provided the swing vote against the project, he  said.  </P> <P> "It's that election and the fact that two supervisors voted against going ahead  with the environmental impact report in the first place," Flynn said.  </P> <P> Flynn and Supervisor Susan K. Lacey voted last July not to allow developers to  study the environmental effects of the proposal and of an adjacent project at  the Ahmanson Ranch. Denial would have killed the projects, but the study was  approved 3 to 2 by the board.  </P> <P> Now, however, Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, who voted for the study, has been  defeated by VanderKolk, whose opposition to development of Jordan Ranch was the  centerpiece of her campaign. VanderKolk takes office in January, in time for  hearings on the proposal.  </P> <P> Supervisor Maggie Erickson, a potential fourth vote against the project, has  said that she has grave concerns about it.  </P> <P> Erickson would have rejected the project last year, she said Wednesday, if  representatives of the state-funded Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy had not  supported it as a way to place thousands of acres owned by Hope into public  use.  </P> <P> "The only reason I didn't turn it down had to do with land going into the  conservancy," she said. "The information I had was that environmentalists were  saying this is important enough to allow the development. Now, there is a great  division of opinion by people involved with the parks about this project."  </P> <P> Under the land-swap proposal, the National Park Service would exchange 59 acres  needed for an access road to the Jordan subdivision for 1,100 acres of the  2,308-acre ranch. In addition, Hope is donating and selling 4,600 acres in the  Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains to park agencies for a below-market $10  million.  </P> <P> The land swap plan has split the environmental community. It is described by  supporters, including the Sierra Club's Southern California Conservation  Committee and the conservancy, as the best deal possible considering the  shortage of public money to buy parklands.  </P> <P> But it has been denounced by critics -- including the Wilderness Society -- who  say that the Jordan Ranch should be preserved as open space because it is  within the boundaries of a national recreation area.  </P> <P> Hope agreed Wednesday to cut his price for the lands in half -- to $10 million  -- in a deal negotiated by Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), a leading  proponent of preserving open space in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Beilenson's support significantly enhances the deal's prospects for funding by  Congress and approval by the Park Service, backers and opponents said.  </P> <P> It followed endorsements of the swap by Sen. Pete Wilson, the California  Republican gubernatorial nominee, and Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City).  A spokesman for state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) confirmed Thursday that  the lawmaker also supports the swap.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) opposes it.  </P> <P> Beilenson said he negotiated the reduced price with Peter Kyros, general  partner of Potomac Investment Associates, which has an option on Jordan Ranch.  Beilenson said he proposed the 50% reduction in price, which Kyros worked out  with Hope.  </P> <P> The congressman said, however, that the entire deal depends on the County Board  of Supervisors approving development at the ranch.  </P> <P> "Everything depends on the developers being able to develop Jordan," Beilenson  said. He cited VanderKolk's victory as a possible setback to the project.  </P> <P> Park Service officials said Thursday that they are monitoring the supervisors'  deliberations and do not intend to enter into a final agreement on the land  swap until the county board votes on the Jordan project.  </P> <P> "We probably will not make our final decision on whether the exchange is in the  public's best interest until the county has had its Board of Supervisors  hearings on it and has either denied or proceeded with its conceptual  approval," said David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa Monica  Mountains National Recreation Area.  </P> <P> Fred Maas, vice president for Potomac Investment, refused to say that denial by  the supervisors would kill the land swap. He did say that the deal would be  "much less attractive if we don't have a development approved on Jordan Ranch."  </P> <P> If the land swap falls through, Potomac's current access road is wide enough to  allow construction of 28 luxury houses on 80-acre parcels and a golf course, he  said. No county zoning change would be needed, he said.  </P> <P> Dividing the property into 80-acre parcels would mean that none of it would be  preserved as parkland, he said.  </P> <P> Maas said he did not know if VanderKolk's stunning upset of Schaefer had  prompted Hope to agree to a cut in price. But VanderKolk said Thursday that  "the timing is too much of a coincidence" for her win not to have been a  factor.  </P> <P> "They are realizing that they have a bigger problem than they thought," the  supervisor-elect said.  </P> <P> Erickson said she would try not to let Hope's sweetened deal be a part of her  deliberations.  </P> <P> "I've tried all along not to let that be part of my decision," she said. "My  decision has to be based on its impact on Ventura County. If it harms the  environment, then I won't support it."  </P> <P> Flynn said he voted against further study of the project last year because, "I  was trying to be fair to the property owner. I said, 'There are some major  problems here and that I don't think any mitigation measures can overcome  them.' "  </P> <P> Maas said as the heat of the VanderKolk campaign subsides he is hopeful that  the board will see things Hope's way.  </P> <P> "We want to take things one day, one week, one month at a time. We've got a  long time yet before there's an ultimate vote by the Board of Supervisors."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Alan C. Miller, in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

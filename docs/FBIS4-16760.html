			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Valentin Tatarchuk by Lev </F> Korneshov; date and place not given: "State Duma Deputy  Valentin Tatarchuk: There Is No Going Back to the Past"]    [Text] [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, you are known as a  State Duma deputy and executive secretary of the "Russia's  Choice" faction. What post do you occupy in the leadership of  the new party of the same name?    [Tatarchuk] So far we have a provisional party name but the  party itself does not yet exist. It is my and my colleagues'  job to form it. What some of us are going to be will be  determined by the constituent congress during the selection of  the party's leading organs. Naturally, after its program and  rules have been approved. Right now I am deputy chairman of the  organizing committee to form the party.    [Korneshov] What exactly do you, the new party's founders,  mean by the words Russia's choice? The choice of capitalism or  some other path?    [Tatarchuk] We are retaining the name of the election bloc  and of our parliamentary faction in order to stress the genetic  link to the movement to which a considerable number of voters  gave their votes last December. It is on this basis that the  party program is now being elaborated. Naturally, it will be  refined and expanded. But it will retain the fundamental  approaches to questions concerning the Federation, economics,  ethnic policy, and foreign policy, and to social problems. To  us there is an obvious need for the sound reformation of our  state in order to create a reliable market economy, freedom of  choice for people, protection of human rights, freedom of  enterprise, protection of private ownership, and to create  normal conditions to develop all types of ownership, while  realizing that state ownership in this country will not  disappear overnight.    [Korneshov] What sort of social base does your party have?    [Tatarchuk] It seems to us that many people involved in  ownership are now appearing as a result of the reforms. This is  the nascent stratum of entrepreneurs. As a result of voucher  privatization tens of millions of Russians are becoming  shareholders, that is to say private owners, and private farming  is developing.    [Korneshov] It is known that you will try to rely on the  workers aristocracy for support. I have a question here: Is  there such a thing as the workers aristocracy in Russia today,  in conditions when ZIL is closed and the giants of Altay and  other industrial regions are becoming idle maybe not forever but  for a long time?    [Korneshov] The workers aristocracy is a somewhat unhappily  chosen term. It refers to the section of workers who are fairly  highly skilled and who realize that reform must be purposeful  and accelerated, but without a further fall in the social level.    [Korneshov] It is known that to a considerable extent the  political orientation of parties, movements, and their leaders  can now be determined by their attitude toward the president and  government....    [Tatarchuk] We are prepared to work constructively in  parliament with the government and president until such time as  the government and president support the advance of the reforms.  If the reverse process is observed we will, of course, state  this and defend our line.    [Korneshov] You have had meetings with the president.  Could you interpret a little of what was discussed at them for  our readers?    [Tatarchuk] We briefed the president on the work we are  doing to create a parliamentary-type political party on a  platform known to the president. And on questions associated  with the slowing down of reforms and the growth of national  extremism.    [Korneshov] At your press conference Organizing Committee  Chairman Yegor Timurovich Gaydar said in passing that all of us  in Russia are Marxist-educated people. As we know,  Marxists-Leninists believed that the most effective way to  create a party is to set up a party-wide newspaper. Will you,  Valentin Ivanovich, have your own press?    [Tatarchuk] That is our dream. But you work for a newspaper  and know what that costs nowadays, whereas we do not have such  resources. We will rely on already existing publications,  specifically on the regional press, which in our opinion needs  special support.    [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, since we are talking about  finances.... What do you see as the main sources of funding for  the party's activity?    [Tatarchuk] We hope that those people and those already  established structures which believe that the reform process  needs to be made irreversible and continued will give the party  material support. We are setting up a fund and are counting on  the fact that our supporters will contribute what they can to  it. The party will also have a system of membership dues.  Although we do not see our party as a mass, amorphous party.    [Korneshov] Please tell us whether the attempt, if it did  indeed take place, to involve [singer] Alla Borisovna Pugacheva  and other popular people in the process of forming the party was  really an attempt or just rumors.    [Tatarchuk] I would like to say that we have made no attempt  whatever to "involve" anybody in the party. This applies to  Alla Borisovna too. Initially she agreed to sign an address on  the party's formation, but then behaved somewhat strangely. But  that is really her affair.    [Korneshov] Valentin Ivanovich, there are now a multitude of  parties in Russia and the vast majority of them are salon  parties, what I call invisible parties. But there are still  parties which enjoy a certain popularity. Which of them do you  see as your natural allies?    [Tatarchuk] Indeed, several parties and movements could  unite in blocs to achieve certain aims. Essentially some of our  fundamental approaches toward solving the most important  problems coincide with those of the "12 December" group,  "Yabloko".... This formation of blocs in parliament would make  sense. In many respects our tendencies also coincide with those  of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and a considerable  number of the "New Regional Policy" group's members.    [Korneshov] So we are talking about a very broad democratic  bloc?    [Tatarchuk] That is our main task -- to unite democrats in  the face of the impending danger of a backward slide and the  threat of fascism. Now is not the time to share out portfolios  or leadership.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Observer: Sir Leon's odd ally Padraig Flynn is the craftiest European Commissioner of them all. At least that is what some are saying in Brussels after his unexpected move to support Sir Leon's Brittan's campaign to become the next president of the European Commission. Flynn has apparently calculated that it is a no-lose strategy to back Sir Leon's unlikely bid to succeed Jacques Delors. Success would mean a plum job in the new commission and failure might still lead to a good turn from Sir Leon. A third option looks even better. Flynn shares Sir Leon's view that victory depends on halting the bandwagon behind Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister who remains the race favourite. But a stalemate would not necessarily tip the scales towards Sir Leon, whose chief weakness is his passport; more likely, EU heads of government would still be looking for a Lubbers-like conservative, if possible from a small state. And who better than. . . Padraig Flynn?</p>

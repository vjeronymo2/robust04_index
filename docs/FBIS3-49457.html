A statement issued by the ZChN Political Committee says that  "the restoration of the property of the Ukrainian populace that  in significant measure supported the ethnic cleansing and that  was nationalized during `Operation Wisla' may take place in the  event there is a parallel restoration of the property of the  Polish population expelled from Galicia and Volhynia during and  after World War II."    The statement was issued in association with a letter from  Ukrainian circles in Poland to the speaker of the Sejm in  December of last year with a request for the abolition of the  consequences of `Operation Wisla', said Marian Pilka, member of  the ZChN Political Committee, speaking to journalists.    The statement also asserts that the destruction of the  Polish  cultural heritage and the prevention of the restoration of  Catholic church buildings to the Roman Catholic Church on  territory at present belonging to Ukraine is directed against  Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation.</p>

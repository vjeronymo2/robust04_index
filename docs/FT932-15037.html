			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / International Company News: Microsoft up 35.8% at Dollars 243m MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, yesterday beat analysts' expectations by unveiling a 35.8 per cent jump in third-quarter net income to Dollars 243m, or 80 cents a share, helped by the continuing popularity of its Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS operating systems. A year earlier, Microsoft earned Dollars 179m, or 69 cents. Revenues in the three months to March 31 soared nearly 41 per cent to Dollars 958m from Dollars 681m. On Wall Street, Microsoft shares added to Dollars 89. The results were released after the close of trading. Most analysts had expected earnings of about 78 cents a share. For the first nine months of the company's 1993 fiscal year, Microsoft earned Dollars 688m, or Dollars 2.28a share, up 38.1 per cent from Dollars 498m, or Dollars 1.70, the previous year. Revenues grew 39.7 per cent to Dollars 2.71bn from Dollars 1.94bn. Mr Frank Gaudette, chief financial officer, said: 'We have expanded core businesses, introduced new product lines and maintained our emphasis on operating efficiencies.' Microsoft has licensed more than 25m copies of its Windows operating system since its debut in 1990. The company said Windows is now pre-installed in about 60 per cent of personal computers. Earlier this week, Microsoft announced an agreement to work with Compaq Computer to make personal computers easier to use and to develop new products and markets. The company is expected to launch its Windows NT (New Technology) in May.</p>

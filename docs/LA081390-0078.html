			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> DISTRICTS GRAPPLE WITH CUTS IN BUDGET  </P> <P> Administrators in the Capistrano and Saddleback Valley unified school districts  say they may be forced to cut programs and deny salary increases in order to  absorb their share of $462 million cut by Gov. George Deukmejian from the state  education budget last month.  </P> <P> In the Saddleback Valley district, officials estimate that the state cuts  amount to $1.3 million in lost revenue. To make matters worse, this year's  $96.4-million budget already suffers from a $1.7-million decrease in revenue  and a $2.6-million increase in expenditures, officials said.  </P> <P> "We tend to be in a hole to start with," said Bob Cornelius, assistant  superintendent for fiscal services. "We were in bad shape last year, and what  the governor's done this year is going to make things worse."  </P> <P> Capistrano Unified School District officials are breathing a bit easier, having  figured a 3% cost-of-living adjustment into their coming budget, the same  percentage used in the state budget allocations. Other districts had counted on  a 4% increase, as was originally provided in the state budget, and so are now  having to absorb the difference.  </P> <P> The district also has about $5 million in a contingency fund intended to be  used in case of emergencies, said Bill Eller, assistant superintendent.  </P> <P> But administrators in both districts said that cutting programs to balance the  budget will become a definite possibility as costs rise and funds from the  state are withheld.  </P> <P> "You either go get more money or you squeeze what you got," Cornelius said.  </P> <P> Some programs, such as those for California Assessment Program tests and driver  training, have already been eliminated because they were not protected by  Proposition 98, which guarantees that 40% of the state budget is allocated to  education.  </P> <P> Teachers are also bracing for the effects of the cuts. Negotiations in  Saddleback Valley for the 1990-91 contract were suspended in May as both sides  waited for the state budget to be finalized. Talks will resume in late  September, said Assistant Supt. Ken Anderson.  </P> <P> In Capistrano Unified, state budget cuts also are likely to result in another  difficult year of negotiations with the teachers union. The only way to fund a  salary increase would be to cut programs or dip into the contingency fund,  Eller said.  </P> <P> "People just have to recognize that some $400 million has been taken from the  districts' budgets," he said. "If programs or services need to be cut, we're  just reacting to what is provided for us by the state." CHERYLANNE BEALER  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA FACES NEW CONTROVERSY IN NEW YORK SHOW;  </P> <P> ART: NATIONAL ENDOWMENT SEEKS VOLUNTARY RETURN OF $10,000 TO QUIET CRITICISM.  </P> <P> A risky new National Endowment for the Arts controversy -- emanating from an  art show focusing on the AIDS epidemic and containing sexually explicit gay  photographs -- has broken out here even as the agency struggles to recover from  a bruising political fight.  </P> <P> Neither the NEA nor the New York City artist organization sponsoring the show,  scheduled to open Nov. 16, would discuss the dispute in detail. But The Times  learned national endowment attorneys have contacted a lawyer representing the  gallery -- apparently to try to persuade the organization to voluntarily return  $10,000 in endowment funding for it.  </P> <P> NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer has also met privately with Susan Wyatt,  director of Artists Space, the Manhattan gallery and arts activist  organization, to urge that the endowment's name be removed from publicity  materials about the show and that the show's catalogue include a disclaimer  distancing the work from the NEA. Under existing federal law, the endowment  cannot order the return of grant money, but it can disassociate itself from a  piece of work or exhibit.  </P> <P> The show has a total budget of about $30,000. Artists Space, one of the  nation's best known artist-run gallery and support organizations, has received  $199,000 in NEA grants in the last three years and is highly reputed in the  NEA's museum and visual arts programs.  </P> <P> The Artists Space show is titled "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." It  involves the work of 23 different artists and was organized by Nan Goldin, a  prominent New York City artist and photographer. The show, which is scheduled  to remain on view until Jan. 6, was planned to coincide with a daylong Dec. 1  national program called "Visual AIDS," in which museums and arts groups around  the country will sponsor events oriented toward the AIDS epidemic.  </P> <P> Discussions between Frohnmayer and Wyatt continued through the weekend, without  final resolution. Wyatt scheduled an emergency meeting of the board of Artists  Space for this week, but she said categorically that the gallery would not  cancel or alter the exhibition.  </P> <P> The situation underscored widespread fears among arts observers that the  political fight over control of content of federally funded artworks could lead  to a new era of hypersensitivity and fear that could influence subject matter  of work funded by the agency.  </P> <P> But the dispute also appeared to represent the introduction of a new tactic by  artists determined to resist the imposition of censorship standards. Wyatt said  that, while she regretted having to involve the NEA in a fresh dispute, she  felt it was important for artists and arts groups to actively resist any  chilling of freedom of expression in the arts.  </P> <P> In the original application for the grant, submitted in November, 1988, Artists  Space described the show as intended to treat the AIDS crisis and "focus on  three areas: sexuality, recovery from drug use (and) death." The application  noted that "the issue of sexuality deals with the sublimation of sexuality  through art or art as safe sex."  </P> <P> The extraordinary attempt to either distance the endowment from the content of  the show -- which is said to include homoerotic sexually explicit pictures and  text materials that criticize a variety of public officials, specifically  including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) -- has developed as Frohnmayer has  struggled to contain political damage to the arts agency and resume normal  operations.  </P> <P> In comments during a meeting of the National Council on the Arts, the NEA's  advisory body, Frohnmayer confirmed that a delicate negotiation was under way  in regard to the content of "Witnesses," precipitated by intense fears within  the endowment that the episode could rekindle the political firestorm that  enveloped the NEA over the summer.  </P> <P> "I don't want to comment on that. We are really communicating actively,"  Frohnmayer said of the situation. "This is a very difficult situation. It has  the potential of being as politically sensitive as some of the other grants  have been. We are trying to manage it."  </P> <P> The other sensitive grants to which Frohnmayer referred were the basis of the  political tumult that arose starting last April. Helms and other conservatives  in Congress objected to the subject matter content of shows involving the work  of two photographers, including sadomasochistic and homoerotic images of the  late Robert Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS last March. The Robert Mapplethorpe  Foundation, an AIDS organization endowed by proceeds from Mapplethorpe's  estate, is underwriting publication of the catalogue for "Witnesses."  </P> <P> The political dispute resulted in restrictions in the 1990 NEA funding bill  that prohibit grants to support work that is obscene unless the work meets high  standards of artistic excellence. The grant for the New York City show,  however, involves money from the NEA's 1989 budget that was disbursed in July  and is not subject to the content restrictions.  </P> <P> It was learned that Wyatt brought the subject matter content of the "Witnesses"  show to the attention first of officials of the NEA's museum division, which  funded the show, and then of Frohnmayer personally. As a result of the  notification by Wyatt, Frohnmayer sent Andrew Oliver Jr., acting director of  the NEA's museum program, to New York to personally inspect work to be included  in the show.  </P> <P> Wyatt's decision to warn Frohnmayer of a potentially difficult grant -- of  which he might not have otherwise become personally aware until the New York  show opened -- was part of what she said was a deliberate strategy to keep the  NEA chairman from being blind-sided by developments of which he had no  knowledge. However, Wyatt also said her tactics were intended to provoke a  confrontation with the principle of federal control of arts subject matter.  </P> <P> She said she initially developed the strategy at a meeting in Minneapolis three  weeks ago of the National Assn. of Artist Organizations. She advocated that  every museum and arts group take deliberate action to take issue with the  proposition that federally-imposed standards of any kind should dictate the  content of art.  </P> <P> "I want the Metropolitan Museum of Art (in New York City) and the Museum of  Modern Art (involved,)" Wyatt said. "This is why I have done this." Wyatt and  Charlotte Murphy, director of the National Assn. of Artist Organizations, met  privately during the national council meeting with Wendy Luers, an artist and  arts patron who is a member of the national advisory body. Luers is married to  William Luers, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  </P> <P> In another development, Frohnmayer and other arts endowment officials conceded  that they were having difficulty drawing up written standards to put the 1990  content restrictions officially into place. In the draft of a letter intended  to be sent to all NEA grant recipients, Frohnmayer urged grant recipients to  cooperate with the endowment and to avoid actions that the arts agency's  opponents could construe as deliberately provocative.  </P> <P> "You may or may not like or agree with the new law," the letter draft said.  "But it is still the law." The draft was released at the national council  meeting.  </P> <P> In an interview, Frohnmayer said endowment officials had concluded of the  pitfalls of implementing the content-control standards that "it's a whole lot  harder in the specific to make these decisions than it is in the abstract."  </P> <P> "When you get the first one (arts project likely to be politically troublesome)  coming down the pike," he said, "it really is crunch time. It's terribly,  terribly tough. I don't think any of us were satisfied that the task is in hand  or that it's going to be easy."  </P></p>

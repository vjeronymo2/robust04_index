What is the consumer's expectation when purchasing ``fresh'' poultry? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Do consumers consider previously frozen poultry to be ``fresh''? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Would it be useful to consumers to have an informative statement, such as ``previously frozen for your protection,'' on the labeling of poultry products that have been previously frozen? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What quality characteristics (e.g., tenderness, appearance, etc.) do consumers associate with the term ``fresh''? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. What are the sensory differences (e.g., taste, texture, etc.), if any, between frozen poultry and poultry which has never been frozen? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Would it be useful to consumers to combine the term ``fresh'' with other descriptive terms (e.g., ``fresh chilled,'' ``fresh deep-chilled,'' ``cryo-fresh,'' ``fresh frozen,'' or ``fresh-super chilled'') on the labeling of poultry products that have been held at temperatures slightly above 0 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The presiding officer at the three hearings will be the FSIS Deputy Administrator for Regulatory Programs. The presiding officer will be accompanied by a panel of FSIS employees with relevant expertise on the issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons who wish to participate are requested to submit a written request to Mr. Charles R. Edwards, Director, Product Assessment Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. The written request should contain the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, affiliation (if applicable) of the participant, location of hearing where participation is requested, and a brief summary of the presentation. FSIS asks groups that have similar interests to consolidate their comments. FSIS will allocate the time available for the hearings among the persons who have properly submitted a request for participation. If time permits, FSIS may allow other interested persons attending the hearings who did not submit a request for participation, in advance, to make an oral presentation prior to the conclusion of the hearings. FSIS hopes that a broad spectrum of the private and public sectors will participate in these hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS will schedule each appearance after reviewing the notices of participation and accompanying information, and notify each participant by mail, telephone, or FAX of when the time allotted to the person's oral presentation is scheduled to begin. Presentations will be limited to 5 to 10 minutes depending on the number of participants. The hearing schedule will be available at the hearing, and, after the hearing, it will be placed on file with the Docket Clerk (address above) under Docket Number 94&hyph;022N. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is holding these public hearings to gather information and opinions on the use of the term ``fresh'' as applied to raw poultry and how it is currently perceived when used on the labeling of raw poultry products. FSIS will use this information to determine if and how the Department's current policy on ``fresh'' should be changed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Done at Washington, DC, on: August 23, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael R.

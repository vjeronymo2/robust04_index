			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After today's three-hour consultations at Cotroceni  Palace between President Ion Iliescu and a delegation of the  National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR], we asked PUNR Chairman  Gheorghe Funar to summarize the contents of their talks.    [Begin Funar recording] We appreciate this initiative by  President Ion Iliescu. PUNR supports the idea of concluding a  political, social, and economic pact and will associate itself  with the PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania], which  intends to sign the pact.    I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to all  political parties, especially those of the opposition, to  associate themselves with us and sign the mentioned pact, which  we badly need in these difficult times. We need national unity,  and I hope that all political parties will prove to be  sufficiently mature to go beyond all party ambitions and lend a  helping hand to conclude the pact and especially implement it.    I would also like to mention the second issue for  discussion,  which we have been invited to by President Iliescu, namely the  International Monetary Fund memorandum and the discussion on it  in parliament. We were happy to see that President Iliescu  appreciates PUNR's petition that was issued a few days ago, by  which it requests that the government should come to parliament  and present the details on the accords concluded over the past  years with the IMF, their consequences, as well as the accord  planned for 1994 and 1995. We are certain that the prime  minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu] will personally come to parliament  to present those details so that our lawmakers can get  acquainted with them and decide accordingly. In this way, the  whole country can learn about the details, since many things  related to those accords are presently unclear. [end recording]</p>

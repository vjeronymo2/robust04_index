			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Paying for roads WITH BRITAIN'S railways facing privatisation, there is symmetry in the idea of putting the roads on a commercial basis too. Why, after all, should they be exempt from a process that has touched every other part of the nation's transport infrastructure? Up until now, the lack of any income stream from the roads has rendered the notion futile. But that could change: a green paper in April will explore the possibility of introducing tolls on trunk roads and motorways to help finance new roadbuilding, while in the longer term, the government is talking of introducing electronic road pricing in urban areas to tackle traffic congestion. Political risks apart, the notion of road charging must be attractive to any government: it offers the opportunity of opening up a very substantial source of revenue while simultaneously being seen as encouraging an environmentally friendly switch of passenger and goods traffic to public transport. Even so, it raises some awkward questions. In the case of trunk roads and motorways, one argument for tolls is that they would help fund the construction of new capacity. But Britain's trunk roads and motorways were not built as toll roads, so a toll system could prove appallingly expensive to instal and might also be costly to run. If so, the equivalent sums could be raised more cost-effectively through the existing system of fuel and vehicle taxes. The other main argument for tolls is that they are necessary to provide a framework in which the private sector will go into business building and operating roads at a profit. But the private sector already builds roads on the government's behalf. If the government wants the private sector to fund them, too, it is not clear what is wrong with asking it to go on doing so as it already does: through the gilts market. Much stronger arguments exist for road pricing in urban areas. Here, where more roadbuilding is usually impractical, high user charges on busy routes would be a much more efficient way of rationing available space than congestion, and the proceeds could be ploughed into better public transport. Yet this idea has taken a back seat to the toll roads plan. The government is in danger of getting itself into a muddle over road user charges. Already, suspicions are aroused. Will the proceeds from tolls really be applied to building better roads, or will they simply represent a new source of taxation? Is there really an environmentally friendly angle to the plan, or is it more to do with the government's determination to keep the privatisation show running? Why press ahead with toll roads at a time when urban road pricing looks a much higher priority? The green paper will need to produce some convincing answers to questions like these if it is to convince a sceptical motoring public that the benefits of toll roads will outweigh the costs.</p>

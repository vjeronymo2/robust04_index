			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOLEN CAR TRACKING SYSTEM GETS WIDE POLICE TRYOUT  </P> <P> Every Los Angeles County law enforcement agency but one has signed on to a  private company's high-tech system for tracing stolen cars, and officials of  the Massachusetts-based LoJack Corp. say the technology will be available to  consumers in June.  </P> <P> After an aggressive yearlong marketing effort by LoJack, 48 of 49 local police  agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol, have agreed to  participate in the system.  </P> <P> Under the technology, police use computers to track stolen cars that have been  equipped with homing devices.  </P> <P> Only the Culver City Police Department has declined to take part in LoJack's  project. Officers there say they are not convinced that homing devices and  tracking systems will be effective in sprawling, hilly Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Many law enforcement officials say they believe the new technology will not  only help recover stolen cars but also deter thieves once enough consumers buy  signal units.  </P> <P> "We think this will be a great step forward. It is a system with a proven track  record," said Lt. Frederick D. Price of the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> However, what remains to be seen is whether consumers will be willing to spend  the estimated $595 that LoJack charges for the homing devices. The units will  be sold through used and new car dealers, but must be installed by LoJack  technicians.  </P> <P> By successfully wooing police departments, the company has virtually cornered  the market on sales because cruisers will be outfitted with mobile computers  that track only LoJack units.  </P> <P> LoJack representatives and police in Massachusetts, where the system has  operated since 1986, say the technology has allowed them to recover about 96%  of stolen vehicles within 24 hours after thefts are reported. That compares to  about a 40% recovery rate in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In Massachusetts, LoJack has sold more than 35,000 signal units and police have  found more than 900 stolen vehicles by tracking the homing devices, company  officials said. Terry Soley, general manager of LoJack's California operations,  said the company hopes to sell about 20,000 of the devices in the first year of  the Los Angeles County program.  </P> <P> The system also is operating in two south Florida counties and is to be  launched in the next few months in New Jersey, Michigan and Illinois, Soley  said. In California, LoJack wants to expand into San Francisco, Alameda,  Sacramento and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> But Culver City police say they will hold out in Los Angeles County because  they remain unconvinced that the cost of equipping cruisers with mobile  tracking computers is worth the investment at $1,750 apiece.  </P> <P> "We are not at all convinced that these things are tamper-proof. I think we all  know that a seasoned car thief is quickly going to be able to find these  things, and tear them out. Then the thing will beep away and we will be looking  in trash barrels," said Capt. Lars Seterling of the Culver City Police  Department.  </P> <P> Seterling said Culver City officers also were concerned that many car owners  wouldn't discover thefts for hours, during which time thieves might have left  the 5- to 20-mile radius tracking area.  </P> <P> Soley said the system has proven effective elsewhere, and thieves likely will  not find the 7-inch-long transmitters in one of 30 hidden locations where they  will be installed in cars.  </P> <P> Other police admit they are not sure whether the technology will hold up over  time, but say the cost of buying mobile tracking computers is not high enough  to deter them from trying it out.  </P> <P> "We are a little concerned because I understand there are other systems out  there. We don't want to get our cars loaded down if something better comes  along," said Lloyd Wood, Azusa chief of police and president of the Los Angeles  County Police Chiefs Assn. "But LoJack was the first one to come to us."  </P> <P> One competitor, Clifford Electronics Inc. of Chatsworth, filed an antitrust  claim in Los Angeles Federal Court in April, 1989, contending that LoJack  unfairly eliminated competition by relentlessly recruiting police departments.  In January, a judge in Los Angeles dismissed the lawsuit, saying LoJack was not  engaged in a monopoly because other companies were still free to pursue the  manufacture and sales of the technology.  </P> <P> An attorney for Clifford said the company intends to pursue legal action  further.  </P> <P> "Now the only source for those transponders (homing devices) is LoJack, which  sells them for $595," said Maxwell Blecher. "My people (at Clifford) said they  could come into the market for $395 and make a very respectable profit. What  (LoJack) is going to do is rape people on the cost."  </P> <P> Competitors like Clifford Electronics tried early on to join LoJack in the Los  Angeles market.  </P> <P> In 1988, Clifford lobbied heavily against state legislation that would have  established a $1-million LoJack pilot program in Los Angeles. At that time,  Clifford persuaded Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) to add amendments to  encourage other companies to bid for a contract to implement a similar stolen  car recovery system. The bill failed when LoJack stopped pushing for passage,  and the company agreed to provide start-up costs for the system in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In the end, LoJack promised to give the LAPD $1.7 million worth of stationary  computers, transmitters and mobile tracking computers. To win the Sheriff's  Department's support, LoJack donated 150 mobile tracking computers. The CHP got  a donation of 90 of the computers from the company.  </P> <P> In the past year, LoJack officials have methodically lobbied smaller police  forces to join up, arguing that the system would work only if the entire county  is blanketed by coverage.  </P> <P> To each of the smaller departments, LoJack donated one tracking computer  apiece. Most then agreed to buy additional computers. In Torrance, for example,  police plan to purchase nine more tracking computers, and in Santa Monica the  department plans to buy three.  </P> <P> Signing up police departments before selling the system to consumers is a  marketing strategy that LoJack officials hope will work to their advantage.  They argue that LoJack, which researched the technology for 10 years, is at the  forefront of its development.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles, we recognized it's true that people love their cars and they  want to protect them. From a business perspective, it is a wonderful  opportunity for us," Soley said. "If somebody does not like the system, they  don't have to buy it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Cars outfitted with a $595 homing device -- hidden somewhere in the auto's  interior -- send out coded signals detected by police with mobile tracking  computers in their cruisers. When a vehicle is stolen and the owner reports it  to police, the LoJack Corp. that manufactures the system activates the homing  device. Any police officer with a mobile tracking computer within a 5- to  20-mile radius will be able to pick up the signal. The system will not work if  the stolen car is taken beyond that radius.  </P></p>

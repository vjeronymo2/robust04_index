			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> FAA TERRORIST WARNING REPORTED  </P> <P> A warning of possible terrorist action was issued this week to airlines in the  United States by the Federal Aviation Administration, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The Daily News said the warning was contained in a general bulletin from the  FAA that said a radical Palestinian group might be planning an attack.  </P> <P> "The timing, location and the nature of the alleged attack is unknown," the  newspaper quoted the bulletin as saying. It said the information about the  possible attack came from the FBI's New York office.  </P> <P> The warnings go to airlines but are not circulated to the general public, a  policy that drew criticism in the wake of the December bombing of a Pan Am  jetliner that crashed in Scotland, killing 270 people. Such a bulletin had been  circulated before that crash.  </P></p>

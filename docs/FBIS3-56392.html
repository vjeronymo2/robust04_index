Contract Signed to This Effect. Everyone Should be Pleased,  Including Ukraine"]    [Text] An executive contract between Russia and the United  States on deliveries of Russian weapons-grade uranium to the  United States was signed at 1000 yesterday in the secluded  atmosphere of Collegium Hall of the former Ministry of Medium  Machine-Building (now the Ministry of Atomic Energy). Making a  short speech before the signing of the document, Viktor  Mikhaylov, Russian Federation minister of atomic energy, pointed  out that the ceremony was taking place in a historic room: All  decisions on the creation of nuclear weapons in Russia had been  made right there, and foreign visitors were present there for  the first time.    One should think that in citing this fact the minister  wished  once again to emphasize the historic importance of the event.  Indeed, this contract (from the Russian side it was signed by  Albert Shishkin, president of the "Tekhnosnabeksport" foreign  trade company of the Russian Federation Ministry of Atomic  Energy, and on the American side by the director of the U.S.  Enrichment Corporation -- USEC -- William Timbers) signals the  start of real disarmament. In line with its provisions, 500  tonnes of weapons-grade uranium are supposed to be sold to the  United States over 20 years (Russia's aggregate stocks of  weapons-grade uranium are 1,250 tonnes). Thus, more than 20,000  nuclear warheads will be destroyed. During the first five  years, 10 tonnes will be sold each year, and 30 tonnes a year  will be sold during the following years. This schedule is  explained by the fact that neither Russia nor the United States  has the production facilities at the moment for the depletion of  enriched uranium (from 90 to 5 percent). Nonetheless the level  of such technology in Russia proves to be higher than in the  United States.    To implement the contract, the world's largest joint  Russian-  American uranium company is being created. It should be  stressed in this connection that the United States controls 50  percent of the world uranium market today; Russia controls 5 to  6 percent of the market while having the same uranium production  facilities. The contract that was signed means in fact that the  United States is letting Russia use one of the segments of its  market.    Answering a question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent on how it had become possible to resolve within  the framework of the contract the question that proved to be a  stumbling block while the document was in preparation (the U.S.  Government insisted on sharing profits from the sales of uranium  between Russia and Ukraine), Mikhaylov said that there too it  became possible to find a mutually acceptable option. Profit  from the sales of weapons-grade uranium from strategic nuclear  warheads, if any, will be partially returned to Ukraine in the  shape of fuel compacts for its nuclear electric power stations.  As for battlefield nuclear weapons, according to the minister,  experts of Russia and Ukraine are yet to determine whether any  profit is possible there at all. Russia is already spending  millions of dollars on the dismantling and transportation alone  of battlefield nuclear weapons from Ukraine. (Incidentally, the  dismantling and storing of one nuclear warhead in the United  States costs between $30 and $100,000; in Russia the cost is a  tenth of the amount because our personnel are paid less).    Viktor Mikhaylov also stressed that, in his opinion, Ukraine  should be pleased with the signed Russian-American document:  "Unless this problem is solved today, Ukraine itself in a couple  of years would have to pay someone who would undertake to  dismantle its nuclear missiles.    Neither will the United States come out a loser: during the  first year alone of the implementation of the contract, weapons-  grade uranium from Russia will provide fuel for 15 American  nuclear reactors. Energy generated by them would provide  electricity for 10 million homes.    At the same time, despite the substantial sum of the  contract  -- nearly $12 billion -- the Russian Federation Ministry of  Atomic Energy will only be able to pay part of its nuclear  warhead recycling costs out of it.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM DRIVER WOUNDED BY GUNFIRE AFTER LAGUNA HILLS TRAFFIC PURSUIT  </P> <P> An Anaheim man, stopped in Laguna Hills for driving erratically early this  morning, was wounded by gunfire after he allegedly tried to run down several  California Highway Patrol officers, law enforcement officials said.  </P> <P> Capt. Steve Malone, of the CHP's San Juan Capistrano station, said the incident  began when officers tried to stop Mario Michael Wiggins, 29, near El Toro Road.  Officers called for a backup unit when he sped off and chased him to a parking  lot near a residential construction area, investigators said. There, Wiggins  got out and "was acting very bizarre," said Lt. Richard J. Olson, of the Orange  County Sheriff's Department. "He apparently began waving his arms around and  started shouting. Then he jumped back into his car."  </P> <P> Wiggins then sped forward, spun the car around and headed for the officers,  according to their accounts. One of them leaped out of the way and sprained his  ankle, Olson said.  </P> <P> Several of the officers fired their handguns, one of them hitting Wiggins once  in the left arm, Olson said. Wiggins was taken to nearby Saddleback Community  Hospital, but he resisted treatment, Olson said. He was then transferred to the  jail ward of at Western Medical Center in Anaheim.  </P> <P> Olson said it did not appear that Wiggins was armed. Sheriff's deputies are  seeking court approval to search Wiggins' impounded car for a weapon.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "Toward International Control of </F> Earth Satellites"]    [Text] It is time the earth satellites of a military and  intelligence nature are placed under international control. For  it is inconceivable for the big powers, headed by the United  States, to continue violating the national independence and  sovereignty of world nations for decades.    International control means restricting the activity of  these  satellites under an international treaty so that it does not  extend beyond the borders of the states concered.    No doubt, the Third World countries are the main target of  the hostile satellite activity conducted by the major states,  especially the big capitalist powers. Therefore, they must  either find the necessary means to counter the dangers of these  satellites by taking the initiative to call an international  conference to be attended by all states concerned in order to  discuss this issue, or raise the matter with the UN General  Assembly or Security Council, despite the hardships they might  expect from the United States and its Western allies in the  United Nations.    By stressing the danger of the espionage satellites to the  Third World countries, we are not excluding their danger to some  European and Asian states which are allies of the United States.  But this alliance has not protected, and will not protect, the  national independence and sovereignty of those states or their  underground resources; nor will it protect telephone  conversations between government officials, company owners,  board directors, and, in fact, anything in those states which is  considered vital to the United States.    Perhaps, it is important when seriously discussing the  drafting of a treaty or an agreement on earth satellites to take  into consideration the scores of satellites which have been  orbiting the earth for several years carrying out intelligence  and military missions for their states.    These satellites must be destroyed. The data they have  collected so far must be placed at the disposal of the United  Nations through an elected special commission, which would  decide what to do with this data for the sake of protecting  other nations' independence and sovereignty. There must be a  complete ban on the use of outer space for military purposes.  Furthermore, the United Nations should be informed about the  programs of satellites which are used for non- military  purposes. It would be useful if the programs of the United  Nations and its cultural and social agencies, which are actually  based on the UN Charter and not influenced by U.S. foreign  policy, could be transmitted via these satellites on a worldwide  basis in the interest of international peace and security and  the cause of common understanding and friendship among peoples  and nations.    Nobody doubts the hardships and financial problems facing  the  world organization and its various agencies. But launching a  special UN satellite is a more worthwhile cause than spending  money on so-called peace-keeping forces dispatched here and  there under the UN flag, when the country responsible for  starting crises in various parts of the world is the one that  refuses to pay its financial contribution to the budget of the  United Nations and its agencies, but which can be more generous  sometimes when it comes to dirty missions undertaken by its  forces and the forces of other nations in such countries as  Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Angola, and elsewhere.    The Americans and their Western allies are turning the  United  Nations into a murderer and a policeman, and an arsonist and a  fireman at the same time. This is the tragedy of the  organization that was originally established for the sake of  achieving and preserving world peace. It is sinking to its ears  in the quagmire.    While the United States claims to defend international peace  and security, what it does in practice is that it places the  national security of world nations at the mercy of U.S. national  security through these satellites and sophisticated espionage  aircraft, which conduct their operations outside international  control. Of course, all this takes place under the infamous  U.S. theory that considers American interests and individuals as  part of the national security that the U.S. Administraton must  defend by every means, including the use of military force  against any country where American interests or nationals may  have been exposed to danger, despite the lack of a political  motive.    It is strange indeed that nobody inside or outside the Third  World countries has thought about the danger of U.S. and allied  satellites to their national security. And if they have, we  have not heard a single opposition voice to the operations of  these satellites in international organizations. This attitude  has encouraged and is still encouraging the imperialists to  continue to use outer space for spying on other nations and  collecting military and economic data with complete disregard  for the meaning of the national independence and sovereignty of  those nations.</p>

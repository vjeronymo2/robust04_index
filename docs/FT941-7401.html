			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / 'Room for lower German rates' Bundesbank board member Mr Edgar Meister said he saw room for further declines in German money market rates following the central bank's discount rate cut last week. 'We still do not have a normal interest rate structure,' Mr Meister said. Inflation of around 2.5 per cent in the past six months, and expectations that it would stay below 3 per cent provided room for the rate cut.</p>

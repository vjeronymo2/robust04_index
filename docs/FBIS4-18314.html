			<p>BFN     [Text] Britain is to open a new embassy in war-ravaged  Sarajevo, the Foreign Office [FO] announced today. The move  reflected progress made towards a negotiated settlement of the  conflict, said a spokesman. It also underlined the Government's  commitment to humanitarian aid as life returns to normal in the  city after the UN-brokered peace.    Britain first established diplomatic relations with Bosnia  in  April 1992, but the security situation was not thought safe  enough until now to consider opening an embassy.    Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has appointed Robert Barnett  as charge d'affaires at Sarajevo. He will take up his post next  month.    Mr. Barnett will initally work alone at the embassy but will  be supported by British aid officials in the area and diplomats  in Zagreb.    Married with two sons, he was previously assistant head of  the Eastern Adriatic Unit at the FO.</p>

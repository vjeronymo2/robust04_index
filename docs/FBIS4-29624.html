			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [17 June press communique of the Royal Government </F> spokesman's office -- read by announcer]    [Text] In pursuance of the august idea of His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanpouk Varaman of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KOC], a  KOC delegation took part in the roundtable commission's meeting  with the representative of the Khmer Rouge held at the Damnak  Chan pavilion of the royal palace, Phnom Penh, on 15 and 16 June  1994 under the chairmanship of Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong,  high representative of the king, and in the presence of the  samdech supreme patriarch and Samdech Mohakhousananda.    This roundtable commission's meeting was a continuation of  the roundtable meeting held at the Chhanghsu-on royal residence  on 27 and 28 May 1994 in line with the fourth provision of the  joint communique issued by this roundtable meeting which  proceeded under the august chairmanship of His Majesty King  Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the venerated king of the Cambodian  nation.    The presence of the KOC delegation at this latest meeting  was  further irrefutable proof to show that the National Assembly and  the Royal Government, the legal institutions born out of the  elections and the constitution, had the goodwill and most  unshakable determination to find a peaceful solution to the  remaining Cambodian problems with the aim of bringing peace for  the people, because this peace constitutes the key factor for  bringing about happiness and development in the nation in  conformity with the august desire of the venerated king.    During this discussion, we once again voiced our solemn  support for the agenda of the meeting graciously set by His  Majesty the king on 5 June 1994: namely, 1) an unconditional,  immediate, and permanent cease-fire in all of the territory of  the KOC; and 2) the minimal policy program, which was a proposal  of the Khmer Rouge.    The KOC delegation agreed to this cease-fire with a high  sense of responsibility. At the same time, the delegation also  proposed that the cease-fire should begin on 30 June 1994, at  noon, or in the early morning of 30 June 1994. However, it was  most regrettable that the august initiative raised by His  Majesty the king in pleading for an unconditional, immediate,  and permanent cease-fire in all of the territory of the KOC -- a  most necessary and urgent requirement for the Cambodian nation  and people -- was made conditional by the Khmer Rouge, who  wanted to reject it once again despite the earnest pleas made by  the samdech supreme patriarch and Samdech Mohakhousananda for  them to accept this cease-fire. The Khmer Rouge continued to  raise the same unreasonable and unrealistic arguments and  demanded that the participants of the meeting divert their  attention to discussing their proposal instead, which in reality  was an excuse for the Khmer Rouge to carry on their "fighting  while negotiating" strategy to prolong the war.    As a matter of fact, besides refusing to agree to a  cease-fire schedule, the Khmer Rouge also ambiguously talked  about the composition of a cease-fire supervision commission,  using it as a condition to set the cease-fire schedule, which is  completely contrary to the august idea of His Majesty the king  concerning an unconditional, immediate cease-fire.    Moreover, the Khmer Rouge also raised the issue of a  competent technical commission to supervise the cease-fire  without by any means trying to specifically describe this  commission.    Through this meeting with the Khmer Rouge, it could be seen  even more clearly that the Khmer Rouge have no desire whatsoever  to find a solution for ending the remaining Cambodian problems  through peaceful means. The impasse resulting from the  categorical inflexibility of the Khmer Rouge caused the  roundtable commission's meeting to conclude on 16 June 1994, at  noon, without any specific and positive results that could be  used as a basis for us to agree on for the holding of further  meetings and talks with the Khmer Rouge. This will be in line  with the idea of His Majesty the king, who had warned before the  meeting that he would not initiate any more roundtable meetings.    Phnom Penh, 17 June 1994</p>

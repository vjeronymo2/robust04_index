			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Van den Broek joins EC jigsaw THE appointment of Mr Hans van den Broek as the Netherlands EC Commissioner means that one of the missing pieces in the forthcoming Commission reshuffle jigsaw is now on the board. Next Tuesday the 17-strong Commission meets in Brussels to parcel out top jobs ranging from foreign affairs to competition for at least the next two years. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is almost certainly the only person who knows how the pieces will fit into place. In selecting his team, Mr Delors must balance personal egos and the national interests of the Twelve, as well as obey a number of unwritten conventions such as handing over the big ticket agriculture portfolio to a small state. Mr van den Broek's high profile in foreign policy will add weight to the Commission; but it is far from certain whether he can take over the bloated external affairs portfolio held until now by Mr Frans Andriessen, the outgoing Dutch commissioner. There are four strong candidates for this job which makes it likely that it will be split up. Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner now in charge of competition, wants to hive off trade policy and relations with Eastern Europe. France may back his bid because it sees him as over zealous in cracking down on cartels and state aid. Mr Martin Bangemann, Germany's EC senior industry commissioner, also wants to swallow up the Commission's considerable trade responsibilities in an effort to create what EC officials describe as a Japanese-style ministry of trade and industry. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, Portugal's highly regarded former foreign minister, may also expect to take over some areas of foreign policy - possibly responsibility for negotiating EC entry for Austria, Finland, Sweden and probably Norway. If Sir Leon were to surrender competition, a possible replacement is Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner now in charge of transport and temporarily environment. Even Mr van den Broek is not excluded for this heavyweight job. Only Ireland has yet to nominate its commissioner to replace Mr Ray MacSharry, the agriculture commissioner and EC farm trade negotiator. The current betting is that the Irish candidate will take the sensitive social affairs portfolio, with Ms Maire Geoghan-Quinn, transport minister in the outgoing Dublin government, or Mr Barry Desmond, a Labour MEP and former health minister, being tipped for the post.</p>

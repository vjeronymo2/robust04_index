This  molecule is capable of fluorescence and light generation in the  wavelength region _l_=340 - 420 nm with a high quantum  efficiency of fluorescence _g_=0.45-0.93 and low threshold  pumping density in different solvents. It was demonstrated that  the solvent affects the localization of the electron density of  the atoms and fragments of the complex OPO molecule in the  fundamental state. Because of changes in the distribution of the  length of linkages in the cycles of the OPO molecules, when the  hydrogen atom attacks the individual pair of electrons of the  nitrogen atoms, the structure of excited electron singlet  (S[.sup]*[/][.sup]i[/]) and triplet (T[.sub]i[/])  states and transitions, determining the photophysical  characteristics of the complex compounds is changing. Spectral-  fluorescence and generation characteristics of the complex  heteroatomic molecule OPO in different solvents and in a gas  phase were measured and computed. It was also demonstrated that  increasing or decreasing of the pumping density in vapors, or  changing the solvent properties, is related to a dynamic  separation or overlapping of the light generation bands on  transitions. A feasibility is demonstrated that the a priori-  structural modeling method can be used for controlling the  properties of the excited states and junctions.

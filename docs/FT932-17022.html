			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Next continues recovery with Pounds 38.9m NEXT, the fashion retailer which inspired a host of imitators in the early 1980s but ran into problems when it over-expanded, showed it was well on the way to recovery yesterday by more than tripling pre-tax profits. Profits for the year to January 31 rose from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 38.9m and included an exceptional credit of Pounds 2.7m following a review of unused provisions. The shares gained 11p to 172p as the total dividend was raised from 0.75p to 2.5p with a proposed final of 2p. Earnings per share also more than tripled, to 9.93p (3.08p). Turnover increased from Pounds 462m to Pounds 485m. Sales in the high street amounted to Pounds 333m (Pounds 282m) contributing operating profits of Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 6.4m). Turnover at the Next Directory mail order division rose to Pounds 90.8m (Pounds 88.1m) and generated profits of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 4m). Mr David Jones, chief executive, said sales in the retail chain were up 24 per cent in the second half. The 18 per cent rise for the year came from 4 per cent less selling space. On a like-for-like basis, sales showed an increase of 22.5 per cent. The strong performance had continued into the current year, with sales of the spring-summer collection up 12 per cent, on space down 2 per cent. 'I doubt if many other retailers could match that performance,' Mr Jones said. He added that the figures should not be taken as a signal of a general recovery in high street trading. Other encouraging signs were that Club 24, Next's credit management business, reduced its borrowings from Pounds 124m to Pounds 53m. This left the group with net cash in hand of Pounds 12m, compared with borrowings of Pounds 88m the year before. Only two years ago gearing was more than 300 per cent. Mr Jones said the improved performance was due to the closure of less profitable stores, better use of space and displays, higher-quality merchandise, and the refusal to discount except during two-week end-of-season sales. This helped annual sales per sq ft of selling space increase to Pounds 355 - higher than most competitors apart from Marks and Spencer - compared with Pounds 292 in 1991 and Pounds 253 in 1990. Lord Wolfson, chairman, said that figure could improve to Pounds 450 or more as further improvements in its range and customer service increased sales. Most of the group's efforts in the medium-term would go into improving the existing retail and mail order operations, rather than expansion or diversification. The company has now largely completed its store closure programme, leaving it with 305 stores and a total of 937,000 sq ft of selling space.</p>

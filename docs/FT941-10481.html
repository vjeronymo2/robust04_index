			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Amersham invests Pounds 3m in Scitech of Singapore Amersham International is to invest Pounds 3m in Scitech Genetics of Singapore in an effort to develop a kit that will speed up the diagnosis of viral infections such as hepatitis. This is the company's first deal in south-east Asia. Scitech said yesterday that it expected the kit would be available in about 18 months. Amersham insisted the deal did not mark its return to the business of medical diagnostics - it sold its diagnostics activities to Kodak in 1990 for Pounds 84m. Amersham will instead use the expertise developed in Singapore to manufacture a kit for sale to research laboratories for the measurement of DNA in cells. Scitech will be able offer a diagnostics service to hospitals, but is prevented under the agreement with Amersham from selling the kit, said Mr Trevor Nicholls, Amersham's head of life sciences marketing.</p>

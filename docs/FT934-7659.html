			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / French MPs rule against Tapie A FRENCH parliamentary committee yesterday recommended that the national assembly waive the immunity of Mr Bernard Tapie, the embattled businessman and former minister, to answer allegations of fraud, writes David Buchan in Paris. The full assembly is expected to decide next week whether to follow the committee's recommendation and allow Mr Tapie, who won election as a left-wing deputy in the Marseilles area last March, to be investigated for alleged irregularities in campaign finance and in the diversion of corporate funds of a company called Testut to Bernard Tapie Finance SA and to Olympique-Marseille, Mr Tapie's football team. Mr Tapie faces a second request to have his parliamentary immunity lifted over the investigation of alleged bribery of Olympique-Marseille's football opponents. That request will, however, have to be handled by a separate parliamentary inquiry.</p>

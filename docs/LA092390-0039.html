			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LETTERS IN VIEW;  </P> <P> TIMES CHANGE ALL OVER, NOT JUST IN THE CATSKILLS  </P> <P> As an Orthodox Jew, my family and I and quite a few others have for many years  sent our children to the best summer sleep-away camps in the U.S.A. These camps  are located in the Catskills. Most of us visit our children on Visitors Day,  or, as in my case, Visitors Weekend.  </P> <P> We stayed at Davidman's Homowack Lodge.  </P> <P> The hotel, as you reported, provided food (all that one could consume),  entertainment and recreation. The one difference between this hotel and others  in the Catskills is that it is strictly Orthodox and maintains Sabbath  requirements according to Orthodox Jewish standards. Young Orthodox families  from across the country are increasingly going to the Catskills.  </P> <P> After spending the weekend of Aug. 3-5 in the mountains, our family will be  back again next year when our kids go back to camp.  </P> <P> STANLEY TREITEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

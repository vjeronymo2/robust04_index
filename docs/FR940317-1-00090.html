			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Is based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation is valid (28 U.S.C. 2680(a)). Where no negligence on the part of any Government employee is shown, and the only ground for the claim is the contention that the same conduct by a private individual would be tortious, or that the statute or regulation authorizing the project was invalid, the sole question is the existence of the statute or regulation, not its validity. However, a claim should not be denied based solely on this exception without the prior approval of the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a Federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved is abused (28 U.S.C. 2680(a)). A claim should not be denied solely because of this exception without the prior approval of the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Arises out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter (28 U.S.C. 2680(b)). It should be noted that administrative settlement and payment of certain mail claims is authorized under subparts C and F. Further, a limited indemnity may be obtained through other channels for the loss or damage to registered, insured, and C.O.D. mail (39 U.S.C. 5001, et. seq.) (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;61.) The exclusion may not be applicable where State law recognizes a cause of action for invasion of privacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Arises with respect to the assessment or collection of any tax or customs duty, or the detention of any goods or merchandise by any customs or other law-enforcement officer (28 U.S.C. 2680(c)). Adequate remedies are available to anyone aggrieved by the application of the tax or customs laws of the United States (26 U.S.C. 6213), or the claimant may pay the tax and sue in the U.S. Claims Court or the appropriate U.S. District Court for a refund (28 U.S.C. 1491 and 1346(a)(1)). Other remedies are also available for the loss or detention of goods or merchandise; for example, Tucker Act, bailment provisions of the MCA (chap 3), or destruction of evidence for scientific analysis (AR 190&hyph;22, paragraph 3&hyph;8). With respect to the detention of goods by a law enforcement officer, this exception may apply to seizures in connection with an arrest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Is cognizable under the Suits in Admiralty Act (46 U.S.C. 740&hyph;752) or under the Public Vessels Act (46 U.S.C. 781&hyph;790). To be cognizable under this exclusion, the tort must have both a maritime situs and a maritime nexus, otherwise the tort is cognizable under the FTCA. Maritime claims may be considered under The Army Maritime Claims Settlement Act (10 U.S.C. 4801, et. seq.) and subpart H, and they must be settled or suit filed within 2 years of accrual of claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Arises out of an act or omission of any employee of the Government in administering the provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. appendix 1&hyph;31; 28 U.S.C. 2680(e)). That Act provides that the sole remedy of any person claiming money or other property held by the Alien Property Custodian is as provided by that Act. This exception should be broadly construed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Is for damages caused by the imposition or establishment of a quarantine by the United States (28 U.S.C. 2680(f)). Claims for failure to impose a quarantine or delay in enforcing a quarantine come within the discretionary function exclusion discussed in paragraph (b) of this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Arises out of an assault or battery (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Often artful pleading is employed to create a cause of action in negligence, such as alleging negligent supervision; such does not create a separate cause of action as the exception bars a claim arising out of an assault and battery even though there may have been negligent supervision. Under the 1974 amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), the activities of law enforcement officers that result in an assault or battery are removed from this exception and can create a cause of action. Such activities have accounted for most of the past claims and litigation involving the assault and battery exception.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Therefore, any claim alleging use of threatening or deadly force, especially by a law enforcement officer, must be thoroughly investigated to determine whether the nature, amount, and use of such force was justified under the circumstances. (See paragraph (i) of this section for definition of investigative or law enforcement officer). Also, section 2680(h) does not apply to a claim arising out of performance of medical, dental or related health care functions (10 U.S.C. 1089(e)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Arises out of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution or abuse of process (28 U.S.C. 2680(h)). This exception has universal applicability to all acts of false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process when committed by an employee of the United States in the scope of employment. However, by amendment to 28 U.S.C. 2680(h), this exception is not applicable on or after 16 March 1974 to such actions when committed by an investigative or law enforcement officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, seize evidence, or make arrests for violations of Federal law (88 Stat. 50). Such employees are considered to include military police, but not post exchange detectives. Whether or not a Federal law enforcement officer is involved, the defense of probable cause, reasonableness, and good faith are available, provided the arrest is otherwise lawful under State law. DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;8c, refers to certain claims based on unjust convictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

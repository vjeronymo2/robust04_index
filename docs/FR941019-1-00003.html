			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Gary M. Holahan, Director, Division  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Systems Safety and Analysis, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, U.S. Nuclear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001, Telephone: (301) 504&hyph;2884.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over the past several years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become increasingly concerned about the safety of operations during the shutdown of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nuclear power reactors. The loss of decay heat removal (DHR) during shutdown and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refueling has been a continuing problem. In 1980, DHR was lost at the Davis-Besse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant when one residual heat removal (RHR) pump failed and the second pump was out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of service. After reviewing the Davis-Besse event and studying the operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that existed at the time of the event, the NRC issued Bulletin 80&hyph;42 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generic Letter (GL) 80&hyph;43 calling for new technical specifications to ensure that one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RHR system is operating and a second is available (i.e., operable) for most shutdown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions. The Diablo Canyon event of April 10, 1987, highlighted the fact that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> midloop operation was a particularly sensitive condition with respect to operability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residual heat removal pumps. In this event, the reactor coolant system was overdrained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during midloop operation. The resulting low water level in the reactor vessel caused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vortexing and air entrainment and loss of both residual heat removal pumps. After  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewing the event, the staff issued GL 88&hyph;17, recommending that licensees address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous generic deficiencies to improve the reliability of the DHR capability. More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recently, the incident investigation team's report on the loss of AC power at the Vogtle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant (NUREG&hyph;1410) emphasized the need for risk management of shutdown operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, discussions with foreign regulatory organizations (i.e., French and Swedish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities) about their evaluations regarding shutdown risk have reinforced previous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC staff findings that the core-damage probability (CDP) for shutdown operation can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be a fairly substantial fraction of the total CDP. Because of these concerns regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational safety during shutdown, the NRC conducted a careful, detailed evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety during shutdown and low-power operations which is documented in NUREG&hyph;1449.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Objective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff's comprehensive evaluation of shutdown and low-power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations, documented in NUREG&hyph;1449, included observations and inspections at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of plants, analysis of operating experience, deterministic safety analysis, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insights from probabilistic risk assessments. It was observed that shutdown risks have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been reduced at many plants through improvements to outage programs. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements have been unevenly and inconsistently applied across the industry. From  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this evaluation, the NRC has concluded that public health and safety have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately protected during the period that plants have been in shutdown and low power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions; but that substantial safety improvements are possible and NRC requirements are warranted for the following reasons:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A regulatory requirement would set minimum standards for all plants and would ensure that safety improvements already made by industry will be applied consistently throughout the industry and will not be eroded in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A regulatory requirement would further reduce risk by improving safety in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas of fire protection for all plants and midloop operation for PWRs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Significant precursor events involving loss of DHR capability continue to occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> despite efforts to resolve the problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Some controls, including regulatory controls, have been significantly lacking and have in the past allowed plants to enter circumstances that would likely challenge safety functions with minimal mitigation equipment available and containment integrity not established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

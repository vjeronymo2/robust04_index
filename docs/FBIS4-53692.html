			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] In the upper house Budget Committee session today,  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata explained the coalition's uniform  definition of the expression Fuhenteki Anzen Hosho [Universal  Security] -- the expression used in describing Japan's concept  of security in the coalition parties' policy agreements. Hata  said the coalition's uniform view is that this expression refers  only to the general framework of peace and security provided by  the United Nations.    The collective security in the UN Charter means a  cooperative  act by the international community to restore peace if peace is  threatened or an act of aggression takes place. The charter  also talks about possible specific actions, including military  operations. But Prime Minister Hata said the concept of  universal security refers to the general framework accepted by  the international community on maintaining peace and security  under the United Nations. He said this term is different from  collective security, but did not clarify whether this term has a  military connotation.    The coalition partners have been said to have different  views  on the question of whether the term [universal security]  included the possibility of military action. Prime Minister  Hata had earlier told the lower house Budget Committee that the  words -- universal security and collective security -- have  roughly the same meaning.    Today's announcement that the two terms do have different  meanings amounts to an amendment to Hata's earlier statement.  Observers said this is an attempt by the coalition partners to  avoid giving the impression that since the two terms are said to  be the same thing, the Japanese Government may be willing to  take part in UN military operations.</p>

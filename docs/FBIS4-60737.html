			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The commentaries and analyses of AL-BA'TH, the only  paper published today because AL-THAWRAH and TISHRIN are on  holiday, stress the need to bring international pressure to bear  on Israel by refraining from supporting it until it abandons its  aggressive inclination and complies with the will of the  international community and its resolutions to achieve a just  and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.    Under the headline "Israel Commits Aggression, Receives  Support," AL-BA'TH writes: Israel seeks deliberately to  reshuffle cards whenever it feels the pressure of international  appeals for peace to guarantee Middle East security.    In line with the strategy of world Zionism, the Israeli  leadership creates tension in the region to form a kind of  pressure on the countries that support Israel and Zionist  objectives.    In this regard, the paper notes the ongoing Israeli  aggression against Lebanon. If aggression is one form of  tension, then the abduction of people from their homes is an act  of piracy, a crime, and a new obstacle to the peace process that  was launched in Madrid.    AL-BA'TH says that when Israel receives a quarter of all  U.S.  aid to the world, then it will continue to have a tendency  toward aggression and crime. When Europe lifts all forms of  arms embargo on Israel and maintains this embargo against the  Arabs, Israel receives direct support for its aggressive policy.    The paper adds that Israel, which has challenged the United  Nations for almost half a century, is once again challenging  anything that could check its aggressive tendency.    When Israel threatens those with whom it has signed  agreements, it confirms that it does not want peace, not even in  its very weakest forms, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    AL-BA'TH concludes: Israel is committing aggression and yet  receiving support and backing. It claims that it is willing to  make peace, but at the expense of the Arabs, their territory and  dignity, and at the expense of international law, which it is  still defying and rejecting.</p>

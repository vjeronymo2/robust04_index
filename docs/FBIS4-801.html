			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Rwandan Government has  started an argument with the Belgian Government. In a letter  addressed to his Belgian counterpart, Willy Claes, the Rwandan  foreign minister states that elements of the Belgian military  contingent are actively taking part in the Rwanda Patriotic  Front offensive, using the equipment which was supposedly  destined for the evacuation of Belgian nationals. The Rwandan  foreign minister also writes that his government has information  at its disposal which proves that the RPF is receiving similar  support from the Belgian Blue Helmets in UNAMIR [United Nations  Assistance Mission in Rwanda].    The Rwandan foreign minister also raised the issue of the  stringently anti-Belgian broadcasts of RTLM -- Radio Mille  Collines. The Rwandan minister writes that the burgeoning of the  democratic process in Rwanda was accompanied by the birth of  private media organizations, which by definition are beyond the  government's control. This reality is as much a fact in Rwanda  as it is in Belgium, he writes, adding that the Belgian  Government is quite free to intervene on Radio des Mille  Collines, either by issuing denials or by making use of its  right of reply, end quote.</p>

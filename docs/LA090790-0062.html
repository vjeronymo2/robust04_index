			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> NEW U.S. ATTORNEY BAIRD IS SWORN IN  </P> <P> Before judges, prosecutors and lawyers assembled in a courtroom of the federal  courthouse in Los Angeles, the new U.S. attorney for the Central District of  California, Lourdes G. Baird, was officially sworn into office on Thursday.  Baird, 55, a native of Ecuador and a former Los Angeles County Superior Court  judge, was nominated by President Bush last May to replace U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Robert C. Bonner. Taking into account Baird's Latino background and the fact  that Southern California is an ethnic melting pot with a large Latino  population, her former law partner, Molly Munger, said that "Lourdes is  symbolic of Los Angeles." Baird, who raised a family before pursuing a legal  career, gave credit to other women in her profession. "I clearly got here  hanging on to the skirts of my predecessors," she said.  </P></p>

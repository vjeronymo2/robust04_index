			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] I am Slota the terrible! I am the new chairman  of the Slovak National Party [SNS]! This is how the SNS  chairman welcomed journalists at the party's regular news  conference today. [passage omitted] After the news conference,  Jan Slota spoke to our correspondent Lydia Mrazova. [passage  omitted]    [Begin recording] [Mrazova] Mr. Chairman, in an interview  for  the SLOVENSKY NAROD newspaper, you said that your members and  sympathizers were aware of the danger threatening the Slovak  Republic. "Danger" is a very serious term that can hide  anything. What, then, is your interpretation of danger in  current politics?    [Slota] I understand the term "danger" as two distinct  dangers. On the one hand, as the communist danger, and, on the  other, as a danger from the south. As regards the former, I  wish to stress that it would be very dangerous if Slovaks  supported left-wing parties because, in 1948, this danger was  also underestimated. Perhaps not so much in Slovakia, but, all  the same, eventually communism was planted in Slovakia, too, and  we know very well what sort of time followed, the 1950's and all  that. So the Slovaks should not forget the past.    As regards the latter, the south, well, anyone who does not  wish to see will not see. But we, SNS members, really do see  how Slovaks in the south of Slovakia, the very people whose  state and territory this is, find themselves in a position of an  ethnic minority. Slovaks are afraid and migrate to the north.  In a word, they are afraid to assert themselves as Slovaks.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

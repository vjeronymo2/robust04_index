			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRELAND HAS LITTLE TO LOSE AGAINST ITALY  </P> <P> A nun from Naples noticed athletic young men in green and white sweat suits  waiting to greet Pope John Paul II at his general audience at the Vatican on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Ours?" she asked with the paternalism of Italy's 57 million soccer coaches.  </P> <P> "Theirs," a friend replied. "Irish."  </P> <P> "Wha . . . " the nun began, but her indignation died aborning. "It doesn't  matter," she said, smiling. "They'll still lose."  </P> <P> Good coaching by former English star, Jack Charlton, now an honorary Irishman,  has carried the Irish farther than they had any right to expect in Italia '90.  The luck of the Irish has meant advancing to the quarterfinals without winning  a game, except for a penalty shootout against Romania after two overtimes had  failed to break a scoreless tie.  </P> <P> Tonight, it will take more than luck and a papal blessing to get Ireland past  Italy in the Olympic Stadium here that is Europe's raucous 20th-Century answer  to the Colosseum. The winner plays Argentina or Yugoslavia in the semifinals.  </P> <P> The Italians have won all four of their Cup matches, and have done it without  yielding a goal.  </P> <P> Along the way, they have found a national hero of their own: chunky, dynamic  Salvatore Schillaci, called "Toto," who scores goals with intensity and pounces  on opponents' mistakes. A banner in the streets of the Palermo suburb where he  was reared reads: "Dio perdona, Schillaci no." God forgives, Schillaci doesn't.  </P> <P> A Sicilian who labored long and anonymously in the vineyards of provincial  Italian soccer, Schillaci is now public property. Everything, from the mewling  of his newborn daughter to the bagginess of his pants, is scrutinized and  weighed for significance. In a country historically split between a rich,  educated north and a poor, unlettered south, the aw-shucks Sicilian has united  Italy in a way politics never could.  </P> <P> Schillaci, 26, will team with his Juventus teammate Roberto Baggio, the world's  highest-paid soccer player, at the spearhead of Italy's attack tonight.  Versatile Roberto Donadoni returns to the midfield to replace twice  yellow-carded Nicola Berti in the only change in the Italian lineup.  </P> <P> Franco Baresi, a sweeper who has been ranked as the best in the world for the  last three years, anchors the Italian defense in front of goalkeeper Walter  Zenga, who has not allowed a goal in his last 802 minutes.  </P> <P> Ireland, the oldest team in the tournament with an average age of 29, seemingly  is overmatched. Most of its players are from the English first division, having  discovered their Irish roots under Charlton's genealogical guidance.  </P> <P> Patrick Bonner, who sank Romania by turning away a sudden-death penalty kick,  is stubborn in the net. Tony Cascarino, whom Charlton calls the "Ice Cream Man"  because of his Italian roots, will be most closely watched on attack. But the  Irish, with only two goals in regulation time, are among the weakest scoring  teams in the tournament.  </P> <P> They also play some of the least attractive soccer, emerging from a defensive  shell into an always-in-the-air, kick-and-run-down-the-sidelines game that  Italian commentators describe as "arid" and "Garabaldian" because of its  guerrilla flavor.  </P> <P> "It's the only game we know how to play," Charlton said at a news conference.  "Ours is an old, out-of-date game."  </P> <P> He blamed the lack of finesse on England's having been banned from club  competition in Europe after hooligan violence in Belgium in 1985 had claimed  the lives of 39 fans, most of them Italian.  </P> <P> "Being banished has been a terrible blow for our young players," he said. "Our  progress is stopped because we can't play against other types of soccer. Ours  is not splendid isolation. It's just isolation."  </P> <P> Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini has warned his players against overconfidence for  a game that will draw about 10,000 Irish fans, among them Prime Minister  Charles Haughey, to the giant stadium.  </P> <P> Italy's soccer public, from cabinet ministers to the Communist opponents to  partisan nuns and the officially neutral Pope, demands nothing less than a  victory tonight. Having come so far with so relatively little, the Irish can go  home with their heads high, win or lose.  </P> <P> "One of the advantages Ireland has is that it will go into the game free of  worries, knowing that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain," noted  Aldo Serena, a reserve striker who scored Italy's last goal against Uruguay in  the second-round qualifier Monday night.  </P></p>

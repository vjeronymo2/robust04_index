			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Higher half year results for the GAP The Gap, one of the most respected specialty retailers in US, yesterday reported a 10.2 per cent improvement in second-quarter profits, to Dollars 37.7m after tax. The rise is scored on sales up from Dollars 523.1m to Dollars 614.1m, with the San Francisco-based company's same-store sales improved by about 5 per cent. This is a slower rate of growth than in the second quarter of 1991, when same-store sales increased by 11 per cent. However, given the 'difficult economic climate', The Gap's chairman, Mr Donald Fisher expressed satisfaction at the figures. The second-quarter earnings total takes profits after tax for the first six months of 1992, to August 1, to Dollars 83m, compared with Dollars 75.1m a year earlier. Sales were Dollars 1.2bn, against Dollars 1.01bn last time.</p>

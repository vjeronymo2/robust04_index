			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Banesto agrees to sell Portuguese bank holding Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank, agreed yesterday to sell its 50 per cent holding in Banco Totta e Acores, Portugal's third largest bank, for Es153bn (Dollars 944.3m). The buyer is Mr Antonio Champalimaud, a 76-year-old Portuguese entrepreneur who has been steadily buying back the industrial and financial empire wrested from his family after Portugal's left-wing revolution in 1974. BTA's return to Portuguese control marks a political victory for the Lisbon government, which has pressed hard for the reduction of Banesto's stake to 25 per cent - the legal limit set for foreign holdings under the terms of BTA's privatisation, begun in 1989. The deal is also a coup for Mr Champalimaud, who remade his fortune in Brazil after most of his assets, representing almost two-thirds of Portugal's industrial capacity, were nationalised. Buying BTA will give him control of Portugal's largest privately-owned banking group, following his requisition of Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor in November. He is already Portugal's richest individual, with an estimated personal net worth of Es170bn. Banco Santander, which acquired control of Banesto in April to become Spain's largest banking group, described the sale of BTA as a rational business decision. Lisbon bankers said resolving the dispute with the Portuguese government would facilitate Santander's operations in the Iberian market over the long term. Banesto is to sell both the 25 per cent of BTA it owns directly and the 25 per cent it controls indirectly through two Portuguese lawyers. A six-month parliamentary hearing into the legality of the indirect stake proved inconclusive. However, Banesto's sidestepping of Portuguese law has been acutely embarrassing for the government. The sale has to be approved by the Portuguese authorities.</p>

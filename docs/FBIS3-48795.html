During a party held  in Okayama city on 16 January, Eda told reporters, "I will form  a new party within the coalition immediately after the Diet's  approval of the political reform bills."    Eda then noted that the new party will be formed by liberals  and that the party will prepare for the next general election in  cooperation with the conservative parties in the coalition. He  said: "The USDP will be dissolved when I form a new party with  grass-roots democrats in the coalition. However, the new party  will contest the next general election in cooperation with the  other coalition members (including the conservative parties)."</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> German artist Ole Jurgen Fischer creates energetic abstract oil paintings  crammed with patterns and shapes that hint at things we are familiar with.  Formidable scale, low luminosity colors and helter-skelter imagery strewn  across the canvases then obliterated with quick marks and broad swatches of  paint heighten the dense, mysterious tone. Burnished browns, blues and grays  ape the look of wood grain and form floating bits of picture frames buried in  layers of calligraphic gestures that look vaguely phallic.  </P> <P> Just when you think the imagery is moving toward some thematic resolution,  Fischer breaks up your train of thought and visual continuity by overlaying  random X's and wild primitive patterning that makes you think of aboriginal  body paint. Working in a long tradition of expressive abstraction, Fischer is  to be credited for making fresh, eccentric marks. Though he is German and spent  years in the United States printing at Tamarind with the likes of Robert  Motherwell, his works don't convey the personal Angst of European or American  Expressionism. Instead the paintings use visual language to establish and  sustain the same tension we feel in a play by Samuel Beckett, where the only  relief comes from acknowledging the absence of conclusions. (Jan Turner  Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to July 29.) MARLENA DONOHUE  </P></p>

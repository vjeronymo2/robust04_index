			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 8 -- The documents handed to President  Lech Walesa by Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his  official Polish visit in August 1993 do not contain files of the  Committee of State Security (KGB) on the Solidarity trade union  movement leaders, the presidential press office has told the  Polish Press Agency (PAP). This information is connected with  the recently-published book of Boris Yeltsin suggesting that he  had given Walesa the KGB files. Last month, President Walesa  told the "Wiadomosci" main TV news bulletin that the suggestions  included in the book are a misunderstanding.    In August 1993, Yeltsin gave Walesa the copies of the  archival documentation of the so-called Suslov commission on the  introduction of martial law in Poland in 1981. In 1993, the  eight documents were published in Poland in the book "The  Documents -- The Suslov File."    The presidential press office also released the text of a  conversation between Krakow's radio station "RMF" Moscow  correspondent Waldemar Gontarski with press spokesman of the  Russian state committee for Russia's archives Nikolay Berezovski.    The latter was asked whether Walesa had published all Suslov  files and whether there was any evidence against the Polish  president. Berezowski is quoted as telling Gontarski "why don't  you believe your president, after all President Boris Yeltsin  handed over the file to Lech Walesa in the presence of a great  number of journalists."    "As an official representative of the committee for the  Russian Federation's archives I have grounds to state that  President Lech Walesa tells the truth when he says that (Walesa)  has published the complete Suslov file."</p>

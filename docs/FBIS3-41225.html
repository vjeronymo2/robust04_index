			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Quito--The family of drug money launderers arrested  last week by Interpol agents in Operation "Azteca" handled  considerable sums of money--over 5 billion sucres--according to  preliminary calculations by the National Police.    The police report that the members of this organization of  alleged money launderers had lived in Quito since 1987, so it is  assumed that in the last seven years they have conducted a  number of illicit money laundering activities, whose extent will  be determined as the investigations progress.    In addition to the weapons and communications equipment  confiscated by the police, a number of items and real estate  properties were seized, including expensive jewelry collections  valued at about $500,000 (approximately 1 billion sucres).  <H5>  Seizures </H5>   Police spokespersons reported yesterday that to date 90  percent of the money launderers' assets have been confiscated.  These items include the house at No. 258 Calle Hidalgo de Pinto  y De la Alcabalas in the residential area of El Bosque which,  the police say, with all its contents, could be worth more than  $700,000 (over 1.4 billion sucres).    The Montenegro Freire family lived in this three-story house  with a penthouse, and from here they ran their illegal  businesses, using as a cover the luxury automobile dealership  located at Avenida Amazonas and Santa Maria.    In this house the police found a collection of 28 paintings  by a variety of artists, whose commercial value has not been  determined; it will, however, be several billion sucres. The  other assets, two apartments in exclusive Quito neighborhoods,  are valued at over 1 billion sucres.  <H5>  Bank Accounts </H5>   According to the police, the persons arrested had numerous  accounts in various banks in Ecuador. Huge sums in both foreign  and national currency have been deposited in the last two years.    The investigations are continuing in order to determine the  precise amount of money the Montenegro Freire family had.    The police have said that details on the group's financial  movements will be released in the next few hours. Only the 8  million sucres seized in the initial raid have now been  reported. This amount was found in their residence.  <H5>  Vehicles </H5>   So far 10 vehicles of different makes and models have been  seized, as well as three brand new motorcycles. The automobiles  included: a dark red BMW with no license plates valued at 260  million sucres; a red BMW with license plates PLH-058, valued at  100 million sucres; a black Mercedes-Benz with license plates  PLH-169, valued at 253 million sucres.    The other vehicles were: a Chevy van with license plates  OBZ-014, valued at 140 million sucres; another Chevy van with  license plates GCN-284 (same price as the first); a Chevrolet  Swift, license plates IBL-704; a Chevrolet Vitara jeep, license  plates PLT-922; a Lancia PKG-188; a Suzuki Forsa, license plates  PHL-107; and another Suzuki Forsa, with plates PHL-706.    There were also three motorcycles valued at 51 million  sucres: a Yamaha, a Honda, and a Suzuki.</p>

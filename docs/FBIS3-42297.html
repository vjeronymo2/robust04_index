			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Eytan Rabin and Amira </F> Hess]    [Text] Defense establishment and IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] elements are concerned about the emerging cooperation  between several Fatah Hawks squads, which have rebelled against  the local Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip, and Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] elements.    A report submitted by security elements indicates that Fatah  Hawks squads were in touch with Hamas recently about possible  cooperation, but no agreement was signed.    So far, Hamas has merely provided moral support to the  insurgent Fatah Hawks squads, but it is believed that the two  sides will initiate joint operations at a later stage.    The security elements' report states that 51 Fatah fugitives  and activists have set up several squads and rebelled against  the organization. The activists and the fugitives, including  some who participated in attacks on Israelis, have acquired  increasing power which rests mainly on support from accomplices.    The report further indicates that the PLO-Tunis leaders have  lost control over the Fatah Hawks squads. Even more serious,  according to the report, is the fact that the squads have  rebelled against the young local leadership of the Gaza Strip  Fatah organization.    It is believed that the local Fatah leadership in the Strip,  headed by Sami Abu-Samahdanah, 'Iyad al-Ashqar, Dhiyab al-Lawh,  and Sufiyan Abu-Zayida, is also unable to control the splinter  squads.    The security report asserts that several elements within the  PLO leadership in the Strip, including fugitives, have rejected  the authority of Fatah because of its agreement to ban attacks  following the signing of the declaration of principles on 13  September.    The report says that Fatah members who have rejected the  organization's authority are still carrying out attacks, and in  recent weeks, they have been involved in attacks on IDF and  security troops. It has been further learned that the local  leadership is also worried about the emerging cooperation.    In view of the intensifying Fatah Hawks activities, the  Jordanian branch of Hamas has issued an open statement  encouraging the squads' work and even urging their expansion.    The defense establishment has decided to continue the  manhunt  for these fugitives despite their affiliation with Fatah and  despite the agreement that Fatah members would no longer be  classified as fugitives.    "The PLO leadership in Tunis, as well as the local  leadership, realize that the IDF will continue hunting the  fugitives, even if they continue to protest against this," a  security figure has stated.    The report also refers to the local leadership's fear of a  wave of purges liable to be launched because of the discord --  which has not yet developed into a physical confrontation --  between peace agreement supporters and those opponents who have  left the organization.    In a leaflet disseminated yesterday in Gaza, the Fatah Hawks  claim responsibility for the assassination of three  collaborators over the past two weeks. A photocopy of the  "license to carry arms and ammunition" belonging to one of the  victims was attached to the leaflet.    The three dead men are Salah 'Ashur from Dayr al-Balah and  Yusuf al-Salibi from Gaza, whose bodies were discovered last  Monday, and Muhammad Shihadah, alias al-Qaqam, from Jabalyah,  murdered 12 days ago.    The leaflet contends that activities against collaborators  are coordinated between the leadership and the Hawks, although  it implies a controversy over this matter between the Fatah  "military branch" and the civilian leadership, which has  reservations about the executions because of their detrimental  impact on society. In the leaflet, the Hawks pledge to carry  out every order of the Yasir 'Arafat-headed leadership, adding  at the same time: "We announce that we will punish every  traitor and collaborator."    The leaflet announces that the Hawks have interrogated  'Ashur, "a collaborator since the 1970's and one of the most  dangerous," warning other collaborators that 'Ashur divulged  their names during his interrogation and that "the Fatah bullets  are not far from them. We will soon meet."    The Hawks leaflet further claims that Shihadah was "a member  of the undercover units."</p>

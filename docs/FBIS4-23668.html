			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jacques Pinto] </F>   [Excerpts] Lagos, 13 Jun (AFP) -- Nigeria's pro-democracy  movement failed Monday [13 June] to spark a civil disobedience  campaign here as police stepped up a manhunt for the businessman  who has declared himself the country's elected president.  Business was as usual in the economic capital Lagos, where the  National Democratic Campaign (NADECO) backing millionaire tycoon  Moshood Abiola against the military junta had called for a week  of peaceful protest from Monday. [passage omitted]    Short demonstrations took place in the northern Palmgrove  and  Iyana Ipaja suburbs of Lagos, a city of some six million  inhabitants, an AFP correspondent reported. Riot police rapidly  intervened against tyre-burning protestors in one of the  incidents.    Abiola planned Monday to hold a "series of meeting with  friends and political associates," one source close to the  self-proclaimed president said. The source did disclose where  the talks would be held and who would attend. If caught, Abiola  faces treason charges. [passage omitted]    A score of armed police and an armoured vehicle on Monday  stood guard at one end of the Ibrahim Babangida bridge, linking  parts of Lagos built on islands in the lagoon with the mainland.    Reporting Abiola's formation of a parallel government more  than 24 hours after the event, the daily THE NEWS in a special  edition on Monday devoted its whole front page to a picture of  the businessman brandishing his fist in triumph, with the title  "President Abiola". Other newspapers, warned by the closure by  police Saturday of Abiola's Concord group of publications, used  foreign news agency dispatches reporting the event. [passage  omitted]</p>

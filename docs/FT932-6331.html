			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan's banks count the cost of bad loans - The earnings data which understate the scale of the burden WHEN Japan's 11 leading commercial banks yesterday announced their combined non-performing loans totalled Y8,435bn (Dollars 78bn), they gave an indication of the problems confronting them, but collectively understated the scale of the bad loan burden. In encouraging the banks to itemise their bad loans, the finance ministry hopes to inspire public confidence in the banking system, but the very narrow definition of what constitutes such a loan itself inspires concern about how deep the cracks run. The figure does not include 'restructured' loans, those on which interest rates have been reduced to almost zero with the aim of supporting an ailing company. Nor does the figure include the mounting pile of bad loans at affiliates for which the parent bank will be ultimately responsible. But the announcements, and the average 70 per cent increase in loan loss reserves do reflect the confidence of the banking industry that property prices will rise again, and the burden will be alleviated without the drama of red ink on the profit statement. The banks wrote off a total of Y172.8bn, an increase of 478 per cent on a year earlier, and announced losses of Y153.8bn on sales to the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, the banks' self-help loan buying organisation set up in January 1993. The figures are impressive when compared to the past modest write-offs, but not in comparison to the non-performing loan total, estimated to be somewhere between Y20,000bn and Y30,000bn. The earnings announcements yesterday, if nothing else, indicated the willingness of Japanese financial authorities to give banks the necessary time to nurse their problem loans, although a restrictive definition of bad loans by the National Tax Agency provides no incentive for them to write them off. There are calls for change. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan governor, recently urged institutions to 'escape from the conventional management stance of doing the same as its competitors'. However, by not taking a larger hit yesterday, the banks showed they are still moving in convoy. The industry wants to keep in step, believing that if one bank announced a loss or if the distinction between the strong and weak became too obvious, public confidence in the more vulnerable institutions would be undermined. As one bank said yesterday: 'This is not the US and we are definitely not going to report losses.' Banks were able to increase loan loss provisions because of higher business profits, but the favourable spreads created by the fall in interest rates during the year are evaporating and the banks will have to work harder to increase profits this year. There is also the possibility of another fall in stock prices, which would create appraisal losses on their securities holdings. Ms Alicia Ogawa, an analyst at US investment bank Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, said loan margins were beginning to narrow, but the banks still had capacity to absorb loan losses. She also suggested the improvement in capital adequacy ratios over the year should enable them to increase lending, if demand from corporate Japan recovers. Sumitomo Bank, which took the largest hit during the year because of links to Itoman, the dissolved trading house, said its fresh loan loss reserves are a 'forward thinking voluntary transfer'. It wrote off Y104.3bn and made provisions of Y97.8bn. Sumitomo explained the liberalisation of interest rates, stagnation of the domestic economy, and a delayed recovery in property prices would affect earnings this year, though it still forecast a doubling of pre-tax profit and a tripling of net profit. The 11 banks generally profited from their dealings in the bond market, which produced an Y18.6bn profit for Sumitomo, an increase of almost 60 per cent on the previous year. Fuji Bank was second on the bond earnings ladder with Y17.7bn, while Sanwa Bank earned Y17.4bn. While the banks were unruffled yesterday in delivering the earnings reports, a sign of official concern at the health of the banking system came earlier this week with the announcement of the liquidations of a financially-troubled credit association, Kamaishi Shinkin Bank, caught out by recession and loose lending. The government was apparently unable to find one institution willing to take over all of Kamaishi's assets, so it will be divided up among several banks in northern Japan. And, for the first time in Japan, funds from the Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures individual deposits for up to Y10m, will be used in a liquidation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE COMMERCIAL BANKS' EARNINGS for year to March 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Operating profit       Net profit    BIS ratio                      Ybn          %      Ybn        %           %                              change            change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DKB                237.3        9.6     53.0    -26.4        9.36 Sakura             271.3       40.4     45.3    -49.6        8.96 Sumitomo           341.5       14.0     14.0    -87.2        9.37 Fuji               313.4       40.7     31.0      2.7        9.26 Mitsubishi         336.4       58.4     47.0    -44.2        9.12 Sanwa              370.2       36.0     67.2    -34.3        9.43 Tokai              186.5       96.1     20.8      7.9        8.97 Asahi              146.3       10.8     21.0    -44.7        9.22 Daiwa               71.8        6.0     16.8    -47.5        9.37 Hokk.

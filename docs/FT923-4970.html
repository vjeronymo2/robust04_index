			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kiwi fruit on menu for starving NZ sheep STARVING SHEEP and lambs on the South Island's Canterbury Plains have something new on the menu: kiwi fruit. The sheep are the survivors of freak weekend blizzards, the worst for 50 years, which blanketed much of the plains with metres of snow, and is only now starting to thaw. Kiwi fruit farmers in the North Island are sending 11,000 tonnes of produce that is not considered good enough for export to the South Island as extra feed for the sheep. The farmers have been told that the kiwi fruit will be good for the survivors, as it contains high levels of sugar to help rebuild their strength. 'The sheep enjoy kiwi fruit, but farmers will have to be careful to spread them around their fields. Too many kiwi fruit at once could be harmful for a sheep,' a government farm advisory officer said. Hundreds of railway wagons and trucks are taking hay and silage to the South Island farmers, many of whom face financial ruin because of the blizzards that struck while the sheep were lambing. A Federated Farmers' official said yesterday that despite the shipments of hay, silage and kiwi fruit, many of the remaining stock were starving, and more was needed. Most South Island farmers rely on sheep for their livelihood; their wool and meat are among New Zealand's major exports. Farmers' losses from the storms in Canterbury, the worst for 50 years, have been estimated at Dollars NZ60m (Pounds 16m). In the neighbouring provinces of Otago and Southland, which missed the worst of the snowstorms, farmers also face losses put at NZDollars 50m. Weeks of cold, wet weather have turned the region's normally lush pastures into mud, and low temperatures have stunted grass growth. The huge lamb losses are causing serious concerns at the effect on the export trade to Britain over the next two seasons as it is expected many farmers will hold back stock in an effort to rebuild their flocks. There is also concern that South Island meat processing companies will bid up prices for stock to keep their factories operating. Fierce competition among processing companies for sheep last season pushed prices so high that companies were reported to be making a loss on the stock they purchased.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHN TOWER'S REJECTION BY THE SENATE  </P> <P> As the sun sets on the political ambitions of Tower, I take pen in hand to  express my appreciation to our Senate and its members. Although at first glance  it appears that Towers's defeat was solely the product of partisan politics, a  closer examination of the facts reveals that Tower simply lacked the required  moral rectitude. Why else would Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) vote against him?  </P> <P> KURT T. KOHLER  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zou Jiahua, member of the Political Bureau of the  CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council,  came to Jilin Province to inspect work from 2 to 6 April. He  pointed out that in doing economic work currently, we should  keep the overall interests in view, implement central principles  and policies in line with specific local conditions, focus on  ending the deficits and increasing the profits of state-owned  enterprises to promote their reform and development, further  consolidate the position of agriculture as the foundation, and  facilitate coordinated and healthy development in industrial and  agricultural production.    During his inspection tour in Jilin, Comrade Zou Jiahua  heard  reports by responsible comrades of Jilin Province and,  accompanied by He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party  committee, and Gao Yan, provincial governor, went to Changchun,  Jilin, and Liaoyuan to inspect the No. 1 Motor Vehicle Group  Company, the Jilin Chemical Industrial Company, Liaoyuan Coal  Mining Administration, and other large- and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises and several enterprises that had  suspended production totally or partially. He also visited  peasant households to learn about peasants' lives and their  preparation for spring farming.    After hearing a report by a responsible comrade of the Jilin  Provincial party committee, Comrade Zou Jiahua said: Jilin  Province has won good results in economic construction over the  past few years. It has achieved fairly rapid development in  reform, opening up, and other undertakings, improved people's  living standard, and maintained social stability. In improving  large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and  strengthening the position of agriculture as the foundation, in  particular, it has adopted some realistic and effective measures  to conduct beneficial explorations and experiments. Its ideas  and measures for the next step of work are also clear and  feasible. Making unremitting efforts, it will certainly see the  result of new achievements.    Comrade Zou Jiahua pointed out: At present, we should regard  state-owned enterprises, especially large- and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises' effort to end deficits and increase  profits, as an important link of economic work. Governments at  all levels and pertinent departments should make active efforts  to provide a good external environment for improving large- and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises, do a good job in  investigation and study, give different guidance according to  different conditions, and work out specific methods for every  enterprise. Enterprises should keep the major target of  establishing the socialist market economy system in view and  focus on market demand in doing work. The key to this is to  make continuous efforts to develop the new products that meet  market demand, are of high quality, and yield good economic  returns and to reduce production cost and improve efficiency.  Enterprises should accelerate their technical transformation,  which should be carried out in an orderly manner every year.  When conducting technical transformation, they should aim at  achieving technological advance and never regard expanding floor  space and increasing personnel as their purpose of development  or continue to adopt old technology, old measures, and old  equipment. To resolve fund shortages, they should not rely  merely on higher levels. They should raise funds from various  channels, succeed in tapping their own potential, increase the  proportion of the funds owned by themselves in the circulating  funds, and reduce their reliance of banks as much as possible.  Meanwhile, they should properly address the specific  difficulties encountered by some enterprise workers in the  process of deepening reform to safeguard and stabilize the  overall situation.    Zou Jiahua emphasized: Industry and agriculture should be  developed in a coordinated manner. As the raw material base for  industry and the market for industrial products, agriculture and  the rural economy, if falling behind in development, will  restrict industrial development. In current agricultural  development, we should first arrange well the development of  basic farm products, such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing  seeds. Meanwhile, we should guide the rural economic work in  such as way that the rural economy is comprehensively developed  and peasants' income increased. We should make overall  arrangements for agriculture, rural economy, and peasants'  income. When agriculture and rural economy are developed and  peasants' income is [words indistinct] increased, industrial  development will be promoted. In agricultural production, we  should restructure crops, encourage peasants to develop  livestock breeding, and greatly develop the intensive processing  industry and the township enterprises that use farm products as  raw materials while stabilizing the acreage sown to grain,  stabilizing grain output, and stabilizing [words indistinct].  We should regard the increase of productivity and per-unit  yields as an important link in agricultural development.    Zou Jiahua said: China's current economic situation is good.  The desire of some localities and some comrades for faster  development is good. However, they should guide work according  to the law governing economic development. They should proceed  from the actual conditions in economic work and the national  capacity and select proper priorities of development to make the  economy develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner.    Zou Jiahua urged: Local economic development should be based  on specific local conditions. All localities should develop the  economy that reflects their own advantages and characteristics;  and they should support their own pillar and backbone  enterprises. Auto and chemical industries are Jilin's  advantageous industries, and black earth is its advantageous  resource. In its endeavor of development and construction, it  should fully develop these advantages to make them still better.    Others accompanying Vice Premier Zou Jiahua during the  inspection tour were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister in charge of the  State Planning Commission; Zhang Kezhi, deputy secretary general  of the State Council General Office; and Li Zibin, vice minister  of chemical industry.</p>

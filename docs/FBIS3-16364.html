This debt is half  of all non-payments in the Russian economy.    Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik told  parliament hearings on non-payments today that the fuel and  energy situation is most complicated and fraught with grave  consequences for both the complex and the whole economy.    A reason for this is insufficient circulating assets of  enterprises, imperfection of the legislation and low financial  discipline of consumers, said Shafranik.    In his opinion, it is necessary to adopt a decree on  regulated payments for fuel and energy in order to ensure severe  sanctions against the non-payers and their priority payments for  the supplies. Off-setting of mutual obligations of the budget  and fuel and energy enterprises, as well as the transfer of the  2,500,000,000,000 ruble debt of Commonwealth states to the  complex's account will help settle the problem as well.    Experts believe 1,500,000,000,000 rubles worth of  allocations  and off-setting of mutual debts worth 5,000,000,000,000 rubles  would be enough to remove financial tension in the fuel and  energy complex.</p>

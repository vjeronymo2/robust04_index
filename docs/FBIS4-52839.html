			<p>BFN     [Text] Voices demanding dissolution of the lower house  floor group "Kaishin"--creation of which caused the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to bolt the coalition--are now  growing in the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] in the ruling camp. The two parties are  expected to hold talks to discuss the issue of "Kaishin" early  next week. The prevailing view is that even when the floor  group is disbanded, "the SDPJ will not return to the coalition"  (as an SDPJ staff official predicted). It appears that the two  parties want to "at least avoid the situation of fataly damaging  relations with the SPDJ" in light of the forthcoming  possibilities of the cabinet resigning en masse and the House of  Representatives dissolving for a general election.    Within the JNP, it is said that "nearly 90 percent of the  party members oppose keeping the `Kaishin' group intact"  (according to a JNP Dietman). At a standing committee meeting  of all party Dietmen on 11 May, voices of criticism were poured  on former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his leadership  for causing the SDPJ to bolt the coalition over the Kaishin  issue. The issue of criticism was settled on 12 May only after  Banri Kaieda, chairman of the public relations committee,  proposed that the party "make efforts toward retracting the  `Kaishin' concept in cooperation with the DSP," and the members  accepted the proposal.    In the party also are unceasing voices calling for Hosokawa  to step down from the post as the party representative. The  retraction of the "Kaishin" concept is, in large measure, aimed  at preventing the party from breaking up.    The DSP held its meeting of all party Dietmen of both houses  at its headquarters on the evening of 13 May. Nearly all the  members agreed that the "Kaishin" issue became the cause for the  SDPJ to bolt the coalition, and that "this means the DSP should  take responsibility for the grave consequence." After the  meeting, Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa told reporters the  DSP wants to take concerted action with the JNP on this issue,  and added: "If disbanding of `Kaishin' could solidify the base  of the Hata administration, we must take this into our  consideration."    Meanwhile, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is negative about  the immediate retraction of the concept because it believes "the  disbanding of `Kaishin' should be done as a last resort only"  (according to a Shinseito official). Shinseito adviser Tatsuo  Ozawa, who was named secretary general of the "Kaishin" floor  group, met with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on 12 May.  Shinseito is now seeking ways to break the current deadlock.  But with the likelihood of the SDPJ returning to the coalition  being slim, the party appears to be more interested in breaking  up the SDPJ-Liberal Democratic Party alliance relationship now.</p>

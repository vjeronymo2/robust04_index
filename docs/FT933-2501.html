			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Lang firm on local authority reforms MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday dismissed as 'an amusing diversion' the campaign of non co-operation being waged by some local authorities against his proposals for reforming local government in Scotland. He said that the reform - which involves creating 28 single-tier authorities in 1996 to replace the present nine regional, three island and 53 district councils - would go ahead regardless of whether local authorities co-operated. It would strengthen local government in Scotland, he said. The Labour-dominated Convention of Scottish Local Authorities decided in late July to ban councillors and officials from speaking to the Scottish Office about implementing the reforms, which will be contained in a bill in the next session of parliament. But the non-co-operation campaign is faltering, with many councils refusing to support it. Yesterday the campaign came under attack from several speakers at a Glasgow conference on the reforms. A councillor from Sutherland District Council, which is to disappear under the new structure, said that it was folly to try to influence the government without talking to it. Professor Arthur Midwinter, from Strathclyde University, called the non-co-operation campaign irrelevant and a diversion from the main issues. But Mr Charles Gray, a councillor and president of the convention, said that the non-co-operation policy would remain in force. The government has told councils that they could face financial difficulties if they refuse to co-operate. The Scottish Office has asked councils to bid for any special funding they may require to prepare for reorganisation next year, and said that if they do not reply they might not receive the aid. Labour opposes the reform because the government has not employed an independent commission to draw the new boundaries, leading to charges that it has 'gerrymandered' the new council map.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NICKLAUS, NORMAN WAIT FOR A COMPLETE ROUND  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus and defending champion Greg Norman have an overnight wait to see  if they will advance into today's third round of the storm-delayed  International tournament at Castle Rock, Colo.  </P> <P> Norman and Nicklaus each finished with three points moments before darkness  halted second-round play Friday night on the Castle Pines Golf Club course.  </P> <P> A three-hour rain and lightning delay left 32 players stranded on the course.  They are scheduled to complete the round this morning. Some have as many as six  holes to play.  </P> <P> Until all players are finished, the qualifying score to make it into the third  round will not be known.  </P> <P> Medal scores do not count in this event. Points are awarded on the player's  performance on each hole: 5 for eagle, 2 for birdie, 0 for par, -1 for bogey  and -3 for double bogey or higher.  </P> <P> It appeared a score of three points would be necessary to make it into a  playoff for the final qualifying spots.  </P> <P> After the completion of 36 holes, the 144-man field will be cut to the 72  players with the highest point totals. Those 72 then will compete for 24 places  in Sunday's final round.  </P> <P> Norman had to make a last-gasp rally to have any chance at all. He birdied both  the 16th and 17th holes, but missed a 15-foot putt on the 18th for the birdie  that would have secured a spot in the third round.  </P> <P> Nicklaus, who designed the course in the eastern foothills of the Rockies,  missed an even shorter birdie putt on the 18th, from about six feet.  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia, among the group stranded on the course, held a one-point  lead with one hole to go. He had 21 points.  </P> <P> Eduardo Romero of Argentina was the leader in the clubhouse with 20 points, 11  of which he accumulated in Friday's action.  </P> <P> Steve Elkington of Australia was next at 19 points.  </P> <P> Rives McBee set a tournament record with an eight-under 64 in the first round  of the Senior Showdown tournament at Jeremy Ranch, Utah.  </P> <P> McBee shot 32-32 on the 7,103-yard mountain course, highlighted by an eagle on  the first hole when he chipped in with a wedge.  </P> <P> Don Bies and Mike Hill were tied at 66, one stroke in front of Phil Rogers, Lee  Trevino, and George Archer. Bob Betley and John Paul Cain were at 68.  </P> <P> Tammie Green shot a three-under-par 69 for a 36-hole total of 137 and  maintained her one-stroke lead at the LPGA Big Apple tournament at New  Rochelle, N.Y.  </P> <P> "I have never led after two rounds," Green said. "My game is good enough to  stay there so now it's a matter of proving it."  </P> <P> Green will have to prove against a formidable field.  </P> <P> Rosie Jones was second after shooting a 69 for 138.  </P> <P> Dawn Coe and Daniel shot 70s, and were tied for third at 140 with Marci Bozarth  and Danielle Ammaccapane, who each had 71.  </P> <P> Dottie Mochrie's 69 gave her a 141, followed by Betsy King, Kristi Albers, Jan  Stephenson, Cathy Morse, Cindy Schreyer and Kris Monaghan at 142.  </P></p>

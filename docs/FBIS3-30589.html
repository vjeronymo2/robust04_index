			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.K.: "Aleksander Kwasniewski on the Functioning </F> of the Coalition; Pawlak Breaks the Agreement"]    [Text] For the first time, the Chief Council [RN] of the  Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] closed its  session to journalists. On Saturday, 5 February, its members  discussed the political situation that developed as a result of  the government crisis and the resignation submitted by Marek  Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister of finance.    Snatches of statements by Aleksander Kwasniewski, Marek  Borowski, and council members, which we were able to overhear  near the door, suggested that the participants expressed severe  criticism of the cadre, information, economic, and financial  policy of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]; they also seemed to be  pointing to a lack of cooperation within the coalition. Talks  between both coalition parties will probably be held on Monday  [7 February].    Aleksander Kwasniewski officially confirmed that Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak is obviously breaching the provisions  of the coalition agreement. Three of its four provisions are  being implemented as the PSL partners wish.    "We will not tolerate this state of affairs any longer,"  said  Kwasniewski. According to him, the governing coalition will not  break up if the intentions of both sides are clear, if both  sides are willing to communicate with each other and implement a  jointly agreed economic program.    "We have expressed such an intention, and we maintain it; we  would like a similar declaration on the part of the PSL so that  we will know whether they want the coalition to remain as much  as we do. Some activities lead us to believe that the  determination to maintain it is different," said Kwasniewski,  referring to the present conflict and to earlier disputes  between the coalition partners.    Despite these accusations, the SdRP chairman conceded that  the discussion is characterized by a desire to reach an  agreement within the coalition. Kwasniewski described Marek  Borowski as the best person for the role of the finance minister  now and a man responsible for the economy.    When SdRP General Secretary Jerzy Szmajdzinski was  presenting  the conclusions of the almost five-hour discussion of the  authorities of his party, he was much more cautious in choosing  his words: "The SdRP decided that there is no need to escalate  this conflict. The existing problems can be resolved among the  members of the presidiums of both parties. It is desirable that  both parties take a more precise joint stance on the issues of  the economy, the budget, privatization, information policy, the  government, and the method of conducting the cadre policy.    He also admitted that there is no need to sign a new  coalition agreement; however, as a result of the fact that it  has not been kept, it is necessary to review the coalition's  activities after 100 days of governing and to explain all doubts.    He said that it was with sorrow that the RN of the SdRP  received the resignation of Marek Borowski; he added, however,  that the deputy prime minister is not the only candidate of the  SdRP for this post. Nevertheless, each person who comes after  him will be in a more difficult situation.    "We do not want to die for anyone. We want Marek Borowski to  be used in the further activities of the coalition, of the  government. Everything is still possible."    As they finished their session, the SdRP leaders expressed  the hope that they would be able to meet with the prime minister  as early as last weekend, all the more so because, during his  morning talk with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, he is reported to  have said that he wants to ease the conflict. However, he will  first have a talk with the PSL leadership.    "These will be talks that will explain everything to us,"  said Szmajdzinski.</p>

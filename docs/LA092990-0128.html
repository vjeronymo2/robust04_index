			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUIT SETTLED OVER POLLUTION CLEANER DEVICE;  </P> <P> PATENT: COSTA MESA'S PARKER AUTOMOTIVE AND TRIANGLE SPECIAL PRODUCTS AGREE TO  WORK TOGETHER BUT DECLINE TO REVEAL MORE ABOUT THEIR ARRANGEMENT.  </P> <P> Parker Automotive Corp. said Friday that a patent infringement suit filed  against it last year by Triangle Special Products Group has been dismissed as a  result of an agreement by both firms.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleged that one of  Parker's automotive pollution-cleaning machines infringed on patents held by  the division of Triangle Corp. of Stamford, Conn.  </P> <P> With the dismissal, each party will pay its own legal costs. The costs will not  have an impact on Parker's 1990 financial performance, said Diane Parker,  corporate vice president.  </P> <P> She said Triangle and Parker have agreed to work together but declined to  reveal more about their arrangement.  </P> <P> In a separate announcement, Parker said it has signed an exclusive distribution  agreement with a Saudi Arabian company for sales of its cleaning systems for  internal combustion engines.  </P> <P> The Saudi Arabian distribution deal, with Diyar Corp. of Riyadh, was actually  signed in July but was held up by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the  subsequent turmoil as troops from the United States and other countries poured  into Saudi Arabia to help defend it against a possible Iraqi attack.  </P> <P> In announcing the agreement Friday, Parker released a statement in which Diyar  vice president Adnan Amin said that "events in the Mideast have more or less  stabilized to the point that it is business as usual for Diyar."  </P> <P> Amin was not minimizing the seriousness of the Persian Gulf crisis, Diane  Parker said: "He was just saying that Diyar has determined that it can continue  doing business."  </P> <P> The one-year agreement, with a five-year renewal option, calls for the Saudi  firm to buy at least $1 million yearly in CarbonClean products, Parker  officials said.  </P> <P> Diyar distributes engine-related machinery and tools throughout Saudi Arabia  and other Persian Gulf countries and provides maintenance services to  government agencies and private companies that operate irrigation and oil field  equipment, Parker said.  </P> <P> In his statement, Amin said he expects the CarbonClean system to be especially  valuable in Saudi Arabia as a method for servicing gasoline and diesel engines  in remote desert oil and irrigation stations, without having to open the  engines and expose them to sand and dust.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Chernov, Sigmatsentr consultant: "Did </F> Russia Have a Budget in 1993?"    [Text] It would be worthwhile to hold parliamentary  hearings on this subject with the participation of Boris  Fedorov, the country's ex-treasurer. Or is no one in our  government responsible for this as before?    The budget is more important than any political argument to  very many people -- no matter what position they occupy. The  incomes of the different categories of citizens and the amounts  of taxes depend on the state budget and budgetary policy.    However, our liberal reformers have turned the budget into  something secret and inaccessible. One can only explain with any  distinctness the situation regarding the state budget in 1993  using truisms. It, as it were, existed and did not exist  simultaneously. There were drafts of the budget (delayed, true,  for at least a half year); however, no final portrait can be  obtained from them. No one discussed and adopted it.    Without a doubt, the entire year of 1993 was -- to put it  mildly -- a strange one in a legal respect. Budget oddities were  in no way fewer than constitutional legal ones.    The budget in the hands of Russia's ultra-liberals is  surprisingly similar to the celebrated clothes of the king in  the well-known fairy-tale -- first of all, probably because it  has the property of not retaining fingerprints due to the  ephemeral nature of the subject itself. A clever tailor was  able to convince the king and his associates that he had cut out  beautiful or, as the specialists say, almost deficit-free  clothing.    Alas, the unsophisticated, like the fairy-tale infant,  people  incited by the vigilant "enemies of reform" were in no hurry for  some reason to go into ecstasies over the stiff savings in their  wages, pensions, subsidies, and other payments. The absence of  certain essential -- from the viewpoint of social decency --  details in the budget clothing evoked among them an  understandable wish to know where the more than sizable "pieces"  of the monetary fabric had disappeared.    The people will hardly be satisfied with the recent  explanation by B. Fedorov, the ex-treasurer. It seems that the  agrarians, who punched through an "unrealistic" (too big, isn't  it?) state order, and the prime minister, who confirmed a price  for grain at the world level (but is it really at the world  level?) are guilty of the wage underpayments by the budget  people since the "breakdown of the budget began because money  had to be taken from others."    The entire essence of his economic policy's ultra-liberalism  and insolvency were expressed in this reasoning of the retired  (fortunately) minister. From the viewpoint of liberal  financiers, the budget would look much better if the Russian  agrarians had not produced anything in general, if agriculture  had ruined itself completely, if all grain had been purchased  from American and other farmers paying for it with earnings from  selling natural resources to the West, etc., etc. This liberal  logic is so absurd and so abnormal that language does not exist  to discuss it seriously from a worldly and scientific viewpoint.  Nevertheless, we agreed for two years -- based on some evil  intuition -- to listen to the barren flowers of liberalism.    Liberalism is back where it started but the deceived people  are participating in these young people's gatherings. Only the  fact that people are apparently no longer building on the  liberal chaff is consoling. Liberal reformers will only be able  to achieve the reverse effect -- intense attention on their  affairs -- with reasoning similar to the one cited above.  Citizens are continuing to remind the authorities about their  legitimate interests and needs. Not trite reasoning by retirees  but answers to simple questions interest them.    For example, with the supposedly existing acute shortage of  assets, how could B. Fedorov, the ex-treasurer, admit that  astronomic sums -- according to the estimates of experts, they  exceed the state's annual budget several-fold --that have  state-wide natural resources as their only source contrive by  some incomprehensively devious way not to be in the state  treasury but in private accounts in Swiss banks?    Upon whom has wealth of such frankly planetary scales fallen  and how? What, in fact, was the state's budget? On the basis of  what considerations and priorities was it compiled? How was it  implemented? Was everything here straightforward from a legal  and, moreover, from a moral point of view?    Peace and harmony in society cannot be based on deceit or a  desire to close one's eyes to the abominations of life nor can  they be built on vengeance. Only truth and the political  morality based on it can be the basis of a civil harmony aimed  at a just reorganization of life.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Polunin] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 9 TASS -- Italian Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta arrived in Moscow on Wednesday to discuss a  wide range of topics with Russian leadership.    In a short interview with ITAR-TASS upon arrival at the  airport, Andreatta said he had come to Russia in the capacity of  chairman of the CSCE Council.    While in Moscow, the Italian diplomat is scheduled to meet  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev to consider prospects for cooperation in Europe and ways  of settling conflicts in hotbeds of tensions -- in former  Yugoslavia and the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.    The talks will also deal with preparations for a high-level  meeting of the Group-of-Seven (G-7) highly industrialized  countries scheduled to be held in Naples this coming summer.    As compared with the previous forums of this kind, Russia  will be a more active participant in the upcoming meeting.  Thus, it will be paid more attention during the meeting itself  and not only outside it, as it was usually done before. The  most important problems facing the present-day world are to be  discussed in the presence of the Russian president.    According to Andreatta, Italy as organiser of the Naples  summit intends to see to it that these changes be reflected in  the forum's final documents. All this is to help Russia become  a G-7 full- fledged member and to pave the way for transforming  such forums into G-8 meetings.    As chairman of the CSCE Council, the Italian minister will  also exchange views with the Russian leadership on Russia's  relations with the Baltic republics. Andreatta plans to discuss  this issue in Tallinn and Vilnius as well, where he will be  going after the Moscow talks.</p>

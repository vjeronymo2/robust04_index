			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For example, consider a blender-refiner who has the anti-dumping statutory baseline, which for olefins is 10.6 vol%. The simple model anti-dumping standard for olefins is no greater than 125% times 10.8, or 13.50 vol%. In this example the blender-refiner used two blendstocks during the averaging period, 10,000 gallons of light FCC naphtha which the blender-refiner sampled and tested and determined to contain 39.8 vol% olefins. The blender-refiner also used 25,000 gallons of reformate that through the blender-refiner's sampling and testing was determined to contain 1.0 vol% olefins. The blender-refiner in this example determined the annual average olefin content of its blendstock by calculating the volume-weighted average olefin content of these two blendstocks, or (10,000 * 39.8) plus (25,000 * 1.0) divided by 35,000, or 11.8 vol% olefins. Because 11.8 vol% is less than the 13.25 vol% olefin standard, the blender-refiner in this example would meet the anti-dumping olefin standard. Annual averages for the blender-refiner for sulfur, T&hyph;90, and exhaust benzene under the simple model would be calculated in a similar manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that compliance with complex model standards cannot be determined using the volume-weighted properties of blendstock as described above, because such an approach would not provide meaningful results for exhaust benzene, or toxics or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance. EPA has, however, included a method in the final rule for calculating compliance under the complex model in the case of blendstock that is added to gasoline whereby compliance is determined on the basis of blendstocks blended with gasoline. This results in a calculation method that is consistent with the technical limitations inherent with the complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this calculation method, the blender-refiner determines the fuel parameters of the blendstock or blendstocks that are to be added to a base gasoline, by testing a representative sample of each blendstock. The blender-refiner then calculates the properties of the gasoline that would result if the blendstock or blendstocks were blended, in the volume-ratio used in the blending operation, with a gasoline having parameters that are equal to anti-dumping baseline applicable to the blender-refiner, except that properties measured on a weight or ppm basis, such as sulfur, must be corrected for the specific gravities of the products blended. In most cases, the anti-dumping statutory baseline would be the applicable baseline for blender-refiners. This mathematical calculation thus models the fuel parameters of the gasoline that would result if the blendstock in question were in fact blended with gasoline having properties equal to the blender-refiner's baseline in the volume-ratio used in the blending operation. The emissions performance (exhaust benzene, or toxics or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions performance) of the mathematically-created gasoline is determined through the appropriate complex model, as is the emissions performance of the blender-refiner's baseline gasoline. The emissions performance effect of the blendstock is calculated by subtracting the emissions performance of the blender-refiner's baseline gasoline from the emissions performance of the mathematically-calculated gasoline. The anti-dumping standard is met if the volume-weighted emissions performance for all blendstock used in blends during the averaging period is equal to or less than zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

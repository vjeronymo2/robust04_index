			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "People's Party Calls For Withdrawal of Spanish </F> `Blue Helmets' from Bosnia"]    [Text] The military affairs spokesman for the People's  Party [PP], Santiago Lopez Valdivielso, yesterday said his  parliamentary group will ask that the government "not under any  circumstances send more troops to replace our forces" in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which amounts to asking for withdrawal of  Spain's 1,200 blue helmets. The announcement reflects a change  of position for the main opposition party, which until now was  ambivalent on the issue.    The current Spanish contingent, the third sent to the  Balkans  since October 1992, completes its six-month tour of duty in the  zone on 23 March. The government has not decided whether to send  fresh troops to relieve them, but the Army is preparing the  Cordoba Group, composed of troops from the 21st Mechanized  Brigade of the Brunete Armored Division, to replace the Madrid  Group during the month of April.    Lopez Valdivielso yesterday served notice of his group's  opposition to the deployment of relief troops, alleging that the  presence of the blue helmets, despite the "enormous  professionalism, dedication, and valor" of Spanish soldiers,  "serves more to keep the war going than to lessen the impact on  the civilian population."    "On numerous occasions, the blue helmets not only have been  unable to impose their moral authority but have been subjected  to almost insupportable humiliations," he added.    According to the PP spokesman, "Spain's decision should be  properly coordinated with the other European governments  involved in the operation and announced immediately at the  United Nations, so that if it is decided to maintain the blue  helmet presence, there will be time to find other troops to  replace the Spaniards."  <H5>  Ministry Replies </H5>   Referring to a withdrawal of blue helmets, a spokesman for  the Defense Ministry said yesterday that "Spain cannot make a  decision of this kind unilaterally," and noted that the Spanish  Government has announced its intention to "renew its deployment"  of troops this spring if the parties concerned have not  concluded a peace agreement by that time.    The decision would be made in conjunction with the other  Western governments that maintain large contingents in Bosnia  (United Kingdom, France, and Canada). However, Minister Julian  Garcia Vargas indicated on Monday [17 January] in Bonn (Germany)  that he considers a reduction of UN troop levels in the former  Yugoslav Republic more likely than withdrawal.    Meanwhile, PP deputy Arsenio Fernandez of Mesa yesterday  accused the government of "muzzling" the military service chiefs  of staff by preventing them from appearing before Congress in  closed session to report on Armed Forces operations. It will be  Minister Garcia Vargas who reports to Congress behind closed  doors on this subject.</p>

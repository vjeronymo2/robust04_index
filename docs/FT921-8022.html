			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Long end slides as Fed cuts reserve requirements US TREASURY prices nosedived at the long end of the maturity range yesterday after the Federal Reserve unexpectedly lowered bank reserve requirements. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at 100 3/16 , yielding 7.973 per cent. The two-year note, however, was up  1/32 at 99 5/16 , yielding 5.232 per cent. After the Presidents Day holiday, which closed the markets on Monday, US investors returned to work with little incentive to buy Treasuries. Early on, however, demand from Japanese investors in Tokyo, provoked by the strengthening dollar, kept prices in positive territory. The market took a sudden turn soon after midday, when the Fed announced that, as of April 2, it was cutting the reserve requirement on transaction accounts from 12 per cent to 10 per cent. The idea behind the Fed's move is to free up capital that banks can lend to corporates or consumers, and thus stimulate the flagging economy. Bond investors took fright on the news because they believed the move makes another interest rate cut less likely. In contrast, prices at the short end held up because investors were betting that banks would use some of their additional capital to invest in short-term Treasury securities. THE UK government bond market opened up a quarter of a percentage point, helped by sterling's strength, but prices later slipped to close unchanged following the weakness in the US Treasury bond market. The pound's strength against the D-Mark fuelled buying interest from both domestic and international investors, traders said. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 97.31, up from Monday's close of 97.23 and traded up to a high of 98.07, before ending the day at around 97.29. Volume in the Liffe futures contract was above average at over 23,000 contracts. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 116 5/32 and traded at 116 3/8 late. GERMAN government bonds traded in a narrow range as participants await the release of the German M3 money supply figures for January. The figure is expected to show an increase from December's 5.7 per cent to between 8 and 10 per cent in January. The Bundesbank's 1992 M3 target range is 3.5-5.5 per cent growth. The Liffe bund futures contract closed almost unchanged on the day at 87.87. JAPANESE government bonds ended little changed with the benchmark No 129 yielding 5.385 per cent after trading in a narrow range.</p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Derwent buys Heronproperties for Pounds 33m Heron Group has raised Pounds 33.4m from the sale of seven properties to Derwent Valley Holdings, taking the value of asset disposals by the property and trading group to more than Pounds 250m since June last year. Derwent's shares fell 20p to 588p on the announcement. The company plans to fund the acquisition partly through a 1-for-3 rights issue at 500p to raise Pounds 18.6m net. The portfolio includes 4 properties in the west end of London, where 85 per cent of Derwent's existing portfolio is situated. Mr John Burns, managing director, said the properties had been 'hand-picked'. The deal will enhance Derwent's income, offering an initial yield of 10.3 per cent, falling to 9.5 per cent in September, as a result of lease renewal. However, as a result of shares being issued at a discount to their 544p net asset value, Derwent's asset value per share will fall to 528p. Mr Burns said the portfolio offered a balance of long and short leases, enabling Derwent to add value through active management. There is also longer-term redevelopment potential for some properties. The company completed a Pounds 17m placing in mid-1993, and has since invested Pounds 57m in the UK property market, including the latest purchase. Its gearing will rise to 60 per cent. Heron said the property sales, made by its Heron Corporation subsidiary, had been at values above those in its business plan. However, under its restructuring agreement, the property proceeds are tied to Heron Corporation's own debt. It will not affect Heron International bondholders, who currently face a request for deferred interest payments, primarily because of the impact of declining European property values.</p>

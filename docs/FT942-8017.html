			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Soft shoe shuffle - Style They sound like lyricist and songwriter or a comedy duo. But in fact Eddie Haan and Trafton Cole were shoemakers from Chicago in the 1920s. Like Kleenex and Hoover, Cole-Haans are almost a generic term to Americans. The penny and the tassel loafer for instance - both very Ivy League, very Scott Fitzgerald - are traditional Cole-Haans in the US. You can almost see Gatsby putting on his scotch grain, moccasin construction, cushioned heel Cole-Haans before choosing from that incredible shirt collection. Today those handsewn moccasins would cost him Pounds 149 and he could have them with or without tassell in many shades of brown and black leather, as well as in suede. At the company headquarters in Yarmouth, Maine, craftsmen still concentrate on the artisan touches of the Cole-Haan brand. These include quality of fit, hand-burnishing the leather (which brings out its character), intricate hand-weaving and hand-tooling for Western Boots, British Oxfords and what they call classic Bucks. Launched at Harrods, Cole-Haans for men have only been in Europe since late last year, although some of the women's shoes have been available earlier. In the US they are worn on every campus, in every office and, the ever-popular deck shoes, in every resort. Cole Haans for women at Harrods, Liberty, Dickens and Jones, Bruno HagIi, Bond Street and Bentalls, Kingston. For men at Harrods and Kurt Geiger, Jermyn Street.

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Banda trails in Malawi poll Malawi's President Hastings Kamuzu Banda and his party last night appeared to be trailing well behind his opponents as unofficial results came in from the country's first multi-party elections on Tuesday, Reuter reports from Blantyre. Official results are not expected until today, largely because of delays in counting ballot papers but the opposition United Democratic Front, a grouping of former Banda aides expelled from his ruling Malawi Congress Party, claimed victory in the parliamentary polls. 'I think it is time the MCP conceded defeat,' UDF secretary-general Harry Thomson told a news conference. He said ballot counts by the UDF showed the party had captured 69 of the 177 contested parliamentary seats, the MCP 52 and another opposition party, the Alliance for Democracy (Aford) 34. State radio gave the UDF 56 seats, Aford 32 and the MCP 25. In the presidential poll, the radio said UDF leader Bakili Muluzi had 961,980 votes, President Banda 418,222 and Aford leader Chakufwa Chihana 436,860. Mr Thomson said Mr Muluzi was confident of unseating Mr Banda in the presidential poll but would not make any announcement until he had obtained official results. 'Barring some miracle, he is out,' a veteran African diplomat said. President Banda led the nation to independence from Britain in 1964 and ran a harsh regime for 30 years. He is now in his 90s and unwell since undergoing brain surgery last year. His grip on power began to slip two years ago under mounting pressure from the west and internal dissent over his human rights record.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Sweden ready for smaller EFA - The Farnborough Air Show SWEDEN will be ready to take part in producing a smaller version of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) as proposed by the German government, it said yesterday. Mr Anders Bjorck, Swedish defence minister, said it would not be realistic to expect the current EFA partners (Germany, Italy, Britain and Spain) to buy Sweden's new single-engined JAS39 Gripen fighter. But the JAS consortium, including Saab and Volvo, might share in producing a redesigned EFA. Mr Bjorck said at Farnborough that many elements of the two aircraft would be 'more or less identical'. The EFA partners are studying ways of cutting costs after Bonn's declaration that it would seek co-operation on a cheaper and lighter aircraft. Britain is resisting big changes in the EFA design, saying performance targets must be kept. Sweden's order programme for the Gripen, involving 140 aircraft, would be completed by 2001, Mr Bjorck added. The Swedish partners would then be able to take part in collaborative production. Sweden wanted its aircraft industry kept independent, with more room for foreign involvement.</p>

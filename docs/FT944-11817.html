			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / 'New Austrian' system is cheaper but more risky The 'new Austrian' tunnelling method, which is at the centre of a safety inquiry into the Heathrow tunnel collapse, is not new at all. The concept championed by Dr Ladislaus von Rabcewicz, a Salzburg consulting engineer, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, has been used with success internationally for almost 40 years. Hundreds of projects have used the method, including the Frankfurt and Washington metros, the Orange-Fish tunnel which diverts water under Suurberg Mountain to Eastern Cape Province in South Africa, and a water tunnel diverting the Indus River for the Tarbela dam in Pakistan. It was used to carve the world's biggest undersea cavern for a rail cross-over for the Channel tunnel, 40 metres below the seabed and 5 miles off the British coast. The technique requires engineers to use the strength of the rock surrounding the tunnel to minimise the extra strengthening required to prevent collapse or catastrophic settlement - as occurred two weeks ago at Heathrow. Its advantage is that it allows excavation by conventional diggers rather than expensive tunnel-boring machines, permitting faster construction and greater design flexibility. Mr Colin Kirkland, development director of consulting engineers Sir William Halcrow, and former technical director for Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, said that it can be up to 25 per cent cheaper than conventional tunnelling methods. Much depends on geology and ground conditions. Underground caverns in the Alps have supported themselves for centuries. It would be impossible to construct a fabricated lining which could bear the weight of the kilometres of rock below an Alpine peak. Mr Kirkland said that in Italy engineers froze gravel, which normally would be too unstable and have insufficient strength, to allow them to use the 'new Austrian' method. The British Health and Safety Executive, which is investigating the Heathrow collapse, is examining whether the method is suitable for use in London clay  -even though a Pounds 1.5m test tunnel using the method has suffered no problems since it was constructed in 1992 by BAA, the airport operator. Alternatives to the method include the laborious installation of strong prefabricated tunnel linings as excavation proceeds, or using a cut-and-cover technique, excavating the ground from the surface, which is stabilised by massive concrete structures while the tunnel is built. Because of the unpredictability of ground conditions, which can change radically in a matter of inches, costly over-engineering invariably occurs. Dr Myles O'Reilly, former head of the ground engineering division of the Department of Transport's research laboratory, said that the original cast-iron linings of the London Underground were eight times stronger than necessary. The 'new Austrian' method, which encourages a minimum of additional strengthening during excavation, is riskier but cheaper. Its success depends on the precision of engineering predictions of likely ground responses to excavation and on sophisticated measuring procedures, which should allow engineers time to strengthen the tunnel if unexpected movement occurs. In harder ground rock bolts up to 6 metres long might be inserted at points of weakness. These are then cemented in and tightened to bind the rock together. A steel mesh is used to cover tunnel walls, which are sprayed with a quick-drying concrete. Once a project is sufficiently advanced a final reinforced lining is installed - as it would be with other methods. The undersea cavern for the Channel tunnel includes a concrete lining up to a metre thick. Dr O'Reilly said: 'The risk therefore is during the construction phase. The two new stations being built under Heathrow by the 'new Austrian' method, for example will have the same standard of strengthening and reinforcement as any London Underground station, when completed.' The risk of damage and loss of life, obviously, is much greater when construction is taking place in highly populated areas. Three people died in Munich in September when a bus fell into a hole caused by the collapse of a tunnel being built using the 'new Austrian' method for the Munich metro. There have been other failures involving the 'new Austrian' method, including several significant collapses during the construction of 120km of tunnels for the 330km long Hannover to Wurzburg high-speed railway line in Germany. The most spectacular failure occured at Krieberg in 1986, when more than 55m of a tunnel collapsed, causing massive settlement of the ground above. The incident could have caused a major disaster if it had occurred under a big office block. Mr Kirkland said: 'The method is not inappropriate for London clay but it does require a high standard of monitoring and construction control if a project is not to be exposed to unacceptable risk.'</p>

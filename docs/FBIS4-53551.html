			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Yasushi Akashi, United  Nations special representative to the former Yugoslavia,  dismissed suggestions Friday [20 May] that there are differences  of opinions within the U.N. Protection Force (Unprofor), Foreign  Ministry officials said.    Akashi told Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa in a 10-minute  telephone conversation he thinks it natural that there are  criticisms against him, but that he wants to continue making his  utmost efforts without being too sensitive about them, the  officials said.    He also said he wants to value the neutrality of the U.N. in  pursuing his job.    Akashi, who is currently in Zagreb, denied there are  differences of opinions within the Unprofor and described it as  a monolith, the officials said.    Kakizawa told Akashi that Japan highly values his work  despite criticism from European countries and the United States,  and his neutral stance despite conflicting interests among  warring parties in Bosnia, they said.    He also said Japan plans to send a delegation to a U.N.-  sponsored international meeting on reconstruction of Sarajevo,  to be held next Tuesday and Wednesday in Vienna. Japan will  look into possible cooperation.    The foreign minister was quoted as saying it is difficult  for  Japan to send personnel to Unprofor at present, but that the  government wants to consider it on a mid- to long-term  perspective.    Akashi said he still wants Japan to join the Unprofor-led  peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia and called on  the nation to consider it from a long-term perspective.    Akashi also called for Japanese support for Macedonia,  saying  that maintaining neutrality and independence of Macedonia and  Albania are important, the officials said.</p>

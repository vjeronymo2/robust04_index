			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: New York If there was any doubt left in anyone's mind, last week confirmed that the long bull run in bonds had reached a turning point. Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, may have talked tough on inflation in his testimony to Congress on Tuesday, but bond prices kept sinking. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds has risen nearly half a point since the Fed raised short-term rates on February 4. This week, a mass of economic data will provide the market with the opportunity to feed on its own fears. Revised figures for gross domestic product in last year's fourth quarter are due today, with some economists predicting that the earlier estimate of 5.9 per cent could translate into an actual 7 per cent. The purchasing managers' index of buying intentions is on Tuesday, followed by personal income and home sales figures on Wednesday, factory stocks on Thursday, then employment indicators on Friday. In one sense, it hardly matters what the numbers say. If the figures point to rapid economic growth, bond prices will fall. If the numbers are weak, people will say it was a weather-related aberration, and prices will still fall. That is the sort of mood the market is in. It is convinced the last interest rate rise was only the first of many - and that the next is not far away.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Ready to tune into the Diller sizzle: Martin Dickson on why mighty CBS may merge with a modest cable television shopping channel What Hollywood wits call the 'Diller sizzle' may soon be back in US prime-time television after a 2 1/2 year absence. Mr Barry Diller, the entertainment industry executive behind such hits as 'The Simpsons' television cartoon series and the 'Indiana Jones' adventure movies, is negotiating a possible merger between QVC Network - the modest cable television shopping channel which he heads - and CBS, one of America's big three national television broadcasting networks. CBS yesterday confirmed it was discussing a merger with QVC. Mr Diller, 52, could become chief executive of the combined entity, returning to national television broadcasting for the first time since February 1992 when he stepped down as chief executive of Fox Inc, the film and television arm of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation media empire. His resignation from Fox shocked the film world because Mr Diller had built the upstart Fox Broadcasting into a fourth national television network - defying industry opinion that there was no room for a fresh challenger to the established trio of CBS, NCB and ABC. Mr Diller wanted to build a media empire of his own. After finding a quoted vehicle for his ambitions - the far-from-glamorous QVC - he made his first big foray last autumn, an unsuccessful Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) bid for film and publishing giant Paramount Communications, which merged instead with cable programmer Viacom. A deal with CBS could bring big benefits to the network. CBS has ranked first in prime- time television ratings for the past three years, but has come under Wall Street criticism for its strategy under Mr Laurence Tisch, the 71-year-old investor who took a controlling stake in the group eight years ago, knowing little about the entertainment industry. There are two main complaints. First, Mr Tisch has pursued a strategy unique in the entertainment industry of maintaining CBS as a pure, stand-alone television broadcasting business. He sold off peripheral assets, including the magazines division and CBS records. He also refused to follow NBC and ABC when they acquired interests in cable television, which has whittled down the broadcast networks' share of national audience from around 90 per cent 20 years ago to just over 60 per cent now. Mr Tisch is proud of the fact that this policy, combined with a clamp-down on costs and a stable management, has allowed the network to vault from third place in the ratings to first, while also giving CBS a cash pool of more than Dollars 1bn. But critics say his 'pure-play' strategy exposes a passive frame of mind, leaves the group exposed to a cyclical downturn in broadcasting and gives it too little clout in forging the complex multi-media alliances reshaping the entertainment industry. Second, critics say CBS may be losing its programming edge and its hold over affiliated stations, a concern highlighted in May when 12 television stations owned by media group New World Communications announced they were changing loyalty from the big three networks to Fox. Eight were defectors from CBS. The switch was due to a complex set of financial factors, but one catalyst was Mr Murdoch winning an auction to broadcast American football games featuring the National Football Conference for the next four years - beating CBS, which had shown the NFC games for almost 40 years. CBS's sports line-up is generally regarded as weak and its nightly news broadcast humdrum, but opinion is divided over the rest of its programming. Many advertisers think the network's prime-time line-up for autumn is strong. A deal with QVC could help CBS overcome both weaknesses perceived by Wall Street. First, it would bring in the immense creative energy of Mr Diller, who boasts one of Hollywood's most distinguished track records. He made his name at ABC in the early 1970s and between 1974 and 1984 headed the Paramount film studios. He could help CBS capitalise on changes in US anti-trust regulations which, for the first time in 20 years, will allow the big three networks to own and produce the bulk of their prime-time entertainment programmes. Second, a deal would thrust CBS into the cable programming industry. QVC runs two home shopping channels which sell products ranging from jewellery to clothing and cookware. Home shopping is still in its infancy, but it is predicted that it will show spectacular growth when inter-active technology is eventually introduced, allowing viewers to click on a remote control to place an order, rather than dialling a phone number as now. It is the boundless opportunities of inter-active entertainment which has attracted Mr Diller to the sector and which could be capitalised on by CBS. A link-up with QVC would also give CBS ties to two of the most powerful cable service companies in the US, Tele-Communications Inc (TCI) and Comcast, both of which have significant investments in the shopping channel. It would be an ironic twist of fate for Mr Tisch, proud defender of broadcasting against the inroads of cable.</p>

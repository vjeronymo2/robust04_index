			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / The triumph of hope over experience: Volvo's planned merger with Procordia For a man whose past merger record is distinctly patchy, Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar was remarkably ebullient on Saturday as he outlined his latest alliance. Unveiling a proposed SKr38.7bn (Pounds 3.73bn) merger of the Volvo vehicle group he chairs with Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals company, Mr Gyllenhammar stressed the European dimension. The deal was 'definitely offensive', he said, giving the merged company 'great possibilities for growth by giving us a presence in many important markets'. From Mr Gyllenhammar's point of view, the proposed reverse takeover would have several advantages: It would create a large and aggressive conglomerate to meet the challenge of post-1992 Europe. By creating a company too big to be easily swallowed, it would protect an important part of Swedish industry from potential foreign predators now that restrictions on foreign ownership of Swedish companies have been lifted. The government is likely to remove a further barrier against takeovers - the distinction between voting and non-voting shares - next year. If 'we had not acted ourselves,' said Mr Gyllenhammar, 'Procordia could have become a victim of the market'. It would fulfil a well-established ambition to own Procordia - in 1989 he tried to buy this state-owned holding company, but Volvo had to settle for a minority stake. And it would give him, as chairman of the merged company, an exhilarating alternative to the grinding task of rescuing Volvo's car business, which lost SKr1.5bn in the third quarter of 1991. Volvo as a whole did not lose money, but its pretax profit of SKr255m was partly due to income derived from its relationship with Renault, the French state-owned car and truck group. That relationship is just one of the complexities with which Mr Gyllenhammar will have to deal. Others include the lack of enthusiasm of the Swedish government, and the view of some of Mr Gyllenhammar's Swedish critics that his time would be better spent on Volvo's SKr5bn cost-cutting programme. The relationship with Renault, forged only two years ago, was seen at the time as the key to the group's future. The two companies, linked by cross-shareholdings, are hard at work on a joint component planning and development plan for light trucks and engines to last over the next 10 to 12 years. Despite this nuts-and-bolts progress, there have already been worries in France about the future of the relationship. These centre round Volvo's joint venture agreement last autumn with Mitsubishi Motors and the Dutch government for carmaking at the Born plant in Holland. The known doubts of Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, about the Volvo-Renault alliance are likely to be fanned by the Procordia merger, which will probably be seen as dictated more by the need to protect Swedish industry than by any European grand design. None the less, Renault has approved the intended merger, and the ensuing halving of its stake in Volvo to 4.2 per cent. No such approval has yet come from the Swedish government, Procordia's second-largest shareholder with 34.2 per cent of its equity and 42.7 per cent of its voting rights. Only minutes after the end of Mr Gyllenhammar's Saturday press conference, Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden's Industry Minister, held one of his own in which he displayed no enthusiasm for the deal. Ministers are furious at what they see as the Volvo chairman's pre-emptive and high-handed action. At first sight this might seem surprising: the new conservative government has already promised to sell off its stake in Procordia as part of its privatisation programme. Mr Gyllenhammar's plan might therefore seem something ministers would favour. However, the government argues that Volvo has broken the agreement it signed when it acquired its minority stake, which says that changes in the company's share capital require 'unity between the two parties'. The government is concerned about the terms of the deal. Its recently appointed privatisation commission - chaired by the veteran industrialist Mr Curt Nicolin who used to sit on Volvo's board - disliked the initial terms as too generous to Volvo shareholders. The 'industrial synergy effects' of the deal 'were not convincing', it said, with clear 'disadvantages' for Procordia. The terms have since been revised, but the commission seems unlikely to be satisfied. The proposal also flies in the face of the government's privatisation strategy, which aims to create as wide a share ownership as possible in the former state-dominated companies. In fact, Volvo's chairman sees no good reason why the government should not agree to join in the proposed deal and sell off its stake in Procordia at the same time. He does not want the Swedish state to maintain its current holdings. Under the proposed deal its equity stake would fall to 25.6 per cent but it would hold an estimated 44.1 per cent of the voting shares. Procordia is certainly a prize worth fighting for. Since its creation in 1990 - with interests ranging from health care products and food processing to tobacco, hotels, alcohol and restaurants - the group has undergone a successful restructuring, doubled its earnings in two years, and started acquiring food and drugs companies elsewhere in Europe. In its last interim results it enjoyed a 23 per cent rise in profits to SKr3.08bn. There has always been more than a touch of the gambler about some of Mr Gyllenhammar's past business adventures. He recently confessed that his wife thinks he is naive and makes thousands of mistakes. 'Naive perhaps', he added, 'but definitely impulsive'. It may have been that characteristic which led him into two past unsuccessful merger attempts. One of these, abandoned just in time, was with the antibiotics and animal health company Fermenta, run - until he succumbed to scandal - by Mr Refaat el Sayed in 1986. The other, no less unhappy, was the merger in 1980 with Beijerinvest, the investment and oil trading conglomerate. This fell apart within two years, but Volvo suffered losses from its oil activities for most of the 1980s until selling them off. There are still difficult negotiations ahead before the new Volvo can take the place on the European stage which Mr Gyllenhammar envisages for it. He has confronted the Swedish establishment before, however; it will not be surprising if he has his way in the end.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                THE NEW VOLVO AFTER                   PROCORDIA DEAL        VOLVO         PROCORDIA  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Assets                SKr130bn         SKr107bn        SKr34bn Sales                 SKr115.7bn       SKr76.3bn       SKr39.4bn Shareholders equity   SKr43bn          SKr35bn         SKr18bn Profit after financial items Employees             105,000          63,000          42,000 Income statements end September 1991  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Volvo/Procordia  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

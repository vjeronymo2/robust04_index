			<p>BFN     [Text] Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, who for some time now  has been known as "President Feliciano" by those who currently  reject Abimael Guzman Reynoso's leadership, has reportedly  simultaneously ordered an increase in Shining Path actions in  Lima and the transfer of Shining Path bases and refuge areas to  border regions, so as to expedite the Shining Path's escape  abroad in case of possible defeat.    This is according to an intelligence report based on  statements made by Shining Path members who have resorted to the  repentance law and who have been in contact with Ramirez  Durand's lieutenants.    There are indications that a few months ago, "Feliciano"  tried to meet with terrorist cadres operating as "roving"  columns in Azangaro and Melgar, in Puno. There is also, however,  testimony that Ramirez Durand is currently in the Gran Pajonal  jungle area in Pasco. Another theory states that he is in Lima,  personally heading the so-called "Neighborhood Class Movement"  in Lima shantytowns.    The fact is that a so-called "Emergency Central Committee"  has started to operate in Lima. This committee seeks to  coordinate actions in seven areas in the outskirts of Lima, in  the same places where the establishment of an "iron belt" was  attempted, before Abimael Guzman's fall, to strangle and take  over the city.    Ramirez Durand reportedly has a contingent of about 200  Shining Path members called the "People's Guerrilla Army." They  are armed and the majority of them have been selected for their  "loyalty" and for having shown cruelty and the capacity to  strictly follow "orders." They are like robots, willing to  sacrifice themselves for "Feliciano," who holds complete control  over them. Only a few of them personally know him, however.    Intelligence souces report that "what they ignore is that  Ramirez Durand will employ the `sausage' policy against them:  When he sees he has lost, he will leave them behind as cannon  fodder to cover his withdrawal. They will be grouped in  platoons to divert attention or to halt the Army's advance so  that "Feliciano" can escape to the "refuge" areas.</p>

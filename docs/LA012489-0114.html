			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE MEMBERS MORE LIBERAL, ADA SAYS  </P> <P> The House of Representatives was more liberal than ever in 1988, signaling good  prospects this year for improving long-neglected social programs, Americans for  Democratic Action said Monday.  </P> <P> While the Senate became more conservative in President Ronald Reagan's final  year in office, liberal voting records were not a handicap for senators seeking  reelection, and a high-ranking liberal, Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), was  chosen to be majority leader, the independent political organization said.  </P> <P> The ADA score card on 20 key issues showed that the House had a record-high  "liberal quotient" of 52% last year, up by a single percentage point from 1987,  while the Senate's rating dropped from 53% in 1987 to 48% in 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Figures Bode Well'  </P> <P> "The prospects for holding President Bush accountable on his campaign pledge to  create a 'kinder, gentler nation' appear excellent," said Marc Pearl, ADA  national director. "The figures bode well for positive action on the critical  issues that even President Bush raised during the campaign: child care,  education and the environment."  </P> <P> Pearl criticized the last Congress for not acting on campaign finance reform, a  minimum wage increase, handgun restrictions, parental leave and further  sanctions against South Africa.  </P> <P> "A new Congress and a new President have the responsibility to restore the  social and economic balance that was so severely shredded during the Reagan  years," Pearl said at a news conference.  </P> <P> "Given the results for 1988, we are optimistic that the 101st Congress will  have the muscle to do it," he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Perfect Records  </P> <P> The ADA said that 24 members of the House and two senators -- Patrick J. Leahy  (D-Vt.) and Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) -- had perfect 100% voting records last  year. Mitchell earned a 95.  </P> <P> In contrast, 25 Republicans in the House received zero ratings, including Jack  Kemp, secretary-designate of housing and urban development. In the Senate, 11  members got a zero from the ADA, including Vice President Dan Quayle.  </P> <P> Overall, the ADA said that Democrats averaged 75% in the House and 72% in the  Senate, compared to 20% scores for Republicans in both chambers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issued Since 1947  </P> <P> The ADA, founded by a group of anti-Communist liberals including Eleanor  Roosevelt and the late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, has been issuing  its congressional score card since 1947. It covers a wide range of issues from  civil rights to foreign policy and is one of the oldest and best-known of  interest-group ratings of liberal and conservative voting patterns.  </P> <P> Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), who has compiled a 100% ADA voting record in  every year since 1982, said that he expects Bush to follow moderate Republican  policies of the kind once championed by the late Nelson A. Rockefeller.  </P> <P> "George Bush's inaugural speech was a Democratic speech," Edwards said in an  interview. "In a quarter-century here, I've never been more encouraged about  world peace, disengaging from the Soviet Union and finding money for these  starving social programs. The Cold War's over."  </P></p>

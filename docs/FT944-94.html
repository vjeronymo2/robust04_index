			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Japan's current account Japan's trade surplus should shrink in coming years. The yen's appreciation will make exports increasingly expensive. Imports should rise as the economy recovers and products arrive from factories recently built elsewhere in Asia by Japanese companies. But the current account surplus is likely to remain contentiously large. Japan's net foreign asset position should surpass Dollars 800bn in the next 12 months and could rise above Dollars 1,000bn by the end of the century. This means that net income could rise from about Dollars 40bn to as much as Dollars 90bn by the year 2000, rather than the figure of Dollars 1000bn erroneously mentioned in Thursday's Lex Column.</p>

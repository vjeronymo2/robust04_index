			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / CBI Distributive Trades Survey: Retailers report dismal sales levels BRITISH RETAILERS suffered dismal high street sales last month and do not expect consumer confidence to recover before the end of the year. Sales volumes remained below last year's for the third consecutive month in spite of a slight improvement on July's particularly poor figures. The latest survey of distributive trades from the Confederation of British Industry also showed a sharp drop in activity for wholesalers and poor sales for car dealers. It confirmed that retailers have had a troubled summer as rising unemployment and high debt levels have hit spending power. The poor outlook for Britain's high streets has apparently worsened over the past three months. According to the survey, a modest upward trend in the annual growth rate of sales since the beginning of the year was reversed in June when sales volumes slipped below the levels of a year before. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trade panel, said: 'While high street sales have improved compared with the dismal trading conditions in July, it is difficult to see a resumption of the underlying improve-ment reported earlier in the year.' Mr Whittaker said shops were now burdened with stock levels that were too high in relation to expected demand. 'Shops have continued to cut back sharply on orders placed with their suppliers as they try to reduce the build-up in stocks since the beginning of the year,' he explained. That accounted for wholesalers' sluggish trade last month. They reported the sharpest annual fall in sales since March last year and expect another fall this month. Within retailing, footwear, furniture and carpet stores reversed July's decline in sales, reporting that trade last month was higher than a year before. Grocers, who until recently had weathered the recession relatively well, said sales last month had flattened out compared with a year ago, while chemists' sales slowed. Off-licences saw sales drop sharply below the levels of a year before. Clothing and DIY retailers said volumes continued to fall, while sales of electrical and other household goods remained flat. Sales for motor traders were disappointing in August - a month that generally accounts for a quarter of their annual trade. Although volumes were up on August last year, they were poor for the time of year. Other findings of the survey - conducted between August 17 and September 2, and covering 15,000 retail, wholesale and motor trade outlets - included: More than two thirds of retailers expect the situation to stay the same over the next three months, but on balance wholesalers and motor traders expect things to worsen. Investment intentions have weakened over the past three months. Retailers, wholesalers and motor traders reported that they intended to invest less over the coming year. The rate of job shedding, compared with a year ago, has intensified, with motor traders reporting the sharpest cuts. In May, wholesalers reported a rise in employment but trends have now reversed sharply. There was a significant reduction in the annual rate of price increases. Wholesalers reported the sharpest reduction in price inflation. The share of deliveries accounted for by imports has remained broadly unchanged over the past year. However, import penetration in retailing rose faster last month than when it was surveyed in May. For wholesaling and the motor trades, import penetration fell.</p>

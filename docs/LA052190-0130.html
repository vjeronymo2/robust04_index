Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> THANK YOUR PARENTS, COSBY SAYS  </P> <P> Bill Cosby told University of Notre Dame graduates to be grateful to their  parents.  </P> <P> "How did you come to live so long?" the 52-year-old comedian asked on Sunday.  </P> <P> "Because they let you live," he answered to applause and laughter from the  2,400 students, parents and faculty members.  </P> <P> Cosby, who has a doctorate in education, received an honorary doctor of laws  degree from the university.  </P> <P> "With all of my heart and soul, I want all of you to understand that what you  call the world out there is rough," he said.  </P> <P> "It's rough not only in terms of your job but in terms of your personal  relationships. You'll have many, many friends, but if your relationship with  your mate is 100% of your heart, you'll never need a friend."  </P></p>

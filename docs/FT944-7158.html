'Competing interests (in Russia) have not adhered to the necessary disciplines and have been leaking diamonds on to the open market in contravention of the contracts with the Central Selling Organisation,' he complained. This placed Russia 'in the role of competitor with the other diamond producers'. But De Beers had dealt with similar problems in the past 60 years 'and on each occasion the CSO and the industry have emerged stronger than before'.</p>

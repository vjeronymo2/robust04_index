			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Spending on rail 'lags most of Europe' Britain is investing less in its rail network than nearly all other western European countries, says a survey of 12 countries by Rail Business Report, an annual review. Of the total Ecu120bn (Pounds 91bn) investment planned by European railways over the next 10 years, Germany will spend Ecu62bn and France Ecu20bn although spending per mile will be greatest in the Netherlands and Switzerland. Only Finland will spend less per mile than Britain. British Rail will spend Ecu4.4bn or Ecu425,000 per mile when projects such as the Pounds 3bn Channel tunnel link, the Pounds 2.5bn London Crossrail scheme and the Pounds 600m west coast main-line upgrading have been excluded. There are no guarantees that the private sector will be willing to finance these programmes, the report says. Even if these projects were included Britain would still rank only seventh in the European league table. Consultants Steer, Davis and Gleave have been appointed to assess the impact of electrifying the London-Sheffield main line. The assessment will consider non-railway effects, including the likely impact on road transport. Such studies were previously confined to railway-related issues.</p>

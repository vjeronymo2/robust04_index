			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Benefit rules 'hit job take-up' The rules and administration of the social security system discourage unemployed people from taking up part-time, casual and low-paid jobs, a study from the Commission on Social Justice says today. The commission, set up by the Labour party to review the welfare state, attacks claims that over-generous benefits discourage the unemployed from taking jobs. It says that it is the inflexibility of the benefit system which 'locks' thousands of people out of an increasingly flexible labour market. Unemployed people who accept a low-paid job lose income support and must wait several weeks before they can receive family credit, the means-tested benefit for low-income families. The risk that the benefit might be refused or withdrawn creates insecurity about re-entering the labour market. The study also says that the partners of unemployed and low-paid men are discouraged from seeking work by the rules for paying benefits. The extra earnings of the wife reduce the amount of benefits the husband receives and can leave the family worse off after paying for travel to work and any childcare costs. As a result, the majority of wives of unemployed men do not work and unemployed men try to find jobs that pay enough to keep the whole family, since they cannot afford to accept lower-paid jobs. The study says that most unemployed people want work, but are looking for an income that will meet their household needs. The study offers a series of policy options to encourage people to take any form of paid work by ensuring that this leads to higher incomes. These include extending housing benefit to low-paid people with mortgages and changes to the benefit rules to encourage wives to go out to work. Flexibility in Work and Benefits.

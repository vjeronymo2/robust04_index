			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said that signs have  been detected through various sources that North Korea has  recently been conducting tests for detonators of nuclear bombs.  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said this today at a meeting of  Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers and local chapter chairmen.  He said that although there were no signs of North Korea having  conducted nuclear testing to determine the success of nuclear  weapons development, he has obtained, from various sources,  signs that North Korea has been conducting tests of detonators  used in exploding nuclear bombs. Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae  said that North Korea must therefore have developed a nuclear  explosion device at least to an elementary stage.    Regarding North Korea's recent military moves, Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae said: North Korea has continued  provocative demonstrations by conducting inspections assessing  the combat-readiness of the entire armed forces under the  supervision of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces since the  middle of last April and by having its party Military Commission  begin inspections confirming its war preparedness posture.    Defense Minister Yi said that in the event of North Korean  provocation, the ROK will prevent it from spreading into an  all-out war with an immediate and powerful counterattack.  Saying that the Defense Ministry is keeping an eye on all the  North Korean moves through thorough intelligence activities, he  disclosed 13 military intelligence photographs of the North  Korean area, including the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon.</p>

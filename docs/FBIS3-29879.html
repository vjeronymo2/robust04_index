The two  sides have already reached agreement on control transfer points.  Last week, they agreed on beyond-point rights where South Korea  would connect to Europe from Beijing while China would fly to  the United States via Seoul, the officials said.    They also agreed on letting multiple airlines serve the  Seoul- Beijing route from both countries, allowing Asiana and  Korean Air to fly into the Chinese capital. While China is  expected to service only Seoul, South Korean carriers are likely  to acquire other destinations such as Qingdao, Dalian and  Shenyang, according to the officials. "Technical questions  remain, however, and they are issues for airline companies and  transportation authorities to handle," said one official.    The technical issues deal mostly with industrial profits as  South Korean companies are likely to earn more than their  Chinese competitors on the Seoul-Beijing route, officials said.  Chinese authorities are said to be asking for special measures  to balance out the profit margins.</p>

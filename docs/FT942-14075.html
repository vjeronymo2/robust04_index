			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freeport rescues Indonesian smelter plan Freeport McMoRan of the US has stepped in to salvage Indonesia's USDollars 500m copper smelter project that was threatened by the financial collapse of Metallgesellschaft of Germany. Freeport said it would take over the lead role to build a 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes smelter at Gresik, near the industrial port of Surabaya. Freeport said that Nippon Mining, which was previously involved, was still interested in joining the project, as were a number of other companies. It pointed out that the Indonesian smelter, which could come into operation during 1998, would be guaranteed a long-term supply of concentrate (an intermediate material) from Freeport Indonesia, which by 1996 would be producing at an annual rate of 499,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate and 1.5m troy ounces of gold. Freeport is also to spend Dollars 215m to expand annual capacity at its recently-acquired Huelva smelter in Spain from 150,000 to 270,000 tonnes by early 1996. It said that if, as planned, Freeport Indonesia supplied half the concentrates required by the two smelters, that would represent about 50 per cent of its output from 1996 onwards.</p>

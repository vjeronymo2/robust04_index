			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARTISTS IN ACTION DEDICATES ITS TALENTS -- AND ITS SECOND PLAY'S PROFITS -- TO  GREENPEACE  </P> <P> Actress Diana Karanikas was last seen in the film "Deadgirls." Her boyfriend,  producer Jackson Harvey, has done "Season of Fear," "Night of the Demons" and  "Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog."  </P> <P> They don't mind working on slasher horror movies -- to have entertainment work  at all in Hollywood is a good sign -- but they wanted to use their talents to  promote causes they believe in. So they gathered a group of a dozen actors and  formed Artists in Action Inc. Their second fund-raising play begins this  weekend, with the profits going to Greenpeace, an international environmental  action group.  </P> <P> "In this age of sitcom television and Rambo-style movies, it's hard to do work  that is socially relevant," said Harvey, 32.  </P> <P> "And most of us don't have the money to give out large donations to causes, or  have the time to volunteer in all the various organizations, so this was a  perfect way to put our talents to work and hone our craft at the same time,"  said Karanikas, 26, who has also appeared in mainstream films such as "Nothing  in Common" and "Risky Business."  </P> <P> "I used to send out a $25 check to the Sierra Club and it didn't seem to make  any difference to me, but now I feel like I'm actively getting the word out to  people who wouldn't normally know or hear about these groups or these issues,"  Harvey said.  </P> <P> At the group's first fund-raiser last summer, which benefited Heal the Bay, the  troupe performed "The Plight of the Lesser Sawyer's Cricket." It was also  broadcast on a local cable television channel, EZ-TV, where pledges were  sought. They earned $250 for the cause after expenses were paid, but Harvey  said, "It seems like just a little, but it was only our first try." The actors  are paid a small fee based on a percentage of the gross, and the shows give  them exposure and theater credits.  </P> <P> Greenpeace spokesman David Wakeling said fund-raisers such as these may reach a  different variety of people and could encourage some of the audience to get  involved. During intermission, brochures are passed out, T-shirts are sold and  audience members find themselves discussing the topical social issues of the  day. Artists in Action expects to expand its fund raising to groups helping  causes such as women's issues, human rights, AIDS, abortion rights,  homelessness, animal rights, anti-censorship, poverty, alcohol rehabilitation  and mental health.  </P> <P> The next step is to find corporate sponsorship for Artists in Action and  possibly attract name actors to appear in the shows.  </P> <P> The current play, "Puntilla and His Hired Man," is an absurd comedy by Bertolt  Brecht written in the 1930s, and the humor is still relevant for today's  audiences.  </P> <P> Stand-up comic Kerry Burke, best known for his 3-year role as Larry on the  daytime soap opera "Ryan's Hope," plays the bombastic, obnoxious heavy-drinking  Puntilla who is put in his place by his handsome and wise chauffeur, played by  Dean Stuart.  </P> <P> Performing with Artists in Action is more than just another acting gig. Gail A.  Lynch, who plays one of Puntilla's sleazy fiancees in this play, said her work  with the group has been rewarding because they are "dedicated to improving the  environment, which is something I firmly believe in."  </P> <P> Lynch, a Pennsylvania native who moved to Los Angeles three years ago and  became an instant environmentalist, said, "Sure, I get into all the recycling  and all that, but it's nice to translate that to your job too."  </P> <P> Newcomer Katie Amstutz, who plays one of the show's many dual roles as a stuffy  telephone operator and a shy maid, said, "So many of my friends complain about  things and don't do anything about it. I know people who have gotten rashes  from swimming in the ocean, but they don't really know how to get involved in  solving some of the problems. When they come to this show, they will learn how  to."  </P> <P> Other actors in the 2-hour, 45-minute performance include Janeece Flint,  Michael McNeill and Dan Navratil.  </P> <P> The plays that Harvey chooses to produce have nothing to do with the cause  Artists in Action is supporting. He said he picks plays for entertainment  value.  </P> <P> In "Puntilla," Harvey cast Karanikas in the role of a spoiled independent woman  who is humiliated while she is being taught how to pull off a man's boots,  cater to him and darn his socks.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure this would have been appropriate as a fund-raiser for a women's  group," Harvey joked. "We don't want message plays, necessarily, but something  that is enjoyable."  </P> <P>  "Puntilla and His Hired Man" will be performed at the Flight Theater at The  Complex, 6472 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, on Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.  and Sundays at 2 and 8 p.m. Through Dec. 2. Tickets are $12. For reservations,  call (213) 464-2124 or (213) 913-1273.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] A news conference by the leader of the Liberal  Democratic Party faction was held on the results of the Council  of Europe session, at which Vladimir Zhirinovskiy sharply  opposed the possible signing by Russia of NATO's Partnership for  Peace program.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I am glad that our country's  political leadership has made a correct step in this regard.  For the first time in the four months since the State Duma'  started working, we can react positively to President Yeltsin's  steps on his refusal to go to Brussels to sign the document  which is called the Partnership for Peace program. Lovely words  -- Partnership for Peace -- anyone would think, but in fact it  is an ideological trap. The more paper we sign, the more  European and international structures we climb aboard, the more  we will be taken by the throat and forced to implement documents  they create. [end recording]    [Kuznetsova] There was a short silence and then Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy tackled the Serbian question.    [Begin Zhirinovskiy recording] I am fully on the side of the  Serbs. The Serbs are victims of aggression. What is happening  in the Balkans today is a scenario for the gradual annihilation  of Russia. The Americans are (?trying it out) on a small  region. Just like the Russians in Russia -- the former USSR --  so it is with the Serbs in Yugoslavia. [end recording]    [Kuznetsova] A statement was made that henceforth the party  will use the title Zhirinovskiy's Party, since Boris Fedorov,  the leader of a new political formation, called it the Liberal  Democratic Union of 12 December.</p>

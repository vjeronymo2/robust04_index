			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Technical and political influences move bourses THE CORPORATE results season had to contend with technical and political influences on bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT withstood its first-ever 'quadruple witching hour' covering the multiple expiry of futures and options contracts, with effects which were obvious to the aficionados, but not marked in blue chip share price terms. Opening prices were clearly higher in Frankfurt, said Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. At the close the DAX was 11.67 higher on the day, and 0.2 per cent up on the week at 1,736.30 after gains of 3.65 and 0.1 per cent respectively for the FAZ at 704.44. The firmer start seemed to indicate that futures players had long positions in the expiring March DAX future. Then, as DAX option contracts were settled in the last few minutes, the index fell by around four points from an earlier high of just over 1,740. Underlying that, said Mr Wiecking, was a rise in companies which could look forward to better earnings in the US, or export margins on the strength of the higher dollar. In chemicals, Hoechst especially comes into this category, and led the big three higher with a rise of DM4.30 to DM259.60. Carmakers, favoured for similar reasons, saw BMW DM6.30 higher at DM560.80. Among special situations, Continental, the tyremaker, had one of its occasional days in the sun with a rise of DM8.30 to DM247.70 reflecting improving fundamentals, the dollar and the possibility that stock is still being accumulated with the abortive takeover approach from Pirelli still a very recent memory. In retailing, Asko took its gain on the week to DM100, or 13.7 per cent on the latest, bullish projections from its management. The stock is 37 per cent above its low for the year, and analysts are suggesting that profit-taking is in order. STOCKHOLM was mixed on a variety of corporate results as the Affarsvarlden General index rose 2.0 to 1,009.7, 2.4 per cent higher on the week. Asea B rose another SKr6 to SKr356 on Wednesday's good results from its jointly owned operating company, ABB, and Volvo B closed SKr5 higher at SKr411 after its Thursday report of a fourth-quarterly operating profit, after five consecutive quarterly losses. However, in transport, Bilspedition B dropped SKr10 to SKr43 on an 85 per cent drop in 1991 profits. PARIS brokers said that Sunday's French regional elections kept investors out of the bourse. The CAC-40 index fell 2.87 to 1,919.12, down 1.4 per cent on the week, in light turnover of about FFr1.75bn. Liquid commodities of one sort or another seemed to be active. In oils, Esso climbed another FFr27, or 3.7 per cent to FFr757 in 108,000 shares after Thursday's 3.1 per cent gain on a doubled dividend. But Total fell FFr2.90 to FFr230.10 in 291,650 as it confirmed that its Hutchison unit is looking into buying assets owned by the Italian tyremaker, Pirelli. Perrier dipped by FFr33, or 2.1 per cent to FFr1,546 afterThursday's FFr34 gain, traders citing a report that Agnelli is not interested in a takeover battle with Nestle for the French mineral water group. Another heavy faller was Pernod-Ricard, down FFr26 or 1.7 per cent to FFr1,482 before next week's results. MILAN opened an hour later because of a visit by Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and moved little during the day with volume remaining light. The Comit index shed 2.55 to 511.79, but up 0.2 per cent on the week. Turnover was estimated at L80bn. Pirelli gained L34 or 2.7 per cent to L1,263 on the Total report. ZURICH closed slightly firmer, activity slowing from early hectic trade when expiring Soffex options and futures took prices up to the day's high. The SMI leading share index hit 1,852.9 at one point, but closed only 3.8 higher at 1,837.1, 1,7 per cent higher on the week. Higher profits took Nestle bearers up SFr40 to SFr9,550, and Swissair bearers rose another SFr18 to SFr735 on news that the airline was cutting down the executive board responsible for day-to-day business. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency Index closed little changed, up 0.2 to 125.8, a rise of 0.5 per cent over the week. Elsevier, which reported a 10.8 per cent increase in profits after the close, dipped Fl 1.40 to Fl 114.60, having earlier shown moderate gains. Heineken, which has been performing strongly all week, came off Fl 1.4 to Fl 189.10 as some investors moved in to take profits. Nedlloyd declined a further 2.35 per cent following its midweek announcement that two institutions were converting loans into shares. It finished down Fl 1.4 to Fl 58.00. BRUSSELS fell with the Bel-20 index ending 3.65 lower at 1,200.89, nearly 1 per cent down on the week. Turnover was BFr740m. Clabecq, the steelmaker, fell BFr190 or 10 per cent to BFr1,660 after its announcement on Thursday of larger than expected half-year losses. ISTANBUL rose for the third consecutive day, although many investors remained cautious, fearing violence ahead of today's Kurdish new year. The 75-share index advanced 67.52 to 3,990.61, an increase of 3.4 per cent on the week. MADRID rose slightly with the general index slipping back 0.17 to 258.38, for a fall of 0.7 per cent over the week. VIENNA drifted lower in thin volume, the ATX index closing down 3.81 to 1,046.46; but it was 2 per cent up on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 20  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1153.00  1154.21  1154.43  1154.38  1155.19  1154.42  1153.95  1153.93  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1155.59    Day's Low  1153.00  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Mar 19    Mar 18    Mar 17    Mar 16    Mar 13      1153.18   1153.82   1151.88   1145.61   1154.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

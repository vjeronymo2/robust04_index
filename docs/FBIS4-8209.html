			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav </F> Jovanovic by Dragan Colovic in Belgrade on 11 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Colovic] Minister Jovanovic, last night and again  this afternoon, Serb positions around Gorazde were bombed by the  NATO air force under the auspices of the international  organization. This event is in the center of attention now. We  would like your comments on this event?    [Jovanovic] As the Federal Government has already said in  its statement, we deeply regret this act of the international  organization, which used NATO to legitimize an act of aggression  against the Serbian people and to carry out air strikes on the  territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina close to our borders.  The international organization has significantly compromised  itself with this act and [words indistinct] for continuing the  role of peacekeeper and impartial arbiter in the otherwise  complex and contradictory Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    We are deeply concerned about this irresponsible and risky  act, which borders on a military adventure because it actually  marks the crossing of the Rubicon, after which nothing is clear  any longer and nothing can be foreseen with any degree of  certainty. We believe that those who have made this decision  will soon realize their mistake and will withdraw the decision  on the further engagement of NATO air power. For us, this act  presents not only a threat to the peace process and a hindrance  to the negotiations that should lead to the signing of an  agreement on the absolute cessation of all hostilities, but also  a new, very dangerous escalation whose consequences cannot in  practice be entirely calculated and for which the international  organization has taken all the responsibility. On the other  hand, Gorazde has been taken as a reason and excuse for the  engagement of NATO military forces, while at the same time,  nothing is said as to why in this so-called safe haven Muslim  forces still have not been demilitarized, and why Gorazde, as a  zone, has been used as a [word indistinct] for the beginning of  a massive military offensive by the east Bosnian corps against  the Serbs in a number of places, and not only in the immediate  vicinity of Gorazde.    Therefore, if anyone has violated the provisions of the  agreement and the resolution on safe havens, and certain  provisions of the [UN] Charter, then it is precisely those who  have called upon NATO to act. Therefore, no one can deny that  with this act, NATO and the international organization have  interfered in the civil war on one side and against the Serb  side. All this greatly complicates the situation and makes it  difficult to maintain the peace process and revive it with  greater chances of ending the war and reaching a lasting  political solution.    [Colovic] Yes. Mr. Jovanovic, I would like to ask you one  thing. What do you expect of other international factors that  have not been consulted on all of this -- I have Russia  primarily in mind. President Yeltsin's statement implies that  the UN Security Council was not even consulted on all of this?    [Jovanovic] Not only was it not consulted, it was  circumvented. Certain provisions of a certain resolution were  applied here that allegedly authorize the secretary general and  other high officials of the international organization in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to make the decision to use NATO forces on  the spot. This is only one of the many interpretations possible,  and whenever you have the possibility of diverse  interpretations, it means that the one that has been highlighted  is not enough to warrant making such an important decision.  [sentence as heard] As far as I know, Russia objected to the  NATO ultimatum [on Sarajevo] for precisely the same reasons, and  I take President Yeltsin's statement as a continuation of  Russia's dissatisfaction that the Security Council has been  circumvented, and in this way, the voice and opinion of Russia  as a great European and world power that has historical and  other interests in its Balkan neighborhood.    On the other hand, with these hazardous actions, the world  organization itself has rather facilely become an instrument for  the realization of aims and interests of the individual great  powers and a group of countries, which is also a dangerous  precedent as this could be repeated tomorrow in some other  situation and in other places. Therefore, it is time for the  international community, above all the smaller and medium-sized  countries, seriously to study this problem and ask themselves  where the international community is heading and what such  irresponsible behavior means from an organization whose main aim  is to preserve peace and security, that is, to carry out a  peace-making role, and not expand military activities and  escalate a civil war that threatens to assume the proportions of  a wider-scale confrontation. Therefore, we want to believe that  reason will nevertheless prevail in the minds of those who so  irresponsibly headed into an adventure, and that they will also  realize that peace cannot be reached through war, but through  peace, and particularly through stopping any kind of war.  Therefore we support the demands by the Bosnian Serbs, as well  as all other people who advocate an immediate, unconditional,  and lasting end to all hostilities throughout the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is the only way to start finding a  political solution to the crisis on the basis of equal respect  for the legitimate interests and rights of all three constituent  peoples. This is the only alternative to this gloomy  development, which gathered speed with yesterday's and  (?today's) military attacks on Serb positions and Serb-populated  places in this part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because the  alternative to peace that I am speaking about is a continuation  of war, which nobody can consider a joyful prospect and nobody  can profit from, not even these who crossed the Rubicon when  they decided in favor of this adventure.    [Colovic] Yes. What are your expectations in the coming  hours and days?    [Jovanovic] Despite all the dramatic events, one must retain  both presence of mind and a cool head. After all, these air  strikes, as much as their form and gesture denote an act of  aggression, are nevertheless virtually limited to a few NATO  aircraft that appear and carry out the destruction and killing  of civilians of Serbian nationality. This shows that at this  moment, the tactic of pressure is dominant in the other side's  thinking. On the other hand, there is the presence of Mr.  Churkin, special envoy to President Yeltsin, who has visited  Belgrade today and has already gone to Pale, where he will try  to repeat his role of a useful bridge between the opposing sides  with a view to overcoming this tense situation as well.  Finally, in this civil war, everybody can do much evil to  others, but nobody can do I do not know how much evil and  thereby benefit from it himself. These advocates of war in  Sarajevo on the East River and in Brussels are finally going to  realize that because, after all, any policy is carried out with  a view to benefiting from it, and not exclusively to doing harm  to the other side.    [Colovic] You mentioned Mr. Churkin, who is visiting Pale  and who will be talking about this with Serb republic officials.  We would like to hear from you what the Government of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will offer in this direction, in  the direction of peace.    [Jovanovic] In the announcement that I hope has already been  issued to the public, we reiterate the consistent policy of  peace, cooperation, and the political solutions to all disputes,  including the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On that line we are  ready to give full support and help to all efforts, wherever  they may come from, directed to reducing the present tension, to  ending all the hostilities, and establishing a just and lasting  peace. This resoluteness of ours has not been abandoned even  after this latest aggression. On the contrary, it has gained in  topicality, significance, and strength because it has almost  turned into a lighthouse in the darkness that has come in the  wake of this unreasonable decision of the top officials of the  world organization and NATO to start this adventure. We expect  Russia and the other countries that kept their political  presence of mind and rational reasoning about the entire  situation to make their full contribution and help those people  who have refused to use their reasoning and view the world with  realistic eyes more easily to see their mistake and return to  the only possible line leading to a way out of this crisis, to a  reduction of tension, an end to hostilities, and a return to  negotiations as the only means for finding way out of the  Bosnian crisis.    [Colovic] Thank you, Minister Jovanovic.    [Jovanovic] Not at all, Mr. Colovic.</p>

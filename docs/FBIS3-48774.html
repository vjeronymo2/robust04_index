Manae Kubota, Economic Planning Agency director general,  called for maximum efforts both by the ruling coalition and the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party to reach a compromise on  political reforms before the current Diet session ends Saturday.  But even if such a compromise was not reached, the government  should not give up fulfilling its minimum responsibility of  achieving the task of reviving the ailing economy, she told a  regular news conference.    Kubota said she hopes a joint economic forum between the  government and parties in the ruling coalition will meet this  weekend, regardless of whether political reform bills are  scrapped.    She also said the cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa  should not resign even if the reform bills fail to secure Diet  passage, because such an action would not serve the interests of  the Japanese people.    In view of the current political confusion, formation of the  main budget for fiscal 1994 will be delayed "substantially,"  Kubota said. She urged the government to bring in another  supplementary budget, which would be the third for fiscal 1993,  ending March 31.</p>

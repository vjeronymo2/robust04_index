			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONS OF THE HEMISPHERE FIND COMMITMENT TO DEMOCRACY TESTED  </P> <P> As the tragic events in Panama move the United States toward a historic  confrontation, the moment has arrived for the nations of the Americas to act  through the Organization of American States.  </P> <P> There is no ambiguity about the current issues. Gen. Manuel A. Noriega tried to  use the instruments of democracy to mock democracy. He failed. His failure has  been witnessed by the entire world. Exit polls conducted under the auspices of  the Roman Catholic church have affirmed the will of the Panamanian people in  favor of the opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara. Two former U.S.  Presidents, Republican Gerald R. Ford and Democrat Jimmy Carter, have confirmed  the observations of all election observers that a clumsy election fraud was  perpetrated. The outrageous brutality of last week, attacking the opposition  leaders and other people with steel rods and iron pipes, demonstrates that the  Panamanian military, led by Gen. Noriega, is at war with its own people. The  aggression is as real as the more traditional aggressions by other states, only  in this case it is by another, more insidious foe, an international drug Mafia.  </P> <P> The nations of the Americas know that the United States has vital national  interests in Panama. They are real and deeply felt. But it is no longer only  the Panama Canal. Two other issues give the tragedy its full meaning: drugs and  democracy. Given the circumstances, President Bush has done well with his  measured response in order to give the nations of the hemisphere time to accept  regional responsibility.  </P> <P> Democracies in Latin America are especially vulnerable to armies with guns.  Unless they show resolve, no democracy is safe. In this case, we are in direct  confrontation with one of the major drug criminals in the world who holds an  entire nation hostage. Past Latin American hesitancy to countenance  intervention in internal matters meets a severe test in the unique  circumstances in Panama. A coherent hemispheric policy in favor of democracy in  which all of the nations participate is the best protection that Latin America  could have against unilateral action.  </P> <P> This is the role for the Organization of American States. Unless it stands for  hemispheric cooperation in defense of freedom and democracy, it stands for  nothing. The words of its charter couldn't be clearer. "The true significance  of American solidarity . . . can only mean the consolidation on this continent  . . . of democratic institutions, of a system of individual liberty and social  justice based on respect for the essential rights of man . . . The solidarity  of the American States and the high aims which are sought through it require  the political organization of those States on the basis of representative  democracy."  </P> <P> The Rio Treaty is equally unequivocal. It states that "the American regional  community affirms . . . that peace is founded on . . . the international  recognition and protection of human rights and freedoms . . . and on the  effectiveness of democracy for the international realization of justice and  security." It adds that "the obligation of mutual assistance . . . is  essentially related to their democratic ideals."  </P> <P> Contrary to popular mythology, the nations of the hemisphere have repeatedly  taken firm action for democracy when faced with blatant abuse of power. Ten  years ago, through the OAS, they took the courageous step to condemn the  dictatorship of Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza by clearly asking him to step  down. They did the same in the case of the military coup in Bolivia a year  later. Throughout the 1970s, the OAS was the major force to focus attention on  human rights abuses in the hemisphere.  </P> <P> Today, as President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela has recognized in his call  for hemispheric action, the OAS has been given another chance. All the rules  and the precedents are in place. It is the nations of the hemisphere that bear  a heavy responsibility. The OAS is but an euphemism. It is the American  governments themselves, nothing more, nothing less. The challenge is whether  they are prepared to deal with serious issues on a multilateral basis. Will  they move to affirm their commitment to democracy in substance as well as in  rhetoric? From the Latin American point of view, the United States could not  have adopted a better stance to give them time to do what they have always  claimed they were ready to do.  </P> <P> A wide range of measures -- diplomatic, economic and political -- are available  to help force Noriega from power. It would be difficult for anyone to criticize  action to fulfill the will of the Panamanian people and place in power the  president they have honestly elected. In recent years, the people of all the  nations of the Americas have repeatedly staked their lives to affirm their  commitment to democracy. The OAS will not get a better second chance.  </P></p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Paktel investment PAKTEL, Pakistan's largest mobile telephone company, plans to invest up to Dollars 20m in improving quality of transmission, subject to availability of more frequencies and wave bands, writes Farhan Bokhari. Paktel was set up at a cost of Dollars 60m more than two years ago. It is a joint project between Cable and Wireless, which has an 80 per cent stake, and Karachi-based Hasan group, which has the remainder. The company is one of two which have set up mobile telephone businesses in Pakistan. Although market size remains limited, mobile telephones have provided a new opportunity for many businesses and industries to consider plans for setting up facilities in suburban and rural areas, where poor telecommunications previously deterred investors. The Pakistani government says that there are 2,500 mobile telephone subscribers in Pakistan. Paktel says that it holds 65 per cent share of the market.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Nato blessing for the Euro-corps FRANCE and Germany yesterday signed an agreement with Nato on how their planned 'Euro-corps' of some 35,000 soldiers could operate within the Atlantic alliance, and invited other European countries to join the force. This was the most concrete achievement of a day set aside by Paris and Bonn to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Franco-German treaty, which since the era of De Gaulle and Adenauer has generated a series of advances in European integration. President Francois Mitterrand flew to Bonn to join Chancellor Helmut Kohl in lauding Franco-German ties as a model relationship between countries. But at the ceremony in Bonn's new national art gallery, the German leader warned that western Europe could still not consider itself safe from the evils of nationalism. 'The ghost of nationalism is not just at home in the Balkans,' said Mr Kohl. With Germany in particular plagued by a racist backlash against immigration, there was still a danger of 'a relapse into intolerance and chauvinism'. A joint statement by Mr Pierre Joxe and Mr Volker Ruhe, defence ministers of France and Germany respectively, invited 'our partners in Europe to participate in the (army) corps, because France and Germany do not consider their co-operation as exclusive'. The Euro-corps, to be formed out of the nucleus of the current Franco-German brigade and based in Strasbourg by 1995, initially worried Washington, because it appeared to rival Nato commitments. Yesterday's accord, signed between General John Shalikashvili, the top Nato and US commander in Europe, and the German and French chiefs of staff, allows Nato to call on the Euro-corps in time of crisis. But, at French insistence, Nato commanders must deploy the Euro-corps as a unit and not split it up. With a link to Nato now established, the Euro-corps may now attract wider participation. Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg have expressed interest in joining it. The most spectacular example of recent Franco-German co-operation has come in the form of Bundesbank support for the French franc, when it was under speculative attack. Mr Kohl reaffirmed backing for France's fight to keep the franc's parity with the D-Mark.</p>

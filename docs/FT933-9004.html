			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Stretching the gap The contrast between yesterday's exuberance in the equity market and the caution of industrialists is startling. Perhaps it is because CBI members do not spend enough time looking at the plummeting gilt yield curve. Doubters may question how rapidly a rising gilt market will aid recovery, but it is certainly having a powerful impact on investment flows. Low returns on cash and falling gilt yields are pushing both private and professional investors towards shares. Indeed, it seems that domestic fund managers have not been in the van of the recent charge. Private investors, overseas funds and bank buying in the gilts market have swelled the cash flow through the London markets. Those UK fund managers and market makers who were left behind have doubtless contributed to the snap move of the FT-SE 100 index above 3,000. Still, while some investment criteria suggest that the rally can go further, there are disturbing signs that valuations are stretched. Share ratings have reached levels which are not justified by even the medium-term earnings outlook. Those companies which have already released figures for the first half of the year consistently report sluggish underlying business conditions. Current valuations do not look supportable without 15 per cent compound earnings growth until at least 1995. Granted, the economy got low interest rates without the threat of inflation after last year's devaluation. That may not be enough once market participants lower their eyes from the blue skies of economic statistics and start to pick through the nitty gritty of company results.</p>

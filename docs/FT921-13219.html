			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Ailing Tokyo contractor in stake talks A LEADING Japanese home-builder, Misawa Homes, is negotiating with an ailing contractor, Ishihara Construction, over a rehabilitation plan. The scheme is likely to include the taking of a 20 per cent stake in Ishihara, which has been weakened by links to failed property developers. The negotiations reflect the reluctance of Japanese banks to allow leading clients to fail. Ishihara is listed on the second section of the Tokyo exchange, and its bankers, including Mitsubishi Trust and Mitsubishi Bank, had apparently been seeking a partner to assist in its restructuring. Misawa Homes has remained strong in spite of the downturn in Japan's property market over the past year. Mr Fumichika Ishihara, president of Ishihara Construction, said the Misawa group was the most likely of the four candidates seeking a capital tie-up with his company, which has debts estimated at Y110bn (Dollars 863m). Ishihara Construction was closely linked to Kyowa Corporation, a bankrupt steel frame builder and property developer at the centre of a political scandal last week for its large donations to the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Fumio Abe, a former Japanese cabinet minister, was arrested for allegedly taking bribes from Kyowa, which collapsed owing more than Y200bn in late 1990.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] The initiative by U.S. Congressman Charles Rangel in  presenting a bill that would normalize trade relations with Cuba  has the [words indistinct] and the courage to do so. It has also  put on the front page the debate over whether it is advisable  for the United States to continue following the schemes of the  Cold War or to modify its views and values and adopt a more  realistic policy in a different world.    Can any intelligent person in the United States continue  arguing that Cuba presents or represents a threat to the  national security of the world's greatest military power? If one  were to make an objective analysis one would see that none of  the conditions, claimed to have existed by nine U.S.  Administrations in order to apply, maintain, and even strengthen  the blockade against our country, currently exist.    As a matter of fact, the events that they used in the past  were not modified to please or to acquiesce to a policy of  pressure but as a result of factors that exclusively involve  Cuba and the countries with whom it maintained the determined  commitments which Washington considered dangerous for its  security, demanding their cancellation. Our presence in Africa,  and the presence in Cuba of some units from the former Soviet  Union were not ended because our country was acquiescing to U.S.  pressures, but because of sovereign decisions between the  parties involved.    Maybe it was the unwavering position that Cuba has  maintained  and will maintain, or the sharp defense of the national  sovereignty and our right to self determination that provoked  anger among the leading members of the U.S. Administrations. At  one time there was a more appropriate climate for such an  exacerbated position. Today, it has been said that the Cold War  is over. The Soviet Union no longer exists. There is not one  Cuban soldier in Angola, a sovereign decision between those  involved.    Today, the most fierce sectors of the counterrevolution in  Florida are losing their influence very rapidly. An important  sector of the Cuban emigres wants dialogue; it does not accept  the blockade. They claim to have other values and interests. A  more rational attitude is gaining ground among intellectuals,  entrepreneurs, and many U.S. politicians, who do not want to  hear anything about a Cold War, but would prefer to hear of  trade, mutual interests, trips, and tourism.    The fact that such important events coincide is not casual,  but neither is it premeditated. While the bill is presented to  Congress to normalize trade relations with Cuba -- in other  words, end the blockade and the Torricelli Law -- the U.S.-Cuba  Friendship Caravan is among us after successfully completing  their mission of peace and solidarity.    I do not believe the Rangel bill will be passed by Congress.  But, it is a sign of a changing view that gains strength in the  United States and that will end up isolating those with  nostalgia for the Cold War and the big stick policy.</p>

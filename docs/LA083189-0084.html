			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE PILES TAINTED SOIL NEAR FREEWAY  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation has dumped 2,000 tons of  lead-contaminated soil on an embankment near the Ventura Freeway about 10 miles  north of Ventura instead of hauling it to an Oxnard landfill as required by  county environmental health authorities, a county spokesman said this week.  </P> <P> The soil, which came from a canyon in the hills above the Rincon, was part of  up to 12,000 tons of contaminated earth that the county had ordered shipped to  the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard three years ago in a major environmental  cleanup.  </P> <P> But a Ventura County environmental inspector, acting on a tip, followed a truck  hauling soil from the canyon and discovered that Caltrans was instead dumping  truckloads of soil in a dirt area between the Old Rincon Highway and the  Ventura Freeway about half a mile north of the Mobil Oil Corp. pier.  </P> <P> Bruce W. Dyar, Caltrans regional manager for Ventura, said he ordered the  dumping on a temporary basis. Dyar said he planned to transfer the soil to the  Oxnard landfill within several days.  </P> <P> Dyar said he ordered the dirt dumped there because a contract with a trucking  company to haul the waste was about to expire.  </P> <P> The county counsel's office is reviewing the dumping with environmental health  officials, but declined to say whether it would recommend the imposition of  penalties against CalTrans.  </P> <P> The county has ordered Caltrans to remove the material from the site near the  freeway and ship it to Bailard. That cleanup will continue into next week.  </P> <P> Terry Gilday, a county Environmental Health Division spokesman, said the soil  is contaminated with low levels of lead that probably would not create a health  hazard for passing bicyclists and others in the area. No residences are nearby.  </P> <P> But he said the dumping posed "a potential hazard to ground water and surface  water." The ocean water near the pier is a popular surfing spot, Gilday said,  and rains could cause the lead to trickle into the ocean or underground water  sources.  </P> <P> "The proper place for it is in a well-managed landfill where there's lots of  controls to keep it from escaping into the environment," Gilday said.  </P> <P> The unauthorized dumping was discovered Aug. 22 after county environmental  health authorities went to the Rincon Canyon area to check on the cleanup of  another unauthorized dump site that may date back 30 years, Gilday said.  </P> <P> About three years ago, the county discovered that Caltrans and the state Parks  and Recreation Department had been dumping brush clippings and waste from roads  and highways in the remote canyon, Gilday said. The clippings were contaminated  with high levels of lead from car exhaust and in turn were contaminating the  soil.  </P> <P> The county ordered the dumping stopped and told Caltrans and the state parks  department to clean up the site. Since then, 10,000 tons have been transported  to Bailard.  </P> <P> The operation was coordinated by Shell Oil Co. and Conoco. The oil companies  agreed to get involved "purely from a P.R. point of view," said Susan King, an  environmental affairs coordinator at Conoco.  </P> <P> Both oil companies deny that they ever dumped anything on the site, which is  owned by Cynthia Wood, the Santa Barbara heiress on whose property California  State University wants to build a Ventura campus.  </P> <P> But Shell once held an oil and gas lease on the site, and Shell and Conoco both  used the land to gain access to other fields that they leased in the area, said  officials with both companies.  </P> <P> Shell and Conoco have also agreed to terrace the Rincon Canyon site and replant  it with native vegetation.  </P> <P> County officials said cleanup of the canyon site has been completed. Final soil  samples will determine whether any contaminated earth remains.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Karmen, did not make home market or third country sales of the subject merchandise. Therefore, we based FMV on constructed value (CV), in accordance with section 773(a)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, Karmen reported that it has an arrangement with a Singaporean company, under which the Singaporean company supplies Karmen with rusty pipe fittings. Karmen reconditions and refurbishes these pipe fittings and exports them to the Singaporean company's U.S. customer. Karmen claims that since the Singaporean company only pays Karmen for the refurbishing, and Karmen does not take title to this merchandise, these sales should not be treated as Karmen sales. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are not treating these refurbished pipe fittings as sales subject to this investigation. We will further examine this issue for purposes of the final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether Sivanandha's or Karmen's sales for export to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Sivanandha's and Karmen's U.S. sales of subject merchandise were made to unrelated purchasers prior to importation into the United States, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated Sivanandha's PP sales based on packed, CIF prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions to the USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, containerization, ocean freight, and marine insurance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with Section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act, we added to Sivanandha's USP the amount of import duties imposed on inputs which were subsequently rebated upon exportation of the finished merchandise to the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We made an adjustment to U.S. price for excise and sales taxes paid on the comparison sales in India, in accordance with our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 834 F.

We made deductions to the USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, containerization, ocean freight and marine insurance. In calculating U.S. credit expense, we used the borrowing rate in the United States on short-term dollar-denominated loans. For a further discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (September 26, 1994) on file in room B&hyph;099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Sivanandha, in order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. As a result, we determined that Sivanandha's home market was viable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted for a excise and sales tax collected in the Indian home market. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the United States Price section of this notice, above.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Karmen, because it sells the subject merchandise only in the U.S. market, we used CV, pursuant to section 773(e) of the Act. We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. imputed credit costs, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act, we: (1) Included the greater of either Karmen's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; (2) used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses for profit. In reporting its CVs, Karmen allocated labor costs and variable manufacturing overhead in such a way as to assign equal amounts for new pipe fittings and refurbished pipe fittings. We believe that the allocation method Karmen used to report CVs results in understating the costs of producing new fittings, because based on our experience in past cases, we would expect that costs incurred in the early production stages would not be incurred in refurbishing fittings. Therefore, we have recalculated these costs by assigning all labor and variable manufacturing overhead costs to the production of new pipe fittings. We will seek additional information on the actual costs for purposes of the final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale (COS) adjustments for differences in movement charges between shipments to the United States and shipments to India. For Sivanandha, we also made COS adjustments for differences in quality inspection charges, credit and advertising expenses. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1), we added U.S. indirect selling expenses as an offset to the home market commission, but capped this addition by the amount of the home market commission. Finally, we deducted home market packing expenses and added U.S. packing expenses to Sivanandha's FMV, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Currency Conversion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We made currency conversions based on the official exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

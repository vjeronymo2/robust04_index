			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil Brazilian equities retreated from earlier highs, following Monday's 8.5 per cent advance, and some commentators forecast that further profit-taking was likely after strong gains in the first half of January. The Bovespa index ended 766, or 1.3 per cent, up on the day at 60,571. Volume was Cr120bn, the highest this month. Some of Brazil's brokerages and banks, however, had difficulty trading as a result of a power blackout in Sao Paulo's financial centre.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello has said it is  clear that the situation in assembly areas is growing worse.  Aldo Ajello said it is urgently necessary to find a solution --  specifically, to close the assembly areas and demobilize the  soldiers. The head of the UN Operations in Mozambique was  reacting to the incident which occurred in the Mocubela assembly  area in Zambezia Province, in which mutinying Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] soldiers detained, stripped, and  assaulted Brigadier Raul Dique, head of that movement's  delegation in the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. The soldiers are  protesting the amount to be paid to the demobilized soldiers and  demanding the full payment of demobilization subsidies when they  are demobilized. The CCF will hold a meeting on 6 June to  discuss the incidents in the assembly areas. The Supervision  and Control Commission will meet on 8 June to assess the issue.</p>

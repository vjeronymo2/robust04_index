			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russia's space industry has a chance to strengthen  its position on the world market. Under an agreement with  Australia, Russia's specialists will play a key role in building  a new international private space launching site. This will be  on one of the islands of Papua New Guinea. The islands are  close to the equator, and that makes it possible to put in orbit  twice as big a payload as that in the more northern and southern  latitude. The launching will be done by Russia's powerful  Proton rocket. The first rocket will be launched from the new  cosmodrome in 1998.</p>

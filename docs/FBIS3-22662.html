			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Feb 2 (AFP) -- More than half the medicine  donated to the World Health Organisation (WHO) for the former  Yugoslavia is unusable, the WHO said in a statement here  Wednesday [2 February].    Around 15 percent of donated medicines had passed their  deadline for use or were otherwise unusable, and 30 percent were  totally inappropriate for the needs of the population, the WHO  said.    Sorting out what medicines could be used had cost WHO and  charity organisations precious time. Carrying the useless  medicines had filled up valuable cargo space in stores, on  aircraft and lorries, the WHO added.    Only medicines which still had more than a year to run to  their expiry date and which are included in the WHO list of  essential drugs should be sent, it said.</p>

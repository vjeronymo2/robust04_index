			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (INA)--Tahir al-Juhaymi, Libyan  minister of economy and finance, has called on Arab countries to  release Iraq's frozen assets from their banks in order to  confront the unfair embargo imposed by an unjust American will.    Al-Juhaymi made a press statement to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY  correspondent in Cairo on the periphery of a meeting held by  Arab financial institutions. He said no law in the world allows  any force to confiscate and freeze other countries' assets, for  any reason. This represents a strong blow to international  laws and norms.    He described the embargo imposed by the United States and  its  allies on Iraq, and the freezing of Iraq's assets, as a negative  turning point in the history of international relations and the  United Nations. This is a full-blown confrontation between the  correct and progressive forces in the world and the incorrect  and colonialist forces on another.    He said the embargo on the Iraqi and Libyan people and the  continuous killing and starving of their sons before the eyes of  the world represents the end of international legitimacy and the  fall of all slogans raised by Western countries and America  about human rights, democracy, and the so-called new world order.    The Libyan economics minister reiterated his country's total  solidarity with the people and Government of Iraq in waging the  fateful battle and their efforts to foil the embargo. He said  he is confident that Iraqi and Libyan victory in the battle will  inevitably be achieved.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Carving a niche for themselves: Susan Moore compares the careers of three craftsmen The contrasting careers of three graduates of the City &amp; Guilds of London Art School illustrate that the late 20th century is more appreciative of the traditional skills of the stone and wood carver and letterer if they belong to an 'artist' rather than a craftsman. Tim Metcalfe is carving a raking knurl - a rope twist to you and me - out of a piece of Ketton limestone surrounding the clock face of Sir George Gilbert Scott's St Pancras Hotel. His clock tower perch is 220ft from the ground, the station forecourt a hoist, a leap over a balcony, and several ladders away. For Metcalfe, replacing the corroded stone and extending the straightforward original design is bread and butter work, 'but best quality bread and butter'. As we took our snakes-and-ladders route across the scaffolding of this grand Gothic Revival facade, Metcalfe pointed out the unorthodox combination of sandstone and limestone, the craftsmanship and richness of the ornament - even in places not destined for the eyes of man. He raises his voice above the sandblasting and the roar of the traffic, and pauses at the occasional thunderclap of rubble emptied down the disposal chute. It is wet and cold, but clearly there is no place he would rather be. Metcalfe, a boyish 48, came to stone carving fairly late. Resisting parental pressure to become a solicitor after public school he tried his hand at most things during an escapist stint in Australia - undertaker's assistant, prawn trawling, gold mining, sapphire digging. He knew only that he wanted to work outdoors with his hands, and hopefully with his brain. In Indonesia he watched wood carvers at work on a door, and decided that was what he wanted to do. Unable to find an apprenticeship when he returned to England, he enrolled on the newly revived stone carving course at the City &amp; Guilds Art School in Kennington, south London. 'It was my salvation,' he claims. 'It was the first time in my life that I found something that I wanted to do. There was  -and is - no greater thrill than whacking into a piece of stone.' On graduating in 1976 he was taken on as Arthur Ayres's assistant at Westminster Abbey. He spent six years working on the north front carving a dozen or so figures and surveying and securing the monuments inside. He still works there off and on. His is a hand-to-mouth existence. Maintaining a steady flow of work is nearly impossible and lean periods are not uncommon. Even at St Pancras where he is the sole stone carver, the work is not continuous. The demise of his ancient and venerable craft saddens him, its death knell the breakdown of the apprenticeship system and the birth of Modernist architecture. Metcalfe is only too aware that he will never begin to match Ayres' experience or knowledge - let alone pass it on. 'Unless we are very careful, these skills will not exist in 20 or 30 years,' he muses. As it is, building contractors increasingly use cheap, unskilled labour for restoration projects. The last stone mason's yard in London closed in May. For the first time in over 1,000 years, there is no London yard cutting, shaping or carving stone. 'We are all waiting for an upsurge in building in stone,' Metcalfe smiles, 'and for a more joyful expression in architecture.' Tim Metcalfe was Alec Peever's contemporary at Kennington. Peever, 39, is a letter cutter and sculptor working in partnership with his wife Fiona, his former apprentice. Seven years ago they exchanged their south London studio for a former milking shed in the Cotswolds. It may be a rural idyll, and Peever may sport a Hollywood-casting craftsman's beard and tousled mane but his is no country crafts operation. Peever had tried various jobs but was always irritated that he was never doing anything he enjoyed. It had always been at the back of his mind that he would like to be a sign painter but everyone had said: 'You had a grammar school education, you can't possibly work with your hands.' He walked into the City &amp; Guilds without any portfolio. His tutor, the German type designer Berthold Wolpe, enveloped them with his passion for the subject. By the time he left he had learned to carve in stone to a rudimentary level. As assistant to the letter carver Richard Kindersley, Peever learnt to carve professionally, and after a year was itching to start on his own. He advertised and took anything he was offered, painting signs for pet shops and garages. It was a rough and ready training. At first he had to persuade people to commission stone lettering. Now, thanks to an increasing awareness of the medium, they are offered an unexpectedly wide range of commissions, from carved titles for TV series and slates cut with poetry for gardens, to pure sculpture. It is the invention rather than the execution that excites. Asked to make a lettering frieze above the tomb of Catherine of Aragon in Peterborough Cathedral, Peever persuaded the authorities to allow him to cast a free-standing frieze from clay and then gild it. Asked to make a commemorative tablet marking the opening of a new primary school, he designed something the children could leapfrog over. Says Peever: 'This job has always had to pay the rent, and latterly pay the mortgage and run two cars.' The business averages 50 commissions a year and a turnover of Pounds 100,000. At 27, Alex Jones is at the start of his career. He works from the Victorian greenhouse of his parents' Queen Anne house near Winchester, Hampshire, surrounded by geraniums and figs, and ineffectually shaded by a gnarled vine. He works outside on benches when it is too hot, his 50 chisels laid out on the bench with a surgeon's neatness. He took a City &amp; Guilds wood carving course after working for a framer off London's King's Road. After an extra year there - 'without apprenticeships these days it is impossible to get the really high standards you need before you go into the marketplace' - and another working with Peter Thurin, a traditional woodcarver, he launched out on his own. An illustration of a carved coat-of-arms in Interiors gained him a string of commissions in the area of interior decoration - cupid coronas for beds, furniture and mirror frames. He makes careful drawings for projects but then casts them aside to work unprepared, like the medieval carver. 'I feel the carving is more alive that way. I like to solve the problems as I go along. It's like going on a journey.' Jones is tired of utilitarian furniture. One of his tables takes the form of an oak tree, its table-top canopy of leaves entwined with carved references to the life of the owner - a watering can, a pheasant, wellies. A mirror takes the form of a trompe l'oeil theatre, his patrons portrayed sitting in a box, their coats of arms carved above the stage. The back of a chair made for an American advertising executive incorporates the New York skyline with an aeroplane circling the Chrysler building. While Jones has never been short of work, he does have difficulty making money. Each commission and its materials are different and require different skills. He has had to re-think his approach and is taking on a traditionally trained wood carver to help him improve, to speed up his carving and to shoulder the bulk of it while he concentrates on design. He detects a new reverence for the work he does: thanks in large part to Lord Linley, saying one's son is a craftsman no longer sends shock waves around a cocktail party. Tim Metcalfe can be contacted on 081-769 4594; Alec &amp; Fiona Peever 0993-868012; Alex Jones 0962-712169. Work by this year's graduates of the City &amp; Guilds is on show at the art school, entrance via the blue door in Cleaver Square SE11, until Monday</p>

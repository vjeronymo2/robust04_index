			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: American Express security quiz - At a glance American Express will be introducing an anti-fraud precaution on its credit cards later this year aimed at preventing the use of cards which are intercepted in the post. When the owner of an Amex card receives it, they will have to telephone an 0800 number within 20 days and answer a number of security questions to verify their identity. The card can then be used. If the card is used before the owner has received it and done the security check, the fraudster will be called to the telephone to answer a series of identification questions.</p>

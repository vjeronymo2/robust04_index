			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Gloomy outlook for EC steel THE EUROPEAN Community's steel industry is benefiting from improved prices and reduced imports from eastern Europe but is still in a 'precarious situation,' according to a confidential European Commission report. 'No improvement or even stabilisation in steel demand can be expected in the short term, nor is an improvement in the macroeconomic climate or in steel-consuming sectors on the cards,' it says. The 'working document' will be reviewed by EC industry ministers at their meeting in Brussels tomorrow, according to Reuters. The document provides a gloomy backdrop to the meeting, which will discuss the progress of the Commission-backed plan to restructure the industry. It confirms reports from the big steel producers, which say that demand for steel is still falling in Germany, Europe's biggest market. The only big market where steel demand is rising is the UK. The Commission's document says a major deterioration in sales on the EC market had only partly and temporarily been offset by an increase in exports, especially to China. It estimates that crude steel production in the EC will reach 125m tonnes in 1993, down about 10 per cent from 1991. 'The financial results of the undertakings will therefore be disappointing and in many cases they will make a loss in 1993,' it says. However, prices are up about 10 per cent from the beginning of 1993, partly because of reduced imports. Steel producers have argued that prices still have to rise further to recoup falls of as much as 30 per cent since 1990.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Indian business welcomes move on further trade liberalisation INDIAN industrial organisations yesterday welcomed government moves to liberalise investment in the motor, white goods and leather industries. The measures, which were announced late on Wednesday, are a significant extension of the economic reforms of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, who is trying to deregulate the economy and integrate it with the global trading network. The changes will permit companies, including foreign groups, to enter the motor, white goods and leather industries without the need for government licences which, until recently, have been used to limit competition and keep out foreign competitors. The Confederation of Indian Industry said yesterday that the measures were a step in the right direction. However, they are unlikely to prompt an immediate rush into the newly-liberalised sectors, since much of Indian industry has been suffering from weak demand for the past year. Foreign car makers have held talks with Indian vehicle makers, but have yet to commit themselves to any large projects until the outlook for the economy is clearer. They have also been held back by the global economic slow down. In separate moves, the government approved state-sector investments totalling Rs35bn (Pounds 737m), including the expansion of import facilities for natural gas, the modernisation of the Digoil refinery in Assam, power station construction, and the building of a new passenger terminal at Bombay airport. Ministers also approved the award of an oil and gas exploration contract for an onshore area in Gujarat, north western India, to a consortium of US, Australian and Indian companies. A parliamentary Committee probing the Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal is considering recommending tough penalties for foreign banks involved in the affair. According to the Economic Times, India's leading business daily, the committee's draft report recommends that the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, should consider banning the offending banks from repatriating profits earned from irregular transactions. The committee's final report is due to be published next month. The scandal erupted when fake and unrecorded transactions were discovered in the inter-bank securities market. Investigators established that money had been siphoned out of the market in contravention of central bank rules for investment in the stock market. Four foreign banks were found to have been particularly active in the securities market - Citibank and Bank of America of the US, ANZ Grindlays of Australia and the UK's Standard Chartered.</p>

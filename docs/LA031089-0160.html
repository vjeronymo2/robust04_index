			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS ARE CALLED KEY TO DRUG-FREE CHILDREN  </P> <P> A 3-year-old boy gazes at a new video. From his seat on the living room couch,  the episode looks and sounds to him a lot like Saturday morning cartoons --  flashy super heroes popping with super powers.  </P> <P> But the stories and messages of "The Drug Avengers" bear little resemblance to  those of the Muppett Babies or Scooby Doo: Three youngsters and an alien  sidekick travel through time from 100 years hence to help 20th-Century  earthlings wise up to drug abuse. The heroes in it are kids. The villains:  pills, booze, cigarettes, dope, addiction.  </P> <P> One catchy rap tune that the Avengers sing grabs the boy's attention: "A girl  named Maggie had a little Baggie, full of something white, something didn't  look right; she said, 'C'mon, check it out,' but I cut out instead, 'cause I  listened to the voice inside of my head, it said, 'Uh-oh!' "  </P> <P> Later, the child begs his dad to "play the uh-oh song" again. And again. The  father asks the boy if he knows what the song is about. The boy shakes his head  in the negative.  </P> <P> When Larry Lancit and Cecily Truett say the fight to save America's children  from drug abuse needs more super heroes, they aren't talking about animated  ones like those in the "Avengers" video they produced. They mean parents.  </P> <P> "We wanted to create something that would be used by kids and their parents  together," say the husband-and-wife team whose concern for their own 5-year-old  daughter and a grant from the U.S. Department of Education motivated them to  create "The Drug Avengers" last year. Since then, the video, aimed at children  from preschool to sixth grade, has been distributed to 18,000 school districts  and now is available for home use.  </P> <P> "It's hard for parents to get a handle on talking to their kids about drugs,"  says Lancit, whose New York company, Lancit Media Productions, maker of such  PBS programs as "Reading Rainbow" and "Romona," co-produced this video with RNC  Research Corp.  </P> <P> "The idea was to use entertainment as . . . a real focal point in the home for  talking about drugs," Lancit says. "We wanted to produce something that when a  5-minute episode is over, the child and parent could have a meaningful  discussion."  </P> <P> A Lou Harris poll on the American family recently disclosed that 9 out of 10  parents are concerned about their children coming into contact with illicit  drugs and alcohol. Yet, meaningful family discussion in the home about drug and  alcohol abuse is not the norm, according to concerned experts. Most parents  instead rely on schools to inform their children about substance abuse.  </P> <P> Government, too, has typically bolstered police- and school-based programs,  seldom seeing parents as a critical part of the solution. Even "The Drug  Avengers" was created for school use and had to be revised for parents. An  editorial piece in the New York Times 10 years ago expressed the attitude that  has remained prevalent through much of the '80s when it contended that  drug-abuse prevention was too important an issue "to be left in the hands of  parents."  </P> <P> But that thinking is changing. Last March, the prevention committee of the  White House Conference for a Drug-Free America concluded that, "with the  tremendous threat of the drug epidemic, it is vital that the first line of  defense be the family and parents."  </P> <P> Increasingly, experts advocate that parents take steps as early as the  preschool years to develop the personal skills and values in their children  needed to keep them free of drugs. Some even warn that if American parents  don't learn to handle "drug talks" with their children better than they have  traditionally handled "sex talks," the war on drugs may well be lost.  </P> <P> "An informed parent is the best bulwark against drug use by young people," says  Doug Hall, spokesman for the National Parent Resource Institute for Drug  Education. Headquartered in Atlanta, the institute emerged as a maverick  organization 12 years ago when it began proposing that parents "put themselves  between drugs and their children." That was a time when parents intervening in  drug problems brought to mind images of parents rifling through drawers and  angry confrontations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Gradual Development  </P> <P> The institute's program stresses a gradual and developmental approach "that  inculcates in the child, over many years, the family's values and standards,  and provides techniques to avoid the problems outside the home," Hall says. The  theory is that if parents warn children of the choices they will probably be  asked to make, and explain the family standards, children are more likely to  make the right decisions. The institute's surveys of children's attitudes  indicate these discussions should take place no later than fourth grade.  </P> <P> But there's an obstacle. "In many cases, today, the parent is less informed  about drug use than children are," Hall says. "It's like the mama and papa  telling the kid about the birds and the bees, and the child looks up and says,  'That sounds a little like making love.' "  </P> <P> Children today are drinking and taking drugs earlier than ever. Elementary  schoolchildren, 100,000 of them, "get drunk at least once a week," according to  the American Council for Drug Education. As early as the fourth grade, one of  three children reports pressure from classmates to try wine coolers. One in 14  children begins using marijuana before age 14. The average age of first use  today has dropped to under 12. Almost a fifth of all children between 9 and 12  have been approached to try illegal drugs, says the Media-Advertising  Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  </P> <P> Another obstacle to home-based approaches in preventing drug abuse is that most  parents are entrenched in denial and blame. "They don't think this precious  child of theirs would ever use drugs," says Anne Meyer, president of the  National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth, based in Deerfield, Ill.  "So to get them interested in preventive measures is very difficult."  </P> <P> The federation's program tries to debunk that myth by informing parents about  how drugs and alcohol affect the underdeveloped bodies and growing minds of  youngsters. "Alcohol, for instance," Meyer says, "takes 5 to 15 years for  adults to become alcoholic. It takes less than 6 months for a child. Cocaine is  a rapid addiction drug for adults, and much more rapid in children . . .  interrupting the circuits in their brains and affecting their reproductive  systems. Kids on drugs are anesthetizing themselves and missing things they  should be developing at their age -- reasoning ability, physical growth."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Action Urged  </P> <P> That prospect shakes most parents into taking action. "Once they understand,  they do what they need to do," says Meyer, who believes kindergarten is a prime  time to get started. She recommends talking with kindergartners about their own  bodies, about caring about themselves, about not taking things from strangers.  Children a little older need instruction on handling peer pressure. "The actual  drug information comes a little later, in the fourth or fifth grade," Meyer  says.  </P> <P> "But it isn't like saying, 'So now you are 9 years old and we're going to tell  you all about drugs.' One problem is that some people give them too much too  soon or too little too late. This is a process, not an event. This is helping  children develop their own personal skills and build their self-esteem. But if  you do all of that and never mention drugs, you haven't done your job as a  parent."  </P> <P> Some experts blame parents' paralysis in protecting young children from drug  abuse on fear of not being a good parent. Does a tough stance work or drive the  child to abuse? Is a little knowledge about drugs a dangerous thing? Lee  Dogoloff, executive director of the American Council for Drug Education, says  that parents learn most of what they know about parenting from what their own  parents did with them. And that shortchanges today's parents on proper and  effective approaches to prevent drug abuse.  </P> <P> "This is unfamiliar territory for them," says Dogoloff, a former presidential  adviser on drug policy. "People tend to make it more difficult than it needs to  be. We need to think about it in terms reinforcing the message over and over  again. Children need to know you are serious about it."  </P> <P> He likens the process to teaching kids to turn off the lights when they leave a  room. "You hear that over and over again as a child," Dogoloff says. "What you  don't hear over and over is don't use alcohol and drugs."  </P> <P> As for starting early, Dogoloff says that is critical too. "Parents need to get  to kids at a time when they still have the credibility. For a young child,  parents are still omnipotent, and they really do believe them."  </P> <P> When Ken Barun talks to parents about their messages to children on substance  abuse, he starts with the subtle messages communicated through actions rather  than words. The first step for parents, he says, is to "take stock of your own  position and addictions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Toeing the Line  </P> <P> "Becoming a parent is like joining the Army -- if you don't like the sound of  reveille and don't like crew cuts, then don't enlist," says Barun, co-author of  "How to Keep the Children You Love Off Drugs" (The Atlantic Monthly Press:  $12.95). "Parents have got to be responsible for their children's behavior. And  parents need to toe the line themselves."  </P></p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (30): Trade mixed with trade and aid under scrutiny - The OECD's 'Helsinki rules' aim to distinguish projects that should be aid-funded from those that are commercially viable. But in developing country infrastructure deals, this is not always easy / Subsidised credits TRADE ISSUES: harmonised European export credit insurance terms, standardisation and quality controls must be in place to permit fair play Telecommunications contracts in developing countries have followed a pattern in recent years. Companies such as Ericsson, Siemens or Alcatel would bid for the order. The client would then press for the most advantageous financing package, as well as the best price and most appropriate technology. The suppliers' government - either where the mother company or its bidding subsidiary is based - might then offer a mixture of export credit and subsidies linked to its aid programme to secure the order. Until recently, this has been standard practice in North Africa, Asia and other regions where 'mixed credits' are common and without the use of grant aid a contract could be beyond the reach of even the best qualified bidder. When Tunisia issued tenders for 880,000 new telephone lines, companies rushed in as usual. Ericsson offered soft credits backed by BITS, the Swedish Agency for International Economic and Technical Co-operation. Alcatel offered French credit and Siemens bid with mixed credits through its Belgian subsidiary ATEA. Other bidders included the US arm of Northern Telecom and AT&amp;T. Letters of intent were awarded to ATEA Siemens for 360,000 lines, Ericsson and Alcatel Tunisie each for 80,000 lines. However, the start of work was delayed when other bidders intervened to argue that subsidised credits were ruled out by the so-called Helsinki rules, introduced by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1991 to limit the use of aid to non-commercial projects. The 'Helsinki rules' are based on the conviction that there must be a level playing field in international trade and the allocation of aid must be based on developmental criteria alone and attempt to control the use of subsidies for projects which could be viewed as commercial. This assumes that the mobilisation of aid-assisted funding disadvantages bidders in what are essentially commercial contracts. The leading advocates of this view are the US and Britain. The annual Development Co-operation report for 1993, published by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, opens with the assumption that 'the context in which donors administer aid is altering dramatically'. Donors are confronted with much greater demand for their aid than even a few years ago, the OECD says. They must scrutinise their use of export credits and stop linking aid to exports. For Tunisia this has meant renegotiations of pricing and financing. Diplomats complain that their companies who offered the usual mixed credit packages have been disadvantaged. Meanwhile, another bidder who offered industrial offset, the North Carolina arm of Northern Telecom, has secured a 360,000-line order, underlining the potential for securing orders by offering other forms of incentive. Under its offset proposal, Northern Telecom committed itself to purchasing equipment worth at least Dollars 25m from local firms and will invest locally to create a network of subcontractors. The critical issue in Helsinki is what constitutes a commercially viable contract which should not now receive aid funding. Given the way that previously soft financing has been mobilised to support large-scale infrastructure and capital goods contracts, the ramifications of this could be enormous. 'Helsinki provides a whole set of terms the outside world has not yet taken into account,' says Malcolm Stephens, secretary-general of the Berne Union, the International Union of Credit and Investment Insurers. 'The development of the Helsinki package will be a major trend in the OECD over the next few years, in particular clarification of what is 'commercially viable' as a practical matter,' says Brian Willott, chief executive of the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Can, for example, an infrastructure project be a development project, eligible for aid funding, if a private company erects and runs a project, such as a power station, which must eventually earn revenue from the scheme? Interpretation of what should be aid-funded and which projects are commercially viable appears to focus mainly on two important sectors, telecommunications and energy. The trend towards privatised companies entering non-OECD infrastructure projects suggests that such schemes are commercial, even if they also have well-defined developmental goals and might also be funded by agencies such as the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank. 'The eventual idea must be to leave aid and mixed credits to large infrastructure projects which no-one else will fund,' says one observer. 'The problem is agreeing how you move to this ideal state. There is obviously a fair degree of bad feeling within the OECD committee.' The move to Helsinki rules is also posing problems for non-OECD recipients of finance. China has differed with the OECD over telecoms contracts. Beijing insists these are not commercially available and qualify for mixed credits. This forms part of China's wider policy to secure the maximum financing at the lowest possible cost, which has also brought Beijing into conflict with the OECD over its call for sub-consensus interest rates. Application of the Helsinki rules is the responsibility of an OECD group which meets 11 times each year. Twenty-two of the OECD's 24 member nations subscribe, and consider themselves bound by the group's conclusions. It is for member governments to present any potentially aid-funded projects for consideration. According to an official in Paris, if the project 'smells like a rose', agreement is given to go ahead. If the project 'smells of something else, they the group talk about it'. A growing number of countries have found their offers of aid to back contracts rejected. Trade officials say that Austria has lost out on several recent orders, including contracts in Indonesia, after Helsinki rules were invoked. The US, UK and some other governments are looking for more still. 'We would expect to see a further stage of Helsinki, eliminating the subsidised interest rate for the least-developed countries and a number of other elements in that package,' says Mr Willott. The mixture of aid and trade is a difficult area in which to find consensus. One European official comments that even a staunch commitment to the level playing field 'does not stop the US or Britain using their own war chests when the contract suits them'. Application of the Helsinki rules can no longer be ignored by exporters  - who, like the bidders for Tunisian telecommunications orders, are learning that the rules themselves can also become an active element in the struggle for international contracts.</p>

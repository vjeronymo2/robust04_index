			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: How central banks ran into the hedge  -James Blitz on the logic of a currency market biased to safety THE Bundesbank and the Bank of France may have won the battle to save the French franc. But the world's central banks are losing a war to preserve their influence over how the foreign exchange market trades their currencies. Since the middle of the 1980s, the central banks have had some success in checking fluctuations in exchange rates when they threatened to become extreme. After 1985, for example, the central banks successfully intervened in the market to depress the value of the dollar, by concertedly buying other currencies. Ten years ago, currency markets were dominated by commercial bank dealers taking short-term positions. Now, managers of pension, insurance and investment funds - the institutional investors - are playing the market aggressively. And they are taking longer-term positions, backed by currency portfolios that match the banks' holdings for size. 'There is an increasing emphasis on the foreign exchange aspect of fund managers' decisions,' says Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew in London. 'Their aggressive approach and their particular way of playing the market partly accounts for the recent runs on sterling and the Italian lira.' During the 1980s fund managers increasingly internationalised their asset holdings as capital controls were reduced. The average UK pension fund, for example, now has 20 per cent of its portfolio invested overseas, compared with 6 per cent in 1980. However, the underlying value of a fund's overseas holding of bonds and equities is affected by fluctuations in the denominated currency. So, fund managers are increasingly 'hedging' - or protecting - themselves against currency risk by buying and selling the denominated currency on forward foreign exchange markets. Hedging by investment funds is now the fastest-growing business in foreign exchange. The Bank of England reported last week that the proportion of interbank business in the London foreign exchange market, the largest in the world, had declined by 9 per cent since 1989, while the proportion involving other financial institutions, such as investment funds, had increased. The share of forward foreign exchange business in London has increased by 12 per cent over the same period, while immediate (or spot) foreign exchange trading has declined by 14 per cent. These developments concern governments and central banks for several reasons: The scale of currency hedging is producing investment flows that rival central bank reserves. The International Monetary Fund reported in June that the Group of Seven leading industrial countries had total foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 350bn. A leading investment fund manager in London said this week that his bank had Dollars 25bn of assets which were regularly hedged on currency markets. 'On a very busy day, our active flows would be in the order of Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 3bn,' he said. 'There are 10 other banks in London which could move the same sums. You can therefore see how the central banks could have encountered an avalanche of money in the opposite direction in recent weeks.' Unlike bank dealers, fund managers take long-term decisions which are far more difficult for the central banks to reverse. The bank dealers who have become familiar on TV screens make short-term currency plays. They sell a currency, watch it depreciate, buy it back again and make a profit. This short-term view makes them easily influenced by a central bank raising overnight interest rates or buying a currency to trigger moves in the exchange rate. Fund managers, however, are more interested in managing risk rather than making short-term gains. As interbank dealers continued to test sterling two weeks ago, the fund managers came into the market and sold the currency on a long-term basis. 'It is much harder for intervention to reverse that kind of decision,' says Mr Chertkow. The growing use of hedging instruments such as options and forward contracts reinforces the prevailing currency flows. The trade in these sophisticated 'derivative' products has grown because they allow fund managers to safeguard long-term currency positions. A fund manager pays a small premium to a bank which, in turn, guarantees to buy or sell a nominated currency in the event that it touches a lower rate. Several weeks ago, a fund manager might have feared that sterling would be devalued below its lower ERM rate of DM2.7780. He might have bought a 'put' option from a bank , giving him the right to sell sterling to the bank at a price of DM2.70 if he wished to exercise it. As sterling started to edge towards the 'exercise price', the bank which had sold the option would have started to fear that it would end up acquiring a depreciating currency. 'The bank would itself have had to start selling into the market to avoid recording a loss once the 'strike price' was reached,' says Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp in London. 'That example, repeated a hundred times over, explains what happened to sterling on 'Black Wednesday'.' It would be wrong to exaggerate the role of these institutional investors in any explanation of the recent sell-off of weaker ERM currencies. Analysts stress that the interbank market was in a uniquely 'pathological' state after the central banks spent huge sums to prop up the lira. The German and French central banks have also shown that a concerted intervention can still turn the market, even if it is anticipating that a currency might be devalued.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daily turnover in three main centres  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       March 1986       April 1989        April 1992                       dollars bn       dollars bn        dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London                        90              187               303 New York                      50              129               192 Tokyo                         48              115               128  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                        188              431               623  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

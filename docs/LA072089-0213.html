			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PLYWOOD WORKERS STRIKE 5 PLANTS  </P> <P> About 2,000 plywood workers at five Georgia-Pacific plants in Arkansas and  Mississippi went on strike this morning after the breakdown of contract talks  about overtime pay.  </P> <P> The walkout forced the temporary shutdown of the mills. A Georgia-Pacific  spokesman said the strike involves about 1,000 union workers at mills in  Crossett and Fordyce in Arkansas, and a roughly equal number of workers at  mills in Louisville, Taylorsville and Gloster, Miss.  </P> <P> Union officials said the company's latest offer called for a four-year  contract, with pay increases of 2% the first, second and fourth years of the  pact and 3% the third year. The unions wanted a three-year contract with pay  increases of 3% each year.  </P> <P> But the union's main concern was over the company's proposal to pay workers  regular wages for working on Sunday and dropping time and-a-half wages paid  under the old contract. The company offered Sunday workers a one-time bonus of  $800 to $1,000.  </P></p>

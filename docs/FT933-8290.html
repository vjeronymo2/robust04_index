			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Open all hours A week of action was launched yesterday to highlight the plight of small grocers, who are facing increasing competition from superstores based outside main shopping areas, Neil Buckley writes. Independent Grocer magazine, which is leading the campaign, has written to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, calling for a moratorium on superstore developments, and to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, warning that 'endless bureaucracy' is crippling small grocery businesses. It will stage a series of special events and bring out a special edition to illustrate the difficulties faced by small shops. It says that tens of thousands of small grocers have closed in the past two decades, although the sick, the elderly, the disabled, and those without transport rely on them. The British Independent Grocers' Association claims superstores destroy rather than create jobs, as every job in a new superstore can cost up to four jobs in small businesses forced to close.

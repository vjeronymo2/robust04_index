			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading Futures continued to show very high turnover and a healthy premium to the cash market in spite of yesterday's retrenchment in financial markets, writes Peter John. The December Footsie futures contract opened at 3,262, some 3 points above the previous close, and leapt to a high of 3,277. Dealers said much of the rise sprang from a Pounds 300m investment last week in equities following the launch of new Lloyd investment trusts. They said one securities house had bought futures to hedge the deal and that had combined with the general rush to get into the market. Yesterday, the buying pressure eased and, also, institutions reversed put option deals made earlier in the month as protection against the possibility of a hit from changes in advance corporation tax. The December contract closed near the day's low at 3,243. However, turnover of 19,822 contracts was exceptionally high once again and December traded well above estimated fair value. The premium is estimated to be at par with the cash market or even a small discount during the current account and it was 20 points over by the close. Equally, volume of more than 66,000 lots in traded options was down on Wednesday's level but still well above average. Hanson, which announced disappointing full-year results yesterday topped the list of stock options with 4,332 lots dealt. Banks were also in demand as the underlying stocks moved higher. The largest single deal was in Barclays, where 2,000 March 600 put options were sold at the equivalent of 21p a share, a bullish trade.</p>

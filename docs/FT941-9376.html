			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power agrees Pounds 250m N Sea gas deal Scottish Power yesterday underlined its ambitions in the UK gas market by contracting to buy the entire output of the Andrew field in the North Sea over a period of 15 years. The deal is worth about Pounds 250m, payable as the gas flows. The contract will help support the future expansion of Scottish Power's subsidiary, Caledonian Gas, which expects sales in the 12 months to March 31 to be 'several times' the Pounds 7m achieved in the previous year. Mr Martin Fleming, managing director of Caledonian, said the deal was the biggest gas purchase the company had made. 'It is a milestone for us which demonstrates that we have serious intent in the gas market.' He added that it would help Caledonian cater for the expansion of gas sales which is expected to follow the liberalisation of the UK domestic market from 1996 onwards. Mr Mike Smith, one of Scottish Power's two chief operating officers, said the deal could also help the company 'explore ways of improving the environmental profile of our generation business'. Scottish Power is considering investing in devices which reduce emissions of nitrous oxide from its coal burning power stations by burning some gas, enabling it to maintain coal burning at present levels in the face of stricter environmental controls. The Andrew field is expected to produce 150bn cu ft of gas in addition to 100m barrels of oil after it comes on stream in January 1997. Daily gas output is likely to be between 25m and 35m cu ft. The field, which is almost 200 km east of Aberdeen, is operated by BP Exploration in partnership with Lasmo, Fina, Agip and British Gas. Caledonian, of which Utilicorp - the US gas company - has 25 per cent, supplies gas to nearly 4,000 commercial and industrial sites. It is now also focusing on the part of the domestic market which is already open to suppliers other than British Gas. This week it begins trying to locate and sign up some of the 60,000 households which take more than 2,500 therms of gas a year from British Gas, meaning annual gas bills from British Gas of at least Pounds 1.12m. Caledonian agreed in December to buy part of the output of the Baird field operated by Amoco off Bacton, Norfolk. Mr Fleming said the company had its 'shopping basket out' to make other purchases.</p>

			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Ashanti/Lonrho The international offer of shares in Ashanti Goldfields, which closes today, should attract strong institutional support. True, the gold price has been in the doldrums after the excitement of last year. A rising tax charge may also take the shine off Ashanti's earnings growth for the next year or two. But Ashanti is a low-cost producer which boasts quality reserves and rising production. So long as investors are willing to take a relaxed view of political risk in Ghana, a share price towards the top of the indicated Dollars 17-Dollars 20 range looks likely. That outcome would be especially pleasing for Lonrho, which will own 43 per cent of the company after flotation. The interest among investors generated by the offer - and the additional transparency provided by its weighty prospectus - have helped Lonrho's shares outperform the market since the turn of the year. Assuming a share price for Ashanti of Dollars 20, Lonrho's holding would be worth around Pounds 450m - more than its total market capitalisation in the dark days of 1992. If investors now turn their attention to Western Platinum of South Africa, Lonrho's share price may have further to run. Like Ashanti, Lonrho's other large mining investment is a low-cost producer with the promise of rising production. As with gold, a rising metals price cannot be relied upon. Political risk will also be a worry until the turmoil surrounding the South African elections has passed. Then it will be up to Lonrho to prove that it can make its assets sweat more effectively than in the past.</p>

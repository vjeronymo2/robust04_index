			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CUTS UTILITY TAXES  </P> <P> The City Council by a 4-1 vote has approved an ordinance that will cut the  city's utility tax by 1% a year until the rate is lowered to 5%.  </P> <P> The first 1% reduction will occur in January, lowering the tax on telephone  service to 10% and cutting the tax on bills for gas, water and electricity to  9% for residents and 11% for commercial and industrial users. It affects all  utility billings in the city; a customer whose monthly bills total $100, for  example, would save $1 with each reduction.  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith voted against the decrease, saying that although the tax cut  will be popular, the council should consider the financial impact on the city  budget first. Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said he is confident other  increases in revenue will offset the tax cut. Councilman Tomas Ursua said the  city should look more closely at spending. "What we're talking about is a  no-growth policy for city government," he said.  </P></p>

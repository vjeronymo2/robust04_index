			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A farewell ceremony was  held here today for Zhu Futang, a well-known pediatrician and an  academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who died on  April 23 at the age of 95.    More than 600 people, including Chen Xitong, member of the  Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of  China (CPC), Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee  of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), and Chen  Minzhang, minister of public health, attended the ceremony.    Founder of China's modern pediatrics, Zhu was also an  educator and honorary president of the Beijing Children's  Hospital.    A native of Wuxi city in east China's Jiangsu Province, he  graduated from the Beijing Union Medical College in 1927 and  obtained a doctor's degree from the State University of New York  of the United States.    In 1931 he went to the United States to study pediatrics,  majoring in the prevention of children's measles through  placental globulin, and was highly praised by TIME magazine at  that time.    Zhu's achievements in that study are still helping  pediatricians in many hospitals around the world today.    He returned to China in 1933 and with others set up the  private Beijing Pediatrics Hospital in 1942.    In the 1960s, he and other Chinese pediatricians invented a  new vaccine for measles and promoted it across the nation. The  vaccine effectively reduced the occurrence of and mortality rate  from children's measles in China.    His work Practical Pediatrics, which was first  published in 1943, was highly praised by fellow pediatricians  around the world. In 1993, that book was awarded a national best  prize.    He also set up a training seminar, through which several  generations of pediatricians in China were trained. In 1991,  the ministry of public health set up the "Zhu Futang Prize" in  his honor, an award to recognize outstanding pediatricians in  China annually.</p>

This is the first visit to Vietnam by the British  princess, which will help promote relations between Vietnam and  Great Britain. Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam gave  a banquet in honor of the British princess. The princess  sponsors many charity and humanitarian organizations in Great  Britain. She visited and conducted many humanitarian activities  in Third World countries in Africa, in the Middle East, Latin  America, and Asia. In June 1987, she was promoted to royal  princess by the Queen.    Vietnam and Britain have a long-standing relationship. The  visit to the United Kingdom in June and July last year by  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet opened up a new stage in  cooperative ties. When chairing the European Community, Great  Britain made an active contribution to promoting trade relations  between the EC and Vietnam. Now more and more British  organizations are doing business in Vietnam, including Oil Giant  BP. During Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit to the United  Kingdom, Prime Minister John Major committed to grant Vietnam  development aid and financial assistance for the reintegration  of returnees program. He also considered delay in Vietnam's  debts. Great Britain also committed to help Vietnam train  pilots and open a stock market, as well as other areas proposed  by Vietnam in which Britain has much experience. Vietnam and  Britain will sign an agreement on investment encouragement and  protection and an agreement on avoidance of double taxation. A  representative office of the Commonwealth of the United Kingdom  of Great Britain [as heard] has been open in Hanoi, which was  catalyzed cooperation between the two countries.    It is hoped that the visit by British Princess Anne will  promote Vietnam-Britain relations.</p>

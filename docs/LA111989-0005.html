			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERNEST FLEISCHMANN  </P> <P> History tell us that the pen is mightier than the sword. Martin Bernheimer has  a pen that he brandishes like a rapier and sometimes like a meat cleaver. The  headline writers followed Bernheimer's lead and selected an equally derogatory  title for the article, "The Tyrant of the Philharmonic."  </P> <P> Would you be kind enough to grant Fleischmann eight pages to respond to  Bernheimer? If not, then it is time for the Los Angeles Times to hire a  critics' critic to review this famous self-proclaimed operatic authority.  </P> <P> JOHN CLEARY, Panorama City  </P></p>

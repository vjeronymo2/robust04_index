			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FALCONS MAY SWAP NO. 1 PICK  </P> <P> Atlanta Falcons coach Jerry Glanville confirms that the NFL club might be  willing to exchange its No. 1 pick in the April 22-23 draft for extra  selections. But he says it won't go to the Dallas Cowboys.  </P> <P> Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson said Thursday that Falcons officials had talked to  him about trading for the No. 1 pick in the college draft. "They've asked us if  we would be interested in moving up," Johnson said. "Nothing happened. We  haven't responded."  </P> <P> Glanville said later Thursday that he might be willing to swap draft picks, but  not with Dallas. "I think he's wrong," Glanville said of Johnson's remarks.  "Somewhere along the line, he got confused. . . . We may move, but not that far  down. It's a long drop down to Dallas." The Cowboys have the 21st pick in the  first round of the draft.  </P></p>

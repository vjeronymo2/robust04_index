			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Trade News: New clash in air on subsidies THE EC and US are today expected to challenge each other about implementation of last year's agreement to limit subsidies to civil aircraft manufacturers. Both sides stressed yesterday that the talks were routine consultations rather than negotiations, and were foreseen in the deal put together last April after more than five years of EC-US discussions. 'Everybody's made very clear that there's no intention to reopen the agreement,' said one EC official yesterday. But the meeting, which should continue tomorrow, has taken on added importance because of the recession in the aircraft industry and a series of statements by the new US administration attacking EC government subsidies to Airbus, the European manufacturing consortium. Today's talks also follow Monday's highly charged encounter in Brussels between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner. Mr Kantor left Brussels yesterday, and concerns about aircraft subsidies were among the issues touched on during his visit. The EC-US agreement was only finalised last summer and set a limit on direct subsidies to manufacturers, as a proportion of total aircraft development costs, and a double-limit on indirect subsidies, as a proportion of total civil aircraft turnover and of each individual manufacturer's turnover in the sector. At today's meeting senior EC officials are expected to cite new studies, which they say indicate that indirect support for US aircraft manufacturers may have breached the limits agreed last year. They will also take up the EC industry's criticisms of special tax financing vehicles used by US manufacturers such as Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. In return the US is ready to challenge 'walkaway' leases, which allow carriers to return new aircraft to manufacturers in less than a year to avoid airlines recording the deals on their strained balance sheets. Although US manufacturers concede that such financing packages were invented by McDonnell Douglas, they believe Airbus can use them more freely to drum up business, because it is backed by government subsidies. But Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chief executive, yesterday criticised US manufacturers, especially Boeing, for attempting to influence the outcome of the trade talks by a campaign 'of innuendo, defamatory remarks and contradictory statements'. Mr Pierson accused Boeing of 'deception' and said the US company's attitude did nothing to improve current US-EC trade tensions. Although EC officials are cautious about reading too much into recent high-level US statements criticising last year's agreement, they will seek clarification about the Clinton administration's intentions. They will also try to discover Washington's attitude towards legislation presented by US senators which would increase indirect support to the US industry, and bring dumping and subsidy complaints against Airbus.</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON OFFERED MONEY FOR INJECTION OF STEROID, CANADIAN ATHLETE TESTIFIES  </P> <P> Andrew Mowatt, who has competed for Canada in both the Winter and Summer  Olympics, said Wednesday that Ben Johnson once offered him money for an  anabolic steroid injection.  </P> <P> Mowatt, a track sprinter and a bobsledder, also told the Canadian government's  inquiry into drug use by athletes that he was given steroids by Coach Charlie  Francis and Dr. Jamie Astaphan without his knowledge.  </P> <P> Mowatt said that Johnson offered to pay him in 1986 if he would inject him with  a syringe full of liquid stored at Francis' Toronto apartment. Mowatt said the  vial of milky white fluid looked the same as a bottle of steroids earlier  entered into evidence.  </P> <P> "He said, 'You give me a shot, and I'll give you a shot,' " Mowatt said, adding  that he initially refused because he had never given an injection. "Then, he  said, 'C'mon, be a friend. I need a shot.' "  </P> <P> Mowatt said he consented after refusing Johnson's offer of cash.  </P> <P> But Mowatt did not indicate whether Johnson seemed aware that the injection was  for a steroid. Johnson is expected to testify next month that he never  knowingly took banned substances.  </P> <P> The hearings are scheduled to continue today with testimony by Johnson's  longtime friend and adviser, Ross Earl.  </P></p>

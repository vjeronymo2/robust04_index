			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Leading Article: Walesa's challenge 'AN IRON curtain is descend-ing over the continent.' With these celebrated words, delivered in 1946, Winston Churchill recognised the onset of the Cold War and the post-war division of Europe. The curtain remained down for 43 years and then in just a few months was torn asunder. But, as President Lech Walesa of Poland remarked during his visit to the UK, 'the political iron curtain should not be replaced by a silver curtain of indifference'. For so long victims of the Soviet determination to keep them in, must the peoples of eastern and central Europe now be victims of the European Community's wish to keep them out? No people struggled to tear down the curtain as bravely as the Poles. Lech Walesa is the symbol of a victorious struggle in which, as he says, 'the peaceful overthrow of communism in Poland changed the visage of the continent and paved the way back for other countries of central and eastern Europe to the family of free nations'. Like other post-communist countries, Poland puts its relations with the European Community at the heart of foreign policy, domestic politics and economic reform. It regards membership as the main safeguard for its democracy and liberal trade as the chief stimulus to its economy. Yet the leaders of the European Community seem to regard what the Polish government refers to as 'giving Europe back to Poland and Poland to Europe' as at least an embarrassment, if not as a nuisance. Liberal trade True, EC foreign ministers have now accepted that membership may figure in the preamble to the prospective association agreement as 'an ultimate, though not an automatic' goal. EC members have also consented to a 50 per cent reduction in Poland's external debt. However welcome, these concessions are not enough. Poland needs more than promises for the distant future; it needs more than debt forgiveness; and it needs more than aid. Poland needs liberal trade. Poland seeks a free trade area with the EC, for essentially all products, one that would ensure stability of market access for Polish exports (about half of which already go to the EC) and would also enable Poland to maintain the open import system it now enjoys. Market access Liberal access to EC markets matters to Poland for four reasons: first, the EC is already by far Poland's most important trading partner and, with the virtually complete collapse of exports to the Soviet Union, its significance must grow; second, greater outward orientation is an essential element in the reform of the Polish economy; third, rapid growth of exports is a necessary condition for service of debt and attraction of new capital; and, finally, liberal access to EC markets is the only way that the Polish government can persuade its people to tolerate liberalism at home. At present Poland's exports of agricultural commodities, of textiles and clothing and of steel, which account for about half its exports to the EC, are under various kinds of restraint. Those restraints did not prevent Poland from achieving rapid growth of exports last year, but are bound to limit Poland's long-term capacity to exploit its comparative advantage. The problem for the EC is that it is committed to offerring asymmetric advantages to Poland, but finds that Poland's trade regime is more liberal than its own. How difficult EC negotiators must find it to deal with a country that embraces both the EC and liberal trade] Unfortunately, the EC's response seems to be to recommend more protection to Poland rather than embrace more liberalism for itself. The leaders of the EC must raise their gaze from their collective navel, from butter mountains and farmers' votes and even from inter-governmental conferences. They can choose to create something that has never before existed: a Europe whole, peaceful and prosperous; or they will bear responsibility for Latin American-style chaos and instability on their eastern borders. President Walesa has thrown down the challenge. Dare European leaders not pick it up?</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Travel: The gates are open wide - Skiing 'WHY ARE you leaning so far forward ?' asks Pierre Raison, the new head of the official Les Arcs ski school. 'It has taken man 5m years to learn to stand up. Why are you crouching like a monkey?' Here we go again. Just as I thought I had got skiing down to a rough-hewn art, here was someone else trying to change my style. Will I ever get it right, or am I doomed to find that just as I have struggled to get used to one idea, someone has moved the slalom gates? Les Arcs has a bewildering number of ski schools which seem to change names each year. Raison, a likeable eccentric and a stunningly good mono-skier, has just taken over the local ESF, the red-suited Ecole de Ski Francais. There are two or three others - more if you count the ubiquitous Club Med instructors who are technically ESF, too, but have their own uniforms. Alternative ski schools have been springing up all over the French Alps to give ski fanatics a more exotic diet. But it is a bit confusing for would-be clients. Many of the schools have put themselves under the umbrella title of Ski Ecole International. These days even the word 'skiing' is far too banal for the likes of Les Arcs. What we have now is la glisse, which encompasses all forms of sliding on snow, including a strong emphasis on mono-skiing, snow-boarding, ski extreme, powder and couloir skiing, even skiing with the aid of parachutes, up-ski and parapenting. In Les Arcs, the International ski school (green uniforms) is called Arc Aventures, which also takes skiers on surf and mono courses. The ESF runs ski decouverte, which organises Poudreuse Circus day trips in which you can join outings to the neighbouring resorts of La Plagne, Val d'Isere and even across the Italian border into La Thuile. Then there is Virage, an a la carte ski school with just 10 instructors (blue uniforms), and Tip Top Ski for snowboarders, based at nearby Bourg St Maurice. But I digress. Raison is still going on about my posture. 'Hold your head up  -look where you're going. Enjoy your skiing.' Oh dear. I thought I was enjoying it. So did Conrad Brunner, my companion and a former ski instructor himself. He takes Raison's criticism on the chin and does not let on about his past. As for leaning forward, that is what instructors have been telling me to do for years. But Les Arcs is like that - at the forefront of any new skiing idea. What is smart today is often passee tomorrow, although ski evolutif, the graduated short-ski teaching method pioneered here, is still taught. My first skiing article for the FT, 10 years ago, was about various concepts of 'ski le new way,' another Les Arcs innovation. One, ski bird, called for plastic wings which halved your weight and enabled you to half-float and half-cruise down the mountain. Just as I got the hang of it, I recall, they dropped it from the adult itinerary and made it a children's feature. Les Arcs - divided by altitude into three areas: 1,600, 1,800 and 2,000 metres - is swashbuckling but friendly, with excellent skiing for every type of skier both on and off-piste. It is the archetypal first-generation, purpose-built, self-catering French resort. With more than 100 miles of skiing and some 75 lifts, the resort offers almost every possible skiing permutation. For off-piste enthusiasts with a guide there are endless possibilities, including the famous run from the Aiguille rouge all the way down to Le Pre, near Villaroger. The Aiguille rouge which dominates Les Arcs provides much of the more testing off-piste. The Couloir Arandelieres is a particular favourite but involves a vertiginous climb along a narrow ridge with disturbing drops on both sides. Once into the couloir, however, you can breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy a steep but wide gully which should present few problems to seasoned deep-snow skiers. The North Face of the Aiguille rouge is a sublime powder run in good conditions but - as so often happens when you are seeking out the best off-piste - getting there is more unsettling than the descent itself. To reach the glorious powderfields of the Aiguille rouge you must first negotiate an extremely steep top section which tends to be rocky even in good conditions, because the slope is too sheer for the snow to stick in any great depth. About halfway down the face, however, the gradient eases and you can let yourself go in what you hope will be perfect powder. The Aiguille rouge is also the setting for one of the more spectacular Olympic events, the kilometre lancee, in which participants clad in skin-tight suits and Darth Vader visors reach speeds of around 135 mph on huge skis. Recreational skiers can try a shortened version. Even they can reach speeds in excess of 60 mph. Once you have committed yourself, there is no turning back - nor any means of braking. At least during the Flying K you can safely ignore Pierre Raison's entreaty to stand up and enjoy your skiing. If you do not crouch during the Flying K you are liable to be jettisoned in the maelstrom of your own slipstream. Arnold Wilson was a guest of Touralp , 197B Brompton Road, London SW3 1LA.

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (8): Stern specifics - David Lascelles on the banks 'I specifically urge all parties related to banking activities to stick to ethical and efficient practice in managing the industry.' These stern words came last month from no less a person than President Suharto - a clear indication of the serious straits in which Indonesia's banking industry finds itself. Suharto made his utterance just as the Indonesian press was regaling its readers with details of the Bapindo trial in which Mr Eddy Tansil, a local businessman, is accused of defrauding Bapindo, the state development bank, of the equivalent of over Dollars 430m. The case has sent shock waves through the Indonesian political and business establishment with its suggestion of corruption in high places. But it has also forced the Indonesian authorities to confront the extent of bad loans in the country's notoriously manipulated state banking sector. According to an announcement by Mr Mar'ie Muhammad, the finance minister, last February, 21 per cent of loans worth Dollars 7bn in the seven state banks are either bad or in default. He told a parliamentary hearing that much of this was the result of collusion between the banks and their customers, and promised a massive clean-up. The ministry of finance has now set up a supervisory team with Bank Indonesia, the central bank, to pick through the state banks' loan books. Mr Sudradjad Djiwandono, who became governor of Bank Indonesia a year ago, says: 'Although there's a big public uproar over Bapindo, we had already begun to address the issue of bad loans.' He says that a wide range of measures is being adopted to strengthen the banking industry - and supervision. All this attention to banking - fed by the new openness Suharto has sanctioned - might be thought highly embarrassing, coming as it does on the heels of problems in the private banking sector as well. But many bankers welcome it as evidence of government determination to get banking back to health. 'It's long overdue,' says a foreign banker in Jakarta. The private sector's problems date back to the ill-judged deregulation of the banking industry in 1988, releasing banks from tight controls on reserves and branch numbers. The banks used their new-found freedom to go on a lending spree which came to a halt a couple of years later, when the central bank tightened monetary policy to rein in credit growth. Since then, many private sector banks have been forced to merge, or turn to their shareholders for more capital. Last year Bank Summa, one of the country's largest, was wound up on government orders. But the road back to health has proved long and arduous. The central bank tightened capital requirements to meet the new Basle regulations in 1991, but had to loosen them again last year to mobilise more lending, although the level of bad debts was still high. 'By the end of this year, I can say that we shall have a very clean portfolio,' says Mr Glenn Yusuf, a director of Bank Niaga, a leading private sector bank. But the shake-out has still some way to go, in many people's view. The number of banks in Indonesia, 243, is considered to be far too large. At the same time, the number of properly qualified personnel is too small: this means that banks are badly managed. Another underlying problem is that many of Indonesia's largest banks form part of wider industrial conglomerates where they are treated as 'in-house' banks. Much of the banking sector's difficulties stem from the incestuous relationships that result. The central bank is trying to cut down the amount of linked lending by enforcing the internationally accepted ceiling of 20 per cent of assets to a single customer. But because the problem is so large, it has had to give banks a breathing space by allowing them to insure the credit risk on any over-limit loans until 1997. The problems of the state sector have also had repercussions on private sector banks. Many of Indonesia's largest companies relied heavily on state banks for their funding. But now that the state sector is more tightly policed, these companies have been forced to turn to private banks instead - putting pressure on the private money markets and helping to push up interest rates. Some companies have also begun to turn to foreign banks operating in Indonesia. But there are limits to the growth of this market because foreign banks are required to restrict most of their lending to export-related business. There are also limits on their ability to raise funds externally. The sharp growth in bad loans has exposed another bugbear for bankers: the difficulty of recovering debts through the courts because of inefficiency and corruption. reform of the law affecting the rights of creditors and depositors is one of the items on the central bank's agenda.</p>

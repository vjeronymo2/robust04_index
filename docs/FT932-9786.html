			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Huntingdon tumbles to Pounds 0.98m PRE-TAX profits at Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and engineering services group, fell to Pounds 984,000 in the six months to end-March, compared with Pounds 6.95m last time. Turnover, helped by a maiden half-year contribution from Travers Morgan, acquired in December 1991, growth in UK operations and currency fluctuations, rose to Pounds 84.5m (Pounds 69.9m). A maintained interim dividend of 0.875p is uncovered by earnings of 0.009p (0.056p). The group warned last month that profits would be depressed in the second quarter, citing continuing weakness in the US economy, abnormal weather and the need to rationalise its US-based engineering and environment services group. The rationalisation was behind a Pounds 3m exceptional provision which contributed to a Pounds 2.74m pre-tax loss in the second quarter on turnover of Pounds 40.9m. For the comparable period last year the group returned profits of Pounds 3.73m on turnover of Pounds 38.9m. Operating performance at the US engineering and environmental services group improved in March, directors said. In the UK, turnover at the Life Sciences group rose 7 per cent with new orders so far ahead 16 per cent on last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said today that Japan should adopt a correct  attitude toward its part in history of aggression and continue  to seek development through peace.    The spokesman made this remark here today at a weekly press  conference when commenting on Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's reported speech on the statement by Japanese Minister of  Justice Shigeto Nagano that the Nanjing massacre was fabricated.

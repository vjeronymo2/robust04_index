			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kiev, 8 Jun -- [passage omitted] DPRK Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam is in Kiev on an official visit. He told  reporters at Borispol airport that "No sanctions, no pressure  put on us will help a fair and unbiased solution to our nuclear  problems. We are against nuclear arms. If the United States  sincerely intends to solve the so-called nuclear problem, they  should get down to the third round of Korean-American  negotiations."    "We welcome Ukraine's intention to become a nuclear-free  state because we, too, are making every effort to make the  Korean peninsula nuclear-free."  [passage omitted]</p>

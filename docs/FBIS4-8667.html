			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dumitru Constantin: "Mihai Has Applied for </F> Entry Visa Again"]    [Text] On the morning of 11 April, quoting a communique  issued at Versoix [former Romanian King Mihai's residence], the  BBC announced that Mihai I of Hohenzollern and his wife had  submitted their passports to the Romanian Embassy in Bern to  obtain an entry visa for their return to Romania to spend the  Holy Easter Holidays in Timisoara. No other details have been  provided.    The Romanian Embassy in Bern officially confirmed that the  British passports were submitted on 8 April and mentioned that  additional instructions from the Romanian Foreign Ministry in  Bucharest have been requested. The Romanian foreign minister's  office said that a diplomatic courier is expected to arrive;  after that officials will be able to examine the precise nature  of the passports in question.    Likewise, the same office noted that additional detail might  be requested regarding the nature of this visit; namely, whether  this is a private visit or another type of visit, whether Mihai  I of Hohenzollern recognizes the Constitution of Romania, and  other such details.    It is noteworthy that the church and local authorities in  Timisoara reminded the central leadership that some time ago  they sent an invitation to Mihai I and his wife Ana to visit  this town because, among other things, Mihai I is also the  founder of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Timisoara.</p>

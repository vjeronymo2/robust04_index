			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Strengthening of Franco-Israeli Scientific </F> Cooperation"]    [Text] Jerusalem--France's minister for  higher education and research, Mr. Francois Fillon, was in  Israel 22-25 November to strengthen scientific and technical  cooperation between the two countries. The trip also gave him  the opportunity to make contact with Palestinian personalities  and look at ways to increase aid in these fields to the  populations of Gaza and Jericho.    Cooperation between the two countries was reviewed on 23  November, in Jerusalem, at the second meeting of the  Franco-Israeli High Scientific Council, with Mr. Fillon and Mrs.  Shulamit Aloni, the Israeli research minister, in attendance.  Created in 1987, this body previously had met only once, in 1989.    "We want to participate in the building of peace in the  Middle East," Mr. Fillon said at a press conference following  the meeting. "We must take political progress into account and  thus to consider cooperation in different modalities. There is  every reason now to put obstacles of the past behind us. We are  ready to participate in development of the (occupied)  territories, in projects desired by the Palestinians. In our  view, scientific and technical cooperation is indeed the  foundation of peace and development." It can "efface differences  in economic levels, reduce tension, and thus facilitate peace."    French and Israeli representatives agreed at the meeting to  launch two new high-priority programs, in immunology and in  basic research on composite materials; each project will be  allotted a half-million dollars per year for a two-year period.  Allocation of such large sums "demonstrates the commitment of  our two governments to continue with the science and technology  cooperation" which began many years ago and will now, according  to Mr. Fillon, be "redoubled again." Both sides noted the  "exemplary character and high quality" of Franco-Israeli  cooperation.    The two new programs will be launched in the next few  months.  They were proposed by the scientists themselves because of their  innovative character, the excellent scientific potential of the  two countries in these domains, and lastly because, as the  French minister put it, collaborative efforts by researchers  from the two scientific communities in these fields "are very  likely to yield positive results." Also discussed was the  possibility of broadening the already good bilateral cooperation  on health problems to include other Mediterranean basin  countries. An initial meeting on the subject may be held next  year.    On 24 November Mr. Fillon traveled to the Palestinian  University of Bir-Zeit (about twenty kilometers from Jerusalem),  which was closed by Israeli authorities from 1988 to 1992  because of the "Intifada" ("war of stones"). The visit of the  French minister for higher education and research coincided, by  chance, with the holding of Bir-Zeit's first student council  elections. The president of that large university group, Mr.  Hanna Nassir--a member of the Palestinian High Council, he was  allowed to return to Bir-Zeit only last April--said he was  delighted to have Mr. Fillon visit the campus "at such a  decisive moment" for the "national development" of the  Palestinian people.    "We know we can count on France, which has taught the world  the true meaning of the word liberty," to furnish aid to the  eight Palestinian universities, which have a combined enrollment  of 20,000 students and a budget in the neighborhood of US$26  million. "France has always supported your right to control your  own destiny," said Fillon. "We will continue to support that  goal. I am here to tell you that the French Government is ready  to cooperate with your universities, so that the system you have  already begun building, under difficult circumstances, will be  able to take on new dimensions."    "We are ready to support the Bir-Zeit juridical [education]  center, the creation of a master's program in public  administration, the training of administrative support  personnel, the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian degree  course--with instruction in the French language, of course--the  expansion of education in technical fields, and to cooperate in  research programs that correspond to your needs." And to engage  in academic exchange programs. "As I see it," the minister  added, "scientific and technological cooperation is a decisive  factor for the establishment of a durable peace throughout the  region."    During his visit to Israel, Mr. Fillon also held talks with  Education Minister Amnon Rubinstein and Foreign Minister Shimon  Peres.  <H5>  30-Year Cooperation </H5>   Franco-Israeli cooperation in science, technology, higher  education, and cultural affairs dates back more than 30 years.  Launched in 1959 by a governmental cooperation accord, it has  been in existence ever since, albeit subject to the vicissitudes  of politics and the complexities entailed by the risk of  knowledge transfer to a country that has very high scientific  potential. Israel treats research as a "national priority" and  in fact devotes to it three percent of gross domestic product  [GDP], compared to 2.4 percent for France.    Scientific and technological cooperation is effected both  through the Franco-Israeli Association for Scientific and  Technological Research (AFIRST) and under the rubric of direct  accords between French research bodies (CNRS [National  Scientific Research Center], INSERM [National Institute of  Health and Medical Research], INRA [National Institute of  Agronomic Research], INRIA [National Institute for Research on  Data Processing and Automation], the Pasteur Institute) and  their Israeli counterparts (Weizmann Institute, Technion,  Volcani Institute, etc.) or Israel's National Council for  Research and Development (CNRD).    The commitment to strengthen cooperation was underlined by  both sides during President Mitterrand's official visit to  Israel in November 1992 and Mr. Yitzhak Rabin's visit to Paris  last June. Since then, concurrently with the High Scientific  Council, a High Council on Research and Industry was  established; still under discussion is the proposed creation of  a $250 million Binational Fund to finance basic research  projects and the creation of industrial partnerships.    Frenchmen and Israelis are cooperating in such varied fields  as life sciences, mathematics, composite materials, immunology,  virology, biology, botanical biotechnologies, research on arid  and desert zones, and hydrobiology. Despite the existence of 29  inter-university accords, exchange students are few--only 223  Israelis, 50 percent of them in the humanities, are studying in  France--because of the drawing power of American universities.    Despite the existence of a French-speaking community of  about  500,000 persons, the French language is clearly on the decline  in Israel, both because it enjoys no official status in the  education system (whereas English and Arabic are mandatory), and  because since 1962 Hebrew has been among the 14 living languages  in which applicants may take the French university entrance  examination.</p>

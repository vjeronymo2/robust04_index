			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GREAT ESCAPES FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD;  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> SHERMAN GARDENS: AN OASIS OF COLOR AND LOCAL HISTORY  </P> <P> Speeding down the main drag of Corona del Mar on a fast-paced and bland kind of  Orange County day, many people don't notice the small wooden, gold-lettered  Sherman Library and Gardens sign on the side of the road.  </P> <P> But it's here, behind a gated, vine-covered wall, that those weary of concrete  can find a riot of color for the senses. They will also find roots to an Orange  County past as colorful as any town they may have left behind.  </P> <P> "I think it's important for people here, especially children, not to have a  feeling of alienation," said William Hendricks, director of the historical  library set in a 2.2-acre cultural and botanical oasis. "People should have a  feeling of connection, so that street names and other things have meaning."  </P> <P> The gardens and library originally were funded by the Sherman Foundation,  funded by the heirs of Moses Hazeltine Sherman, a land baron who started street  railway systems in both Phoenix and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Hendricks said the gardens and library grew out of "accidental circumstances."  </P> <P> A nursery was part of the real estate that the Sherman Co. had purchased to  expand its holdings on the block. Hendricks came down looking for papers for  his dissertation and ended up creating a library.  </P> <P> Today, about 2,500 people are Friends of Sherman Library and Gardens and pay  dues to help support the operation.  </P> <P> Specializing in color, the Sherman Gardens have more than 1,000 species of  plants in a setting of fountains and sculpture. There is a tea garden where  visitors may have lunch, a conservatory and a koi pond.  </P> <P> For the blind, and sightseers who wish a different sensory experience, there's  a Discovery Garden that focuses on touch and smell.  </P> <P> The gardens also have guided tours, along with weddings, concerts and special  lectures.  </P> <P> And if the present-oriented sensual palette is not enough, the research library  there is devoted to 100 years of past local color.  </P> <P> Hendricks is the man behind the books in the cozy rooms with three fireplaces  and collection of plein air, or fresh air, paintings by artists once connected  to Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Specializing in the history of the Pacific Southwest, the library houses about  20,000 books and pamphlets in addition to maps, photographs, documents, back  files of newspapers and more than 2,000 reels of microfilm.  </P> <P> Hendricks, who left a teaching position at USC in 1965 to wade through  truckloads of papers in trunks, safes, wooden crates and even a five-gallon can  to establish the library, is a master at making history come alive.  </P> <P> The Sherman Library and Gardens is a 2647 E. Coast Highway and is open daily  from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free on Mondays and for children under  12. Otherwise, admission is $2 for non-member adults.  </P> <P> To visit the library without going through the gardens, ring the bell at a  separate locked entrance on Dahlia Avenue for admittance.  </P></p>

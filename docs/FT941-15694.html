			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Adding value to the sweet-talk  -Alison Maitland meets a man who is undaunted by the task of reviving the fortunes of the International Sugar Organisation Dr Peter Baron, the new executive director of the International Sugar Organisation, likes to look on the bright side. He even professes to be 'one of the few who like Canary Wharf,' the controversial east London development in which the ISO now has its headquarters. 'It's the 21st century here,' he says, surveying the Thames and an adjacent muddy building site from the fifth floor office in which he took up residence at the start of the year. The German-born commodity expert's cheery outlook could be a valuable asset as he takes the reins of an organisation struggling to recover from a series of setbacks that threatened its survival. 'It was a real challenge for me to come back,' says Dr Baron, 53, who has run German wine policy in Bonn for the past three years, after 15 years as his country's chief representative at the world's food commodity meetings. He was seen as a forceful chairman of the International Cocoa Council in London in 1990 and presided over the United Nations sugar conference in Geneva in 1992, which hammered out a new five-year agreement. 'I love the international commodity business and I jumped at the chance. It was a particular challenge to take over an organisation under difficult circumstances.' A financial crisis in 1992, precipitated by defaults in subscription payments, took the ISO to the brink of liquidation. Then, when the new sugar agreement was reached, the US withdrew because its proposal to downgrade the body to a study group was rejected. Some say a study group is what the sugar body has effectively become. The US move coincided with a growing rejection by governments of international commodity agreements on the grounds that the market, rather than buffer stocks and quotas, would prove more effective at balancing supply and demand. International sugar agreements were stripped of economic measures for intervening in the market in 1985, following the failure of buffer stocks to stabilise the market in the 1970s and 1980s. A further blow to the ISO's standing was the break-up of the Soviet Union, which led to a drop in votes of more than 10 per cent. Today the organisation has just 30 members, compared with 59 in 1982, when the sugar agreement still contained economic measures, and 42 in 1992. Dr Baron is undaunted. 'Let's start with the good news,' he says. 'Ecuador joined a few days ago.' He sees the recruitment of new members as one of his most important tasks. 'The more members we have, the better and more reliable our data and studies because members have to give us their statistical data. We also need a safe financial base. The more members share the burden, the less individual members have to pay.' The cost is Pounds 396 a vote, with smaller countries having at least six votes while the European Union, the largest member, has 413 out of a total of 1,834. Dr Baron, whose appointment followed the death last year of his predecessor, Mr Alfredo Ricart, hopes to persuade the US, as well as Canada and the Philippines, which left at about the same time, to return to the fold. He also aims to win back Russia and Ukraine and has had 'very encouraging contacts' with Arab League states, which are big sugar consumers. 'The key question is whether the ISO can convince its bosses, the governments, that it's valuable having membership and continuing to subscribe,' says Mr Chris Pack, head of research at Czarnikow, the London trade house. The ISO has a budget of just Pounds 800,000. It is still owed Pounds 250,000 in subscription arrears, some of it dating back to 1988, and has cut its staff from 29 to 10 in the past three years. 'It's not easy to cope with the expectations of members with this small budget,' says Dr Baron. 'But in a couple of years we should convince them we're worth that and a bit more.' The ISO has 'the best data network in sugar worldwide', he says, pointing to its 'little red book' of statistics on production, consumption, imports, exports and stocks for each country, its regular publications, international seminars and market analysis. Another of his objectives is to help raise sugar consumption, growing by about 2 per cent a year globally, by exploring non-food uses for sugar. Mr Pack of Czarnikow believes Dr Baron is the man for the job, although he says it is unclear what new functions the sugar organisation might take on. 'He's got a reputation for hard work and lots of German thoroughness. If there's a role for the ISO to play then he will spend a great deal of energy in finding it.'</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Credit quality warning on Japanese banks THE CREDIT quality of Japan's leading banks will remain under pressure through most of this decade, warns Moody's Investment Service, the US credit rating agency. In The Future of the Japanese Banking System, a report to be published this week, Moody's concludes Japanese banks will lose their stature as international banks as they concentrate on low-risk domestic businesses. Moody's expects the average rating for Japanese banks - currently between Aa3 and A1 - to continue to decline, but remain in the A range through the mid-1990s. Japanese banks face a severe squeeze on profits due to loans stemming from property related lending. Between 1984 and 1990, loans to property companies rose from 6.6 per cent to 10.3 per cent of Japanese banks' domestic loans. The banks, burdened by large unrealised losses, have also been hard hit by the sharp fall in Japan's stock markets. The gross amount of problem loans, including restructured loans, is well over 10 per cent of portfolios at the weaker institutions. 'Japanese banking has never faced asset quality deterioration of the scale in the postwar period,' says Moody's. Despite these problems, Japanese banks will not fail or default on deposits or bonds, thanks to Japanese regulatory protection. However, Moody's points out the financial authorities are using this crisis as an opportunity to restructure the banking system. Rather than recapitalise banks or materially improve their profitability, the authorities are looking to change the shape of the system through mergers and ultimately to reduce the size and role of the financial system itself. Due to the pressure on earnings and capital ratios, banks' strategy will shift from market share to profitability, focusing on the quality of borrowers rather than loan volumes. In the international markets, credit concerns have increased international funding costs for Japanese banks. But Moody's points out the effect on Japan's economy will be limited, since corporate funding needs will be met by borrowing in the growing debt securities markets. Moody's has upgraded its rating of the debt of Chemical Bank, citing the progress it has made to cut costs, increase revenues and improve capitalisation following last year's merger with New York rival Manufacturers Hanover, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The rating of the senior long term debt was raised to Baa1 from Baa2.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- Russian ultra-nationalist  leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy left for home on Thursday [14  April] after complaining French police had failed to protect him  from "Jewish extremists."    Zhirinovskiy was referring to Jewish protestors who  demonstrated on Monday outside the Russian consulate where he  was staying. He spat at the demonstrators, threw clods of earth  and threatened them with his "atomic revolver."    On Wednesday the extremist MP, who was part of a Russian  parliamentary delegation at the spring session of the Council of  European parliament, said "I am leaving this country where the  police fails to protect me from the attacks of Jewish  extremists."    Zhirinovsky adopted a low profile since Tuesday after being  warned to behave himself by the French Foreign Ministry. He  attended all parliamentary sessions quietly, but failed in  attempts to take part in meetings of party groups.    On Monday he had called liberal parliamentarians "CIA  agents"  and inside the the Council chamber, he denounced NATO air raids  against Bosnian Serbs and suggested Russia should bomb European  cities.    When he arrived in France on Sunday, Zhirinovsky berated the  host country and also Germany, saying Paris would be "an Arab  city in 10 or 20 years" and Germany would be taken over by  Turkish immigrants. "Soon, Russia will be the only white country  left in Europe."</p>

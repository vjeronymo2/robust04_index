			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S BACK TO FUTURE AS ANGEL BID ENDS  </P> <P> Still stuck on 89 for '89, the Angels officially began preparations for the  1990 baseball season Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The American League West championship they gamely pursued for more than five  months will belong in hands other than the Angels' for the 26th time in 29  years. Their 4-0 loss to Kansas City at Anaheim Stadium, coupled with Oakland's  4-3 victory over Texas, equaled elimination for the Angels on the 157th date of  their regular-season schedule.  </P> <P> And, cruelty upon cruelty, the home run that again torpedoed the Angels was  delivered by Dave Henderson, the anti-hero of '86, whose two-run shot up north  was the difference in the Athletics' victory over the Rangers.  </P> <P> Rubbed out . . . and not spared having it rubbed in.  </P> <P> At 89-68, the Angels are six games behind Oakland with five to play. Only  Kansas City, which remains five games back, has a mathematical chance of tying  Oakland for the title. The A's (95-62) have clinched at least a share of their  second consecutive AL West championship.  </P> <P> The Angels, meanwhile, squandered their fifth consecutive chance to win their  90th game. Last Wednesday, they logged victory No. 89 and haven't won since,  going 0-5 against Cleveland and Kansas City.  </P> <P> After a long and unlikely run -- they were tied for first place as late as Aug.  21 -- the Angels, in the end, went quietly. And that end left Manager Doug  Rader unprepared for its reality.  </P> <P> Or, at least, Rader refused to acknowledge it.  </P> <P> "I never anticipate losing and I never anticipate that tomorrow we're not in  the pennant race," Rader said. "I can't get my mind in the mind set to prepare  myself for failure."  </P> <P> Rader also refused to look back on the successes experienced by a team that  most expected to finish no better than fourth with no business winning 90  games.  </P> <P> "No reflections tonight," Rader said. "Tomorrow there will be. I need some  time."  </P> <P> Kirk McCaskill, Tuesday's losing pitcher, reacted much the same way.  </P> <P> "I'm not looking back on anything yet," said McCaskill, whose record dropped to  15-10. "We're still fighting for something, as far as I'm concerned. Second  place and possibly the second-best record in baseball means a lot, at least to  me.  </P> <P> "All of these things are valuable. We should always have goals. Granted, we're  not going to win this thing, but nothing was ever accomplished sitting back.  </P> <P> Contention ended rather predictably for the Angels. They were beaten by young  nemesis -- and AL Cy Young Award favorite -- Bret Saberhagen, who threw a  six-hitter to improve to 22-6, lower his earned-run average to 2.19 and extend  his consecutive scoreless-innings streak to 27, a Kansas City record.  </P> <P> By retiring pinch-hitter Jim Eppard on a fly ball to left field to complete the  shutout, Saberhagen eclipsed Roger Nelson's old Royal mark of 26 2/3 scoreless  innings, set in 1972.  </P> <P> So, from the Angels' vantage point, what's new? This was Saberhagen's 16th  appearance against the Angels, and with it, he won for the ninth time in 12  decisions. He is 2-0 against them this season and 5-1 at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> "Saberhagen is something else," Rader said. "I can't imagine a better pitcher  -- anywhere -- than him right now. He was throwing 93 (m.p.h.) in the ninth  inning and still had command of all three pitches.  </P> <P> "He's got it all."  </P> <P> Seldom, however, have the Angels made it easier for Saberhagen, who led, 3-0,  before throwing his first pitch. Angel starter Kirk McCaskill didn't retire a  hitter until striking out Kurt Stillwell, the No. 7 batter in the Kansas City  lineup. Before that, McCaskill:  </P> <P>  -- Hit leadoff man Kevin Seitzer with a pitch.  </P> <P>  -- Yielded a looping single to left field by Willie Wilson.  </P> <P>  -- Loaded the bases when George Brett beat out a grounder that skittered away  from Angel second baseman Johnny Ray.  </P> <P>  -- Surrendered a two-run broken-bat single to Bo Jackson.  </P> <P>  -- Gave up another infield single, this bouncing off the glove of shortstop  Kent Anderson, to Jim Eisenreich.  </P> <P>  -- Gave up a run-scoring single to left field by Danny Tartabull.  </P> <P> To that point, the only out McCaskill had recorded was at second base, when  Angel catcher Lance Parrish erased Jackson on a stolen-base try.  </P> <P> So at that point, Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann left the dugout to  offer McCaskill a few words of advice.  </P> <P> McCaskill promptly settled down -- he retired the next 12 hitters -- but by  then, Saberhagen was entrenched.  </P> <P> Saberhagen was in trouble only once, in the fifth inning, when Lance Parrish  led off with a single and Jack Howell then hit a double to left field.  </P> <P> With runners on second and third and no outs, Saberhagen got two in a hurry  when Anderson hit a bouncer to Brett at first base. Brett scooped up the ball  and stepped on the bag for one out, then watched as Parrish made a belated  break for home.  </P> <P> On the run, Brett fired an off-balance throw to catcher Bob Boone, who made the  tag on Parrish for a threat-killing double play. Saberhagen retired the next  batter, Brian Downing, on a ground ball to shortstop and was out of the inning.  </P> <P> Twelve outs later, the Angels were also out of time. Five games are left on  their schedule, but the next one that really counts for anything will be played  early next April.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> So, what's left for the Angels to play for? With a 4-2 final home stand, the  Angels would tie the club record for most victories in a season, 93, set by the  1982 American League West champions. With a 3-3 home stand, the Angels would  equal the franchise record for most victories at home, 53, set in 1967. . . .  The Angels' Johnny Ray and Kansas City's George Brett both ended protracted  batting slumps with first-inning singles. Ray was one for 18 before singling  off Bret Saberhagen, and Brett was one for 21 before beating out an infield hit  against Kirk McCaskill.  </P> <P> A'S ASSURED OF TIE  </P> <P> Oakland Athletics clinch at least a tie for their second straight AL West  title.

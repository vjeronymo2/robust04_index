			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Li presses for power progress China's premier, Mr Li Peng, has urged speedier progress in negotiations on a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) power project in southern China involving GEC-Alsthom and Chinese partners, Tony Walker reports from Beijing. Lord Prior, GEC chairman, said in Beijing yesterday Mr Li had left no doubt he was anxious for the project to move ahead quickly because of electricity supply problems. Lord Prior, who met Mr Li on Tuesday, said he expected negotiations on the coal-fired Jiaxing plant in Zhejiang province to finish next year, but financial discussions were proving complex. This will be GEC's first power project in which it will take an equity stake through a build-operate-transfer (BOT) funding arrangement.</p>

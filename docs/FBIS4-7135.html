			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Leaders of political  parties of different countries expressed full support to and  sympathy with "Let Us Defend and Advance the Cause of  Socialism", the Pyongyang declaration published in Pyongyang in  April 1992.    Branko Kitanovic, general secretary of the New Yugoslav  Communist Movement, said that delegates of many communist and  workers' parties and political parties of many countries  aspiring after socialism gathered in Pyongyang and declared to  the whole world that they would struggle for the victory of  socialism, and this was a historical event which marked a new  milestone in the strengthening and development of the socialist  and communist movement.    The Pyongyang declaration, he said, serves the communists  and  progressive peoples of the world as a common fighting program in  rebuilding the socialist and communist movement and advancing  the cause of socialism with a clear fighting goal on a new basis  after socialism has suffered a setback and capitalism has  revived in East European countries owing to moves of the  renegades of revolution.    Guillermo Garcia Ponce, general secretary of the "New  Alternative" of Venezuela, in a statement issued to the press  said the Pyongyang declaration is an inspiring banner which gave  firm confidence in victory to the revolutionary parties and  people of the world aspiring after socialism, and it declared to  the whole world that the victory of the socialist cause is  inevitable.    Guzman Rivera Castaneda, general secretary of the  Revolutionary Socialist Party of Peru, said the Pyongyang  declaration is a fine document which dealt a telling blow at the  imperialists who were resorting to vicious anti- communist  rackets, making a bluff.    Sean Garland, member of the Central Executive Committee of  the Workers' Party of Ireland, said the Pyongyang declaration is  the source of unity of all the progressive forces. The fact  that more than 200 revolutionary parties and progressive  political parties of the world signed the declaration fully  proves its great vitality, he added.    Ludo Martens, chairman of the Central Committee of the  Belgian Labour Party, said the Pyongyang declaration is a solemn  declaration announcing a new start of the communist movement.  The just cause of the revolutionary parties of the world who  are advancing under the banner of this declaration is sure to be  crowned with victory, he stressed.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Premier League agonises over its leading player THE Premier League, the new division for the top 22 English football clubs, is poised to kick off its first season without signing one of its biggest players - its commercial sponsor. A meeting of the clubs this week failed to agree on a proposed Pounds 9m sponsorship deal with Bass, the brewer, or a similar one from Ford, the motor manufacturer. Some clubs are thought to have opposed the Bass offer because of fears that it might jeopardise their own deals with other brewers. Ford's offer might have caused difficulties for Coventry City, which is sponsored by Peugeot. Some are also concerned that their financial independence may be at risk if the league controls marketing. The main bar to a deal appears to be the unwillingness of some clubs to surrender control over advertising hoardings at their grounds. Some clubs apparently believe they can sell advertising space in their own grounds at a higher rate than the league. Last year, the clubs in the English First Division - the Premier League's predecessor - received about Pounds 11m from league television deals and sponsorship. In the Premier League this season they expect to get some Pounds 45m. The wrangle over sponsorship is the latest disagreement to mar the launch of the division, designed to concentrate England's richest and most talented clubs in a 'super league'. But its membership is little different from that of the old First Division; promises of new investment have been slow to emerge; and, under the terms of a deal with the BBC and BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, live football from the league will be available only to those with satellite TV. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in BSkyB. Mr Rick Parry, league chief executive, said the situation was 'very disappointing'. The sponsorship offers showed that 'even in these tough times there are companies which have faith in football'. That faith may evaporate if clubs cannot begin to play the sponsorship game  -sacrificing individual interests for the sake of profits for all.</p>

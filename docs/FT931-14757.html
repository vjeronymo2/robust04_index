			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Dearer food pushes up underlying inflation rate UPWARD PRESSURE on seasonal food prices was the main influence behind the 0.1 per cent rise in underlying inflation last month compared with the previous month. The Central Statistical Office said that seasonal food prices were still low because of plentiful supplies of fresh fruit and vegetables. But prices nevertheless rose more in December than in the same month the previous year. As a result the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments - the Treasury's measure of underlying inflation - rose 3.7 per cent in the year to December compared with 3.6 per cent in the year to November. The fall in the all-items index from 139.7 in November to 139.2 last month, which took headline inflation to 2.6 per cent, was the result of further mortgage rate cuts. Housing costs fell 2.6 per cent in December compared with the previous month and the year-on-year rate dropped to 0.5 per cent from 3.5 per cent in the year to November. The CSO said the impact of the cut in mortgage interest rates on the all-items index was tempered by the upward movement of food prices. Seasonal food prices rose 4 per cent month-on-month, compared with a monthly rise of only 1.2 per cent in December 1991. Compared with a year ago, prices are still falling. In the year to December seasonal food prices dropped by 9.9 per cent, a slower fall than in the year to November when prices fell 12.4 per cent. Non-seasonal food prices rose a modest 0.5 per cent in December, but may pick up this month as increases are expected for butter, sugar, imported lamb and poultry. Continuing falls in the prices of second-hand cars were behind a 0.4 per cent monthly fall in motoring expenditure prices. Recent cuts in petrol prices are expected to exert downward pressure on the index this month. Christmas discounts on wines and spirits pushed alcoholic drinks prices down by 0.5 per cent on the month. Household goods prices rose 0.7 per cent on the month, reflecting price rises on furniture and electrical goods as new stock entered the shops. Year-on-year prices rose 2.1 per cent compared with 2 per cent in the year to November. Clothing and shoe prices fell by 0.5 per cent on the month, the sharpest fall for any December since 1954. That followed widespread special offers. The outlook for January is mixed. The headline rate will be pushed down by lower mortgage rates and a sharp fall in petrol costs, but seasonal food prices usually rise in January and alcoholic drinks may cost more as Christmas offers end.  ------------------------------------------------------------------     UK INFLATION RATE (+2.6 per cent)    RPI: 139.2 in December  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Housing (172)                           +0.5 per cent Motoring (143)                          +4.0 per cent Food (non-seasonal) (130)               +2.7 per cent Alcoholic drink (80)                    +5.0 per cent Household goods (77)                    +2.1 per cent Clothing &amp; Footwear (59)                -1.1 per cent Household services (48)                 +3.8 per cent Leisure goods (47)                      +1.5 per cent Catering (47)                           +5.2 per cent Fuel &amp; Light (47)                       -0.5 per cent Personal goods, serv.

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (6): Bars face rigorous tests - London Good Delivery List IF a large gold bar is good for delivery on to the London market, then it is acceptable anywhere where gold is traded. This did not happen by design. No-one is sure when the words good delivery came into being. Mr Les Edgar, chairman of the London Bullion Market Association's physical subcommittee, says the phrase surfaced in the 1920s, but the oldest surviving list of good delivery refiners available to him dates from 1934. 'We don't quite know what went on in the early days as the informal customs of the market developed into formality,' he says. There is no way of knowing how bars were tested, but they were known to be deliverable and were the currency of the day. That first list comprises mainly British refineries throughout the world, including South Africa. The London market shut for the Second World War and did not open again until 1954, when the good delivery list, although dominated by British and Commonwealth refineries, was much bigger. Since then it has expanded to include Asian and Latin American refineries as different countries discovered the advantages of good delivery status. The list is still growing - three refiners have been added this year. A rigorous process has to be undergone in order to attain good delivery recognition. But refiners remain keen to get on the list, which is printed every year and sent to all LBMA members and other interested parties such as central banks. Mr Edgar believes this is because if a refiner cannot add value to his gold, but has to cast the raw material, 'it's good to know it's of a standard someone will always buy with no hassle'. Any applicant must have been in existence for not less than five years, and refining for not less than three years. It has to have been producing more than 10 tonnes of gold a year in the form of bars weighing 400 troy ounces. The net worth of the applicant must exceed Pounds 10m, and the central bank of the country in which the applicant is based must have accepted its bars. Only when all these conditions have been met can the applicant write to the LBMA, including among other documents the central bank letter of recognition, audited financial statements and 10 colour photographs showing bars produced by the company. An applicant can be rejected at this paper work stage of the process, and never make it to the second, technical stage. 'We might see from photographs that his bars look like rubbish, or we may have problems with his finances, says Mr Edgar. Once the paperwork requirements have been satisfied, the applicant must provide a sample of gold bars which comply with the LBMA specifications. They must weigh between 350 troy and 430 troy ounces, and be 99.5 per cent pure gold. The specifications reflect the necessity of keeping to an unchanging standard so that all the bars already deep in vaults around the world are not invalidated. The very fact that the weight is measured in troy ounces, a unit used at the annual fair at Troyes in France in the Middle Ages, is testimony to gold's value as a steady currency in a changing world. (A troy ounce is slightly heavier than the UK ounce at 14.58 to the lb, equivalent to 32.15 per kilogramme). In reality modern bars are consistently close to 400 troy ounces, and modern refining techniques mean that most gold is of 99.99 per cent purity, 'and frequently a premium can be obtained for such high grade material,' says Mr Edgar. Each bar has a serial number and the stamp of the refiner. It is traditional not to put the weight on the bar because if there were an error on the original weighing the bar would have to be amended. The gold not only has to pass the technical specifications, it also has to look good. 'Bars should be of good appearance, free from surface cavities or other irregularities, layering and excessive shrinkage, and must be easy to handle and convenient to stack,' the LBMA demands. This is very much a subjective test. The vault man in charge of the bars will get another three or four vault men to attend from the eight vaults in London and carry out a joint inspection. It is possible for bars to be rejected at this stage and a request for bars to be resubmitted. 'If we are happy at the eye stage the bars are sent to two referees,' says Mr Edgar. They carry out a series of assays and melting procedures and produce a report. The applicant is then sent 24 gold samples he has to assay. 'His assaying ability is thoroughly tested,' says Mr Edgar. 'Where problems arise it is on the assay testing side - the test is necessarily a tight one.' Past this last hurdle, the subcommittee will recommend the applicant to the LBMA as a producer of acceptable bars. Only then will the LBMA confirm that the bars are good delivery in London.</p>

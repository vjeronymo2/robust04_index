			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE RACE IS ON;  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ENTERS STATE TREASURER CONTEST  </P> <P> Ending weeks of speculation, former U.S. Treasurer Angela M. (Bay) Buchanan of  Irvine barnstormed California on Tuesday to announce her candidacy for the  Republican nomination for state treasurer.  </P> <P> Buchanan, 40, flew to Sacramento, Fresno, Burbank and San Diego to promote her  challenge of Treasurer Thomas Hayes, a Republican. Hayes, 43, was appointed to  his post by Gov. George Deukmejian last year after the death of Jesse M. Unruh.  </P> <P> Buchanan, calling herself "the underdog" to the governor's candidate,  nevertheless dismissed suggestions that she was defying Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "I'm not running against George Deukmejian," Buchanan said at the sparsely  attended press conference in Fresno. "If he (Deukmejian) wants to run for  treasurer, I'll be glad to step out," Buchanan said.  </P> <P> The announcement is expected to set in motion a costly internecine battle that  Deukmejian and other Republican leaders had hoped to avoid. Many GOP insiders  were unhappy that Deukmejian had not chosen someone with stronger party  credentials to succeed Unruh in the only constitutional office that has fallen  vacant during Deukmejian's term in office.  </P> <P> Hayes, the nonpartisan state auditor general for 10 years, had purposefully  stayed clear of party politics during his tenure. His job required him to make  recommendations to the Legislature and governor regarding state government  operations. He registered as a Republican when he was appointed state  treasurer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questions Credentials  </P> <P> In an interview Tuesday, Buchanan avoided attacking Hayes' record but sharply  questioned his party credentials.  </P> <P> "There is no reason for conservatives to mount a campaign on behalf of Tom  Hayes. He has never lifted a finger for the (conservative) movement," Buchanan  said.  </P> <P> Whoever wins the GOP primary will likely face Kathleen Brown, the leading  Democratic candidate, in the 1990 general election. Brown is the sister of  former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat)  Brown Sr.  </P> <P> "I believe I can beat Kathleen Brown. I can keep this office for Republicans,"  Buchanan said in Sacramento. Buchanan herself is the sister of a political  figure with his own fame in GOP circles, Washington commentator Patrick  Buchanan.  </P> <P> "A run of Jerry Brown's sister against Pat Buchanan's will bring national  attention and national money," Bay Buchanan said Tuesday, estimating that she  will need up to $1.5 million for the primary alone.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A First for Women  </P> <P> Should Buchanan and Kathleen Brown both win their party's nominations, it will  be the first time in California history that two women have faced each other in  a general election for a state constitutional office. Secretary of State March  Fong Eu and former state Treasurer Ivy Baker Priest -- who coincidentally was  also a U.S. treasurer before she ran for the state post -- are the only two  women to have been elected to statewide office, according to Caren Daniels  Meade of the secretary of state's office.  </P> <P> Buchanan's entry into the race has split Republicans in her home turf of Orange  County, with several Assembly members siding with Hayes, including Orange  County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, while Orange County Republican Party  Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes is backing Buchanan.  </P> <P> Several county Republicans said they know and like Buchanan but do not want to  see the party's resources depleted when there is a qualified Republican  incumbent.  </P> <P> "This is one of those tough decisions when you have to pick between two people,  both of whom you like," said Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Huntington Beach),  who has decided to support Hayes.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said he was "extremely disappointed"  at Deukmejian for failing to select either a politician or "someone who was  very active in the Republican Party." But now that the governor had used his  "political chips" on the appointment, Ferguson said he thought it best for  Republicans to get behind Hayes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Embarrassment for Governor  </P> <P> "If he (Hayes) lost now, it would be a terrible embarrassment to the governor,"  Ferguson said.  </P> <P> Others in the county's legislative delegation, including Assembly Minority  Leader Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) and Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden  Grove), are prepared to wait and see.  </P> <P> But Buchanan's candidacy has sparked unbridled enthusiasm among another sector  of the county's conservative Republicans.  </P> <P> "I consider Bay Buchanan the most intelligent woman I have ever met in  politics," said Fuentes, adding that he will support Buchanan. "I esteem her  very highly."  </P> <P> Buchanan is known as a hard-driving, politically ambitious Republican who has  earned her way into party politics on the national, state and local levels.  </P> <P> "Bay has good campaign instincts because she is a fighter," said Eileen  Padberg, a GOP political consultant. "She's aggressive and she's intelligent."  </P> <P> Buchanan is expected to be able to raise money both statewide and nationally  for her campaign because of her former position as U.S. treasurer and her ties  to the Reagan and Bush administrations. At 30, she was named in 1979 as  national treasurer of Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign. In 1986, she  managed the U.S. Senate campaign of Los Angeles commentator Bruce Herschensohn,  a fellow conservative who came in second for the Republican nomination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ability to Raise Money'  </P> <P> "She has a great ability to raise money also, and that's the name of the game,"  Buchanan's business partner, Jackie Campbell, said. "That will tell the tale."  </P> <P> While a few local Republicans muttered privately that they thought of Buchanan  as a hired hand for GOP causes who had done little in the way of actual  volunteer work, Fuentes praised Buchanan as an "in-the-trenches, hands-on,  volunteer and professional leader of campaigns and conservative causes."  </P> <P> Fuentes, who has been known to scold Republicans who have jumped into primaries  where there is a GOP incumbent, or even a favorite of party leaders, defended  Buchanan's candidacy.  </P> <P> "There is a sharp difference here in that the appointed incumbent . . . never  has been the nominee of the party," Fuentes said.  </P> <P> John Cronin, a member of the Lincoln Club, a prestigious Orange County GOP  support group, also had high praise for Buchanan.  </P> <P> "I'd say Bay is someone who's paid her dues inside the party," Cronin said. "I  think she'd be a dynamic candidate."  </P> <P> He added that he also thought she would have a better chance of defeating  another woman in the race.  </P> <P> Even her recently divorced husband, William R. Jackson, had nothing but  positive things to say about her qualifications for state treasurer.  </P> <P> "She is very, very, very hard-working," Jackson said. "She is also very, very,  very good with numbers. And she is also very, very, very bright."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lists His Accomplishments  </P> <P> Hayes, who has never run for elective office, has said that because he was not  affiliated with either party, legislators reviewed his recommendations to them  on the merits and without concern for politics. He said that as a result, he  was able to gain approval for programs that saved the state more than $400  million over his 10 years in the office.  </P> <P> Hayes has been traveling the state meeting local Republicans in an effort to  bolster his candidacy. His itinerary has included six trips to Orange County in  recent months, speaking to members of the Lincoln Club and other groups and  meeting privately with potential supporters.  </P> <P> On April 27, Hayes and Deukmejian will appear jointly at a private,  $1,000-per-person luncheon in Newport Beach being organized by Orange County  developer Kathryn Thompson. Among those who are expected to attend are some of  the county's top developers, including Don Koll, George Argyros and William  Lyon.  </P> <P> Buchanan has hired Washington consultant Roger Stone and pollster Lance  Tarrance for her effort. She pledged Tuesday to refuse donations from anyone  who does any business with the treasurer's office.  </P> <P> Hayes has hired as his campaign manager Brian Lungren, brother of former Rep.  Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach), whom Deukmejian first chose as Unruh's  replacement but who failed to win legislative confirmation. Several of the  governor's closest supporters, including his former chief of staff, lawyer  Steve Merksamer, will play a key role.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called a Wise Move  </P> <P> Also, in an unexpected stroke of political savvy, Hayes convinced B.T. Collins,  a Republican who once was chief of staff to the younger Gov. Brown, to be his  chief of staff. Collins is revered on both sides of the political fence.  </P> <P> "His support of Hayes makes a very dramatic difference in Hayes and makes up to  a large extent for his lack of political experience," Assemblyman Ferguson  said. "B.T. has been twisting arms throughout the state. . . . He has more than  enough political acumen to make sure that Hayes meets the right people as he  goes around the state."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campaign Trail  </P> <P> Angela M. Buchanan of Irvine, announcing a bid for GOP nomination for state  treasurer in 1990, covered the state Tuesday from Sacramento to San Diego.  </P></p>

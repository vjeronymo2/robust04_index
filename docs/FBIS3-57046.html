			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin] </F>   [Text] Kazan January 21 TASS -- "There were and there are  no problems between the Russian and Tatar interior ministries,"  Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin told a news conference in  Kazan on Friday. All efforts by national extremists to drive a  wedge between Russia and Tatarstan are in vain, the minister  added.    In the minister's opinion, everything should be done in a  civilised way. A government decision between Russia and  Tatarstan is being drafted now. It will define ways of  delegating powers.    All this is being made to reform the Russian Interior  Ministry. The first move has been made: The role of city and  district militia departments was increased. Their powers were  enlarged.    These departments were granted additional rights and,  consequently, their duties were increased. Functions which city  and district departments are unable to fulfill, are delegated to  regional departments or the Interior Ministry. The entire  ministry will be remade on such principles.    Yerin noted that he gave a news conference on last year's  results for the first time. Although the crime situation  remains difficult, there are some positive changes. Crime rate  rose by 1.4 per cent over the past year, while in 1992 it was 24  per cent.    The rate of crime exposure is at the level of 50.6 per cent  and for serious crimes -- 55.6 per cent.    The situation in Tatarstan is much better, the minister  stressed. The general rate of crime exposure here is 60 per  cent. The minister attributed this to special crime control  measures taken by the republic for the second year running.    These measures should be thoroughly studied, the minister  noted. In Yerin's opinion, Tatarstan outstripped Russian law  enforcement bodies in taking initiatives in the sphere of crime  control, which should be acclaimed.</p>

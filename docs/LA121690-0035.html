			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> ON THE TIP: The "Explicit Lyrics" sticker has become such a popular  record-industry marketing tool that it's practically impossible to walk into a  record store without seeing a stack of CDs stamped accordingly. So it was only  a matter of time before a shrewd rap artist (or his record company) decided --  why bother with a sticker when we can just make it the title of our album?  Which is why Virgin Records' has just released a new rap album called "Barsha's  Explicit Lyrics."  </P> <P> (Trust us -- we've heard the lyrics and Barsha isn't exaggerating.) . . . Our  fave oddball novelty holiday compilation is from I.R.S. Records. Titled "Just  in Time for Christmas," it features Squeeze's "Christmas Day," Wall of Voodoo's  "Shouldn't Have Given Him a Gun for Christmas," the dB's' "Home for the  Holidays" and Dread Zeppelin's "All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front  Teeth," which the band concludes by segueing into "Viva Las Vegas." . . . And  contrary to what we reported last week, Profile Records is no longer  distributed by California Record Distributors. Profile co-owner Steve Plotnicki  says that the label severed its ties with CRD in mid-September and is now  handled by Landmark Distributors, a Profile-owned distribution company.  </P></p>

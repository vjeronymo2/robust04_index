			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Colombia poll victor denies drug cartel link Colombia's president-elect Mr Ernesto Samper yesterday vehemently denied accusations that his election campaign had benefited from contributions by the country's Cali cocaine cartel. A tape containing conversations allegedly detailing possible contributions was released in Bogota yesterday, only three days after the the election success of Mr Samper, a member of the ruling Liberal party. The tape was released by Mr Samper's defeated opponent, the Conservative Mr Andres Pastrana. He was given the tape in Cali just before the election and passed it on to outgoing President Cesar Gaviria. The prosecutor general is investigating the case. Mr Samper said his campaign treasury had not received any money 'of doubtful origin' and offered his accounts to the prosecutor general for examination. Mr Pastrana played the tape and said it could not in any way be interpreted as involving his own campaign. He asked Mr Samper to issue a statement saying he would resign as president-elect if it was shown the Liberal treasury had received money from drug traffickers. Three conversations are recorded on the tape, the first two allegedly between a journalist and a senior member of the Cali cartel. The third is between the same journalist and a man considered to be leader of the Cali group. Nicknames and elliptical references are used in the conversations as well as some direct mention of figures in the presidential campaign. At one point the journalist says multi-million dollar contributions are needed and the answer is: 'Those are there. That is defined.' The context suggests this refers to the Samper campaign. However, transcripts of the tape released in the Bogota press also refer to a meeting with a member of Mr Pastrana's campaign, and to contacts with independent law-and-order candidate Mr Miguel Maza Marquez, who later backed Mr Samper after defeat in the first round. Diplomats have said they would be surprised if some drug money had not entered the campaign of both the run-off candidates, though they stressed this could have occurred without the candidates' knowledge.</p>

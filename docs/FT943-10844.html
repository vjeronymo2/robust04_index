			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Voluntary health plan by Mitchell Senator George Mitchell, the leader of the Democratic majority in the US Senate, yesterday proposed a healthcare reform bill that would require employers to offer - but not pay for - health insurance for their workers, with the goal of extending coverage to 95 per cent of the US population by the year 2000. 'What I am proposing is a voluntary system which includes insurance market reform, subsidies for the uninsured and voluntary purchasing cooperatives,' Mr Mitchell said yesterday in presenting his plan. The bill could be debated on the Senate floor as early as next week, during debate in the House of Representatives on a different compromise proposal, presented last week by Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic majority leader. The latter's bill, like the original plan set out by President Bill Clinton nine months ago, would require employers to pay for 80 per cent of the cost of their employees' health insurance. Mr Mitchell said the Congressional budget office had agreed with him that his bill would extend health insurance coverage to 95 per cent of the population by 2000. He said yesterday that 95 per cent was not universal coverage, but was 'a very important measurement on the way to universal coverage.' If the goal of 95 per cent is met - which would bring into the healthcare net 25m-30m of the 35m-40m people now uninsured - a national commission would recommend ways to move further towards universal coverage. If the goal is not met, and if Congress does not then enact other measures to make up the shortfall, then a requirement that employers pay half of their workers' insurance premiums would be triggered in 2002. Mr Mitchell said the percentage of people in the US covered by the health system had declined from 90 per cent in 1980 to about 85 per cent, and that 100,000 people were losing their health insurance every month. Like virtually all other health reform proposals, the Mitchell bill would stop insurance companies dropping coverage, increasing premiums or reducing benefits to someone who becomes ill. States would certify non-profit health insurance purchasing co-operatives in every region, with the existing federal employees' health benefits programme stepping in where no other co-operative emerges. Every business would have to offer to its employees - but not pay for - a choice of at least three health plans, either through the co-operative, in the case of small companies, or on its own, in the case of companies with more than 500 employees. Subsidies aimed at low-income families, with special emphasis on children and pregnant women, would be introduced to encourage more people to take advantage of the insurance offered. Most of the cost of the bill would be met by savings on the existing government Medicare programme, estimated at Dollars 278bn (Pounds 181bn) over the next 10 years, and by increasing the tax on cigarettes by 45 cents to 69 cents a pack.</p>

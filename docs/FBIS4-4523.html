			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yi Kang-tok from Tokyo] </F>   [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who arrived in  Tokyo today after completing a visit to the United States, held  talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Hata. They decided that  the two nations will continue efforts for a solution to the  North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue.    The foreign ministers of two countries shared the view that  for North Korea to resolve its nuclear issue through  negotiations, North Korea should first accept the nuclear  inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and  should respond to North-South dialogue, and that China is  playing an affirmative role for a change in the North Korean  attitude.    During the talks, the foreign ministers of two nations  shared  the understanding that in the event that North Korea refuses  IAEA nuclear inspection in defiance of the statement by the UN  Security Council president, hard-line countermeasures, including  UN applied sanctions, will be inevitable. Thus, it is likely  that the two foreign ministers discussed concrete measures for  sanctions.    At the same time, Foreign Ministers Han Sung-chu and Hata  agreed to work out promptly the follow-up programs discussed  during the ROK-Japan summit last month, including the plan to  support permanent repatriation of Korean compatriots in Sakhalin.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will meet with Japanese Prime  Minister Hosokawa tomorrow and will explain to him the result of  the ROK-PRC summit and joint measures on the North Korean  nuclear issue, which were discussed between the ROK and the  United States during his visit to the United States.</p>

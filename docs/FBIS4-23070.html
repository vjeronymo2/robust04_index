M. Ginzburg, N. G. Keratishvili, Ye. L. </F> Korzhenevich, V. I. Sapritskiy; UDC 621.383.3]    [Abstract] This article describes a method of monitoring  the linearity of opto-electronic channels used in superweak  electromagnetic field reception systems operating in photon  count mode. The method is based on control sources of radiation  with known (Poisson) photon statistics and comparison with the  photon count statistics at the channel output. This method was  used in absolute measurement of the quantum efficiency of  photoreceptors using spontaneous parametric scattering. The  advantage of this method is the simplicity of the equipment. A  simple comparison method is visual comparison of histograms. An  algorithm is developed to improve upon the comparison. This  method is suitable for the measurement of the limits of  linearity of opto-electronic channels and operational  monitoring. Figures 2; references 4 (Russian).</p>

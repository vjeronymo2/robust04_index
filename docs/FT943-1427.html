			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / There's a whole lotta coffee in . . . Ethiopia: There's some good news at last in a country that has had more than its share of suffering, both natural and man-made For a country usually associated with drought, famine and war, Ethiopia has for once something to celebrate. Plentiful rains have raised hopes of a good harvest after 18 months of drought. And coffee prices are soaring because of frost and drought in Brazil, with Ethiopia among those reaping the benefits. In addition, the discovery of the world's oldest human fossils, solving the missing link between man and apes, is a source of pride to a much beleaguered people. Ethiopia earlier hit the international headlines 10 years ago, when millions starved because of persistent drought. The country was back in the news this May, when government and aid organisations were warning of a potentially worse disaster this year; early-season rains had failed and thousands were dying of hunger. An Ethiopian government delegation organised a world tour to drum up food donations. A disaster may well be averted. Rains in much of the country have been heavy, and continue to fall. 'The main season's crop harvest is very very promising. If - and it's a very big if - moisture continues for another few weeks then there will be a good harvest. At the present time there is no indication of an emergency situation in our areas in the coming months ahead,' says Dr Getachew Diriba, of CARE International, one of 160 non-governmental organisations operating in Ethiopia. Aid organisations working in other parts of the country echo his remarks, but stress emergency food will still be necessary until the harvest. Coffee farmers are also getting a big break. World coffee prices have almost trebled this year because of Brazil's misfortune. Ethiopia's farmers are therefore taking better care of their plants and sending more to the export markets. The country expects coffee exports worth Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) this year, compared with Dollars 100m in 1993. Coffee - which originated in Ethiopia and grows wild - accounts for more than half of the country's export earnings. Such good news stands out in a country struggling for the past three years with the transition to democracy after three decades of conflict which ended with the collapse of the Mengistu regime and independence for Eritrea. Ethiopia has 55m people - second only to Nigeria in Africa in population - and has one of the world's highest population growth rates. And while 85 per cent of the population is rural, eking a living from the land, the country is unable to feed itself. Even with a good harvest, the country needs an extra 500,000 tonnes of cereals to feed its people each year. Add to that drought, pest infestation of crops, and the needs of people fleeing from ethnic conflicts, the return of exiled Ethiopians, refugees from Eritrea, and disabled servicemen, and the figure more than doubles. Food aid is a necessity for the foreseeable future. There are other huge demands on the transitional government. The country's infrastructure is severely under-developed. Roads, electricity and telecommunications all need huge investment - not only to make life bearable for Ethiopians but to attract foreign investors. People need such basics as schools, hospitals and jobs; in the capital, Addis Ababa, about 60 per cent are unemployed, according to one study. Many of the jobless set up home-grown businesses selling necessities like injera - a pancake like bread  -or they polish shoes, or guard cars, or beg. Many small businesses are being formed - from restaurants and travel agencies to fruit and vegetable stalls. But the government is moving in the right direction, against all odds, according to the World Bank. A structural adjustment programme is in place, involving a devaluation of the national currency, the birr, the introduction of market pricing and privatisation plans. Defence spending has been reduced by about two thirds while the education and health budget has doubled. 'I will be hard put to find another African country in which such a clear change is evident in just three years,' says Abhay Deshpande, the resident representative for the World Bank in Ethiopia.

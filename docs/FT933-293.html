			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (11): Jungle villages drawn into war SENDERO'S biggest recent action - which attracted only a fraction of the international attention caused by last July's car-bomb in a Lima suburb - was aimed at a series of villages in Peru's central jungle. More than 60 peasant farmers and Ashaninka Indians, including women and children, were hacked to pieces by a Sendero column. One of the most troubling aspects of the August 18 Mazamari-Puerto Ocopa killings is that Ashaninkas, the most populous of Peru's 64 Amazonian tribes, were among both the victims and the aggressors. For several years past, Sendero has been recruiting Ashaninkas to swell its fighting forces. Estimates of the numbers of Ashaninka in Peru vary from 50,000 to 80,000. Most live in the valleys of the Tambo and Ene rivers in Peru's eastern jungle where the illegal coca trade flourishes. Essentially peace-loving, they have allowed colonos to settle on adjoining lands. But in recent years, Sendero has entered Ashaninka territory, running drugs protection rackets and taking hostage men, women and children to fight and labour for them. The children are indoctrinated in Sendero-run 'popular schools',reciting Marxist-Leninist-Maoist slogans. CAAP, Peru's centre for applied anthropology, estimates that 10,000 Ashaninkas are currently held captive by Sendero. Army patrols, often Ashaninka-assisted, periodically rescue some of those lured or forced into joining the guerrilla war against the Peruvian state. In one jungle town, Puerto Bermudez, Ashaninkas have established their own army. Their weapons are primarily bows and arrows but the government has also distributed hunting rifles to help them defend their territory against Sendero. President Fujimori appears to be supporting Ashaninka calls for more native battalions and has promised a new airport on the eastern front of Ashaninka territory. If subversive activity is in sharp decline in the capital, victory in Peru's remote jungle looks still to be a long way off.</p>

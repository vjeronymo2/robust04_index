			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: Gloomy Delors sees his star falling - Lionel Barber sums up an awful year for the European Commission's battered president MR JACQUES DELORS has long been riding for a fall. Imperious, intelligent, and unusually sensitive to criticism, Mr Delors has made plenty of enemies during his near eight-year stint as president of the European Commission. Toward the end of the 1980s, when his influence reached its peak, Mr Delors could see off most challengers - even Mrs Thatcher. But 1992 has been an awful year for Jacques Delors, a succession of political crises within the European Community which culminated this week in an squalid public row with one of his own Commissioners over the breakdown of the Gatt world trade talks. Mr Ray MacSharry, the Irish agriculture commissioner, has long been gunning for Mr Delors. A blunt-spoken man with a healthy dose of personal political ambition, Mr MacSharry is a skilled negotiator who was convinced that he could reach a deal with the US on reducing farm subsidies - the single biggest obstacle to a Gatt agreement. Such a deal would have capped Mr MacSharry's four-year term as agriculture commissioner, surpassing his own considerable achievement last May in securing agreement between the EC member states to reform the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). CAP reform, which will substantially reduce future EC farm production, was in Mr MacSharry's mind the only basis on which there could be a deal with the Americans. The reason for this week's explosion is thus easily grasped: Mr MacSharry believes Mr Delors - by allegedly interfering in the negotiations - is not only acting as a surrogate for his native France, but is also questioning the very CAP reform which he supported earlier this year. Mr Delors declared himself 'outraged' by the charges of sabotage in London yesterday. Privately, he has told close colleagues that he definitely supports CAP reform and that he has never had any intention of undermining Mr MacSharry in his role as one of the EC's top two Gatt negotiators. At the same time, however, he is understood to be adamant that the outgoing Bush administration has not made sufficient concessions on farm exports, and that he would abstain in a future vote in the European Commission on a Gatt deal on the present terms. He may not have instructed Mr MacSharry to this effect, but he will doubtless have made his feelings known. Charges that Mr Delors is a French surrogate are overblown. He cites, for example, his decision last year to abstain rather than support the Franco-Italian bid for DeHavilland, the Canadian aircraft maker, which was blocked by the full Commission. However, critics say this was an easy choice: his vote was never going to be crucial because there was already a blocking majority in place. There is little doubt that Mr Delors is on some issues reflexively anti-American. When he talks about the need for 'adolescent Europe' to be able to say 'No to Big Brother',(America), he sounds as if he has just finished reading Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber's Le Defi Americain  - but as one Brussels wit put it yesterday: 'It is not the American challenge we should worry about, it's the Japanese.' The recent troubles in the Community, which began last June when the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty on European Union, have undoubtedly led to an eclipse in Mr Delors' power and influence. Once known as 'Mr Europe' because of his personal role in prompting the creation of a single European market and the effort to forge a single European currency, he has been eclipsed as national leaders in Europe have gone their own separate ways. Equally, his star has fallen as doubts have grown about the prospects for monetary union for the Twelve. 'He must be asking himself: 'Was it all a great mistake?'' says one Brussels diplomat. The drift within the EC has led to a period of intense frustration. Mr Delors feels marginalised. He would like to force leaders to discuss the really important issues such as the need for a pan-European economic growth package, further financial support for the poorer states to entice them to stick to the path of fiscal rectitude - the so-called Delors II package. Mr Delors has also reverted to his old habit of 'shooting from the lip'. Last week, he issued a blunt warning to Denmark that it could not expect legally binding exemptions from the Maastricht treaty. This week, he took the unusual step on Dutch radio of naming Mr Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, as his preferred successor - even though his own term does not expire until 1994. Such talk has provoked rumours that Mr Delors may be about to quit. Close aides say that Mr Delors feels bruised, but he is not about to leave his post. Others who have spoken to the Commission president in the past few days describe him as 'right up against the wall, his own wall'. By this they mean his own sense of frustration at being turned, unfairly, into a scapegoat for all the Community's ills.</p>

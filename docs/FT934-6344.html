			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Exchange rates help Tate &amp; Lyle Tate &amp; Lyle's combination of swings and roundabouts was largely favourable in the year to September 25, with profits before tax at Pounds 222.5m against Pounds 189.5m, although profits were still below the record Pounds 230.8m achieved in 1991. The pre-tax figure was boosted by Pounds 19.1m from exchange rate gains. Group sales were 13.4 per cent higher at Pounds 3.82bn, and operating profits rose by 13.6 per cent to Pounds 269.6m. Two of the five divisions suffered profit falls at the pre-interest level. In the North American sugar business profits fell from Pounds 39.6m to Pounds 28m, with Domino - the cane business - largely to blame as lower sugar prices and selling quotas hit margins. A strike at one plant cost Dollars 6m (Pounds 4m). Profits from Western, the beet business, also fell, with Dollars 7m of start-up costs from a new desugarisation plant, although this is now trading profitably. The other division which suffered lower profits was European cereal sweeteners and starches, where the decline was from Pounds 54m to Pounds 51.4m. Lower prices were caused by a potato starch glut, after a record crop, and as the problems of the paper industry meant it used less starch. Outside North America, profits from sugar rose from Pounds 71.2m to Pounds 94.8m, including the UK up from Pounds 49.9m to Pounds 64.4m, with a Pounds 4.6m stock profit thanks to the green pound devaluation. Productivity improved 10 per cent in the UK. Profits from North American starch and sweeteners rose from Pounds 65.3m to Pounds 84.7m, with Staley, a problem area in 1992, up from Dollars 118.7m to Dollars 130m. In 1991 Staley made Dollars 172.5m. The partial recovery in 1993 was despite pricing pressures, a Dollars 12m rationalisation provision and a lock-out at one plant. Animal feeds and bulk storage profits rose from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 25.1m. Sucralose, a sugar substitute Tate has developed, lost Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 4m) and is not expected to make significant profits until it gains approval in the big markets of the US and Europe. It has gained acceptance in Canada, and has recently been approved in Australia and Russia. Net interest charges fell from Pounds 47.9m to Pounds 47.1m. A settlement of a tax dispute in the US cut the tax charge from 26.2 per cent in 1992 to 24.7 per cent. Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 26.2p to 32.7p.</p>

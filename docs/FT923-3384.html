			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Maastricht, a vital matter of yes or no - The implications of the vital referendum in France A FRENCH referendum would not normally seem a matter of importance for British investors. Sometimes, though, the financial markets seize on a particular event and give it enormous significance. So it is with the French vote on September 20 over whether to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Five years ago, the markets would have viewed progress towards European monetary union as purely an academic issue. Now, it has the power to ruin economies. The problem lies with the economic strength of Germany and the determination of the Bundesbank (the nation's central bank) to defeat inflation. International investors have had a natural preference for the Deutschemark over other European currencies. Other countries in the exchange rate mechanism traditionally have been forced to offer higher interest rates to attract investors and maintain their parity against the Deutschemark. But the prospect of European monetary union via the Maastricht treaty altered the equation. Eventually, there would be one currency and one interest rate across the Continent. So, investors who bought the other currencies in the ERM would effectively be buying 'higher yielding Deutschemarks.' This theory of 'convergence' meant that those who bought European bonds would enjoy capital gains as yields fell gradually to German levels. (Remember that, as yields fall, prices rise). The outcome was that the differentials between German interest rates and the rates of other ERM countries were able to narrow. But the No vote in the Danish referendum earlier this year, and the doubts about the result of the French poll, have thrown the whole process into doubt. If the French vote No, progress towards European monetary union will stop. It is even possible that the exchange rate mechanism, which has brought a measure of European currency stability for more than a decade, will break up. Such uncertainty makes international investors flock for the safe haven of the Deutschemark, the one currency they are certain will not be devalued. That has put immense pressure on the European currencies - such as the pound and the lira - perceived to be weaker. There are two obvious responses for the other ERM countries. One is to devalue, something that seems unacceptable politically. The second is to raise interest rates and increase the differential with Germany. But German rates are high already and, with most European economies in a weak state, no government - especially Britain's - wants to risk the damage a rate rise would cause. The Italians have been forced to bite the bullet, though; will the UK have to follow? Those are the stakes behind the French poll. We asked City experts what would happen to markets in the event of a Oui or Non vote. See Page 6, Section One.</p>

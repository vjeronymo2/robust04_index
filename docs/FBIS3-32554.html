			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Milagros Duran] </F>   [Text] Division General Rafael Angel Montero Revette,  minister of defense, said it will be very difficult for the  military personnel charged with participating in the 4 February  [1992] and 27 November [1992] coup attempts to reenter the Armed  Forces, thus the defense minister's office is "trying to  incorporate them into civilian life without problems."    Minister Montero explained that the respective files are  being studied by the court martial and the court in charge of  the case in order to make recommendations to President Caldera.    [EL NACIONAL] And how long will that take?    [Montero] I can't say, but we are studying them all.    [EL NACIONAL] What can you tell us about the return of the  military personnel who sought asylum in Peru?    [Montero] So far we haven't had any contact with them, but  we  are studying their files to solve the problem.    [EL NACIONAL] They must come before the law?    [Montero] The president already said that they must come  before the law. They have been notified of this several times.    [EL NACIONAL] How are your investigations proceeding  regarding the alleged sale of weapons to Colombia by the  Venezuelan soldiers?    [Montero] We have a DIM [Directorate of Military  Intelligence] officer in Colombia right now coordinating the  investigation, and we are trying to determine whether their is  any connection between the two cases. Right now we are in the  middle of the investigations.    [EL NACIONAL] The Zulia State governor said Yucpa Indians  were massacred in Sierra de Perija. What do you have to say  about this?    [Montero] There was no massacre. What happened was that a  trooper reacted. He was attacked with sticks and machetes, he  reacted, and, regrettably, it happened. Vice Admiral Huizi  Clavier will go to Zulia on 7 February to coordinate with the  governor for an investigation of the problem at the scene.    [EL NACIONAL] Is the possibility of reintegrating the  coupist  officers into the Armed Forces being studied?    [Montero] Yes, it is being studied, and they know it will be  difficult for them to be allowed to return to the Armed Forces.  We are looking for the best way for them to leave the  organization but through the front door with no problems later  in civilian life.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Johnson Matthey to be sued by GM SHARES IN Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, lost more than 4 per cent of their value and dropped by 22p to 480p yesterday on news that General Motors, the world's biggest vehicle group, had filed a lawsuit against JM in a US District Court. The suit alleges 'irregularities in accounting for precious metals used in catalytic converters'. GM is seeking damages, punitive damages and legal costs but an official said last night it was too early to judge what these might total. JM said the action had 'come out of the blue' and it needed more time to study the details. Nevertheless, the allegations were denied and would be 'vigorously defended'. JM supplies about 40 per cent of the anti-pollution vehicle catalysts GM requires. In the US, the vehicle group provides platinum group metals which are then used by JM to coat the catalysts. A JM official said that this business had not been interrupted by the law suit. Three years ago the two companies were embroiled in similar litigation which JM described then as 'arising out of the interpretation of a contract to supply autocatalysts'. GM said this was settled out of court. JM said that matter was resolved 'without material loss (to JM)' late in 1991 and a new four-year contract was signed with GM in 1992.</p>

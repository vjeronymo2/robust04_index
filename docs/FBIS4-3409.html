			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Qiu Jiangbo (6726 3068 3134)] </F>   [Text] Fuzhou, 1 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Fuzhou Vice  Mayor Sun Haishan disclosed here today that half of Fuzhou's  state-owned industrial and communications enterprises have had  injections of foreign capital.    It is learned that one of the four major forms of reforming  the property rights system for state-owned enterprises in Fuzhou  city is to graft foreign capital onto them. In 1993, a  breakthrough was made in transferring enterprises. The Fuzhou  Perfumery and the Fuzhou Printing and Dyeing Mill were  completely transferred to foreign businessmen, and a large  number of large and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Fuzhou  Special Steels Plant, the No. 1 Plastics Plant, and the Fuzhou  Silk Factory, formed joined ventures with foreign capital. In  1993, 28 enterprises signed 31 joint venture or cooperation  projects with foreign businessmen, with a contractual investment  volume of over $82 million and the use of over $25 million in  foreign capital. The number of state-owned enterprises in  Fuzhou City that have had foreign capital grafted onto them now  accounts for 52 percent of the total.    After the grafting, most state-owned enterprises have  changed  their operational mechanisms and have notably improved their  economic returns. According to a briefing from official  quarters, a large state-owned light industrial enterprise in  Fuzhou suffered losses as soon as it went into production. It  lost a total of 170 million yuan in 10 years. After having  foreign capital grafted onto it, it made a profit of over 1  million yuan in 1993.    Official quarters added: The transfer and grafting of  state-owned enterprises have also brought many social problems,  such as the placement and medical insurance of staff from former  state-run factories.    Sun Haishan said: In the future, Fuzhou will go on promoting  the grafting of state-owned enterprises to foreign capital to  boost the reform of state-owned enterprises. What is slightly  different from past practice is that the city will also select  some state- owned enterprises which have good returns and a good  market share to be grafted onto foreign capital. Moreover,  standards for assessing foreign capital will also be raised.  The focus of foreign capital to be introduced will be shifted  to large companies in Europe, America, and Asia, and the grade  of foreign capital utilized will also be raised.</p>

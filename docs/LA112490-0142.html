			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENIOR CITIZEN APARTMENT COMPLEX APPROVED BY PLACENTIA CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> The City Council has approved the development of a 122-unit senior citizen  apartment complex that had been delayed for months after neighbors objected to  increased traffic and noise from the project.  </P> <P> The complex, to be located on a 2.7-acre site on the north side of Carlson Lane  and the east side of Bradford Avenue, was approved unanimously this week after  the developers, Huntington Properties of Huntington Beach, agreed to construct  an eight-foot fence around much of the site to reduce noise and ensure privacy.  </P> <P> They also agreed to make sure trash bins are not placed in back of someone's  home.  </P> <P> The City Council amended its development standards for the project to allow  fewer parking spaces and less open space than what has been required. Some  council members said that it fulfills a demand for more senior citizen housing  in the community.  </P> <P> "There's certainly a need for this in this community," said Councilman John O.  Tynes.  </P></p>

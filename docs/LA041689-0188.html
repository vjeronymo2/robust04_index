			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> AFTER THE RAIN, STEWART MOVES AHEAD BY THREE STROKES  </P> <P> Payne Stewart pulled into a three-stroke lead Saturday before darkness halted  play in the rain-delayed, incomplete third round of the $800,000 Heritage golf  tournament at Hilton Head Island, S.C.  </P> <P> Stewart, who shared the first- and second-round leads with Kenny Perry, moved  in front when Perry missed the green and bogeyed the ninth hole. When Stewart  made a birdie and Perry had a bogey on the 11th and final hole they completed,  the lead went to three shots.  </P> <P> "There's too far to go to be thinking about winning," said Stewart, who was 13  under par. "I'm just glad to be leading."  </P> <P> Stewart and Perry, along with 16 others, marked their positions on the course  and will return this morning to complete the third round. The final round is  scheduled for this afternoon.  </P> <P> Play was delayed 3 1/2 hours by heavy rains that flooded portions of the course  and backed up the final starting time to 5:36 p.m.  </P> <P> Mark McCumber was third, nine under par, through 11 holes, with Bernhard Langer  of West Germany at seven under par through 14 holes. Tom Kite and Kenny Knox  were five under par through 14 holes.  </P> <P> Tom Byrum had a 68 and was the leader in the clubhouse at four-under-par 209.  Chip Beck and David Ogrin, each with a 68, were at 210.  </P> <P> Gary Player of South Africa shot a par 72 and took a one-stroke lead over Gene  Littler, Don Bies and Bob Erickson in the third round of the $600,000 Tradition  tournament at Scottsdale, Ariz.  </P> <P> Player, 53, seeking his 13th career Senior PGA Tour title and first since  winning five times last year, has an eight-under-par total of 208. He is the  tour's No. 2 all-time money-winner with $2.92 million.  </P> <P> Littler started the day tied for the lead with Player but shot a 73.  </P> <P> Bies' 68 included seven birdies.  </P> <P> Erickson shot a 70.  </P></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Death of healthcare Sir, Although dated October 19, Mr Tim Hames's article, 'US healthcare: the issue that won't die', has the curious appearance of an ancient relic when measured politically. While addressing the matter of 'Who killed healthcare?', he claims that the irony is that the White House has won on healthcare. In fact, the irony is that President Bill Clinton's ratings have risen only since he has engaged himself in the foreign policy of the US, and he and his peppery spouse along with the Congress have dropped out of the war on American healthcare. And all this time I had been believing rumours that healthcare change died as a result of a plot by foreign agents provocateurs; where will the Canadians get treatment if US healthcare goes down the socialised road to medical oblivion?

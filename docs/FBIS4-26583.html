			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Lu Mu (7627 3668) from "Views on </F> Economic Life" column: "How To View the General Situation of  State Enterprises?"]    [Text] Properly improving state enterprises is the focus of  our economic work. How to view the general situation of state  enterprises has become a universal concern of the people.  <H5>  Powerful Strength of State Enterprises Remains </H5>   Our country's state enterprises have developed steadily  since  reform and opening up began. The 1985 general survey on  industry throughout the country showed that the total number of  large and medium industrial enterprises was 8,285. In 1990,  that is, five years later, the number had increased to 13,469.  In 1992, the number again rose to 13,719.    State enterprises, in particular large and medium-sized  ones,  are the mainstay of socialist modernization and the main source  of state financial revenue. In the first year of the 1990's,  the number of large and medium-sized enterprises accounted for  only 3.2 percent of the total number of industrial enterprises  which kept separate accounts, but the original value of their  fixed assets accounted for 67.6 percent of the total; their net  output value, 58.4 percent of the total; their income from  product sales, 56.4 percent of the total; and their volume of  taxes and profits, 68.2 percent of the total.    By 1992, among industrial enterprises at and above the  township level, the output value of state enterprises accounted  for 59 percent of the total; their profits and taxes obtained,  69.43 percent of the total; and their taxes and profits handed  over to the state, 76.8 percent of the total. According to  statistics from the departments concerned, since 1978, China's  gross domestic output value has grown at an average annual rate  of 9 percent, while the average annual growth rate of state  enterprises was 8 percent. This shows that the powerful  strength of state enterprises continues.  <H5>  Difficulties in the Course of Advance </H5>   There is no denying the fact that in the early stage of the  transition from a highly concentrated unitary planned economic  structure to a socialist market economy, some trades and  enterprises of our country's state industry of our country have  actually encountered various kinds of difficulties in their  production and operation. For example, the situation of the  entire coal industry's long-standing losses has not  fundamentally changed, and the textile industry also suffered  losses as a whole last year. In 1993, 31.8 percent of state  industrial enterprises included in the state budget suffered  losses. Also, the burden on state enterprises is excessive and  they lack the strength for further development. In 1992,  profits and taxes handed over to the state by state enterprises  accounted for 88 percent of those obtained, which was 20  percentage points over those provided by collective enterprises  and about 100 percent over those from enterprises in other  economic sectors. They depend on bank loans for a large amount  of their working funds and this again increases their burdens  because of interest payments. Moreover, the internal management  of some state enterprises has tended to become poorer, causing a  decline in economic results.    However, all these problems are mainly caused by the  irrational structure of industries, products, and enterprise  organizations; slow technological progress; problems with  prices, which are not yet completely solved; and, in particular,  the operational structure, which is not yet really changed.  They are problems in the course of the advance and can  certainly be solved through deepening reform. The problem of the  excessive burden of state enterprises, for example, has been or  is being solved following the coordinated reforms carried out in  finance, banking, and so on. The Baoshan Iron and Steel  Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Yangzi Ethylene  Plant, and a large number of other large and medium-sized  enterprises have adopted the method of separating the "main body  from the supplementary bodies" and of "setting separate  accounts" to gradually relieve themselves of the heavy burden of  "enterprises running society" on their shoulders.    Poor management in production and operations, low economic  results, and other problems not only exist in state enterprises,  but also exist in township and town enterprises, Sino-foreign  joint ventures, and enterprises owned by individuals. These  problems have accumulated over a long period of time and cannot  be solved at one go. To solve these problems, we must make  concerted efforts, energetically carry out exploration, and  persist in deepening the reform of the economic structure and  the enterprise system.  <H5>  The Road of Enterprise Reform Becomes Broader and Broader </H5>   Authoritative personalities in economic circles were correct  when they said the socialist market economy structure was a new  type of economic structure which integrates with the basic  socialist system. The position and role of the state economy  cannot be replaced by other economic sectors. In carrying out  reform of the economic structure in our country, we should  always regard public ownership as the main body and promote the  common development of various economic sectors. We should never  take the road of privatization in reforming state enterprises  today or in the future.    Some old leaders and old specialists who have been engaged  in  industrial economic work for a long time, universally hold that  since the 1980's, the whole country has all along been making  efforts to improve state enterprises and the road of enterprise  reform has become broader and broader. Although the road taken  has been rough and bumpy, we have achieved fruitful results,  such as the promulgation and implementation of the "Enterprise  Law," the relevant "regulations," and so on. This is clear to  all. Enterprise reform in our country started with the  delegation of greater power to enterprises and was followed by  changing the operational mechanism of enterprises. The Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, in  particular, made clear the goal and means of establishing a  modern enterprise system. We have finally found, through  explorations, a broad road for state enterprises to move toward  the market and to become prosperous and flourishing.    Our country's state enterprises were brilliant in the past,  remain brilliant today, and will certainly be even more  brilliant in the future.</p>

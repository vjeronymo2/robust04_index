			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (24): Innovation under scrutiny - R &amp; D, from technology push to market pull AS the shock waves of fiercer competition and accelerating structural change flow through world computer markets, debate is intensifying on both sides of the Atlantic about the policy measures needed to stimulate faster innovation in information technology industries. The debate is broad because the nature of innovation and the ingredients which contribute to it are hard to pin down precisely. Most studies identify a wide range of contributing factors, including the macro-economic environment, industry structure, education and training, management culture and capital markets. Most of these elements, however, respond to policy changes only over the longer term. Hence the search for faster-acting remedies has frequently focused on deepening the technology base by stepping up investment in research and development and encouraging research collaboration between companies and universities. Since the early 1980s, subsidised joint research programmes such as Esprit have constituted the main thrust of European Community efforts to enhance the competitiveness of its electronics industry. In the US, there has been a growth of industry consortia such as Sematech, the MCC and the SRC. The trend has been inspired partly by the mounting costs of staying at the forefront of electronic technologies and partly by the widespread belief that government-orchestrated collaboration has played a decisive role in the rise of Japan's electronics industry. So far, industry performance has not perceptibly improved. Many larger US computer makers, including IBM, are suffering a severe profit squeeze, while in Europe the industry is fighting for survival as heavy losses at companies including Philips, Nixdorf and Bull have prompted drastic retrenchment and restructuring. Why has the industry failed to respond? One explanation was given in a recent paper by Dr Brian Oakley, former head of the Alvey programme, a five-year electronics industry research project launched by the UK government in the mid-1980s. He says that though Alvey achieved its technical goals, few of the participating companies turned the resulting research into successful products. That suggests that the weak link in the innovation chain is not a shortage of good technology but companies' failure to exploit it commercially. A broadly similar conclusion is supported by a number of recent studies of government-sponsored industry collaboration in Japan. These suggest that government schemes played only a minor role, and that the Japanese industry's strength owes much more to the stimulus of fierce competition on its home market and to the structure and organisation of individual companies. In successful Japanese electronics manufacturers, research and development are much more tightly integrated with production and marketing than in western industry. A team approach ensures the rapid feedback of information between all concerned - including suppliers and sub-contractors - at every stage of the process. Unlike western companies, which have traditionally viewed innovation as a sequence of separate leaps forward, in Japan it is a continuous process achieved by simultaneous incremental advances across a broad front. Typically, Japanese manufacturers have many more, smaller development projects under way at once than do their western counterparts. The benefits of the Japanese system include shorter product development cycles and greater flexibility in responding rapidly to market changes. Furthermore, by spreading their development effort across so many different projects, Japanese companies are less vulnerable to the consequences of individual product failures. Stung by Japanese competition, many western technology companies are seeking to speed up innovation by attacking barriers between research, product development and manufacturing. IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Philips and Daimler-Benz have all recently taken steps to strip away layers of bureaucracy which slow down their response time. However, turning technology into manufactured products efficiently is only one aspect of the challenge facing the computer industry. Indeed, as even Japanese suppliers are discovering, it is no more than a necessary condition for staying in the race. As technology becomes ever more mobile, component prices continue to fall and product lives grow shorter, many types of computer hardware are becoming low-margin commodities. That trend - which is being accelerated by the spread of open systems standards - is compelling manufacturers to seek more of their value-added downstream by competing on functions, services and software. As this process gathers momentum, the driving force behind the computer industry's development is shifting from technology push to market pull. Increasingly, innovation is stimulated by the way in which computer power is applied, rather than by the specifications of the equipment used to deliver it. That has placed more influence in the hands of users, particularly larger ones, and is obliging suppliers to tailor information systems ever more closely to the organisation and specific requirements of individual customers. A number of western manufacturers, such as IBM and ICL, have responded to that trend by directing more of their marketing effort into alliances with partners which possess intimate knowledge of specific industry sectors. Japanese computer companies are starting to realise that they can no longer rely simply on technical and manufacturing excellence to sustain their growth. Fujitsu's recent acquisition of ICL was heavily influenced by the Japanese company's desire to improve its access to European markets and to benefit from the British company's expertise in systems integration. Over the longer term, this is likely to mean that computer manufacturers' competitive performance will depend critically on the sophistication and quality of demand in their main markets. Furthermore, as information technology becomes more pervasive and deeply-embedded, the economic benefits it confers will be found increasingly in its application, rather than its production. However, the heavy preoccupation among western policy makers with technology as the main competitive battlefield suggests that they have still to absorb the full implications of these trends. If their efforts to strengthen the performance of the computer industry are to bear fruit, they will almost certainly need to widen their focus beyond the supply side and place more weight on measures to stimulate vigorous demand.</p>

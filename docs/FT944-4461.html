			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / People: Pillars of property boom reunite Nicholas Sheehan, who is joining the board of Pillar Property, is no stranger to Raymond Mould and Patrick Vaughan, chairman and chief executive. As a director of London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, Sheehan rode the 1980s property boom alongside Mould and Vaughan, who ran Arlington Securities before its acquisition by British Aerospace in 1990. LET was floated in 1983 with a market capitalisation of Pounds 24m and was acquired near the peak of the market, for Pounds 490m, by Swedish insurance group SPP. When SPP stepped in, Sheehan took over as chief executive and stayed through the depths of recession - including LET's Pounds 448m loss in 1992 - before resigning in March this year. 'We used to look over the fence to see what they were up to at Arlington,' says Sheehan. 'The corporate styles of the two companies were always similar  -a small team with lots of ambition. I am looking forward to getting back into that environment.' While Sheehan's role at Pillar has not been closely defined, he will be seen as a replacement for Robert Maxted, who resigned as property director in October having been with the company since its formation in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Yongquan (7895 3057 </F> 3123) and XINHUA reporters Yuan Yanghe (5913 7402 0735) and Zhou  Zhenfeng (0719 2182 0023): "A New Song of Yitao"]    [Excerpts] Nanjing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- XINHUA editor's  note: Yitao Township, Jiangsu's "number one poor township," has  greatly improved its situation in two years. The peasants there  have written a "New Song of Yitao" and sing it everywhere. "New  Song of Yitao," praising the blood-and-flesh ties between our  party and the people, is both thought-provoking and inspiring.    The rural primary party organizations are the party's  important foundation for accomplishing its rural work. The  great changes of Yitao Township have shown to people that the  party's rural principles and policies are in line with the  people's aspirations. So long as there is a leader who is  ideologically correct, displays a good work style, and has the  courage to pioneer, the enthusiasm of the masses will be  aroused, their strength will be pooled, and a poor village can  quickly improve its situation. (end of editor's note) [passage  omitted]    Yitao is an old revolutionary base area on the lower reaches  of the Yishu He and it is named after Zhu Yitao who was a native  here and a revolutionary martyr. After liberation, the cadres  and people here made great efforts to develop production and  Yitao was once very famous in the Chang Jiang and Huai He  region. However, some cadres here changed their work style  several years ago. They indulged in eating and drinking  extravagantly and squandering pbulic funds. They also wantonly  collected fees and fines and wantonly apportioned expenses and  work among the people. There was a strong resentment among the  people. During a visit here two years ago, the reporters heard  the villagers sing a song: "Yitao peasants oppose 'three wanton  practices'" [passage omitted]    The lyrics of the song was written by Sun Zhonghua, a  villager of Wandui Village of Yitao Township. [passage omitted]    The reporters visited all villages in the township and saw  that many villagers were living in shabby thatched huts and some  of them did not even have food in their home. So, the reporters  truthfully reported to the departments concerned Yitao's serious  problem, the peasants' plight, and their song.    After General Secretary Jiang Zemin heard about the song, he  issued an important instruction on improving the situation of  Yitao. The Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee was determined to  solve problem for the "number one poor township." [passage  omitted]    In 1992 spring, the Shuyang County CPC Committee appointed  Chen Xueping, a young cadre, to serve as the secretary of the  Yitao Township Party Committee. Chen Xueping is a  "trouble-shooter." [passage omitted]    The township party committee deems it an important task to  reduce the peasants' burden. In 1993, the peasants' burden was  reduced by 710,000 yuan. [passage omitted]    The party committee also helped raise funds, successfully  built 10 electric pumping stations and 500 auxiliary projects,  and turned 35,000 mu of dry land into rice paddies which ensure  stable yields despite droughts or excessive rains. [passage  omitted]    In 1993, Yitao Township, with industrial and agricultural  output value exceeding 120 million yuan, became the first  township of the "100-million-yuan category" in the county.

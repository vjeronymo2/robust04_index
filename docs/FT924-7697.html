			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / The Long View: Dukes and duchesses THREE YEARS ago the British government was buying back its own gilt-edged securities. Next year it will be selling Pounds 1bn worth every week, to cover a public sector borrowing requirement which is pencilled in for Pounds 44bn, but which, if the public sector trade unions have anything to do with it, will turn out to be quite a bit more. In fact the PSBR for 1993-94 is officially heading for 7 per cent of GDP, or perhaps 8 1/2 per cent if you exclude privatisation receipts, which is how they did the sums in the 1970s, the last time that public borrowing got this high. The crucial question over the next year or two, for the equity market as well as for gilt-edged, will be the long-term interest rate at which this public borrowing spree can be financed. In the much more inflationary 1970s the interest rate sometimes reached 15 or 16 per cent as the government resorted to bizarre 'Grand Old Duke of York' tactics, marching interest rates up and down the hill in order to lure institutional investors into gilts with the offer of periodic quick profits. You might think that the gilt-edged market would be in disarray today as investors, already demoralised by the exit from the exchange rate mechanism, stared up at the mountain of debt. A few weeks ago several leading gilt-edged brokers were gloomily forecasting a rise in long gilt yields from 9 to 10 per cent. Not a bit of it. Gilt yields have been tumbling at all dates, long and short, and the only disarray this week was to be found in the back offices of the gilt-edged market makers which could not cope with the rush of thousands of small orders from private investors. There are some ironical comparisons with the French bond market. The French, remember, won the battle of the franc and have stayed within the ERM. Their anti-inflationary credentials are much more convincing than those of the fickle British. Yet on some days this week French government ten-year bonds were yielding more than the corresponding British gilts. True, there are now fears that the ERM currencies are overpriced, making their bonds look risky to international investors. However, the fundamental reason is that the fall in short-term interest rates in the UK is generating a structural shake-up in the financial markets, and is causing some international anomalies to appear. At 7 per cent, bank base rates in the UK are at their lowest for 20 years, except for a three-month spell in 1977. For most of the past decade they have ranged between 10 and 15 per cent. In recent years they have been above the yield on long-term gilts, often substantially so. Consequently there has been a huge build-up of savings balances in building societies and banks, where the personal sector has some Pounds 260bn of interest-bearing deposits, up Pounds 85bn during the past five years. We have come to think of this pattern of savings as normal, but historically it is definitely not; traditionally, investors had to turn to gilts and other securities (both fixed interest bonds and equities) in order to obtain a decent yield. The shift can also be seen in terms of the collapse of the housing market. Throughout the 1980s there was a vast demand for mortgages - up to Pounds 40bn a year - at comparatively high interest rates and the lending institutions could bid up deposit rates in order to satisfy this demand, which was insensitive to the cost of money. Now, not only is loan demand weak but the lenders are forced to widen the spread between their deposit and mortgage rates in order to pay for their bad debts. Shocked savers will find, after the latest cuts, that accounts which a year ago returned 8 per cent after tax will be yielding little more than 4 per cent. If you are trying to live off the income that is grim news indeed. For several years the banking industry will be licking its wounds and trying to preserve its capital base. It will be in no position to finance recovery. This is why the government, against its political prejudices, is being forced to step into the gap, buying houses, digging tunnels in various directions and running a very large deficit. There is some comfort in that the government's debt starts from a very low level in balance-sheet terms: since the mid-1970s the outstanding net public sector debt has dropped from nearly 60 per cent of GDP to about 30 per cent. Accordingly there is plenty of room for not only private savers but also investment institutions to take on board large quantities of gilts. However, this presupposes some shrinkage of the banking system and a generally poor outlook for important areas of the economy such as housing and construction. Once recovery starts the government must be ready to step back quite quickly or there will be a crunch in the capital markets. In any case, the forecast levels of borrowing cannot be permitted to drag on for years, Italian-style. Debt is deferred tax, and when the PSBR rises towards 8 per cent of GDP the burden on the taxpayer will mount rapidly; the 1990s will not be like the 1970s, when inflation wiped out the debt almost as fast as it was issued. So far, however, the rake has only just started to make his progress. When interest rates are falling rapidly the securities markets are bound to be gripped by strongly bullish forces. But at some stage next year the sustainability of the state borrowing spree will come under serious question. A heavy balance of payments deficit, perhaps the single most frightening statistic in the Treasury's forecast, will also leave the government highly vulnerable to sharp shifts of sentiment in the financial markets. The government may come to seem extravagant and in need of a new financial adviser: a Duchess of York situation, perhaps.</p>

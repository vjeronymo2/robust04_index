			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Egypt and Israel will resume talks on the disputed Taba border area today and  have agreed to try to resolve all pending issues by early next month to  expedite an Israeli withdrawal. A statement issued in Cairo by Egypt, Israel  and the United States said two committees will meet to discuss the issues  holding up an accord: Egyptian compensation for an Israeli-built luxury hotel  and beach cabana complex, access for Israelis to Taba and location of the  border line in the area where tourist facilities are. Washington is a partner  in negotiations over the 250-acre patch of beach overlooking the Gulf of Aqaba,  which was awarded to Egypt by arbitrators last September.  </P></p>

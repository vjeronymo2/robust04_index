			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Upturn has some downside for societies The upturn in building societies' mortgage lending is more of a mixed blessing than it might appear. First, the good news. Net new commitments in February totalled Pounds 2.93bn, compared with Pounds 1.83bn the previous month and Pounds 2.72bn in February last year. The figure was the highest monthly total since July. But the bad news for them is the difficulty in funding the increase in lending if they are unable to attract enough retail savings. Last month gross mortgage lending increased to Pounds 2.24bn compared with Pounds 2.06bn in January and was 17 per cent more than the corresponding month last year. Mortgage applications traditionally pick up at this time of year as the peak spring buying season approaches. Nonetheless the figures confirm the recent upsurge in demand reported by housebuilders and estate agents. House sales, according to Inland Revenue conveyancing records, rose by more than a third in January compared with January last year. Prices have also started to rise again. According to Halifax, the UK's largest building society, the average price of a home rose by 3.8 per cent to Pounds 62,498 during the 12 months to the end of January. The society forecasts that prices on average will rise by 5 per cent this year while the number of sales could rise by up to 15 per cent. According to seasonally adjusted figures published by the Bank of England, there is further good news for societies, in that they seem to be regaining some of the market share they lost to banks last year. Building societies' difficulties in attracting retail savings increases the pressure on the government to move quickly in relaxing the amount of funds that societies can raise on the wholesale markets, where funding is cheaper at the moment. A rise in the statutory limit from 40 per cent of funds to 50 per cent is in prospect, but a change in the law is dependent on the passage of the de-regulation bill, which is still some months away. In the meantime, Mr John Wriglesworth, analyst at UBS, says that in order to allow societies to compete, the Building Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, should raise the regulatory limit on wholesale funding which it sets for each society within the overall 40 per cent ceiling. 'The commission would be well advised to relax individual ratios ahead of the impending general relaxation arising from the legislation on de-regulation,' he says.</p>

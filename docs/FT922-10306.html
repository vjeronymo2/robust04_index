			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / MPs query Skillcentre disposals DEPARTMENT of Employment officials had warned ministers that the sale of four Skillcentres to an organisation which subsequently went into liquidation would be risky, according to a report published yesterday by the Commons Public Accounts Committee. The committee said the ministers had decided to go ahead 'in the light of their objectives for the privatisation'. The committee investigated the department's management of the sell-off of 60 Skillcentres. In May 1990 it completed the sale of 51 Skillcentres on terms which required them to pay the purchasers Pounds 13.6m. Sales to three organisations were controversial, particularly the sale of four centres to TICC, a private company, for Pounds 2.1m. Employees made redundant were told that their employer could not finance their redundancy provisions. The MPs said Deloitte Corporate Finance had made careful enquiries for the department before the sale to TICC. Officials had warned ministers that the sale would be the most risky because the company 'had no track record'.</p>

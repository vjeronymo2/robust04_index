He also emphasized his concern "about the  misery that is the result of the lack of jobs." He made these  remarks in a speech he delivered at the closing session of a  meeting of OAS specialists who addressed measures of confidence  and security.    Menem also praised Brazilian Joao Banea Soares, the outgoing  OAS secretary general, who in his speech emphasized the devotion  to peace of the region's countries, highlighting the example of  Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, which signed agreements  establishing nuclear controls and banning chemical weapons.    In referring to Baena Soares' speech, Menem said: "Those  agreements should serve as guidance for future steps we can take  regarding our relations."    The president previously emphasized that in regional  integration efforts, diplomacy plays a major role, adding that  there is "cooperative diplomacy," along with "preventive"  diplomacy "to prevent confrontations that can be irreversible  and irreparable."    Menem also admitted that in the continent "there are some  minor conflicts, but which are conflicts nonetheless," noting  that "we should tackle them in order to solve them." As an  example to be followed, he mentioned the recommendations of the  OAS meeting's final document, which covers matters referring to  cultural, educational, and military affairs.  <H5>  Recommendations </H5>   The conclusions of the specialists' deliberations were  considered "modest" but predictable within the path toward  designing a new security system for the region, sources  consulted by CLARIN said.    The six-point document states in point three that it is  necessary "to recommend that member countries regularly  communicate to the appropriate OAS offices about the  implementation of measures to promote confidence."    Specialists have said that this point, especially the  periodical nature of such communications, is the beginning of a  system of consultations. This is one of the most significant  matters approved on 18 March.    Likewise, the OAS Special Hemispheric Security Commission  (presided over by Argentine Ambassador Hernan Patino Mayer) was  urged to continue with the examination of measures for  strengthening confidence, "and among others, the measure  regarding the peaceful settlement of controversies and the  prevention of conflicts."    This is different from an Argentine proposal to create a  permanent center for the prevention of conflicts. It was not  possible to establish a mechanism for regular defense ministers  meetings either. However, a new meeting was set for 1995 in  Chile.</p>

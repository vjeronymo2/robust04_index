Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a  revolutionary policy of economic construction that reflects our  party's intent to enhance the superiority of socialism of our  own style by effecting a new upsurge in economic construction  and to consolidate the national economic power by further  strengthening our economic independence and self-reliance.    The implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy is the  most important demand in realizing our party's economic strategy.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: This year is  meaningful because it is when the 30th anniversary of the  presentation of the socialist rural theses is marked. We should  make a new turning point in developing our rural economy by  vigorously carrying out the struggle to accomplish the historic  tasks of the rural theses.    The year 1994 is a meaningful one in which the 30th  anniversary of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's  presentation of the socialist rural theses is marked.    Our people have stoutly carried out the struggle to  implement  the socialist rural theses under the wise leadership of the  party and the leader. By vigorously advancing along the road  presented in the rural theses, our people have been able to  correctly solve the socialist rural problems without a slightest  deviation and an improvement close to a complete realization  [wanjonhan silhyone kajang kakkaun kaesone chopkun] of the rural  theses is drawing near today.    Thus, the rural areas of our country have turned into  socialist, cultural rural areas with good living and working  conditions, and increasing agricultural production has made it  possible to solve the people's food problems more smoothly.    With this great result we have already achieved, we should  vigorously carry out the struggle to accomplish the historic  tasks of the rural theses this year, when the 30th anniversary  of its presentation is marked, and completely implement our  party's revolutionary economic strategy.    Complete implementation of the agriculture-is-first policy  is  considered to be an important demand in realizing our party's  revolutionary economic strategy because it enables us to greatly  enhance the superiority of socialism of our own style by  improving our people's living conditions.    Food problems are the most imminent in the people's material  life, and how to solve the problems is one of the important  questions that influence the result of socialist, communist  construction.    With our party's people-oriented policy to smoothly solve  the  people's food problems, our country supplies sufficient food to  our people, who enjoy happy lives without food problems [mogul  kokchongul morugo].    The people, however, demand more and more abundant living as  their living conditions improve. When we do farming well by  implementing the party's agriculture-is-first policy, we can  meet the people's ever-increasing demand and can ultimately  guarantee the people's happy lives in accordance with the  socialist demand.    In particular, the thorough implementation of the  agriculture-is-first policy is an important demand in fully  displaying the superiority of socialism of our own style. The  true superiority of socialism can be displayed in various fields  of social life, but it can be shown practically in the people's  happy, abundant, and material lives.    Without properly solving the people's food problems, we can  neither talk about the true superiority of the socialist system  nor firmly keep it against the enemies's various offensives and  denouncements. To highly display the superiority of the  socialist system of our own style, we must therefore achieve a  century-old desire of our people who want to eat rice and meat  soup, wear silk clothes, and live in tile-roofed homes.    When we thoroughly implement the agriculture-is-first  policy,  we can have the people eat plenty of rice and meat soup as well  as lead them to constantly raise their standard of living. As a  result, we can highly display the superiority of the socialist  system.    The thorough implementation of the agriculture-is-first  policy is regarded as an important demand in carrying out our  party's revolutionary economic strategy. This is because we can  strongly solidify the country's economic might by strengthening  the chuche character and self-reliance of the economy.    As are cases in all other sectors, we cannot achieve the  self- reliant economy when we depend on other countries  regarding food problems.    Food problems are very important and essential to the  people's material lives. In the people's material lives,  starvation is the most difficult to put up with. Therefore,  solving the food problems of the people is very important in  strengthening the self-reliant economy.    Also, agriculture provides various raw materials to the  light  industry to strengthen its self-reliance and to satisfy the  demands of workers for various industrial products. When people  have many things to eat, including rice and meat, their  consciousness can become much better and everything will be  fine. As a result, they can vigorously accelerate the socialist  economic construction.    To thoroughly implement our party's agriculture-is-first  policy, we must successfully promote electricity and irrigation  in rural communities and adequately introduce machines and  chemicals. Also, we must further develop all sectors of  agriculture, including grain production, by thoroughly  implementing the chuche farming method.    Our working class must produce more modern agricultural  machines, including tractors and automobiles, and various  farming chemicals, such as chemical fertilizers and agricultural  chemicals, and supply them to rural communities.    Farmers of cooperative farms and agricultural working people  throughout the country must assiduously carry out all  agricultural works in a position of being befitting to masters  responsible for the nation's rice granaries. As a result, they  must surely reach this year's grain production goal put forward  by the party.</p>

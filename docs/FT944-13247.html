			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Filter system for diesel emissions Renault, Europe's second largest diesel engine manufacturer, is developing a filtering system to cut emissions from diesel engines in conjunction with Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company. The programme will build on work by Rhone-Poulenc, which has developed a catalyst derived from cerium. When this is added to the fuel, it lowers the combustion temperature of carbon particles to about 200'C, allowing the particles to be burned off. Diesel engine emissions of nitrogen dioxide and carbon particles are highly pollutive. Rhone-Poulenc: France, tel 4768 1234; fax 4768 1911.</p>

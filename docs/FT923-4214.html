			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Lamont's cold Bath The UK chancellor may be crowing about the 'promise' he extracted from the Germans over the weekend, but on reflection yesterday the gilt and equity markets were rather less impressed. In part second thoughts recognised that the German statement was little more than an offer not to increase interest rates unless it was necessary, but sterling's weakness hardly helped. The Treasury must feel that the pound hovering just below DM 2.80 is scant reward for last week's Ecu 10bn-worth of ingenuity. In truth, all eyes are fixed on the dollar and the French referendum; until that is out of the way, there is little the chancellor can say to influence events. However hard the government struggles to persuade investors that it is committed to the current parities, the markets still look towards the pressure on the ERM which would follow a No vote. Assuming the French say Yes, there is probably room for the gilts market to go higher. Gilts now yield some 150 basis points more than German bunds, and while that is less than the 200 basis points reached in the darkest days of August, it still reflects a healthy risk premium. The market has also had some Pounds 7.5bn of supply removed from this year's funding requirement, and real yields remain at very high levels. If that is not yet enough to encourage investors to brave the risks of a No vote, it is at least a reasonably solid underpinning for the market.</p>

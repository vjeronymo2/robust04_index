			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A REWARDING WAIT FOR 'GODOT' AT OLD GLOBE  </P> <P> Let us not waste our time in idle discourse, says Vladimir in Beckett's  "Waiting for Godot."  </P> <P> The joke's on him, of course, for he and his partner Estragon can do little  else except "waste their time in idle discourse" as they wait for Godot.  </P> <P> The first challenge in any production of "Godot" is to seduce the members of  the audience into believing that they are not wasting their time by listening  to the idle discourse of these two lonely tramps on their Godot-forsaken  country road.  </P> <P> Andrew J. Traister's staging at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage  succeeds at this magnificently for most of its two hours-plus. No one could  accuse this "Godot" of being arid or airless. This is an audience show.  </P> <P> And it's not just for audiences who appreciate irony. For example, while the  irony of the "idle discourse" line drew a hefty laugh on opening night, the  absolute stillness of the audience during the "long silences" that follow a  second-act exchange about the voices of the dead was an even stronger piece of  evidence that this "Godot" was connecting, that the discourse really didn't  seem so idle after all.  </P> <P> Jonathan McMurtry's Vladimir and Richard Easton's Estragon are intensely human.  Despite the hopelessness of their situation, they embrace each other with  infectious warmth. They take genuine pleasure in each other's eccentricities,  even in each other's ability to bicker in return.  </P> <P> Vladimir is the philosopher prince of "Godot," and McMurtry wraps his voice  around Vladimir's attempts to justify his actions and non-actions, as if he has  all the time in the world -- which, in a way, he does. But when Estragon goes  away for the night or even tries to take a nap, impatience suddenly rears its  head within this Vladimir. The corners of his puffy eyes betray his fear.  </P> <P> That fear is much more apparent in Easton's Estragon, as is every other  emotion. This is a hungry and tired man, with an appropriately lean look, but  he's also one whose eyes light up at any sign of change, no matter how  pathetic.  </P> <P> The two tramps' primary visitors are the slave driver Pozzo and his slave  Lucky, and Jeffrey Allan Chandler and Richard Kneeland are sensationally  theatrical in these wonderfully showy roles.  </P> <P> Chandler's Pozzo preens and preaches and throws bones at everyone in his path.  Even when he is blind, in the second act, his railing at his fate retains a  sense of command.  </P> <P> Kneeland's Lucky, by contrast, is a shambles -- florid-faced, trembling, with a  rush of white hair that descends halfway down his back. As he hoists Pozzo's  bags or does his wretched little dance for the benefit of the others, he looks  as if he may have a heart attack at any moment.  </P> <P> Kyle Wares plays the young boy who brings messages from Godot with a fine  deadpan.  </P> <P> Traister's arena staging only occasionally results in blocked sight lines (at  least from the quarter of the audience where I sat), and the compensation is  that every seat in the house is close to the heart of the non-action.  </P> <P> The arena configuration also adds to the impression that Vladimir and Estragon  are literally going in circles, that they will never escape this desolated way  station. When they try to escape, or simply to avoid the more unpleasant  aspects of their encounter with Pozzo and Lucky, the short aisles quickly put a  stop to their efforts.  </P> <P> The design -- by Cliff Faulkner (sets), Shigeru Yaji (costumes) and John B.  Forbes (lights) -- carefully observes Beckett's directions.  </P> <P> But there are a few too many mixed signals indicating where this way station  is. Pozzo pronounces schedule in the British style, and Easton maintains a  slight British accent throughout. Yet it sounded as if Vladimir referred to a  past experience picking grapes in the Napa Country (the text says Macon  Country). The references should either be consistent or else completely  neutral.  </P> <P> The momentum of the second act occasionally flags, but this isn't surprising --  in fact, it's part of the point of the play. As Vladimir says, "habit is a  great deadener." Yet it's indicative of the strength of the play that this line  occurs in a speech that more or less brings the play to a climax, as Vladimir's  resolve begins to crack.  </P> <P> Habit may deaden, but this production makes sure that "Godot" remains alive.  </P> <P>  At the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts, Balboa Park, San Diego,  Tuesdays through Sundays at 8 p.m., Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2 p.m.,  through Aug. 20.

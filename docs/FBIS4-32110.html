			<p>BFN     [Text] The main activity of the Federal Government over the  past week concentrated on the realization of the program of  economic stabilization, the Federal Government stated at a  regular news conference. Sporadic cases of currency dealers'  cuts are of a passing character and the exchange rate of dinar  remains stable, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic assesses. Vladimir  Nikolic reports:    [Begin recording] [Nikolic] From 24 January to 11 June,  prices have increased by a mere 0.8 percent altogether.  However, the structure of increases is not satisfactory because  we have noted a (?great) increase in the prices of agricultural  produce and the prices of services, Kontic said. For this  reason, the Federal Government has pointed to further  possibilities to cut prices, especially some of them. The main  attention focused on the accomplished level of incomes and its  influence on the realization of the program, the strengthening  of the overall economic activity and production, and elimination  of the budget deficit in the second half-year. In connection  with this, at yesterday's session, the Federal Government passed  a decree that regulates the salaries of deputy prime ministers,  federal ministers, and officials, changes to the law on  earnings, compensations, and other incomes of the employees in  the federal ministries, federal offices, federal organizations,  and federal government services, and changes to the decree on  expenses that are being recognized as material expenses for the  federal administration offices.    According to Kontic, salaries have increased greatly,  especially in May. He assessed this as a negative trend,  primarily because of its intensity, which does not match the  increase in production and the trends in the economy. An  accompanying factor is a disproportion between the incomes in  industry and non-industry. However, the federal prime minister  believes that the total income mass in May means that we have  accomplished equilibrium with the available national product. He  said that further increases in salaries could endanger the  strategic goals of the program of the economic stabilization:    [Kontic] Departing from these conclusions, the Federal  Government, with the decrees that I have just read, passed a  decision to reduce all calculation factors at the federal level,  better to say, in the federal administration, by 30 percent and  to additionally reduce the highest salaries in the Federal  Government by an additional 10 to 15 percent. To avoid any  misunderstandings in your reports and interpretations of my  words, I must draw your attention to the fact that the Federal  Government has, even so far, been paying out approximately 30  percent lower salaries in comparison to the established  calculation factors. Therefore, nobody should conclude that the  earnings in the federal administration will be reduced by this  amount.    [Nikolic] The Federal Government is preparing a law that  will, in a unique way, regulate all the issues regarding the  entire state administration. Regarding general economic  activity and the increase in production, they concluded that  positive trends are taking place. Statistically speaking, the  industrial production in May was lower than the month before,  however, according to the federal prime minister, positive  trends have continued in industry. The energy supply, which has  noted an expected drop, has a considerable share in all this.  This primarily refers to electrical energy, whose production is  matched with the requirements. Excluding the energy industry,  the remainder of industry is nevertheless [words indistinct]  than in April, Kontic said.    We expect further cuts in the share with which the public  expenditure participates in the national product, which has  already been brought below 41 percent. Kontic assessed that the  budget deficit will also be eliminated by increasing incomes  from real sources.    [Kontic] Departing from this, we have drawn up and already  agreed a consolidated balance of public expenditure at the level  of the country, which involves a certain amount of deficit  financing of the budget in July only, however even then  exclusively on the basis of foreign currency coverage. The  uncovered balance of the federal budget has been reduced to 100  million dinars altogether, while the republics have practically  managed to eliminate their budget deficits.    [Nikolic] Prime Minister Kontic informed the reporters that  at yesterday's session the Federal Government passed a proposal  on the law banning the construction of nuclear power plants on  FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] territory. With this, the  existing legal provision has been harmonized with the FRY  Constitution. The law envisages a ban on the construction of  nuclear power plants and a ban on the construction of  installations for manufacture of nuclear fuel and processing of  exhausted nuclear fuel on FRY territory.

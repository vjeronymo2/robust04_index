			<p>BFN     [Text] The Serbian army and police continue to raid  Albanian families throughout Kosova. Meanwhile, it is reported  that an Albanian national died from the consequences of torture  in a command post of the Serbian police. Let us follow a  telephone report by Mehmet Haziri:    [Haziri] Recently, the cases in which the Serbian Army has  been launching new adventures by helping the police with the  daily terrorization of the Albanians have become more frequent.  The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance  [LDK] in Han i Elezit reports that the Serbian soldiers  stationed in this locality, in collaboration with the police,  raided six Albanian families in Dine village. It is also  reported that the soldiers stationed in the barracks in Han i  Elezit have been maltreating the Albanian citizens of the nearby  villages for days on end.    The LDK confirms that raids and maltreatments of Albanians  were reported in Mitrovice and Gjilan communes. The bus station  in Mitrovice has long become a place where the Albanians are  tortured for no reason. Thus, in the evening of 20 April, the  police caused serious body wounds to two youths who were found  in this location. Under the pretext of searching for arms,  several families in the villages of Zhegel, Lladove, and  Llashtice in Gjilan were raided and some persons were  maltreated, among whom was the 83-year-old man Shuaip Ajeti.  Mehmet Hajrullahu died in Zhegel village in Gjilan last night  and there are no doubts that he is a victim of police torture.    The LDK Information Commission in Gjilan has reported that  two weeks ago, the deceased was gravely tortured by the police  on the pretext of handing over weapons.</p>

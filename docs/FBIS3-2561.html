In moving  the Legislative Council (Electoral Provisions) (Amendment) Bill  1994, the Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng  Wing-fui, said the proposals on functional constituencies and  the election committee were in line with the Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law.    In Beijing, senior officials and Hong Kong advisers to China  warned the Hong Kong administration not to mislead the public  into believing the three-tier political structure would survive  beyond 1997. A deputy director of the local Xinhua (the New  China News Agency), Qin Wenjun, accused Governor Chris Patten of  spreading rumours that the Chinese Government would not risk  international criticism by dismantling the pre-1997 political  structure.    "It is a total deception and misleads the public. The  political structure formed under the `triple violation  blueprint' can never survive (the sovereignty transfer)," Mr Qin  said.    A vice-director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Offfice, Chen Ziying, said the tabling of the electoral  bill was "no surprise." "Any consequences incurred because of  that will have to be fully borne by the British Government," he  said.    Director of the local XINHUA, Zhou Nan, said Britain's  unilateral move would have no major adverse impact on the  territory's smooth transition. "I've said in the past that they  have damaged (the talks) a long time ago."    Under the bill, corporate voters on the existing functional  constituencies would be replaced by individual voters in the  companies or organisations in each functional group. Together  with the nine new functional constituency seats, the entire  workforce of more than 2.7 million would be given a vote in the  functional constituency polls.    The first part of the electoral bill, containing less  controversial reforms, was passed last month.</p>

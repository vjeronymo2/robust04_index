			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADING DOWN;  </P> <P> GOLDEN TIME ON THE 'GOLDEN MILE'  </P> <P> Olga Marcus, whose marriage to Beverly Hills dentist David Marcus lasted almost  six decades, suddenly found herself, at 80, alone and isolated.  </P> <P> "It was a terrible shock when my husband passed away suddenly, in 1988," she  said. "I'd always been rather slight, but David was like the Rock of Gibraltar.  We both assumed I'd go first."  </P> <P> The Marcuses lived for more than 30 years in a spacious contemporary home  designed by John Lautner on one acre of Brentwood Park.  </P> <P> "We led busy lives and entertained a lot," she said. "My husband's patients  included many celebrities, and many were personal friends. My own involvement  with politics also brought us into a wide circle of interesting people.  </P> <P> "But with David gone, our wonderful house suddenly felt empty. I wanted out.  </P> <P> "Well-meaning friends cautioned me not to think of moving, for at least a year.  And my children pleaded with me to remain in the family home.  </P> <P> "I could have continued there without any financial burden, but the house no  longer fit my needs.  </P> <P> "I had a pool I hadn't used in years, my garden had a half an acre of lawn and  40 large cymbidiums that required special care. You can let dust accumulate in  a home but you can't let a garden go."  </P> <P> Far more appealing to Marcus was the thought of someday having valet parking at  her beck and call and round-the-clock security. She envisioned a convenient  location for friends to drop by, and public transportation that was close  enough, if she decided not to drive.  </P> <P> Four months after her husband passed away, Olga Marcus accepted a $2.5-million  offer for her home and purchased a luxury condominium on Wilshire's Golden Mile  near Westwood. The total cost for the three-bedroom apartment, including major  renovation, came to about $600,000.  </P> <P> "I don't feel as if I traded down. It was more like trading off. When my  priorities changed, I wanted things that would free me to continue an active  lifestyle and provide for any future physical limitations that might develop,"  Marcus said.  </P> <P> "The only disadvantage about living in an apartment is that I can't go outside  and cut flowers. So I now buy a lot of flowers and look for every opportunity  to snip them from my friends' gardens."  </P> <P> Marcus, a co-founder of volunteer organizations, Women For and Teach  Foundation, as well as former key campaigner for presidential candidates,  served 11 years on the Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension Commission. She  still keeps a full schedule.  </P> <P> On Mondays she runs errands; Tuesdays, she attends board meetings as  commissioner of the City Employees Retirement System, and as its newly elected  president; Wednesdays, she joins in discussions sponsored by the Plato Society  at UCLA; Thursdays, she gets her hair done and plays bridge.  </P> <P> "Saturdays I leave open for family and social functions, and Fridays and  Sundays are for playing golf," said Marcus, who recently returned from a  golf-playing tour of New Zealand and Australia.  </P> <P> "It's nice to be able to close the door and go -- whenever I feel like it."  </P> <P> Marcus is aware of other domestic options, though it has never occurred to her  to have someone live with her, though she can visualize eventually living in a  retirement hotel.  </P> <P> "In sickness you want your family around but when you're older, even more than  family, you need companionship among peers with whom you can communicate," she  added.  </P> <P> "I have wonderful children who respond lovingly to my needs and I know I can  always count on them. But I wouldn't want to live with my family. The less you  rely on them the better the relationship.  </P> <P> "Getting old is such a personal thing. I admire people who can cut themselves  off from their community when they retire or become widowed. That takes a great  deal of courage. I moved only a short distance away."  </P> <P> Marcus describes life as a series of cycles. "When you finish one cycle in your  life, you better close it and move on confidently to the next. I take each new  cycle in stride."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 11 (XINHUA) -- President Bill  Clinton said today that U.S. warplanes striking at Serb  positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde acted in "an entirely  appropriate way."    He downplayed Russian objections to the attack, saying he  had  "a good talk" with Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday and  that foreign ministers of both countries would continue  communications today.    In Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters that the U.S. has no right  to bomb Bosnian Serb positions without consulting Russia first.    Clinton said U.S. warplanes acted with U.N. civilian  authorization and that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali backed such a move in an earlier statement.    The U.S. president made these remarks before a meeting of  his  national security advisers at the White House.</p>

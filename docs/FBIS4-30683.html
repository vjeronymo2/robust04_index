			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by a "Japan-U.S. relations reporting team"; seventh </F> and last in series entitled "Japan and the United States -- The  Picture Shakes": "The Swift Current Is Carrying the Economic  Superpower Off its Footing"]    [Text] The book entitled "Global Engagement -- Cooperation  and Global Security in the 21st Century," published by the U.S.  Brookings Institute, is now very popular with U.S. diplomatic  officials. In the chapter on the Asia-Pacific region, the book  says, "During the past few years, Asia witnessed the end of the  Cold War not once, but twice: the end of the antagonism between  the United States and the Soviet Union, and the normalization of  diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union."  <H5>  For the United States, Is Improving its Relations With China </H5> More Important Than Dealing With North Korea's Nuclear Issue?    The two events that marked the end of the Cold War brought  about a breakaway from ideology and a relaxation of  international friction. As a result, countries have begun to  grope for new relations based on "economics." "This trend is  even trying to normalize U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations,  despite the long dispute between the two countries over human  rights and exports of Chinese-made weapons and ammunition," said  a Mr. Harding [name as published], a researcher at the Brookings  Institute.    On May 27, the day after U.S. President Bill Clinton  announced his decision to renew China's most-favored-nation  trade status, while breaking the link between human rights and  trade, a meeting was held in New York by the Asia Society. U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher was invited to the meeting  to give a lecture entitled "The Future of the United States and  the Asia-Pacific." Although he first pointed out "the U.S.  policy toward Asia is confronted with three pressing issues:  the new development of the situation in China, North Korea's  nuclear program, and the improvement of U.S.-Japan economic  relations," he spent most of his time explaining the importance  of strengthening U.S.-Chinese relations. As for Japan, he  merely referred to it in connection with the North Korean issue.    Once the establishment of new international relations based  on "economics" becomes the main trend of the times following the  decline of power politics, this inevitably brings on a change in  the psychological distance that exists between different  countries: a once-distant nation may suddenly emerge as a close  nation, and vice versa. In other words, this is the beginning  of a "new shifting of nations." The remarkable advance being  made by U.S. firms in China and other Asian nations is a good  example.  <H5>  A New World Called China </H5>   General Electric Co., which is said to be the bellwether of  U.S. business management, was the first to go into action. In  the autumn of 1992, General Electric established its Asian  headquarters in Hong Kong to supervise the region covering  China, Southeast Asia, and India in line with the strategy of  Chairman John F. Welch to "draw a demarcation line between Japan  and the rest of Asia." In the case of American Telephone &amp;  Telegraph Co., the chief executive officer in charge of China  was stationed in Beijing, while the CEO in charge of Southeast  Asia was posted in Hong Kong.    If we look at how U.S.-Japan relations and U.S.-China  relations changed in 1991, the year marked by the collapse of  the Soviet Union, and in the following year of 1992, we can  assess the psychological distance between the United States and  China. In 1992, the total hours' duration of telephone calls  made from the United States to China grew by 87.2 percent from a  year earlier, while telephone calls made from the United States  to Japan grew by only 14 percent. Concerning the total amount  of direct investment in China on a contract basis, the United  States moved quickly ahead of Japan in 1992.    The movement to convert government-controlled economies into  market economies has spread throughout the world as another  consequence of the end of the Cold War.    In the early 1980s, Nomura Securities Co. exerted  overwhelming influence on the Chinese market. Well before the  Tiananmen Incident, then-General Secretary Zhao Ziyang of the  Chinese Communist Party had asked Masanori Ito to explain the  Japanese capital market to him. At that time, Ito, who is now a  senior advisor to Nomura Securities, was in charge of carrying  out Nomura's policy toward China. Zhao had also asked American,  British, and German experts to explain how matters stand in  their own countries. Later, Zhao questioned Ito: "Given that  Japan, the United States, Britain, and Germany are all  capitalist nations, why do they have different systems?"    According to Ito, "Chinese people were eager to follow the  example of Japan, as they are also an Asian people."    Japan Is Left Out in the Cold    However, what Ito said is now a thing of the past. The fact  is that China seems to have chosen the United States as its  model. In 1993, Merrill Lynch &amp; Company Inc. helped list  Chinese companies' shares on the New York Stock Exchange. When  its chief executive officer, Daniel P. Tully, went to China in  March 1994 for the opening of its Beijing office, Chinese Prime  Minister Li Peng directly asked him for assistance and advice in  financial business. Meanwhile, a total of 22 Chinese companies  are planning to list their shares on overseas stock exchanges  after this summer. Many of them have already appointed  U.S.-affiliated securities firms as their lead underwriters.    "If we remain idle, the entire world market will be  Americanized," said senior managing director Katsuya Takanashi  of Nomura Securities, with great anxiety. This spring, the  Tokyo Stock Exchange sent delegates to China after it realized  that an overseas listing boom was on among Chinese companies.  However, since China decided to follow the example of the  United States, there were no companies willing to list their  shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.    The number of foreign issues listed on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange, which reached its peak of 127 in 1991, is expected to  decline to 97 by the end of June, as many U.S. companies, such  as General Motors Corp., are delisting one after the other. The  closedness of the Japanese capital market is cited by the U.S.  side as a cause of foreign delistings. However, if Japan  considers the recent move by U.S. companies to be merely a  result of the trade friction between Japan and the United  States, there is a possibility that Japan might be left out of  the worldwide trend toward market economies.    If the United States is really determined to give  consideration to economic interests before fundamental rules,  with its President acting as a "vehicle," Japan, which has  always viewed the world through the United States, will  certainly become bankrupt in policy. To avoid such a situation,  Japan had better begin reviewing its relations with the United  States, based on a simple viewpoint that, after all, the United  States of today is a "nation that changes its relations with  other nations eaasily."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First paragraph NASDA REPORT comment] </F>   [Text] ADEOS System Passed EM Development Test and  Opened to Public: System Development Test and Compatibility  Test With ETS-VI and Ground System Generally Successful.    The Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS) system  engineering model (EM) development test was conducted from May  to August 1993 at Tsukuba Space Center. The system EM was put in  the radio anechoic chamber in the Radio Test Building, where the  bus equipment performance and function and the interfaces with  the mission equipment were verified. The model was also tested  in the electromagnetic environments produced by the satellite  communication equipment. The tests verified that the satellite  operation and the observation data transmission were  satisfactory. Data acquired during the test were evaluated by  the observation sensor development organizations to verify good  interfaces with the satellite. The results of the development  test will be used for establishing the protoflight test  procedures as well as reflected into the protoflight model  design.    A compatibility test between ADEOS, the Engineering Test  Satellite-VI (ETS-VI), and the experiment ground system was  conducted, following the system engineering model development  test. The purpose of the test was to verify the interface  between the above three systems by connecting them on the ground  to obtain data for the experiment base line for NASDA's first  intersatellite communication experiment between ADEOS, ETS-VI,  and the experiment ground system. Good communication was  verified, but some problems were discovered in the interfaces.  These were reflected into the design of ADEOS protoflight model  and the experiment ground system.    A series of environmental tests, including acoustic,  vibration, and shock tests, was conducted on the structural and  thermal model (STM) since April 1993 at the Spacecraft  Integration and Test Building of Tsukuba Space Center. The tests  were completed, and the model was published to the press on  September 17, 1993. STM has undergone thermal vacuum tests since  late November 1993.</p>

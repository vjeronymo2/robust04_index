			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A round of talks was held at the National  Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] today between  the ASBP delegation, led by comrade 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, ASBP  assistant secretary general, and the delegation of the Chinese  Communist Party, led by Comrade Wei Jianxing, member of the  Political Bureau and head of the Chinese Federation of Trade  Unions. [passage omitted]    Comrade al-Ahmar delivered a speech in which he stressed  Syria's adherence to its firm principles to build a new society,  to deal with the current peace process in our region, and to  establish a just and comprehensive peace based on international  legitimacy and its relevant resolutions, particularly  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, which stipulate the need to  return the occupied Arab territories and the usurped rights to  their rightful owners.    Comrade al-Ahmar stressed that Syria wants to make this  process successful by achieving its goals and to seriously  contribute, along with the honest forces in the world, to  efforts to make this march successful. He also explained that  the peace process is stumbling because of Israel's intransigent  position and its refusal to commit itself to withdrawing from  all the Arab territories, which it has occupied since 1967, as  stipulated in UN resolutions.    In his speech, comrade al-Ahmar called on the international  community, foremost of which are its active forces, to exert  efforts to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy  and to force Israel to implement its relevant parts in order to  end its occupation of the Arab territories, to remove hotbeds,  and to achieve security, stability, and peace for everyone. He  pointed out that Syria would continue efforts to achieve a just  and comprehensive peace and would not relinquish an inch of its  occupied territories in the Golan, or any Arab right.    For his part, Comrade Jianxing, head of the Chinese  Communist  Party delegation, spoke about current developments in China and  the successes achieved in recent years under the policy it has  defined for itself. He also stressed his party's desire to  promote relations with the ASBP and between his country and  Syria and urged continued consultations on the most important  current international issues.    He then stressed his country's support for the  implementation  of UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 regarding the Arab-Israeli  conflict in order to achieve a solution to the Middle East  problem based on these resolutions and in a way that achieves  just and comprehensive peace in the region. He also praised  Syria's position, its desire to achieve peace under the  leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, and its status and role  both on the regional and international levels, as well as the  developments and successes he has seen in Syria. He wished  Syria and its people further progress and prosperity.</p>

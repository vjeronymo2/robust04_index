			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Boddington presses Devenish on plans for Redruth brewery BODDINGTON, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, yesterday pressed its Pounds 127.7m bid for JA Devenish with demands for information about the west country brewer's plans for its loss-making Redruth brewery. In a letter to Devenish shareholders, Mr Denis Cassidy, Boddington's chairman, questioned whether the brewery could be sold without an agreement for the supply of beer to Devenish pubs. 'The terms of any such agreement would be critical to the future performance of Devenish and it would be a matter of the greatest concern if future profitability were sacrificed for the sake of short-term gains,' Mr Cassidy said. Boddington would have to consider whether to let its offer lapse if Devenish entered into any supply agreement on unsatisfactory terms. Mr Cassidy also urged shareholders to seek a full explanation from the Devenish management about the ownership of its Newquay Steam beer brand. If Devenish licensed the brand from a British Virgin Islands company, Island Trading, why had it failed to point this out in previous public documents? he demanded. Mr Cassidy asked whether the brand had been registered as a trademark, and called for details of any royalties or other payments for the brand, and expenditure on developing and marketing it. Devenish is expected to make its formal reply to the Boddington bid in a letter to shareholders today.</p>

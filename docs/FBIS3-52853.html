Our  political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that, after the  meeting, Ambassador Rabinovich will hold a series of tete-a-tete  meetings in Washington with the head of the Syrian delegation to  the talks, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf.    In Israel, there are rising expectations for a positive  shift  in the negotiations with Syria following the Clinton-al-Asad  summit. A senior political source, however, told our  correspondent that the prime minister will have to slow down the  pace of negotiations on the Golan Heights because, at this  stage, he will be unable to deal simultaneously with  negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians.</p>

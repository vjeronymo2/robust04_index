			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Book Review: Plea for no muscle-play Die Grenzen der Macht (The Limits Of Power)By Michael Sturmer Siedler Verlag, Berlin, DM37, 255 pages The German,' wrote Theodor Heuss, West Germany's first president, 'appears more complex and inexplicable to himself and to other nations because his history is more complex than that of other countries.' One of the reasons for the complexity of Germany's history is its place on the map. It has become a cliche to affirm that Germany's position in the middle of Europe, at the crossroads of ideas and the intersection of armies, has greatly contributed to the vicissitudes of Germany's national saga during the past four or five centuries. The byways of Germany's past, and the still open questions over the reunited nation's future, form the focal points of Michael Sturmer's book. One of the best-known German historians, with a deep interest in the nexus between economics and politics, Sturmer takes the reader on a magisterial grand tour of the dells and the high ground of his country's history. His title underlines that this is no plea for a resumption of German muscle-play. At the beginning of the 1980s, Sturmer was an adviser to Helmut Kohl in the Bonn chancellery. Some of the misunderstandings and suspicions concerning Germany's foreign policy during the past two years - over its relationship with Moscow, for instance, or its stance on the Gulf War and Yugoslavia - might have been dispelled had a man of Sturmer's formidable analytical and public relations skills remained at Kohl's side. Sturmer contends that German power, stretched beyond its limits under the Third Reich, and then squeezed to nothing by defeat and dismemberment in 1945, will remain highly constrained now that the nation is whole again. Germany is being reminded, Sturmer notes, of its 'historical dilemma' in the centre of the continent. Germany has the size and the influence to shape the future of the 'European system'. But the country itself will be shaped by the balance of forces stemming from the break-up of the Soviet Union, the redefining of the US role in the world, and the relationship with France. And the limits of German power will continue to be defined - just as they were during the years of division - by the degree of trust it earns from its neighbours. Germany's influence is due to its position straddling east and west, as well as to the strength of its economy. But Sturmer knows that, at the heart of Europe, the ending of the Cold War creates risks as well as opportunities. Sturmer's fundamental question - 'Where do Germany and the Germans belong?' has to be posed afresh. 'Between the Rhine and the Oder lies a land which must still, through painful experience, find its internal balance and its external role.' Precisely because of the uncertainties, Sturmer is convinced that Germany will be able to play this role only if it resists the temptation to become once again a 'bridge' between east and west and remains firmly anchored in the Atlantic community. Sturmer ascribes great importance to maintaining the US military presence in Europe. One of Sturmer's theses is that Hitler not only destroyed the Reich, but also undermined 'the German future'. With unity and sovereignty now recovered, Hitler's thrall has weakened. Somewhat ambiguously, Sturmer alludes to the tendency for Germans to become less apologetic for the crimes of the Third Reich. 'With increasing distance, Hitler's place in European history will become less sharp.' But Sturmer also expresses irritation with compatriots who use the catastrophe of the Third Reich as an excuse to prevent Germany from bearing its greater responsibilities, for instance, by sending troops on peace-keeping missions abroad. Germany will have to become 'actor and not spectator' on the world stage, Sturmer writes - but he leaves unclear exactly how this new strategic role should look. There is another intriguing gap in the book, relating to the integration of the European Community. Sturmer is a skilful guide through the paradoxes of German history. But at the end of the journey, Sturmer makes clear that united Germany's place on the political map will be determined by the degree of power it wishes to assign to supranational institutions. Sturmer writes correctly that the new impetus in 1990-91 to European political and monetary union was part of Germany's Beruhigungspolitik (policy of calming fears), aimed at lessening distrust about the might of a united Germany. He also half-approvingly records the remark of a French diplomat equating Germany's D-Mark to France's possession of nuclear weapons. Sturmer leaves open whether Germany will be willing to take the step of monetary disarmament by allowing the D-Mark to be subsumed into a single European currency. Like many influential Germans, Sturmer is in fact (although he does not say so in the book) sceptical about whether a European central bank will really be set up. Sturmer might have spelled out more clearly that a premature abandonment of the D-Mark is one limit on German power which his country is not, after all, willing to countenance.</p>

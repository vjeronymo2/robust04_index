			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (7): Sefam's show case - Nancy ideas and techniques enter the market 'WE will now probably go for external growth and make an acquisition or two  -we've got plenty of cash,' says Mr Pierrick Haan, president of Sefam, a company which did not exist 10 years ago but is now the French market leader in breathing equipment for patients being treated at home. Sefam (Societe d'Etudes et Fabrication d'Appareillage Medical) is a show case example of how ideas and techniques in the laboratories of Nancy and the surrounding area can be successfully brought to market. In his brand new offices in the Brabois science park on Nancy's southern outskirts, Mr Haan recalls how he and another engineer at the INSERM national health institute in Nancy, in 1983, conceived the idea of making small series of specialist equipment. But he says that their company only took off a couple of years later, when they started to make a respiratory machine invented by a Strasbourg neurologist. 'We were lucky enough to fall into an enormous market,' says Mr Haan. The machine caters for serious snorers who suffer breathing and sleep interruption, and for chronic sufferers from bronchitis and emphysema. Last year Sefam sold some 4,000 respiratory machines, half in France and half in the rest of Europe. Its equipment does not come cheap; its Continuous Positive Pressure machine sells for about FFr10,000. But the cost is generally borne by governments (except the UK's National Health Service, which is even more short of cash than its continental counterparts), because these machines allow patients to be treated at home - cheaper than hospital care. With a FFr70m annual turnover now, Sefam may have reached saturation point in respiratory equipment, but Mr Haan intends to target other 'home care' products such as wheelchairs and electric beds for the handicapped. Mr Haan says he is not a big fan of the local authorities 'nursery' programme for infant companies - though Sefam benefited by only paying a nominal rent for its first two years on the Brabois science park. But that science park now has 12,000 people working on its 500 hectares. Mr Bernard Guerrier de Dumast, of Nancy's Development Agency, points out that the science park depends on bringing the university and business worlds together. 'This requires constant pressure. The moment you relax this pressure, the two sides fall apart.' Someone who has applied constant pressure is Mr Michel Gantois. In addition to founding a couple of companies in his own field, engineering materials, he used his 1986-92 presidency of the Institut National Polytechnique to federate this engineering faculty with Nancy's much larger universities. Thanks to Mr Gantois' efforts, Nancy's universities, like those of Strasbourg and Grenoble, are now considered by the French government to form a pole universitaire europeen. This is not just a public relations effort to attract European Commission attention and money. It is a recognition of what Nancy's universities have done to pool research in areas such as engineering materials, industrial safety and cleaner manufacturing, and to improve foreign links. Nancy's French students are being given more facilities to learn foreign languages. Extra French is laid on to increase the share of foreign students in Nancy. Nancy is also reaching out to help universities in Poland and Hungary.</p>

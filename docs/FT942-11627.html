			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Gaza-Jericho Autonomy: Decades of neglect leave unemployment as the norm - The economy Groups of young men sit outside their concrete breeze-block shacks in the middle of the day in the sprawling rubbish streets of Jabalya refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip. For many Palestinian youths, unemployment is the expected norm. Creating jobs for the 800,000 residents of the Strip, where 40-50 per cent of the workforce is unemployed and the population is growing at 4.6 per cent a year, will be the immediate challenge for the incoming Palestinian authority. The Palestinians will also need to reverse decades of Egyptian and Israeli neglect which have left Gaza's sewerage, water, roads, power, communications and housing in disrepair and chaos. The World Bank says the Israeli-run civil administration of the occupied territories for 27 years had an unusually low rate of investment, only 3 per cent of gross domestic product. A recent International Labour Organisation report warned unemployment could worsen unless the Palestinian administration puts in place an immediate programme for up to 12,000 freed detainees, along with temporary public works measures to employ a further 15,000 workers. Many of Gaza's problems are repeated in Jericho and the West Bank. But Gaza, which has an annual per capita income of Dollars 850 (Pounds 566), will be the real test for the economic challenges of peace. Unless Gazans feels a rapid change in living standards, the already fragile support for the peace process may collapse. Unmet expectations may fuel Islamic and other groups which reject peace with Israel. 'If the peace process is to have any hope of success, the Palestinians need to see improvements in the living conditions quickly,' Mr Caio Koch-Weser, World Bank vice president, said this week. Total GDP for the West Bank and Gaza Strip is Dollars 3bn, less than 5 per cent of the Israeli economy. Creating economic growth will not be easy. First, the Palestinians must untangle a web of regulations over investment, land and trade which scared away private-sector investment. The biggest factory in the Gaza Strip is the Seven-Up bottling company, and industry's share of GDP is less than 10 per cent. Second, the Palestinians must create credible economic institutions free from the political interference of the PLO. The economic protocol with Israel will considerably aid the Palestinians in giving them access to the huge market next door. Mr Samir Houleila, a Palestinian economist, says the agreement will create an immediate lowering in costs of production and living. This is because Palestinians have won a lower rate of VAT and direct taxation, lower customs duties on many imports mainly for construction, and cheaper sources of oil which will let them price petroleum products freely - except petrol which can be only 15 per cent lower than Israeli pump prices. In agriculture, which accounts for at least a quarter of Palestinian GDP, the economic accord grants Palestinians the right to export to Israel for the first time since 1967. All farm products will be exported freely except for five items subject to a sliding quota scale until 1999. Lower labour and production costs should let Palestinians compete effectively with Israeli farmers. The Palestinians will also be much helped by a Dollars 1.2bn, three-year emergency aid programme announced by the World Bank this week. About half the package, which will inject Dollars 200 a year in aid per person, is targeted on transport, water supply, housing and education. International donors are increasingly concerned about the Palestinian ability to absorb the aid, spend it on productive projects and create the capacity to manage their own economy. The World Bank's report acknowledges the risk that some aid could end up being used for 'political' construction projects that are not needed and line the pockets of politically-connected businessmen. Institutions such as the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, which will co-ordinate aid with donors, will be play a vital role. Senior Palestinian economists fear the PLO may not allow independent and efficient institutions to emerge. 'The problem for the PLO is to realise that it is no longer in exile and needs different capacity, different organisational structure based on efficiency, professionalism and transparency,' said Mr Houleila. Another problem is skills gaps in the occupied territories, especially in economic and financial management. Mr Houleila said recent efforts to recruit personnel from the Arab world have been a failure; he urged Arab governments to give key workers a sabbatical to work in Gaza-Jericho for a year. Foreign technical assistance and training programmes, such as Bank of England assistance with the Palestinian Monetary Authority, will be critical. Raising their own revenue, building an independent sustainable base to finance domestic activities and avoiding aid dependence will be a vital challenge. Israel will help by transferring 75 per cent of income tax levied on Palestinian migrant workers in Israel to the 'Palestinian treasury'. But improving tax collection in Gaza-Jericho will not be easy. Ultimately, much will depend on the Palestinians building a stable free market environment to attract the billions of dollars held by the Palestinian business diaspora.</p>

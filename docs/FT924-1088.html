			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Offshore accounts still have attractions for UK savers - And one of them, as Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds, is that you can delay paying tax OFFSHORE accounts sound glamorous and, no doubt, some people put their money in the Channel Islands to feel richer than they are. But, for UK building society savers, there are still good reasons to consider opening one. The market is relatively new for societies and many have established offshore subsidiaries only in the past few years - although some, such as the Halifax, have had an offshore presence for longer. Such accounts, which pay interest gross, are aimed mainly at expatriates but non-taxpaying UK residents needed them before the abolition of composite-rate tax in April 1991. This tax was deducted at source in the UK and could not be reclaimed by non-taxpayers. Now it has gone, so has the main need by UK residents for an offshore account. Since they must declare their income to the Inland Revenue regardless of where it is held, is there much point now in putting money in an offshore building society account? One reason can be found in the table, which compares rates paid on an instant access offshore account at the top 10 UK building societies with the corresponding onshore account. In most cases, the gross rate is higher on the offshore account. Halifax's Jersey-based Deposit International, for example, offers 6.5 per cent gross on Pounds 10,000 compared with 5.6 per cent on its Instant Xtra Plus onshore account. Its onshore rate is bettered offshore by 1.35 percentage points on sums over Pounds 50,000, while National &amp; Provincial pays 8 per cent gross on Pounds 100,000 or more in its Isle of Man-based Independent Reserve account, compared with 6.5 per cent onshore. One reason for higher rates is due to the funding of offshore subsidiaries. Guy Stephenson, operations manager of Woolwich Guernsey, explains: 'We collect sterling and dollar deposits world-wide and lend sterling deposits to the society on the mainland. They pay us a rate for the money, which has to be a market rate.' Overheads on offshore subsidiaries also tend to be lower, since they often are smaller and have fewer staff than mainland offices. Societies such as Bristol &amp; West, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester already have the benefit of low overheads with their postal accounts, and are not able to better these rates offshore (although those investing Pounds 100,000 or more in C&amp;G's Guernsey Gold account will get a better return offshore). Another reason for putting money offshore is that, although a tax liability cannot be avoided, it can be delayed. depending on your timing. Take Alliance &amp; Leicester's Maximum Instant account, which is paying 6.75 per cent gross on a Pounds 50,000 deposit. Like most of the onshore accounts, it offers a choice of dates for crediting interest. You can choose April 1 or May 1, depending on your tax year. If you chose May 1 1992, and declared the interest on your 1992-93 tax declaration form next year, you would then be unlikely to have to pay tax on it until the first half of 1994 - although the exact timing depends on your tax office. Some societies differentiate between expatriate accountholders and those based in the UK. Leeds, for example argues that paying higher rates on its Liquid Gold Overseas account would take business away from its UK parent. Its Overseas Gold account, open only to expatriates, offers a higher rate to compete with other offshore institutions. You do not have to be particularly rich to go offshore: the minimum investment in Leeds Permanent's Liquid Gold Overseas account is Pounds 25, and Pounds 500 for a Woolwich international account. But some societies require much higher sums: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester demands Pounds 10,000 minimum for its Guernsey Gold account. The UK's Building Societies Deposit Protection Scheme, which guarantees to pay 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in an account, does not apply outside mainland Britain. Of the three main offshore islands, only the Isle of Man has its own scheme. Under this, deposits are protected up to 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, and building societies also are covered by the scheme. However, section 22 of the 1986 Building Societies Act requires all the liabilities of a subsidiary to be guaranteed by the parent. Should that parent go bust, savers would not be covered by the Building Societies Deposit Scheme. In the past, though, troubled building societies have been taken over rather than allowed to collapse.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Developed-country victims of the technological age STROKING British manufacturers, who are still sore after a decade of neglect, has become a cross-party activity in post-Thatcherite Britain. Neither main political party appears to have clear ideas about how government can revive Britain's dwindling industrial base. But both agree that manufacturing matters after all. This rediscovery of the importance of manufacturing industry is probably long overdue. That Britain has a current account deficit of more than 2 per cent at the bottom of a long recession certainly suggests that its traded goods industries, predominantly manufacturing, have been allowed to shrink too far. The case for subsidising investment in equipment is strengthened by new evidence from the US of a powerful link between such investment and economic growth (Post-communist dilemmas for would-be activists, FT March 22 1993). But a manufacturing revival, however desirable to close the trade deficit, would not solve the problem of high unemployment and falling relative wages among poorly educated workers that Britain shares with much of the rest of the developed world. It is tempting to see the decline in British manufacturing employment in the early 1980s as the cause of the growth of unskilled unemployment and wage inequality that followed. Tempting but misleading, for wage inequality in the US grew faster than in the UK in the 1980s even though US manufacturing performed relatively well compared both to British industry and the US economy as a whole. The shift in demand for labour, and thus wage differentials, in favour of skilled and educated workers has also occurred within US manufacturing industry. Consistently, over the past 30 years, the growth of manufacturing output, capital and raw materials in US manufacturing has outstripped employment, according to recent research released by the US National Bureau of Economic Research. But, while the number of non-production workers has continued to grow, blue-collar employment has stagnated since the mid-1970s, as the chart shows. Between 1979 and 1989 the employment of US production workers fell by 2.2m to 12.3m, while non-production employment increased by 0.2m to 6.7m, raising the share of non-production employment from 23 per cent in 1973 to 29 per cent in 1989. Labour-saving technological change, not just low-wage, labour-intensive competition from developing countries, is the primary reason for the decline in blue collar employment, according to the NBER research. The share of high technology capital in the total manufacturing capital stock rose from 1 to 7 per cent between 1973 and 1989. And, while the share of imports in total US manufacturing shipments also doubled over that period, less than a third of the increase in the share of non-production workers in total employment in the 1980s occurred because old, labour-intensive industries were replaced by new, high-tech industries. More than two thirds of the increase in non-production employment occurred within existing industries as they upgraded their technology and expanded the use of computers. Not surprisingly, non-production workers - engaged in supervision, management and administration, technology and product development, sales and delivery - are more likely to have educational qualifications and are better paid than their blue collar counterparts. More than 90 per cent of non-production workers graduated from high school in 1987, compared with 70 per cent of production workers; only 17 per cent of blue collar workers attend further education, half the average for all manufacturing employees. Manufacturing may matter; but only an increase in educational investment can solve the problem of unskilled unemployment and rising wage inequality.

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE VILLAGE OKS HOUSING PROJECT FOR WILDLIFE HABITAT  </P> <P> The Westlake Village City Council has cleared the way for a developer to build  51 houses in an area described as important wildlife habitat, but complained  that a state parks agency should have bought the land to preserve it.  </P> <P> After nearly four hours of testimony and discussion Wednesday night and early  Thursday, the council voted 5 to 0 to approve plans by M.J. Brock for a  development on an oak-studded meadow upstream from Lake Eleanor, which  environmentalists call an important water source for animals in the Santa  Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Council members expressed regret over allowing development on the land, but  said they had no choice because of the absence of an offer from the Santa  Monica Mountains Conservancy to buy the land.  </P> <P> The land had been described by biologist Rudi Mattoni of the Center for the  Conservation of Biodiversity, a Beverly Hills environmental group, as a "really  unique property . . . a truly rich area of bio-diversity."  </P> <P> Larry Lynch, a representative of M.J. Brock, said the developer is willing to  sell the land, but no agency has stepped forward to negotiate for it.  </P> <P> "I am very disappointed in some of the agencies," Councilman James Emmons said.  "Their mission is to acquire open space land and it would have been good if  they had in fact acquired this site."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Berniece Bennett questioned whether officials of the conservancy  -- a state agency charged with the preservation of the Santa Monica Mountains  -- truly considered the site ecologically significant. "If it was that  sensitive, I wish they had come forward to buy it," she said. "That's why they  have the funds."  </P> <P> But conservancy officials later said the agency -- now involved in complicated  negotiations to acquire a controversial, expensive canyon in Studio City --  doesn't have the money.  </P> <P> "The conservancy can't buy everything," spokesman Paul Edelman said. "People  seem to have this illusion that the conservancy has this endless source of  money, but that's not the reality."  </P> <P> At the hearing Wednesday night, Edelman appealed to the council to reject the  construction proposal on grounds that the potential benefits of the new houses  are not adequate compensation for the environmental damage they would cause.  </P> <P> The proposed construction site is home to a large population of tiny yellow  flowers, known as Pentachaeta lyonii, which are on the federal government's  list of endangered species. Many of the flowers, which are indigenous to the  Santa Monica Mountains, will be destroyed by the housing, project opponents  said.  </P> <P> The project also calls for uprooting 11 oak trees, although seven would be  transplanted.  </P> <P> Environmentalists also complained that runoff from the development will pollute  the lake, and that the residences will block a canyon wildlife trail, making it  difficult for animals from the mountains to reach the water.  </P> <P> Dave Stoddard, who has lived in Westlake Village 16 years, contested the  conclusion of an environmental impact report that significant environmental  damage on the site is "unavoidable."  </P> <P> "I always thought that only death and taxes were unavoidable. I guess now we  have to add the destruction of our environment," he said. "But the truth is, it  is avoidable. Simply by not approving this project, you can avoid it."  </P> <P> But Mayor Ken Rufener said the landowner's property rights take precedence over  the environmental concerns because the land is zoned for residential  development.  </P> <P> "I do not believe that an acre or two of land on which a small flower grows is  enough to justify depriving a property owner the right to build on his land,"  he said.  </P></p>

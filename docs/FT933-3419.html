The 5.2m ordinary shares were sold to institutional clients of Hoare Govett Securities for 403p a share. Hoare Govett were appointed Airtours' brokers last week, replacing Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

It said bookings for summer 1993 had been 20 per cent ahead of last year. Hoare Govett said it was upgrading its forecast of 1992-93 full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 41m to Pounds 44m, after Pounds 9m costs incurred in the bid, which failed earlier this year, for rival Owners Abroad. Pre-tax profits last year were Pounds 36.5m. The largest seller of shares was Mr David Crossland, chairman, who disposed of 2.6m shares with a total value of Pounds 10.6m. He retains 30m shares.

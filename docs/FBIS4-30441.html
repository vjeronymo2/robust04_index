			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Buck-Toothed"] </F>   [Text] No buck-toothed guys have charged Cambodian papers  printed in the West of violating the press law. Not just those  printed in the West, even the Thai newspapers have spread so  much divisive news to sow dissension among Cambodians without  even an iota of truth. For example, they have claimed that  Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi  would resign their government portfolios if the Khmer Rouge were  declared outlaws.    Are the Khmer Rouge related in any way to His Highness  Norodom Sirivut and His Excellency Sam Rangsi? Are they their  fathers-in-law or what?    Although they have published such a blatant falsehood, no  buck-toothed people dare accuse them of day-dreaming. Maybe  these buck-toothed guys are too buck-toothed to do something  normal persons would do.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Expenditures Have Grown Despite </F> Savings"]    [Text] Esko Aho's government announced an ambitious program  for restraining the rise in government expenditures right at the  beginning of its term. The government promised to keep  government expenditures in real terms on the same level as in  1991.    It did not succeed in keeping its promise. In 1991  government  expenditures increased about 15 percent and in 1992 by a further  16 percent. Last year government outlays including bank support  were 202 billion markkas or 15 percent greater than the 175  billion markkas included in the budget proposal.    Aho's government has begun to interpret its own objectives  in  such a way that it would be sufficient if there were a return to  the 1991 level in 1995.    When the government announced its proposal for this year's  budget in the fall, the final amount of the bill was 188 billion  markkas. During Eduskunta deliberations, 5.5 billion markkas in  expenditures and a deficit of 4 billion markkas were added to  the bill. Supplementary budgets issued in the course of the year  will push up the total even more.    This year the state is saving more than ever. It will use  30-35 billion markkas less money than it would have if last  year's saving decisions had not been made.    Despite the savings, the final amount of the budget bill in  nominal terms is 12 percent larger than the state's final  accounts for 1991. In real terms, i. e., when the rise in prices  of public expenditures is taken into account, the government's  original objective will be exceeded by nearly 10 percent.    Last year government expenditures were 202 billion markkas,  tax revenues 100 billion, and other revenues 35 billion markkas.  The gap of 67 billion markkas that was generated was filled by  borrowing.    The rate of increase in government debt is stabilizing. This  year the government's need for borrowing is approximately the  same as last year. At its greatest the year before last it was  necessary to borrow 72 billion markkas.</p>

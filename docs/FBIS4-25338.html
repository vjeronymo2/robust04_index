			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, June 8 (XINHUA) -- China calls the  International Labor Organization (ILO) to respect member  countries' right to choose their own path of development and  strengthen its cooperation with them.    The call was made today by a Chinese delegate at the 81st  International Labor Conference in Geneva.    Addressing the conference, Chinese Labor Minister Li Boyong  said that in a world moving towards multi-polarity, the ILO  should help to resolve the ideological controversies left over  by the long-time bipolar confrontation.    He called on the ILO to show full consideration for the  various social systems and values of its member countries and  stop using a single pattern to assess them all.    He urged the organization to step up its cooperation with  member states and so promote global economic prosperity, defend  social justice and protect workers' rights and interests.    Li said that with unemployment being the most pressing  problem in both the advanced and the developing countries, the  ILO should make work promotion as its main priority.    According to statistics from the International Labor Office,  the number of people registered jobless in the world now exceeds  120 million, and 700 million more are underemployed.    Li also called for the ILO to use a more flexible labor  standard suitable for a broader application.    But he said that the ILO should not use the standard as a  condition for technological cooperation with member states, as  it would not work if the ILO were to impose standardization on  the developing world.    The Chinese minister briefed the conference on the labor  situation in China, where job promotion, the elimination of  poverty and the protection of workers' interests have always  been an important part of the government's work.    The rate of urban unemployment in China has remained at the  low level of under three percent in the 1990s, while the average  real salary is up by 4.5 percent, said Li.    The Chinese Government has also expanded the range of  unemployment insurance and provides social insurance for retired  workers, he said.    In transition from a planned to a market economy, Li  concluded, proceeding from the specific situation and learning  from the experiences of the advanced countries could help to  avoid social turmoil and economic recession.    The International Labor Conference, ILO's most authoritative  organ, began its annual session on Tuesday [7 June].</p>

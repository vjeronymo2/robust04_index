It is expected to  become operational in early 1995 and in the first year of  operation the two partners expect it to generate some ECU1.5  billion in revenues. The venture will make approximately ECU  1,000 million in investments during the next five years and its  workforce will number 4,000 persons.    Jean Arnould has worked at France Telecom since 1975 when he  was head of Industrial Development within the International  Affairs division. He was subsequently appointed Regional  Director for Alsace, Lorraine, Nord Pas-de-Calais and  Rhones-Alpes. Since 1993, he has been Deputy Director for the  Southeast France Sector.    Dr. Knoppik joined DBT in 1990 as Head of the Satellite and  International Cable Systems Division.

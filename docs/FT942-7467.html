			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Big jump in first quarter at Incentive Rising demand and improved competitiveness provided the impetus for a big jump in first-quarter results at Incentive, the industrial and investment group controlled by the Wallenberg family. Profits before financial items rose 51 per cent to SKr130m (Dollars 16.9m) from SKr86m, excluding associate companies. Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr3.35bn, while orders were 11 per cent higher at SKr3.65bn. Last month, Incentive paid SKr3.7bn to acquire a 44 per cent stake in Cardo, the Swedish investment group. It then launched a bid for the rest of the group in a move to secure control of Gambro, the medical equipment specialist. The group forecast higher profits per share in 1994, even though the Cardo purchase will lift interest expenses and goodwill amortisation. Last year, profit per share was SKr6.75. Mr Mikael Lilius, president, said demand was increasing in Europe, North America and Asia.</p>

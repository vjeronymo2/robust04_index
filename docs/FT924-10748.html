Euromonitor reports that spending on pets, including food and veterinary bills, went up by 7 per cent in the UK in 1991, reaching the staggering figure of Pounds 2.4bn, more than was spent on pets by any other nation. Per capita spending on petfood alone in the UK was Dollars 44.8, followed by Dollars 35.4 in Germany and Dollars 35.2 in the US. Barking mad or just purring along nicely?</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Maxwell administrators sue bank for Pounds 100m ADMINISTRATORS to the manager of the Maxwell company pension funds have filed a writ seeking Pounds 100m from Lehman Brothers International, the US investment bank owned by American Express. The writ alleges that officials of Lehman Brothers International entered into 'stock-lending' agreements in which Bishopsgate Investment Management, the Maxwell-owned fund management company, borrowed increasing amounts of US Treasury bills, and that it knew the deals were unusual. It alleges that as early as October 1990 Mr Mark Haas, Lehman's head of international stock-lending, knew that stocks being offered as collateral for the borrowings of US Treasury securities actually belonged to the pension funds. The writ details a conversation between Mr Haas and Mr Timothy Daily, then head of stock-lending at Invesco MIM, the fund managers. Mr Daily was questioning why the Maxwell pension fund investment portfolio managed by Invesco had been passed to Lehman Brothers. The writ alleges that Mr Haas informed Mr Daily that the stock-lending arrangements were not normal; that the Treasury bills being lent to BIM were being converted to cash; and that the late Robert Maxwell was in financial difficulties. Lehman rejected the claim, adding: 'We engaged in bona fide business transactions under a legitimate stock-loan arrangement with a regulated counter-party, and had no notice of any impropriety.' The writ alleges that while Lehman was receiving press materials and private information suggesting that Maxwell's personal empire was under pressure, it agreed to increase borrowings to BIM in exchange for larger amounts of collateral. Once, it says, the bank agreed to an increase in credit facilities only after BIM agreed that Lehman could be lead underwriter in a secondary offering of BIM's stake in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceuticals company. Last month Lehman acted as lead underwriter for an offering of the shares still held by BIM as well as the shares it acquired under the stock-lending agreement. The prospectus for the offering notes that the Teva shares held as collateral were registered in the name of BIM and that permission had to be obtained from Teva after Maxwell's death to change the registration to its own name. The borrowed Treasury bills, the writs allege, were on numerous occasions sold back to Lehman Brothers Government Securities and then resold for cash. The writ alleges that the cash was then deposited, upon the instructions of a man who Lehman Brothers knew was not a director of BIM, into accounts for the personal interests of Maxwell. The writ says that Lehman usually took instructions from Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a director of London and Bishopsgate International Investment. BIM is not legally connected to LBII and Lehman had received on several occasions lists of BIM directors, copies of its accounts and other documents.</p>

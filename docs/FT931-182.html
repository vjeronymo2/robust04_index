			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Arts: When it's the real thing - Television One of the earliest columns I wrote for this page said that while television fiction was fun, fact was the real thing; when done well, documentary and current affairs programmes represented the pinnacle of television's achievements. However, today that distinction seems less obvious, if indeed there is a distinction at all. As time and a multitude of programmes go by, what seems to matter more and more is the intent and integrity of the programme maker and not the form that the programme happens to take. But surely there is such a fundamental difference between, say, the Nine O'Clock News and Lipstick On Your Collar that the very idea of comparison becomes ludicrous: the news programme is a factual report, constructed by a large team of journalists aiming for objectivity, whereas the drama is an entertainment springing from the mind of one person with no pretence at being anything but subjective. Yet even at this extreme you could argue that matters are not as simple as they seem. What they choose to show us on the news must be less than one per cent of what comes in from staff, agencies and wire services: deciding which 99 per cent to reject and which one per cent to select is a highly subjective process. It is true that news desks, at least in the western industrial democracies, tend to share assumptions about the ranking in importance of the various events going on in the world. But they are only assumptions; there is no god-given list of ultimate news values, and if you replaced the existing staff on the Nine O'Clock News, News At 10 and Channel 4 News with teams from the Women's Institute, the National Front and the British Humanist Association you might (after an initial period during which the newcomers instinctively aped the professionals) achieve some very different news programmes. The objective nature of news is much less dependable than most of us tend to assume. Dennis Potter's drama, on the other hand, may be much less of a flight of fancy than it seems at first. In the best book about Potter yet published (Potter On Potter, a series of interviews carried out by Graham Fuller: Faber and Faber, Pounds 12.99, out last week) Potter again rejects the idea that his television work - in particular The Singing Detective - is autobiographical. 'The form of autobiography is very powerful because it appears to be authentic. As I've said before, autobiography is one of the most venal and lying of all the sub-art forms in prose' he declares. But whether Potter's work is strictly 'autobiographical' or not, it is clear that much of the strength of Lipstick On Your Collar comes from its authenticity. The songs are the main, but certainly not the only, means of achieving period verisimilitude. From vintage cars to 1950s' clothes, from wooden filing cabinets to the original brown-and-cream Nescafe tin, enormous care has been taken to ensure that things are 'real' and these do not come out of Potter's head in the way that CS Lewis's Narnia came out of his. Even such detailed matters as the officer's habitual reference to the coffee break as 'time for a spot of the barely-bloody-drinkable' has about it the ring of authenticity. It would be astonishing to discover that Potter had invented that rather than remembered it from his own days as a Russian language clerk in the Army. In other words it seems likely that this is closer to fact than fiction. But so what? Surely nobody would want to deny that Potter thought up the story about oh-so-Welsh Francis Francis, flirtatious fantasising Sylvia, and randy Harold Atterbow the bitter cinema organist? Naturally not, but in the end (right the way through, actually) none of these characters mattered very much. Their stories could have been usefully condensed into a 90-minute single drama. What seems to have concerned Potter much more was to convey to us the zeitgeist, and his feelings about it: his sadness at the increasing influence of American culture in Britain; the end of empire and the emasculation of the British lion as exemplified by the Suez fiasco; and the continuing rigidity of the British class system despite the other changes. Of course one individual's interpretation of the spirit of the times may be at odds with ours, but this applies as much to supposedly factual as to fictional programmes. Consider The Beginner's Guide To The State We're In, a 75-minute BBC2 programme in which young novelist and university teacher Robert Wilson drove around the UK talking to 'the poor'. It is never wrong for television to show the comfortable majority what life is like for those who are worse off, but such matters are relative. The people we met via the camera seemed not only well dressed and well enough fed to be chubby, they could also afford such items as cigarettes and television. Ranked against a global scale of wellbeing and poverty these people must fit somewhere in the top 25 per cent, yet Wilson referred to them dolefully as 'the dispossessed'. He and producer Mike MacCormack laid mournful mood music on the soundtrack, and Wilson's commentary and questions made it clear that he felt they were deeply wronged. No doubt Wilson describes a glass as half empty, and some other university lecturer who considered it half full could make an equally persuasive programme arguing that the poor in Britain today are better off than at any time in history. If not as selective and subjective a piece of work as Lipstick On Your Collar, Wilson's programme ran Potter's pretty close. On the other side of that coin was the first episode of BBC2's Goggle Eyes, a dramatisation by Deborah Moggach from a novel by Anne Fine. You can hardly get more fictional than that, and yet, for those of us who are not female and have never been part of a one-parent family, that opening episode (Part 2 is tonight) could serve almost as a text book . . . at least, I suspect it could. It must be possible, in theory, that this picture of the strains caused by the arrival of a new 'boyfriend' in the life of the mother is sheer invention. But it vibrated with the sort of authenticity ('He's been here before, he knows where the drinks are kept]' hissed a furious daughter) which experience tells us is hard to fake. By a similar sort of reckoning, it must theoretically be possible that the elderly people in The Nineties, which has just begun on BBC2 on Sundays, and A Labour Of Love, which comes to an end on BBC2 tomorrow night, are either mis-remembering events or deliberately lying about them. But tests of various sorts suggest otherwise. In The Nineties there is internal evidence. It would take not a sceptic but a an out and out cynic to doubt the mutually corroborative reminiscences of the amazing Summerhayes, mostly born in the 19th century, who served in the British Empire as missionaries and medics. In A Labour Of Love you have not only similar internal evidence as elderly people tell of the difficulties, techniques and joys of childcare between 1900 and 1950, you also have the track record of producer Steve Humphries who made the excellent archive-and-interview series A Secret World Of Sex. In the end, if we expect to get more than mindless entertainment from our televisions we will have to learn to evaluate work from various producers and networks in much the same way as generations of readers have learned to evaluate books from various authors and publishers. Sometimes the supposedly 'factual' programmes will turn out to be largely fantasy, and sometimes the fiction will bear out the saying that art is a lie which tells us the truth.</p>

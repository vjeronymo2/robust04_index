			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Japan's current account surplus soars in January JAPAN'S CURRENT account surplus soared in January to Dollars 3.06bn (Pounds 1.74bn) compared to Dollars 45m a year ago. The huge increase in the broadest measure of Japan's external balances resulted from an 8.1 per cent rise in the value of exports, a 5.6 per cent decline in imports, and a 10.4 per cent decline in Japan's invisible trade deficit, which includes non-trade items such as insurance and tourism. Finance Ministry officials, however, said that the rise in the value of exports was mostly accounted for by the increase in the value of the yen over the past year. This also depressed the value of imports, as did a drop in the price of oil compared to a year ago. Average oil import prices were Dollars 19.02 a barrel, compared to Dollars 28.60 a year ago. Many economists believe the huge year-on-year increases in Japan's external surpluses which have been recorded for most of the past year, will begin to level out in the months ahead. The continued high level of trade and current account surpluses, however, are likely to prove a continuing source of friction with Japan's trade partners. Japan's exports rose to Dollars 23.3bn during the month, while imports fell to Dollars 17.4bn, leading to a 90 per cent increase in the trade surplus to Dollars 5.89bn. Japan also posted a surplus in the long-term capital account of Dollars 3.5bn, compared to a deficit of Dollars 2.88bn a year ago. The surplus reflected a continuing flow of foreign money into Japan, where foreigners were net purchasers of Dollars 6.9bn in stocks and bonds. Japanese were net sellers of Y2.39bn of foreign stocks, although they bought Y7.4bn in foreign bonds. Overtime work in Japanese manufacturing companies in January registered the biggest year-on-year decline in 16 years, the Labour Ministry said yesterday, in a reflection of the sharp slowdown of the Japanese economy. Average overtime work in manufacturing companies with more than 30 employees fell by 17.8 per cent during the month to 14.4 hours. Housing starts fell by 16.4 per cent, the 15th monthly decline running.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Arts: The Shadow of a Gunman - Leicester Haymarket Studio The recent bombing in Co Tyrone has given a sad, topical edge to Sean O'Casey's 1923 The Shadow of a Gunman at Leicester. The production carries its topicality with great tact; it makes the play's issues current yet preserves the historical moment which O'Casey recorded. O'Casey based this play, originally On The Run, around a series of raids on republican 'safe houses' in north Dublin over the Easter weekend, 1921. O'Casey had links with the IRA through his secretaryship of one of its constituents, the Irish Citizen Army; and since 1920 the IRA had been conducting insurgency operations. O'Casey was staying in a dilapidated Georgian house raided by British forces; he was untouched, but another tenant was taken away under suspicion of manufacturing bombs. That real life incident survives in Shadow: a poet and a travelling salesman share a room in a republican tenement; other inmates drift in and develop the nationalist cause from various positions: labourers, landlords and shopgirls. The house is raided, and explosives found in a girl's room. What emerges is a play about how people make political belief intimate with their lives, about degrees of activism. O'Casey jokes coolly, bringing the troubles back home: 'a land mine exploding under your bed is the only thing that would lift you out of it.' Elsewhere the play's tone alters to a resigned shrug at the state of Ireland: 'After a bit, a gunman throws a bomb as carelessly as a schoolboy throws a snowball.' Shadow has the excitement of Conrad's Secret Agent and the tenderness of Joyce's Dubliners. Paul Kerryson's scrupulous direction meets the technical demands levied by O'Casey's staging notes: the poet 'bears upon his body the marks of the struggle for existence and the efforts towards self expression' and is well interpreted by John McCormack. Russell Dixon as the salesman, all blarney and belief, turns in a natural, easy performance, as does Angela Clerkin as a lovestruck girl willing to hide explosives in her room. Denis Quilligan is a model of unvarnished respectability as a worried tenant appealing to the IRA to resolve a domestic broil. The set follows O'Casey to the letter, creating a decayed room with collapsible beds; but Charles Cusick-Smith's design successfully incorporates a bright mural in a rural idyll spattered with blood. Shadow of a Gunman closed after three nights at The Abbey Theatre, Dublin in 1923. The first night box office was 13. The Irish Times wanted less tragedy and more satire from the play to increase its longevity. But 70-odd years on, its plain disillusionment has assumed an aspect of inevitability: 'I believe in the freedom of Ireland, and that England has no right to be here, but I draw the line when I hear the gunmen blowin' about dying for the people, when it's the people that are dyin' for the gunmen'.</p>

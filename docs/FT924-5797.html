			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Charter poised to include GPs THE GOVERNMENT is about to extend the National Health Service Patient's Charter to family doctors and other areas of primary care. So far, the Department of Health's contribution to the Citizen's Charter has concentrated on hospital services. But 90 per cent of medical consultations begin and end with general practitioners, and the decision to involve them in the charter has a number of significant implications. In 1990 the government introduced a new performance-related contract for family doctors which, among other things, was intended to improve patient choice and make it easier for people to change GPs. One of the difficulties of extending choice has been the absence of clearly understood common criteria to help patients assess whether the services provided by a particular GP are reasonable. The charter proposals will set out a range of standards including maximum waiting times for urgent consultations with GPs; waiting times for routine consultations and waiting times to see a chosen doctor in a group practice. Other factors, such as availability of health education services and facilities for children in GPs' surgeries, will be included. The primary-care proposals will break new ground for the charter concept because GPs are independent contractors rather than NHS employees. That means that their involvement in the charter programme must be voluntary. The charter arrangements will be fortified by a set of national standards for family health services authorities, the statutory bodies responsible for administering primary care.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Will Ross's Administration Translate Words Into </F> Deeds"]    [Text] Not much has changed since the last visit to Amman  by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross regarding the siege imposed on the  Port of al-'Aqabah and the losses estimated at millions of  dinars that it causes.    The U.S. Administration has spoken in positive words about  Jordan and its balanced and responsible policy. Yet this  administration has not translated these words into solid facts.  It continues to besiege al-'Aqabah, the sole naval outlet of  this country which has endured the results of all events and  regional and international conflicts throughout the previous  decades without any justification or legal pretext.    Jordan for years has stood as a model state that knows its  responsibilities on the national, pan-Arab, and international  levels. It has continued to bear all the results of these  responsibilities, in terms of its obligations toward the causes  of the homeland and nation. It has continued to respect  international norms, charters, and resolutions. Jordan has  continued to bear the heaviest burden caused by regional  developments, responsibility for which is shouldered by  international and regional parties, led by the state of  occupation and aggression, Israel.    Ross's visit to Jordan is a suitable opportunity to remind  him and the U.S. Administration about direct and indirect U.S.  responsibility for many problems facing this country, which has  a sensitive regional position. What is needed is to expedite  the translation of positive U.S. words about Jordan and its role  into practical results, foremost of which is lifting the siege  imposed on al-'Aqabah, Jordan's only naval outlet.    Ross's visit, which precedes the new round of negotiations  on  various tracks, is supposed to bring in new elements that  justify the resumption of these negotiations, whose realization  is blocked by Israel.    Certainly, we do not expect the U.S. envoy to ask for any  concessions from us so the negotiations will succeed.  Otherwise, this would be as if he is asking us to  unconditionally surrender in the face of Israel's intransigence.  In addition to the fact that we do not accept capitulation --  no matter how much pressure we face -- it is an established fact  that a peace that is not just and that doesn not meet the  people's demands to restore their usurped rights will not last.</p>

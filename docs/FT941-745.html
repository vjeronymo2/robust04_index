			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Tory MPs braced for EU deal Conservative MPs were last night edging towards sullen acceptance of the compromise over reforms to European Union voting procedures hammered out by EU foreign ministers in Greece last weekend. After a bubbly 45-minute performance by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, in the Commons yesterday, it was clear that hardcore Euro-sceptics still thought the cabinet should today reject the deal. But the self-styled Euro-realists to the centre and centre-right of the party appeared to be steeling themselves to accept what they almost unanimously regarded as a government climbdown. Mr Hurd's carefully-worded responses to MPs' questions appeared to have convinced only a handful of the doubters on the Conservative backbenches that the concessions he had secured were of much importance. Mr David Evans, the outspoken MP for Welwyn Hatfield and a member of the executive of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, summed up the mood: 'I hope they (the cabinet) stick to their guns. But everything points to a giving-way - however they wrap it up.' Even those MPs who saw nothing objectionable in Sunday's deal were generally critical of the government's tactics, which had seen Mr John Major side very publicly with Conservative Euro-sceptics at prime minister's questions last Tuesday. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, MP for Upminster and chairman of the Commons defence committee said: 'I think the compromise is probably one which is acceptable. But I don't think the particular stand which the government has taken is one that necessarily need have been taken in the circumstances.' The Labour MPs barracking Mr Hurd with shouts of 'grand old Duke of York' in the Commons had learnt their lines from what many Tories were whispering in private. While studiously avoiding giving any indication of what his recommendation to his cabinet colleagues will be on the matter today, Mr Hurd said Britain's tough negotiating position had ensured there would be a 'root and branch' review of qualified majority voting - the system at the centre of the current row - in two years. In the 'transitional' period leading up to the review, the EU presidency and all members of the council would be 'legally bound' to work for an agreement on the basis of a 23-vote minority. This allows two large member states and one small one to muster 23 votes in order to block decisions. But the foreign secretary acknowledged that decisions would be able to be taken on the basis of a larger blocking majority of 27 if all other avenues were exhausted. Asked by one Tory MP whether he would be prepared to resort to the so-called Luxembourg compromise, enshrining Britain's right to veto EU legislation when it considers vital national interest is at stake, Mr Hurd gave an assurance that he would. The Euro-sceptic position was best articulated by Mr Bill Cash, MP for Stafford. He said that the cabinet should turn down the compromise because arrangements for the proposed review were not included in the accession treaty. Mr Cash said that unless this was done there would be no guarantee that Britain could unravel 'any decision that had been arrived at in the meantime'. Other Euro-sceptics later put it more bluntly. One said the government should reject the deal 'straight down the line.' He added: 'What is more important - uniting the party or enlargement? How many votes are there in enlargement?' Another said: 'If John Major accepts this, I don't think there is any further useful function he can serve the country or the party.' For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said it would have been difficult to devise a sequence of events which did more damage to Britain's interests and reputation in Europe than the confused and contradictory behaviour of this government over the past three weeks. In the Lords, there was an unusually sharp exchange between Lord Tebbit and Baroness Chalker, with the Foreign Office minister attacking the strongly Euro-sceptic former Conservative party chairman for endorsing opposition criticism of Mr Major. Lady Chalker said Lord Tebbit - who said that the government had been 'turned over' in the recent negotiations - 'seems to put agreement with political opponents before loyalty to his own party'. Lord Tebbit remarked that he agreed with 'much that was said' by Lord Richard, the Labour leader in the Lords, and Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, leader of the Liberal Democrat peers. Lord Richard described the negotiations over the future size of the EU blocking minority as 'one of the most crass pieces of British diplomacy I can remember'. Lord Jenkins condemned the prime minister's desperate attempt 'to save his own skin' and commented on the 'pathetic spectacle of a weak man trying to behave like a strong man'.</p>

Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once critical habitat is designated, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies, and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies insure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines an action may affect a listed species or its designated critical habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse modification of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate jeopardy and incidental take. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Basis for Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The evaluation of actions that may adversely modify least Bell's vireo critical habitat should consider a number of factors such as the present condition of the habitat, the number of current pairs, the reproductive success of breeding pairs, the expected time to regenerate sufficient habitat to support an effective population at a particular site, and local and regional problems. Although the Service considered the entire range of the least Bell's vireo in determining an approach to critical habitat designation, its section 7 analysis of actions that may adversely affect vireo critical habitat will consider the significance of impacts at individual critical habitat areas as well as the entire range. All proposed actions should be viewed as to their impacts on all four constituent elements relative to the potential for adverse modification on individual critical habitat areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of Actions Affecting Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Activities that disturb or remove the primary constituent elements within proposed critical habitat areas may constitute destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. In the case of the vireo, these activities include: (1) Removal or destruction of riparian vegetation, (2) thinning of riparian growth, particularly near ground level, (3) removal or destruction of adjacent chaparral or other upland habitats used for foraging, and (4) increases in human-associated or human-induced disturbance. Specific actions that could adversely affect vireo critical habitat include stream channelization, water impoundment or extraction, water diversion, livestock grazing, intensive recreation, and conversion of presently existing riparian or adjacent upland areas to residential, agricultural, or commercial use. Complete or major destruction of riparian vegetation would result in the extirpation of the least Bell's vireo from the affected area, which could further endanger the species throughout the remainder of its range and preclude opportunities for recovery. Thinning or selectively removing components of riparian vegetation could cause vireos to abandon an area because suitable nesting and foraging sites are scarce or absent or could result in lowered reproductive success because of diminished habitat quality. Increases in recreation could cause actual destruction of nests or could disrupt nesting activities which in turn could cause nest abandonment, lowered hatching success, increased rates of cowbird parasitism and depredation events, and a decrease in the number of fledged young.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Conservation Measures: Non-Federal Lands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and unintentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat (see 16 U.S.C. 1538(a)(1), 1532(1a) and 50 CFR 17.3). Section 10(a)(1)(B) authorizes the Service to issue permits for the taking of listed species incidental to otherwise lawful activities such as agriculture, sand and gravel mining, and urban development. Incidental take permits must be supported by a habitat conservation plan (HCP) that identifies conservation measures that the permittee agrees to implement to conserve the species, usually on the permittee's lands. A key element of the Service's review of an HCP is a determination of the plan's effect upon the long-term conservation of the species. The Service would approve an HCP, and issue a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit if the plan would minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking and would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of that species in the wild.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) is coordinating the development of HCPs for the San Diego River and Sweetwater River critical habitat areas. This effort also included the development of draft plans for the Santa Ana River and San Luis Rey River critical habitat areas, but these plans are no longer under consideration. The intent of these plans is to address land use conflicts and to conserve the vireo and its habitat. The Service will issue section 10(a)(1)(B) permits, if the HCPs are acceptable. In November 1991, the Service received two permit applications and final draft HCPs from SANDAG for the incidental take of vireos on the San Diego and Sweetwater Rivers. SANDAG is currently finalizing the HCPs and a draft Environmental Assessment is under preparation. Based on the review of drafts of these plans, the Service anticipates that they will be compatible with the designation of critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

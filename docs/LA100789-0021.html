			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'CAN'T AFFORD TO GROW OLD' TOPICAL AND UNSETTLING  </P> <P> Former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm says that the elderly are getting more than  their fair share of the nation's resources, while children are going to bed  hungry.  </P> <P> Policy analyst Peter Ferrara says that public-home health care for seniors  would cause families to "shirk responsibilities" and want government-paid  "maids and cooks."  </P> <P> Seventy-two-year-old, disabled Helen has enough savings to live in her small  apartment for 10 more months. When she is officially impoverished, Medicaid  will support her in a nursing home. She will lose her beloved pets, her privacy  and her independence. "When you outlive your money," she says, "you're  nothing."  </P> <P> Helen, Lamm and Ferrara appear on tonight's PBS documentary "Can't Afford to  Grow Old" (7 p.m. on Channel 28). In light of the devisiveness spurred by the  Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988, which the House of Representatives  voted to repeal Wednesday, this is one unsettling hour.  </P> <P> Hosted by Walter Cronkite and written, produced and directed by Roger Weisburg,  the program inexorably addresses the aging of America through real people  facing hard choices. We see a few of the millions of elderly coping alone or  cared for by relatives whose own physical, financial and emotional resources  are desperately strained. We hear arguments from those who feel that there  should be no public, long-term, home health care plan. As is obviously  intended, the dichotomy is shocking.  </P> <P> By the middle of the next century, 22% of us will be elderly. Estimates are  that our long-term care needs will triple; costs will increase 10-fold.  </P> <P> An innovative Medicaid plan in Oregon has reduced its nursing home population  by 33% (to the dismay of the nation's nursing home network), providing foster  home and other alternative care.  </P> <P> This has saved the state's taxpayers millions of dollars, we're told. If human  dignity is hard to quantify, money isn't. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

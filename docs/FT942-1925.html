			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Railtrack takes the route to modernisation: Robert Taylor on the radical reforms which would end archaic practices for signalling staff Railtrack's offer to modernise the pay and practices of its 4,600 signalling staff provides an indictment of the obsolete industrial-relations culture it inherited less than two months ago from British Rail. 'We cannot continue with an outdated structure which is inefficient, costly and denies our employees the opportunities of a varied and rewarding career,' Mr Bob Horton, company chairman, said yesterday. 'I believe the union agrees with us on this.' Details of the offer released by Railtrack yesterday illustrate archaic labour practices that should have been negotiated away a long time ago. Railtrack wants to negotiate change with the RMT rail union on a tight timetable, with a settlement by October 1. What is proposed amounts to a radical reform that will increase take-home pay for about three-quarters of the company's signalling staff - although the rest would see no benefit. Railtrack proposes to remove obstacles to promotion and job changes in signalling grades. In future existing signalling staff, other employees or external applicants 'deemed suitable by local management' would be able to apply for any signalling vacancy. This proposal is intended to end the regional boundaries which, for example, prevent a signal operator at London's Kings Cross station applying for a job at Euston station, a few hundred yards away. The company proposes an annual career development review; extra pay for employees who carry out training; and a job-evaluation system that 'properly rewards increased responsibility'. It also proposes a higher basic rate of pay to subsume a range of allowances introduced piecemeal over the years - including one for using closed-circuit television; another for working in isolated areas, and others for working irregular and unsocial hours. Railtrack points out that sick pay and pensions, which are calculated on basic pay, would be improved. The company also wants to simplify the pay structure. At present, signalling staff have widely differing pay levels, including three kinds of shift allowance. Railtrack proposes that signal-staff pay would consist of three elements: a basic rate, a shift premium of up to 20 per cent of the basic rate, and an 'additional-time payment' of up to 30 per cent of basic to replace overtime. Signalling grades would be paid monthly by credit transfer. A quarter of staff are still paid weekly in cash, with security vans delivering wage packets to the signal boxes. Flexible rostering would replace the present fixed hours of work, giving management 'freedom to roster turns of duty up to a 12-hour maximum limit'. Sunday would be treated as part of the normal working week. Signalling staff would be asked to do a range of tasks, which could include controlling electronic control centres; dealing with equipment failures; cleaning signal boxes; using portable data terminals; and operating passenger information systems. A computerised system would replace the ledgers in which signal staff now write all train movements. Railtrack estimates these changes would generate Pounds 4.3m in savings, raising the basic pay of signalling staff by at least 16 per cent and giving 75 per cent of signal staff higher take-home pay. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, accused Railtrack of offering a 'pig in a poke' with the 'uncertainties of job evaluation'. The union's negotiators believe average earnings 'on Railtrack's own figures' would bring a pay rise of only Pounds 4 a week. The union insists that it is not its fault that the grievances of the signalling staff had not been dealt with before. 'We have struggled to negotiate a deal for them for weeks - if not years,' said Mr Knapp. Both sides accept that the signalling staff have been a badly neglected and uncomplaining group in the railway network. But the union is insisting on an 'up-front' payment for past productivity improvements, while Railtrack says the only pay increases available are those on offer under its reform plans. Mr Knapp said: 'The company appears to be negotiating on the basis that the industrial world began on April 1 when the government gave birth to them.' Rail travellers, business customers and Railtrack are now having to pay for past neglect by a union that should have pressed the cause of signalling staff more resolutely years ago, and by British Rail, which was too timid to press for long-needed change in the way the signal staff work.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLUES HEAVEN;  </P> <P> JOHN LEE HOOKER WINNING NEW ACCLAIM AT 73  </P> <P> As far as John Lee Hooker is concerned, the blues wasn't born in the  Mississippi Delta. He dates blues back further than that -- to the Garden of  Eden.  </P> <P> "When the world was born, the blues was born," he says. "There wasn't no  problem till God put man and woman together. Then started love and heartache.  It turned into blues."  </P> <P> The 73-year-old singer, guitarist and songwriter had a hit with his first  record, "Boogie Chillen," in 1948. Since then, he's been up and he's been down,  opened for the Rolling Stones on one tour, paid a lot of dues. His latest  record, "The Healer," has brought him more attention than any record he's ever  had.  </P> <P> He was recently honored at a concert in Madison Square Garden, and talked about  the tribute a few days before.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to be here and alive," he said. "I'm just proud and I'm overjoyed  that the people are doing this for me. It's a long time coming but it got here.  </P> <P> "I paid so many dues. I've laid the path for so many other musicians to follow  my footsteps. I'm proud of that."  </P> <P> The concert was a benefit for the 12-year-old Delta Blues Museum in Hooker's  birthplace, Clarksdale, Miss.  </P> <P> A duet by Hooker and Bonnie Raitt, "I'm in the Mood," won a Grammy Award this  year. A single now is out, "Baby Lee," by Hooker and Robert Cray. Raitt and  Cray are on Hooker's "The Healer." So are Carlos Santana, Charlie Musselwhite,  Los Lobos, Canned Heat and George Thorogood.  </P> <P> "They wanted to do it because of the respect they had for me," Hooker said.  "They didn't need the money. It's brought more attention to me than any album  ever."  </P> <P> Hooker estimates that he has made between 65 and 70 albums, and wrote or  co-wrote all the songs on "The Healer."  </P> <P> About the title:  </P> <P> "The blues is a healer. It's got a meaning to it. You do things in your  lifetime -- at the time you did it you really wanted to do it. In the end  sometimes you see it wasn't good for you and you say, 'It served me right to  suffer.' People hear that and say, 'Oh, that's a true lyric,' and feel better."  </P> <P> Hooker lives in Vallejo, Calif., and tours two to four months a year.  </P> <P> "I love to go in small nightclubs, dirt on the floor or peanuts, people  drinking at the bar, not dressed up. They're shocked, thinking I shouldn't be  in the funky little place with them. They're the ones put me where I am. Rich  men don't buy records. They ain't got the time. Poor people are the ones that  support you. They work, buy your records, come out and see you when you got a  concert."  </P></p>

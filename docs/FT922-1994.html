			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Chips go down in electronics THIS HAS been a troubling week in Europe's electronics industry. A surprise profits warning from Philips of the Netherlands, which had been recovering from its financial crisis of two years ago, was followed yesterday by confirmation that Siemens of Germany is sharply scaling back its commitment to memory chips, of which it is the leading European-owned producer. These developments raise fresh doubts about the prospects for European-owned companies in a sector where, despite extensive government support, they have struggled to survive. But their plight needs to be seen in the perspective of recent upheavals, which have also scarred electronics producers in the US and Japan. The problems are more than cyclical: they stem from structural changes in the industry. The worst mistake EC policymakers could make would be to respond by plying Europe's electronics industry with still further subsidies and trade protection. Excessive reliance on such favours contributed largely to Philips' past difficulties by insulating it from commercial realities. Rather, policy should focus on removing the remaining barriers to free competition in Europe. The most obvious barrier is the long-standing 14 per cent EC tariff on semiconductor imports. This has failed to encourage a strong home-grown semiconductor industry, while piling unnecessary costs on European chip purchasers. There is also something badly wrong with a European market in which the prices of many computer and consumer electronics products remain far above US levels. The price discrepancy, which penalises every European information technology user, calls for thorough investigation by EC competition authorities. Changing dynamics These distortions have been encouraged by myopic European industrial policies which have ignored the changing dynamics of electronics markets. At its most absurd, the approach is summed up in the recent assertion by an industry lobbyist that 'without semiconductors, Europe has no industrial future'. Rarely has special pleading contained so many half-truths and non sequiturs. Europe is in no danger of being starved of semiconductors. The world market is awash with the devices, and every boom in demand stimulates costly investments in new capacity. Many are sited in the EC, where US- and Japanese-owned chip plants are proliferating - often generously assisted by local taxpayers. Furthermore, actual chip production accounts for a diminishing share of the margin and value-added in the industry, which must increasingly be sought in the products and systems that use chips. Commercial success State-of-the-art component technology remains an important driver of innovation in the whole electronics industry. But its possession is no longer a guarantee of commercial success. At the same time, such success is possible for firms that exploit the fruits of others' technological advances. Speedier technological diffusion and plummeting hardware prices have conspired to erode the innovator's advantage, turning innovations rapidly into commodities. Only by successfully differentiating final products can companies hope to prosper long-term. That calls for much more emphasis on marketing, a function most electronics producers have largely ignored. Even the once-mighty IBM has been revealed as deficient: until recently, it did not even know the true costs of its sales force. The industry has much to learn from marketing-intensive low-technology business-es, such as soap and cornflakes. But productive marketing also requires a demanding market. Europe's biggest weakness in electronics is a lack of the demand pull provided in the US and Japan by well-informed customers hungry for new and cost-effective products. The solution is not dirigisme, the mistake EC bureaucrats are making in high definition television (HDTV), by yoking manufacturers and broadcasters into support of probably obsolete home-grown technology. It can only be achieved by making markets operate more efficiently. That is a goal worth pursuing for its own sake. It also offers Europe's electronics industry its best long-term chance of survival.</p>

Feeling uneasy about the statement, he dared to charge the  DPRK with its "threat to the United States" and "menace to South  Korea," the analyst says, and continues:    This is a preposterous sophism reminding us of a thief  crying  "stop thief!"    Who really resorts to threat and menace and who is subjected  to them on the Korean peninsula?    It is the United States that has thrown off the promise it  had made at DPRK-U.S. contacts like a pair of old shoes and  urged the DPRK to accept the demand for an overall inspection  raised by the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, which is tantamount to its return to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, while pressing ultimatum-style demand  to the DPRK, threatening it with "sanctions" after setting a  deadline.    No matter how loudly those who are trying to threaten and  overpower the DPRK with strength may charge it with "threat" and  "menace," nobody will be deceived by them.    The "minister of the unification board" might have been  bribed by the United States, the master of the South Korean  puppets. But his sophistry has sparked off the anger of the  Korean nation.    The South Korean people hit the nail on the head when they  labeled the South Korean "unification board" as a "board of  division and confrontation." If the puppets persistently seek  a nuclear war against the fellow countrymen in the North in  league with outside forces, letting loose belligerent outbursts  and playing with fire, while tailing behind the United States,  it would be none other than the provocateurs and warmaniacs who  would be burnt in the flame.    The puppets must clearly see the situation and stop running  riot.</p>

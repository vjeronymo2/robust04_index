			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA HILLS RUSHES PAST WOODBRIDGE, 29-0  </P> <P> Junior halfback MawanSaba led the running attack and the defense forced three  turnovers as Laguna Hills High School shut out Woodbridge, 29-0, in the Pacific  Coast League opener for both teams Friday at Mission Viejo High School.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills (3-3, 1-0) discovered early it could run on Woodbridge (2-4, 0-1).  Saba, who carried 27 times for 103 yards, scored on a two-yard run with 5  minutes 57 seconds left in the first quarter. Senior quarterback Mark Wells  passed to senior tight end AricRoman for the two-point conversion to make it  8-0.  </P> <P> While Saba did most of his damage inside, Wells broke loose outside, gaining 72  yards in six carries in the first half. He also scored on runs of one and 19  yards, as the Hawks led at halftime, 22-0.  </P> <P> "We've been running the ball a lot all year and I think we are becoming a good  running team, especially when our line gets off like it did tonight," Laguna  Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said.

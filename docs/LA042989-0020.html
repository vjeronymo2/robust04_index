			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: GETTING THERE THIS WAY  </P> <P> There is a man on the Westside everyone calls Short Cut Bernstein because he  never takes a direct route. Tell Bernie that all you want to do is walk one  block from 4th Street to 5th Street and he will know a shorter way to do it.  </P> <P> "All you have to do," he'll say, "is cut through the kitchen of Chin's Sezchwan  Restaurant, cross the parking lot, go down the alley and you're there. But  don't let Chin know you're just cutting through his place. Pretend you've  dropped by for lunch but suddenly remember something important you have to do  before you can enjoy his lovely food and you'll be back later. Then split  through the kitchen and you're on your way."  </P> <P> "What if it isn't the lunch hour," I say, "or if Chin's place is closed?"  </P> <P> "Then you can use the King Carpet Emporium," Bernie says, "but first you have  to browse a little through their sale carpetry and ask to use their restroom  and when you get down the hall . . ."  </P> <P> I would not write about Short Cut Bernstein today except that he is  representative of a Los Angeles subculture that has figured out how to get from  here to there when the freeways are in chaos and most of what we call the  surface streets are gridlocked.  </P> <P> It was only after writing about my inability to drive from Topanga to downtown  L.A. because of problems on both the Santa Monica and Ventura freeways that I  realized how many exponents of Bernie's philosophy exist.  </P> <P> I must have received 50 letters from people like Bernie telling me how I could  have done it without the use of freeways. One of the letter-writers said I  sounded like a damned fool and probably ought not to be going downtown in the  first place.  </P> <P> None of those who wrote, however, seemed to possess the short cut expertise on  a scale comparable to Bernie. He seems to know a short cut that connects any  two points in town, although I suspect much of it is instinct and not  knowledge. Otherwise he would have to spend every waking hour studying maps.  </P> <P> Let me offer a modest example of Bernie's almost uncanny abilities.  </P> <P> To begin with, Bernie owns a car that is in a state of disrepair at least 72%  of the time, so he telephones his friends to ask for rides. My turn came last  week. Bernie was stranded at the corner of Beverly Drive and Wilshire  Boulevard.  </P> <P> He called me downtown and asked if I would pick him up on the way home and  drive him to Topanga. I said sure and met him on the corner. As we headed south  on Beverly Drive, Bernie said, "I know a short cut."  </P> <P> I said, "I figured you probably did."  </P> <P> "Which way do you usually go?"  </P> <P> "I go to Pico," I said, "and turn right to Overland. At Overland, I turn left  and get on the Santa Monica Freeway westbound. If a motorcyclist without a  helmet hasn't smashed himself against a guard rail, I will traverse the freeway  to Pacific Coast Highway and turn right on Topanga Canyon Boulevard."  </P> <P> "That's crazy," Bernie said. "Pico is a mess and Overland is worst. Keep going  straight on Beverly."  </P> <P> I followed his advice out of curiosity and began an odyssey on the most  circuitous route I have ever taken to achieve a destination. It wound and  twisted through Beverly Hills and Rancho Park on streets named Beverwill and  Castle Heights and McConnell and Club and Motor and Wala Vista and other  streets I cannot remember.  </P> <P> "Swear you'll never reveal the exact short cut," Bernie said. "It'll ruin it  for the rest of us."  </P> <P> "I swear."  </P> <P> Eventually we ended up westbound on the Santa Monica Freeway but Bernie said it  would be crazy to go all the way through McClarren Tunnel to Pacific Coast  Highway. "That's for real jerkholes," was the way Bernie put it.  </P> <P> He had me get off at Lincoln, cut over to 7th and follow it past San Vicente to  a street called Entrada, where we twisted down to West Channel and then PCH,  which was also crowded.  </P> <P> "Now what," I asked, "into the ocean?"  </P> <P> For a moment I thought he was going to say yes.  </P> <P> "What you can do to avoid this mess," he said after a long moment of silence,  "is to take a long cut."  </P> <P> "A long cut?"  </P> <P> "There's less stress to simply driving than to waiting in traffic. You go up  Chautauqua to Sunset and then down Sunset to . . ."  </P> <P> I am not in the market for long cuts so I just stayed on PCH and eventually we  got home, although Bernie sulked the rest of the way. He was angry because I  ignored his advice. I would have told him to go straight to hell but Bernie  never goes straight to anything. There's a short cut to that too.  </P></p>

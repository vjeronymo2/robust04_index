She said this at the joint press conference held here at  noon  today by her and Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner of the European  Commission in charge of external economic relations and trade  policy, upon the conclusion of the 13th meeting of the China-EC  joint committee this morning.    The two sides conducted a broad discussion on China-EC  relations at the meeting.    "Brittan and I briefed each other on the economic situations  in the European Community and China, and exchanged views on  China-EC cooperation frankly," Wu said.    "Talks have been held on the problems existing in bilateral  trade and economic relations and the ways to solve them, and  consensus has been reached in many aspects concerned."    It is said that the two parties agreed that all efforts  should be made to promote a more balanced development of  bilateral trade.    They decided that the working group on economic and trade  matters, after the first meeting last year, will hold its second  meeting in Brussels in June 1994, with specific sectoral  discussions on agriculture, intellectual property and financial  services.    The two sides also decided to hold an industrial cooperation  meeting in the non-ferrous metal sector, to launch technical  discussions on the alcoholic beverage sector and to organize an  information seminar on anti-dumping in China.    The EC side welcomed continuation in China's reform of its  economic and trade system and expansion of opening-up.    The joint committee reaffirmed that both parties will  continue to apply the principle of non-discrimination.    The committee was satisfied with bilateral cooperation in  such areas as the environment, industry and training of Chinese  experts concerning trade policy, economics, law, management and  telecommunications.    Besides, a working group on environmental cooperation is to  be set up to analyze Chinese environmental problems and needs as  well as to propose and coordinate concrete China-EC cooperative  activities in this field.    Both parties underlined their wish to step up business  cooperation to increase direct contacts between enterprises  leading to more investment and other forms of industrial and  trade cooperation.    A memorandum between China and the European Commission was  signed on the establishment of the China-Europe international  business school.    This afternoon, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Sir  Leon Brittan and his party, and they exchanged views on issues  of common concern.</p>

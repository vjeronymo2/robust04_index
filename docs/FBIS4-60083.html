			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 20, IRNA -- Britain's soured diplomatic  relations with Iran has continued to have repercussions on trade  between the two countries, which has fallen by 30 percent during  the first quarter of 1994 compared with the same period last  year. The latest official figures show the UK's total trade  with Iran in March was only pnds 54 million, a third down on the  corresponding month in 1993. Predictions are that the amount  could slump even further following the discovery of a bug in  Iran's London Embassy.    Most of the drop in business between the two countries is  due  to Tehran buying only pnds 32 m worth of goods from Britain  during March, 40 percent less than last year. Iran's exports  for the month, although pnds 4 m down, were actually the highest  since May 1993.    London's relations with Iran have been sour since the  Islamic  revolution in 1979, and trade has remained at only a fraction of  what was Britain's largest market in the Middle East.    In 1989, ties were finally severed by Tehran following the  worldwide controversy over the publication of Salman Rushdie's  blasphemous book, `The Satanic Verses,' and were not renewed  until the British Government clarified its position on the issue.    Subsequent expectations of relations to reach ambassadorial  level have not since been fulfilled and instead, there has been  renewed concern that Iran's Majles may again be led to break  ties, unless the matter of bugging of Tehran's London mission is  resolved.</p>

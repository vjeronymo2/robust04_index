			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 30 Mar (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina disclosed today that a large number of the  invitations to the approaching meeting with representatives of  the exiled community have already been answered favorably, which  guarantees the meeting's success.    During an encounter with national and international media,  Robaina said that even though political affiliations are not  expected to dominate the meeting, scheduled to take place at the  end of April, "there will be lots of color" in its composition.    The foreign relations minister explained that issues to be  analyzed jointly with the emigres evolve solely around  immigration matters, but the meeting is a door that is being  opened and a bridge leading to future meetings.    He immediately rejected the possibility that the meeting  could be negatively affected by positions adopted by those  groups headquartered in the United States, which he described as  hysterical. Robaina pointed out that the gathering constitutes  a meeting between those Cubans of goodwill living overseas and  those living on the island.    In another part of his statements, he referred to relations  with the United States, explaining that Cuba is always willing  to accept any economic arrangements provided Washington does not  attach any preconditions.    Robaina explained: We maintain excellent economic ties with  numerous countries that have political systems different from  our own. Regarding the United States, we do not want to have  such abysmal differences exist as a result of an obstinate  attitude that has not changed, except for the dropping of the  aggressive language used in the past.    The foreign minister also criticized the U.S. decision to  exclude Cuba from the so-called continental summit to take place  in Miami at the end of this year.    We must evaluate the real intentions behind this type of  meeting, Robaina stated, and if it is in any way related to  interest in isolating a country that in no way accepts  conditions.    The Cuban foreign minister also expressed satisfaction with  the results of his recent trip to several Asian nations and  indicated that he was able to determine these nations' interest  in Cuba's sugar, education, and public health experiences.    He added that the nations visited expressed interest in  investing in areas such as crude oil, nickel, textile industry,  and much more.    Robaina confirmed that on Monday he will be heading to South  America in answer to invitations from the Governments of  Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, as well as an unofficial  visit to Paraguay.</p>

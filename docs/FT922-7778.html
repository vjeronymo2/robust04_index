			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Unilever up to expectations but shares marked down 17p UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, met market expectations with a 5 per cent increase in first quarter profits, from Pounds 358m to Pounds 377m. However, signs that the economic slowdown was hitting European sales volumes affected sentiment and the group's shares fell 17p to close at 932p. Overall operating profit declined 2 per cent to Pounds 404m (Pounds 412m) on turnover 3 per cent higher at Pounds 5.49bn (Pounds 5.35m). In Europe, operating profits dipped from Pounds 306m to Pounds 260m, as sales volume fell compared with a strong first quarter in 1991, particularly in Germany. The results were also affected by the disposal of the 4P packaging businesses. Margins in Europe came under pressure, dropping from 9.4 per cent to 8 per cent. Profits from North American operations rose from Pounds 10m to Pounds 17m, and in the rest of the world from Pounds 96m to Pounds 127m. 'An improved performance in North America was largely due to foods and personal products,' said Mr Michael Perry, chairman. 'Rest of the world increases in volume and profit were widespread, with a particularly good contribution from Latin America.' The results were helped by reduced interest charges. Payments in the quarter fell from Pounds 68m to Pounds 43m. Net profit increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 242m; earnings per share showed a rise to 13.09p (12.44p). See Lex</p>

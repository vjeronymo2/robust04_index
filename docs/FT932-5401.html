			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Newbridge Networks record NEWBRIDGE NETWORKS, an Ottawa-based data system equipment maker, posted record sales and profit for the year ended April 30. It attributed the rise mainly to large orders from international telephone companies, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Sales jumped 70 per cent to CDollars 307m (USDollars 241.7m), while profit advanced to CDollars 60m, or CDollars 1.63 a share, well ahead of the CDollars 9.7m, or 28 cents a share, reported a year earlier. Fourth-quarter profit rose to CDollars 25.5m, or 65 cents, compared with CDollars 4.7m, or 13 cents, a year earlier, on revenue of CDollars 100m, against CDollars 52m. Eight-year-old Newbridge, which specialises in multiplexers for data and computer networks, said its order book had risen steadily over eight consecutive quarters.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA LAWYERS ASK FOR WIDER USE OF 'PUBLIC INTEREST' LIBEL RULE  </P> <P> Lawyers for news organizations asked the state Supreme Court on Thursday for  new legal safeguards against libel suits over reports on matters of "public  interest."  </P> <P> The justices, in a far-reaching test of the competing rights of a free press  and protection of reputation, were asked to require private figures to show  that a newsworthy but false and defamatory report was made with knowing or  reckless disregard for the truth.  </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court has established that often hard-to-prove standard for  libel suits by public figures, such as government officials. But the high court  has left it to the states to set the standard for private individuals, or those  who have not sought public attention.  </P> <P> At present, 35 states allow private figures to win damages by merely showing  negligence -- or lack of reasonable care in publishing or broadcasting a news  report. Only two states -- Indiana and Colorado -- require them to show malice  or disregard for the truth.  </P> <P> News media attorneys told the justices Thursday that imposing the  harder-to-prove standard would encourage full and free discussion of matters of  public concern and lessen the intimidating burden of defending costly but  unwarranted libel suits.  </P> <P> "We're not asking for a license to be negligent," said Robert S. Warren, a Los  Angeles lawyer representing the McClatchy Newspapers, Times Mirror Co. and 17  other news organizations. "We think free speech about certain matters is so  important it should not be punished unless it is a knowing or reckless  falsehood."  </P> <P> However, an attorney for the plaintiff in the case before the court contended  that private figures -- with fewer resources and opportunities to combat false  reports -- should not have to meet the same rigorous constitutional standard  set for public figures.  </P> <P> The lawyer, Brenton A. Bleier of Sacramento, discounted any significant adverse  impact on a free press.  </P> <P> "The communications industry . . . is not easily intimidated," Bleier said. "I  can't believe that requiring the media to meet a standard of reasonable care  will have any effect on their future performance or existence."  </P> <P> The justices heard arguments in the first libel case to come before the court  since the departure of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other court  members defeated in the November, 1986, election.  </P> <P> The court, acting under newly adopted time limits for deciding cases, is to  issue a ruling within 90 days.  </P> <P> The case arose in 1984 when Sacramento television station KCRA, in a news  segment devoted to consumer affairs, aired complaints about allegedly "shoddy"  work by a local building contractor on a home undergoing renovation under a  federally funded program.  </P> <P> The contractor, Shirley Brown, brought suit against KCRA, saying that the  allegations were false and that the station ignored her requests for a  correction.  </P> <P> The suit was dismissed in Sacramento Superior Court on grounds that the  broadcasts were protected under state law because they involved an issue of  "public interest." A state Court of Appeal agreed such protection existed, but  said Brown could still take the case to trial to attempt to show the station  acted in reckless disregard for the truth.  </P> <P> In Thursday's hearing, the justices closely questioned Warren and L. Thomas  Wagner, a Sacramento attorney representing the station, about the difficulty of  defining reports of "public interest" and about the propriety of establishing  new safeguards for the news media at the expense of private individuals.  </P> <P> Justice Marcus M. Kaufman appeared skeptical about applying additional  protection simply because a news report involved a private figure who received  public funds or participated in a government program.  </P> <P> "I once had a federal VA loan," Kaufman remarked. "That would be pretty hard to  take."  </P> <P> Bleier, representing plaintiff Brown, argued that it would be too hard to  define which reports were of "public interest" and which were not. State libel  law, he said, should not be interpreted to grant such protection.  </P></p>

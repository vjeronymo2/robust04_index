			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komogo] </F>   [Text] Washington, 9 Feb -- The Clinton administration has  taken a tough stand on trade toward Japan by notifying the  Japanese Government that it will break off working-level  negotiations under the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks.  Because of disappointment over Japan's new package of stimulus  measures, which fell short of fulfilling the United States' high  hopes, the Clinton administration appears to have decided to  break off the working-level negotiations between bureaucrats of  the two countries and to look for political decisions from Prime  Minister Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Hata. The Clinton  administration has decided to do so because of the U.S.  Administration's long-held view that "if pressure is applied on  Japan, Japan yields to the United States' trade demands." This  is unfortunate for Japan. The Clinton administration has  decided to break off the working-level negotiations in defiance  of domestic criticism against it for being impatient for trade  results from the framework talks. Its decision can be termed a  dangerous gambit.    The administration's decision to break off the working-level  negotiations has been anticipated. In the working-level  negotiations on government procurement of telecommunications  equipment and medical instruments held on the morning of 8  February, before the Clinton administration notified the  Japanese Government [of the working-level talks' suspension],  the U.S. Trade Representative made an unprecedented demand that  "Japan increase its government procurement of foreign-made  telecommunications equipment and medical instruments by 25  percent every year" with the aim of having Japan reject this  demand. The Japanese delegation clearly viewed this demand as a  "U.S. proposal aimed at bringing an end to the working-level  negotiations."    A member of the U.S. delegation said that "Japan's new  package of stimulus measures" has prompted the Clinton  administration to break off the working-level negotiations. The  Japanese Government originally was supposed to decide to cut the  income tax for three years, but now it has decided to cut it for  only one year. In response, the Clinton administration has  expressed its dissatisfaction.    In cabinet-level negotiations, the U.S. side will try to  wring a commitment from the Japanese side under which Japan will  go along with the United States on numerical targets and will  cut its income tax for many more years. The Clinton  administration thinks that toward this end, it is wise to opt  for negotiations with Japan's foreign minister, who is  considered to be "close to the prime minister and able to make  decisions."</p>

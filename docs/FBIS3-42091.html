			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 3--The Government has set up a nodal  committee of secretaries, presided over by the Cabinet  Secretary, to study the structure of the proposed National  Authority being set up to meet obligations under the Chemical  Weapons Convention. Three groups have been set up under the  committee, of which one is headed by the Secretary, Chemicals  and Petrochemicals.    The Convention is to come into force in the beginning of  1995  with the international secretariat being established in the  Hague while each signatory nation is to set up a national  authority. A strong technical support structure required for  this in the shape of trained manpower and laboratory back up is  also being planned.    This was disclosed here today by the Minister of State for  Chemicals and Fertilizers, Mr Eduardo Faleiro, while addressing  the Parliamentary Consultative Committee attached to his  Ministry.    Mr. Faleiro told members that the National Authority will  collect, transmit and obtain data relating to chemicals  identified in the Convention. It will also oversee the need to  ensure that Indian production facilities do not get over-exposed  to international inspections of such facilities.    He felt this was most important since technology needed to  be  guarded and inspection should not become a means for obtaining  information which could allow for duplication of such technology  in other parts of the world.    Mr. Faleiro noted that the Convention is non-discriminatory  and non-confrontationist in its approach and seeks to eliminate  all chemical weapons within a fixed time frame. Chemicals which  come under schedule III, however, have a dual purpose as many of  them can be used for weapons but also have important benign uses  in production of pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Signatory  nations will not have any unfair intrusions into the way they  utilise these chemicals, apart from keeping a centrally  established nodal international secretariat informed about  production, storage and trade in such weapons.    The Government will work closely with the chemical industry  to finalise measures to implement the provisions of the  Convention. Interaction with industry has already begun as  several meetings have taken place between industry  representatives and the Department of Chemicals during which  implications of the Convention have been conveyed to them.    The Minister stressed that it was essential for the  Government and industry to work together to ensure that the  international secretariat is not able to build a case against  any production unit in the country. This was all the more  important since it is well established that we have no chemicals  weapons activity in the country.    He said the implications of the Chemical Weapons Convention  on the industry mainly relate to becoming more transparent in  its functioning and in reporting details of production and sale.</p>

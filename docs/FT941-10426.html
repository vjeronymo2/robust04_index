			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Active year for Australian broker High levels of stock market activity helped McIntosh Securities, Australia's only quoted stockbroking firm, to a ADollars 9.6m (USDollars 6.9m) profit after tax but before abnormals. McIntosh is the product of a merger with the Australian operations of Britain's Baring Securities. The figure compares with a loss of ADollars 3.1m in the same period of 1992. Operating revenues surged by 67 per cent to ADollars 58m. McIntosh said that, on a calendar year basis, 1993 was its most profitable trading period since 1989 - a result attributed partly to 'the buoyant trading conditions in the securities industry,' and partly to internal operational changes. The wave of new issues coming to the stock market also helped push up the results. An abnormal profit of ADollars 12.1m from the sale of Equinet alsohelped, leaving profits after tax and abnormals at ADollars 21.7m, compared with a loss of ADollars 4.34m a year ago.</p>

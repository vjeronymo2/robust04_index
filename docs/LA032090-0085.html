			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL: THE LOCKOUT AFTERMATH;  </P> <P> DODGERS;  </P> <P> FREEWAY SERIES IS DELAYED ONE WEEK  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who will open training camp at Vero Beach, Fla., today, will play  their first spring training game Monday against the Minnesota Twins in Orlando,  Fla.  </P> <P> And the Dodgers will face the Angels in the annual Freeway Series, only a week  later than originally scheduled.  </P> <P> Also, the Dodgers might open the season at Dodger Stadium with a day game  against the San Diego Padres on April 9, the same day the Angels open the  season at Anaheim against Seattle at 6 p.m.  </P> <P> April 9 is a scheduled day off for the Dodgers, with a three-game series with  the Padres to begin the next night in San Diego.  </P> <P> "We have to get word from the commissioner's office before we can do anything,"  Executive Vice President Fred Claire said Monday from Vero Beach. "We'll know  more tomorrow."  </P> <P> Claire also said that the exact dates of the Freeway Series are yet to be  determined. It could be Friday through Sunday, April 6-8, or Thursday through  Saturday, April 5-7.  </P> <P> "We have some details to work out," Claire said.  </P> <P> After the Dodgers play the Twins next Monday, they will play the Montreal Expos  on March 27 in Vero Beach and then the Atlanta Braves on March 28 in Vero.  </P> <P> The Dodgers are off on March 29, and spring training games after that will be  announced later.  </P> <P> Claire said that the team would like to stay in Vero Beach until April 5. "The  longer we can stay in Florida the better," Claire said.  </P> <P> Claire said he thinks a three-week spring training would be long enough for  position players, but probably not long enough for pitchers.  </P> <P> "Three weeks is workable," he said. "But for pitchers, it's a different story."  </P></p>

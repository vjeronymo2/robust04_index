			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Observer: Faith, hope, charity Celebrities rush in where Nato fears to tread. Well, not all of them perhaps. Alan Sealy, a British ex-marketing man who describes himself as an 'ordinary bloke', has managed to entice some stars to flock to Southwark Cathedral on January 18 to fund-raise for Bosnia. Sealy's ad hoc group Sarajevo Witness is staging what it calls a 'multi-faith event'. Southwark's Anglican bishop, Roy Williamson, will be joined by his Roman Catholic counterpart, Charles Henderson, along with Orthodox, Moslem and Jewish divines. But the real crowd-pullers will be actress Juliet Stevenson - reading from the diary of 11-year-old Zlata Filipovic, the so-called 'Anne Frank of Sarajevo' - and punk virtuoso violinist Nigel Kennedy. Lesser lights include Bosnian cellist Vedran Smailovic and television newsreader Zeinab Badawi. But one celebrity has had to pull out. Lieutenant Colonel Bob Stewart, the former commander of the Cheshire regiment with the UN in Bosnia, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss aid worker in Sarajevo caught the headlines, has said he can't make it after all.</p>

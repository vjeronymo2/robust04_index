			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Korolev: "The Prospect of International </F> Inspections on DPRK Nuclear Facilities" from the "Today's World"  program]    [Text] The final date -- 21 February -- when the DPRK has  to give a clear answer on allowing an international inspection  team to enter its nuclear facilities is approaching.    The problem lies in Washington's strict demand and the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] asking Pyongyang to  open the two facilities suspected of secretly developing nuclear  weapons.    The future of the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks depends on  the DPRK leaders' attitude toward this problem. Issues related  to normalizing the two countries relations should be discussed  in the talks.    Considering all the facts, it is of most concern that  Pyongyang positively resolve the issue for economic reasons.  Judging from the result of the past two rounds of talks, the  DPRK seems to be well prepared for IAEA inspections of all  nuclear facilities.    In the talks with the IAEA held in Vienna concerning the  dispute of the details of inspections, it was agreed that two  important facilities in the DPRK territory would not be taken  into account [kaman haji anta].    According to data in possession [kajigo innun charyo],  weapon  [word indistinct] needed for nuclear warheads could be produced  at these facilities. It is worrisome [pulan hada] how Pyongyang  will answer Washington and the IAEA.    It is clear that the situation in the region would be  aggravated if DPRK does not change its attitude on the nuclear  issue. This is because Washington, Tokyo, and some other  countries insist that a series of sanctions be imposed on the  DPRK. They could also bomb [pokkyok halsudo itta] the nuclear  facilities in the DPRK.    On the other hand, other countries oppose such hard-line  measures. Russia insists on the early resolution of the nuclear  weapons issue on the Korean peninsula, constructive dialogue  between parties concerned, and effective cooperation between the  DPRK and the IAEA.</p>

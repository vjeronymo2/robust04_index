			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: KIO faces further battle to pull out of Spain - The complications surrounding the Kuwaitis' shareholdings The messy withdrawal from Spain of the Kuwait Investment Office and its Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras, is being threatened with further complications as suspicions mount that the Kuwaitis may own much more of two key Torras affiliates than they have previously reported. The Spanish stock market commission (CNMV) is studying claims by the former KIO agent in Spain, Mr Javier de la Rosa - whom the current KIO management says is responsible for the collapse of its Dollars 4.4bn Spanish empire - that Torras owns up to 70 per cent of the Prima property group and not the 34 per cent it reports. Mr de la Rosa has also claimed the Kuwaitis own more than half of the failed chemicals group, Ercros. The KIO claims Torras has just 39 per cent of Ercros. In both cases, the claims concern old share support schemes in which Prima and Ercros shares were parked with Torras associates. Mr de la Rosa and some Madrid bankers claim these share packets were put back to Torras this year. Under Spanish takeover law, a company which holds more than 25 per cent of a subsidiary has to make a bid for the subsidiary if it increases its stake by more than 6 per cent in one year. Failure to mount the bid is illegal and is regarded as a 'serious' offence. CNMV officials are searching documents to recreate the rise of the KIO's Spanish empire since 1986 and its collapse of the past six months. Mainly, though, they are looking at Prima, which followed Torras into receivership this month. The KIO used to own most of Prima, separately from Torras. In 1990, when it decided to delist Torras from the Madrid stockmarket, shareholders were paid a mixture of cash and expensive Prima stock. But Torras was already borrowing against Prima and it was important to keep share values strong. So, to prevent them flowing back to the market, Torras set up a share support operation. On February 15 and 23 and on March 2 1990, Hammarstone, a company newly registered in the Netherlands and the Antilles, bought 1,226,325 Prima shares - about 12.45 per cent of the company. This was financed by a loan of Pta10.2bn (Dollars 89m) from Banque Paribas (Suisse), agreed on February 15. The shares, plus a cash deposit of Dollars 14m, guaranteed the loan. Grupo Torras also signed a 'put and call' contract with Paribas (Suisse), guaranteeing Paribas the right to sell to Torras at any time the Prima shares for the value of the loan to Hammarstone, plus Paribas' financing costs. The question is who owns Hammarstone. Mr Fouad Jaffar, general manager of the KIO in early 1990, says he was asked to act as a proxy head of Hammarstone. He says the company was set up, and is owned by, the KIO and Torras. In May of this year, the management of the KIO and Torras changed. Before this, though, two things had happened to the Hammarstone loan: it had been split between Paribas and Banco Santander and, shortly before the new management arrived at Torras their predecessors - possibly under bank pressure - supplemented the put and call agreements with direct Torras loan guarantees. In the rowing that has followed the change of management at Torras, most of the KIO's Spanish empire has collapsed. Certainly, fears that the KIO would stop supporting Prima destroyed any chance the KIO had of recouping its investment in the company. Prima stock dropped like a stone in June, prompting the banks to call in their loans to Hammarstone. Mr de la Rosa claims the KIO is leaving because it fears having to bid for more of Prima and Ercros, or face charges for not making a bid. New managers at the KIO deny this as they deny owning the Hammarstone stock. Nevertheless, on July 8 this year Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, the new Torras chief executive, wrote letters to Hammarstone in the Netherlands and the Antilles. He said Torras had been told Hammarstone had defaulted on repayment of its loans and that as guarantor it, Torras, had paid Santander Dollars 17.4m. On July 13, Mr al-Nouri wrote to Paribas (Suisse) in Geneva, acknowledging both the put and call option and an additional, direct, Torras guarantee of the Hammarstone loan, granted on May 22 this year and which Paribas executed on July 7. Mr Al-Nouri paid Paribas DM64.4m (Dollars 39.9m), according to his letter. As the guarantee had been paid, he said Torras regarded the put and call option as dead, but he then appears to have instructed Paribas what to do with the Prima stock. 'We hereby request and require you, as pledgee, until further notice, to hold the shares . . . strictly to our order.' Mr al-Nouri and the KIO were clearly in a most tricky position. They were keeping their distance from Hammarstone's asset (the Prima stock) by not openly acknowledging ownership - arguing they had merely acted as a guarantor - but appear to have been exercising control over the shares. Anyway, asks one Madrid banker: 'Why would anyone pay millions of dollars for something they do not own?' In its defence, Torras could challenge the legality of the original share support operation or argue that contracts with Hammarstone do not legally tie it to Torras. Also, it might argue it was controlling the shares to pursue a claim against Hammarstone. The latter might be hard to do with a straight face, though, as Hammarstone could only pay Torras back (for paying off the banks) with its Prima stock. Neither Mr al-Nouri nor his advisers were available to comment yesterday, but the financial community in Madrid is eagerly anticipating the fight Torras and KIO may have to put up to prove they are not the owners of Hammarstone and its Prima shares. Mr de la Rosa is at risk, too, if the authorities decide the original share support operations infringed market regulations. The CNMV is a short-staffed and rather ponderous young institution but is likely take an aggressive stance.</p>

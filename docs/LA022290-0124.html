			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE POUNDERS IS TAKEN OFF BUCKEY'S RETRIAL;  </P> <P> COURTS: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS PREJUDICED. BUT CONCERNS ABOUT  POST-TRIAL COMMENTS RESULT IN THE PLAN TO ASSIGN THE CASE TO A DIFFERENT JUDGE.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William R. Pounders, who presided over the  record-breaking McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, was barred Wednesday  from hearing the retrial of defendant Ray Buckey because of remarks the judge  made after Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted last  month of 52 counts.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Michael Hoff, who evaluated the defense's claim of bias,  said in a written recommendation that, although he found no evidence that  Pounders was prejudiced against Buckey or his lawyer, the case should be  reassigned to another judge to avoid potential conflicts of interest during  jury selection.  </P> <P> "Both the prosecution and the defense would want to know if a prospective juror  saw or heard any of the post-trial broadcasts that involved Judge Pounders and  if so, what effect, if any, that would have on the prospective juror's capacity  to be impartial," Hoff wrote.  </P> <P> "Judge Pounders may very well be forced into the position of ruling on a  challenge for cause by either the prosecution or defense and would, in effect,  be ruling on his own actions that were taken during the post-trial publicity."  </P> <P> Hoff did not specify what Pounders had said that might influence a potential  juror.  </P> <P> After Hoff's recommendation, Judge Gary Klausner, presiding judge of the  Superior Court's central criminal division, announced that he had decided to  assign to a different judge Buckey's March 9 retrial on the 13 counts on which  the earlier jury deadlocked. That choice will be announced Monday.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Danny Davis called the ruling "a good decision," and his  client agreed.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy with the ruling," said Buckey, 31, who is free on his own  recognizance. "It concerned me that he (Pounders) had gone public and made a  lot of statements people might misinterpret."  </P> <P> However, he added, "I thought there was justice in the first trial. . . . Now  we're going to go for justice again, for total acquittal, and put this thing to  rest finally."  </P> <P> District attorney's spokesperson Sandi Gibbons said the prosecution "respects  Judge Hoff's ruling. Our concern is to try to bring this case to trial as soon  as possible. We're ready to go."  </P> <P> The removal of Pounders could delay the start of the trial, depending on how  much preparation time the new judge feels is necessary.  </P> <P> Pounders said afterward that he felt both "relief that I'm finally free" to  channel his energies elsewhere, but also "disappointment" that he will not be  the judge to take the case to its conclusion.  </P> <P> He said he had appeared on at least 12 news programs after the verdicts because  he felt it was important to explain why the trial took nearly three years and  to defend the jury against public reaction.  </P> <P> Following the first trial, Pounders made himself available to the local and  national media and made the talk show circuit -- including "Nightline," "Oprah  Winfrey," "Geraldo," "The Today Show," and "Good Morning America."  </P> <P> The judge discussed the significance of videotaped interviews with the alleged  child victims that the jury, but not the public, saw, and the impact of earlier  interviews on the children's later trial testimony. He also talked repeatedly  about the system of justice as one "that is set up to allow guilty people to go  free" rather than to risk convicting the innocent.  </P> <P> But the judge maintained that, "I don't think anything I said would affect the  merits of the second trial and I didn't see any problem in selecting a second  jury."  </P> <P> However, Pounders said the stress and strain of the long trial had left him  exhausted. He said he broke a molar while clenching his teeth and often took  his frustrations out on his family, rather than allow them to surface in court.  </P> <P> "I was honestly afraid I wouldn't live through it," he said. "I never saw a  doctor. I didn't want to know. I had literally committed my life to the case."  </P> <P> Davis had alleged that Pounders had demonstrated bias during the trial, which  Pounders vehemently denied. The defense attorney cited the judge having called  him "an ass," his slashing of the defense witness roster, his exclusion of some  evidence, his refusal to pay all defense costs, and his vow to conclude the  trial "even if it's over your dead body" as evidence of prejudice.  </P> <P> But Pounders countered that the defense had consumed the majority of trial  time, and had submitted "excessive" or unauthorized claims for financial  reimbursement.  </P> <P> After reading written arguments from both sides, Hoff determined that "the  papers and videotape submitted by (the defense) and the gross allegations  contained therein did not cause me to find Judge Pounders was prejudiced  against Mr. Davis or Mr. Buckey in the trial that recently concluded. The 52  'not guilty' verdicts tend to support this view."  </P> <P> However, he added, while there was "a need to explain the court's function" to  "an irate community," and that "the judge did just that," such activities would  create a problem in jury selection for both the prosecution and the defense.  </P> <P> The tone of the first trial was frequently hostile and tense. But everyone was  smiling Wednesday when Davis and Buckey stopped by Pounders' courtroom. The  judge shook hands with them and wished Buckey "good luck."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NOT HAPPY TRAILS FOR BIKERS;  </P> <P> ECOLOGY: MOUNTAIN BIKES HAVE BEEN BANNED FROM THE SENSITIVE UPPER NEWPORT BAY  PRESERVE UNTIL SPECIFIC TRAILS CAN BE DESIGNATED FOR THEIR USE.  </P> <P> On a recent Saturday, county Park Ranger Nancy Bruland pointed to the dusty  bluffs rising above her in the Upper Newport Bay. Along with the established  hiking path winding horizontally up the hill, there was a number of deep, bumpy  ruts cutting their way down the ridge.  </P> <P> The ruts were largely made by mountain bikers and have been additionally eroded  by more bikers, hikers and the natural water runoff in the area. Since Bruland  took the job as sole county caretaker of the 115-acre Upper Newport Bay  regional park, which lies to the west of Jamboree Road and north of Back Bay  Drive, she has seen between five and seven mountain bikers each day on the  paths. Some of them, she said, are simply unconcerned about the damage that  they can do to park hills and the animal environments.  </P> <P> "Erosion is the biggest concern. When they blaze new trails, they wipe out the  vegetation," Bruland explained, adding that since she went to work at the park  late last year, several residents have told her how the number of bikers has  increased steadily over the last couple of years.  </P> <P> So, until specific trails are designated for mountain bike riders by the  county's General Park Development Plan, Bruland is prohibiting bicycles from  the park, leaving them the asphalt paths at road level for their racing and  riding.  </P> <P> Bruland is not the first to accuse some Orange County cyclists of riding  roughshod over the environment. Last fall, complaints from South Laguna  residents prompted county officials to abandon plans to run a bike path through  part of Aliso Canyon. And in Orange, bike riders were blamed for scaring horses  being ridden down a bridle path along the Santa Ana River.  </P> <P> Skip Lauderbaugh, a spokesman for the biking club, SHARE, expressed frustration  at the Newport Bay limitations, though he said he sympathizes with Bruland's  concern.  </P> <P> "I've lived down the street from the Back Bay for 30 years, and I've been  hiking back there since I was 6 years old," Lauderbaugh said. "Instead of  restricting access, they need to educate the people as to how sensitive an  environment it is."  </P> <P> Lauderbaugh maintains that people have been breaking new trails for as long as  he has lived near the park and says that since people come from all over the  county to the few parks that are open to mountain bikers, the trails that  remain open will have to tolerate a greater number of users.  </P> <P> But he and other members of SHARE agree that there has to be a greater  awareness of the environment among mountain bikers. The group has produced an  educational pamphlet instructing riders on biking etiquette, on the safe ways  to bike and the need to stay on the trail. Their group takes the stance that  all trail users in the park need to cooperate to keep the park safe for animals  and plants that live there.  </P> <P> Bruland is not just concerned about erosion and crushed vegetation but also  </P> <P> possible damage to the habitats of the burrowing owl and the light-footed  clapper rail. The clapper rail, a relatively uncommon bird, makes its nest in  the short brush of the west-bluff side of the park. Upper Newport Bay is the  home to about 70% of the birds.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of kids on BMX bikes, and they're cutting new trails and causing  erosion, and there's no doubt about it," said SHARE member Marcko Popovich,  but, he added, conscientious riders do not break new paths, speed or hog the  trails. In fact, Lauderbaugh added, "we're more critical of people riding that  way than others . . . and 90% of the riders are really safe people."  </P> <P> Lauderbaugh and Bruland agree that there has to be a recognized policy for  bikers and other trail users in the Upper Bay, where for years hikers,  horseback riders and cyclists have shared the road and paths. They, along with  other residents of the area and naturalists, are working to plan a safe course  for the park through the county's General Development Plan.  </P> <P> Part of the plan also needs to spell out enforcement of trail restrictions,  Bruland added. Despite vigilant patrols, and help from Fish and Game rangers  and local residents, some bike riders ignore the signs posted at entrances to  the facility. And once they are caught, Bruland doesn't have the authority to  issue citations -- though she can have the riders removed from the park by  police. In most cases, she said, she tries to explain to the riders the harm  that they can do to the park.  </P> <P> "It depends on how you approach them. . . . Sometimes they'll listen and pay  attention and sometimes they tell you to, frankly, mind your own business," she  said. "I have found that it's a real me-type of generation around here."  </P> <P> Though the blame does not entirely fall on the shoulders of mountain bikers,  Bruland feels that until a policy can be worked out that balances the need of  the bikers with the protection of the resources, no bikes should be allowed on  the dirt paths inside the park. Popovich agrees, though he hopes that with  speed limits and additional education for cyclists using the park, sufficient  trails can be maintained.  </P> <P> And SHARE also sponsors a program that helps revegetate land that has been  eroded by human activities by planting native plants and by shoring up eroding  bluffs. Members of the group have spoken with Bruland and are making plans for  future projects in the Bay area.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors is tentatively scheduled to approve the  temporary ban, along with a number of other interim park provisions, during its  Aug. 7 meeting. The General Development Plan for the park is due out within the  next two years, county officials said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RALLY: GANGS TOLD TO LEAVE;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS PULL TOGETHER TO SEND MESSAGE TO GANGS: 'GET OUT OF HERE'  </P> <P> You're in your back yard, and two armed teen-agers run by. Later that month,  you learn that two other youths were gunned down in the graffiti-lined alley  behind some nearby apartments. And those are just the latest signs that  gangsters have invaded your neighborhood.  </P> <P> Do you put your house up for sale or look for another apartment? Decide to  rename your community to disassociate it from the rest of Van Nuys? Cower  indoors and hope the gangbangers go away?  </P> <P> Not if you live near Victory Boulevard and Fulton Avenue.  </P> <P> About 100 residents from that area joined police and city officials Saturday  morning in an outdoor rally to encourage the community to drive gangs out by  constantly reporting their activities to police.  </P> <P> The rally was staged half a block from the site of a Sept. 23 shooting in the  alley behind the 13100 block of Victory Boulevard in which one man died and  another was wounded. A 17-year-old North Hollywood gang member is in jail  charged with murder and attempted murder.  </P> <P> "We're all afraid," said Wylie Gustafson, the resident who was standing in his  yard recently when armed youths ran by. "But we're not going to let fear rule  our decisions. We're going to let gang members know that they're not welcome in  this neighborhood."  </P> <P> The gathering in the front yard of a single-family house on Mary Ellen Avenue  was unusual because it drew Latino and white neighbors, apartment dwellers as  well as homeowners, alike.  </P> <P> Candace Campbell, president of the Tract 15105 Neighborhood Assn., which  organized the event, said the group distributed flyers in Spanish for the first  time since it was formed 10 years ago.  </P> <P> "They're just as fearful as us, and we can't do it without them," Campbell  said.  </P> <P> Officer Angel Lopez, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang  unit, translated into Spanish as police and a representative of Councilman Joel  Wachs' office encouraged residents to report all crimes -- even gatherings of  youths that violate the city's anti-loitering laws.  </P> <P> But Martha Rojas, who manages six apartment buildings in the 13000 block of  Victory Boulevard nearby, said she has called police about large gatherings,  and they have failed to show up.  </P> <P> Police Capt. Sidney Mills, head of the Van Nuys Division, said he would pay  personal attention to the area.  </P> <P> "I'm paid $90,000 a year to sit in a little office, and I've got all kinds of  time, so call me personally at 989-8332 to report a crime," Mills said. "If  you'll be our eyes and ears, even if it's anonymously, I promise you we can  maintain a high quality of life in this area."  </P> <P> Lopez said heightened scrutiny by residents would drive gang members away  rather than incite them.  </P> <P> "Something like this shows them that they're going to get a lot of attention,  and they don't like that," Lopez said, adding that gang members have drifted  into the area recently because their home turfs nearby are heavily policed.  "It's become hot at home for them, so they have some friends in the apartments  and start hanging out in the alleys out here."  </P> <P> Some Latino residents complained after the rally that Lopez did not speak  Spanish well enough to translate adequately. The language barrier somehow must  be overcome if the neighborhood is to successfully unite, they said. But the  rally was a significant first step.  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't want to get involved, because they're afraid, but if the  gangs see we're mad like this, they'll slack off," said resident Ruben  Rodriguez, 34.  </P></p>

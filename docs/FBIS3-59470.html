The data show that, as of yesterday, Croatia has used more  than 13 million kw per hour. The Slovene distribution system has  been recording "stolen" electricity. Each hour, day and night,  it has notified the Croats by fax that they have exceeded their  quota. So far over a hundred reminders have been sent. The  employees were unable to tell us what they plan to do if Croats  continue to violate the agreement. They are awaiting  instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Croatia  continues to import about 6 million kw per day from neighboring  countries.</p>

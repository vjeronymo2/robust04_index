			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Leading Article: A policy for dividends THE 1992 dividend declaration season was always going to be difficult for UK shareholders. Big names such as Vickers, Royal Insurance, Lonrho and Midland Bank have already reduced their payouts to shareholders, often sharply. But just as remarkable is the fact that the likes of Barclays Bank, Commercial Union and Rolls-Royce have maintained, or even slightly increased, their dividends even though they have had to dip substantially into reserves. Overall, the response of dividends to the recession has been slow. In 1991, dividends in aggregate increased by about 6 per cent while earnings fell by 10 per cent or more. As a result, average dividend cover has dropped to 1.8, which is significantly less than in the previous recession at the beginning of the 1980s. The risk is that British companies will struggle unduly to maintain their payments, in ways which cause permanent financial damage. It is different in most other countries: in Germany, for example, dividends are moved up and down with much greater flexibility, while in Japan the level of payout is far lower. There are several historical reasons for the propensity to pay high dividends in the UK. The imputation tax system introduced in the 1970s was designed to be neutral as between profit retention and distribution, eliminating the double taxation of dividends which still applies in the US. At the same time, persistent inflation has encouraged institutions and private investors alike to seek a high and rising income from equity portfolios, this being seen as safer than investing in fixed income bonds. New twist The increasing prominence of gross investors such as pension funds, and more recently private investors with personal equity plans, has added a new twist to this. Because such investors can claim back the 25 per cent tax on dividends, the overall tax borne by a company and its shareholders taken together in such cases is only 10 2/3 per cent on dividends compared with 33 per cent on retained profits. These sums do not make sense when dividends are uncovered and tax reserves have run out. But there is strong pressure on companies to keep paying out as long as possible, with the assurance that they will be able to call on shareholders later through rights issues to repair any damage to their balance sheets. Last week, Rolls-Royce justified its decision to maintain the dividend by saying it reflected the long-term view that it took of its business. But this is not the traditional view of equity finance. The theory has been that shareholders accept much of the risk that supports the ability of companies to operate in volatile markets. If companies bear the risk themselves, and are prevailed upon to keep paying out unchanged dividends even in a recession, then the actual businesses may be endangered. Short cycle Within a short business cycle this may not matter very much. A profits recovery will soon restore the financial balance of a company. But the fear must be that in an extended downturn lasting several years, the adjustment of dividends to financial reality might be dangerously slow. In the longer term, the structure of corporation tax may need to be re-examined, if it seems that far from being neutral, it involves a bias towards distribution. In an increasingly international market place, it would be unfortunate for British companies to suffer calls on their cash flow that do not exist in major competitor countries. For the time being, public companies in the UK must keep their dividend policies under close review. It would make sense for them to develop and publicise long-term dividend policies which would be applied during the recovery as well as the downturn. All too often, dividends have appeared to be decided in an obscure way, largely on the passive basis of market expectations. It is about time that companies, albeit after discussions with their shareholders, took their own individual decisions about dividends.</p>

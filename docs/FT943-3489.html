			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Tory grassroots to press Clarke for tax cuts Rightwing Conservative MPs yesterday warned the chancellor that grassroots members of the party wanted tax cuts soon, as Mr John Maples, party vice-chairman, stressed that the Treasury had only ruled them out this year. Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, said he thought there would be room for tax cuts before the general election but also predicted further rises in interest rates. After the decision by the Treasury to rule out tax cuts this year Mr David Shaw, vice-chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said a number of his colleagues would be pressing the case for small reductions in taxation. He said: 'It should be fairly evident to government ministers and those in parliament that the party out there, as well as people in the country at large, want to see some sort of down-payment on tax cuts and want them to start soon.' Another rightwing backbencher said: 'Mr Kenneth Clarke (the chancellor) would do well to think again. We need tax cuts now.' While the chancellor remains confident that he will be able to face down any protests from the right over his decision not to reduce taxes, senior backbenchers made it clear that the party would expect them to follow a period of sustained growth. Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said: 'We have to get public expenditure under control first, which will lead to a period of sustained growth. 'Then we will be in a strong position to cut taxes.' Mr Lamont said: 'I think there will be room, given the improvement in our finances, before the next election for some modest tax cuts.' The chancellor had 'skilfully lowered expectations' by correctly indicating that those cuts would not come this year. He added: 'He has very wisely taken a medium-term view and taken steps that will place the Conservative party in a very strong position in two years' time.' He urged backbench critics of the chancellor's stance to keep their nerve and said the government's willingness to control inflation would enhance its credibility. Mr Lamont also predicted further interest rate rises - only 24 hours after the Treasury announced a 0.5 per cent increase. He told the BBC that he expected to see rates 'edging up' towards 7 per cent in the next year. His prediction is at odds with the comments of Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, who said he hoped there would be no further increases in the cost of borrowing.</p>

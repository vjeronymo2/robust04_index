			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Canadian markets rise after Quebec election: PQ may face uphill battle gaining a majority in a promised referendum Canada's financial markets rose sharply yesterday as investors took heart from the separatist Parti Quebecois' unexpectedly narrow victory in Monday's elections in Quebec. Although the PQ won 77 of the 125 seats in the National Assembly, it gained only 44.7 per cent of the popular vote, compared with 44.3 per cent for the outgoing Liberals. Bond and currency markets were buoyed by pointers that many Quebeckers voted on Monday for a change in government rather than for independence, and that the PQ may have an uphill battle gaining a majority in a promised referendum to decide whether the predominantly French-speaking province should remain part of Canada. Recent opinion polls show that nearly 60 per cent of Quebeckers oppose outright independence. However, the PQ's leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, reiterated his determination to press ahead with a referendum in 1995. Political observers and economic analysts cautioned that the referendum was likely to be preceded by a divisive campaign in which the new separatist government in Quebec City will be well placed to push its case for independence. The PQ has pledged to push a formal declaration through the Quebec legislature expressing a desire to begin sovereignty negotiations with Ottawa. It will also set up a commission to draw up an independence constitution. In English-speaking Canada, Mr Bob Rae, premier of Ontario, urged Mr Parizeau to hold the referendum as soon as possible. 'A climate of uncertainty will not in any way contribute to economic growth and recovery.' The PQ, which previously held office from 1976 to 1985, failed to gain a mandate in a referendum 14 years ago to negotiate a loose form of sovereignty for Quebec. It has indicated that it plans to pursue its goal more vigorously and unambiguously in the coming referendum, although there are divisions in the party on the strategy to be followed. Mr Parizeau, a former economics professor who obtained his doctorate from the London School of Economics, told a victory rally in Quebec City that: 'in 1995, we will go before Quebeckers and ask them the question that will make a people into a country. We have begun a new chapter in our history.' But he also sounded a conciliatory note, pledging to work on improving the province's economy. By contrast, Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, expressed confidence that 'Quebeckers will once again demonstrate their profound attachment to being a full part of Canada.' The Bank of Canada intervened to slow the rising Canadian dollar, trading at 73.84 US cents at noon. The gap between the yield on long-term Quebec provincial bonds and government of Canada issues narrowed. Canada's commercial banks responded to improvements by cutting their prime lending rate from 7.25 per cent to 7 per cent. Polarisation after poll, Page 4 Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta 10 Jun -- Commenting on the additional  World Bank loan of U.S. $101.5 million to Indonesia, Saleh  Afiff, coordinating minister for economics, finance and  supervision of national development, told newsmen that Indonesia  still needs foreign aid to sustain its 6.2 percent economic  growth. However, the government's total foreign debt of U.S.  $93 billion has now reached a psychological level. In view of  that, Indonesia has to manage its foreign loans carefully.    The World Bank loan will be used as an additional fund to  upgrade 1,620 kilometers of road and maintain 6,000 kilometers  of roads in 27 districts.    Mr Saleh admits that to date, Indonesia's foreign debt has  almost reached a psychological level with the figure approaching  U.S. $100 billion. "The people will be shocked to hear that our  foreign debt has reached U.S. $100 billion. Likewise, if the  inflation rate is above 10 percent, the people will be  psychologically affected and will be worried", he said.    Even if it is so, the most important thing is to have the  ability and willingness to repay the foreign debt. Indonesia is  committed to debt repayment and will not ask for its  installments to be rescheduled.    After signing an agreement for an agricultural loan with the  International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), Finance  Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said there is no need to make a fuss  over the rise in foreign debt. This is because repayments are  not only being made by the government. Projects that utilize  the loans will also have to contribute to the repayments, which  is being done in installments. He explained that foreign loans  have been handed over to the government because the World Bank  only gives loans to a single borrower.    Continuing, Afiff said that there are three types of loans  being extended to the government. They are: soft loans payable  under a long-term period under the coordination of the CGI  [Consultative Group on Indonesia], export credit, and foreign  commercial loans (PKLN). "What we require is the soft loans,  considering that the conditions attached are not very strict,"  he added.    On the other hand, Indonesia has to be very careful about  its  foreign commercial loans, especially now that the total has  reached 40 percent out of the U.S. $93 billion debt. "We have  to act cautiously and not add to the huge amount of PKLN loans.  However, we still need such loans to ease the government's  burden of financing development projects," he said.    He said that the debt service ratio [three preceding words  in  English] (DSR) is the yardstick for measuring the safe limits of  a nation's foreign debt. Currently, the state's DSR, including  that of the private sector's has reached 30 percent.    Minister Afiff expressed the hope that the foreign  commercial  loans team will do a good job in preventing the private sector  from using the government's name to take advantage of the  foreign commercial loan facilities.    Responding to the World Bank's prediction that Indonesia's  economic growth during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan  [Repelita VI] will reach at least eight percent annually if  bureaucratic constraints on the economy are limited, Afiff said  that would be rather difficult. He said based on the present  conditions, it would be hard to achieve such high economic  growth.    "We will be satisfied if we achieve a 6.5 percent growth  under the Repelita VI. This exceeds the 6.2 percent target," he  said.    According to the coordinating minister, to achieve such high  economic growth, there must be efficiency in both the  bureaucracy as well as state-owned firms. As Indonesia's growth  is fragile, the economic machinery will overheat if growth is  rapid, he said. He added that the conditions that contribute to  an overheated economy are the oversupply of money, an increase  in the current account deficit, as well as other related factors.    He said the fragile economic growth is due to the decline in  the export on non-oil and non-gas commodities, the fluctuation  of oil prices, and also strong pressure from the foreign debt  problem. "If the government can control the macroeconomy, rapid  growth will not result in the overheating of the economy," he  said.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> JACKSON TO GRADS: SHUN DRUGS  </P> <P> The Rev. Jesse Jackson says the biggest threat to the younger generation is not  bigotry but weakness of character.  </P> <P> He urged his daughter's ninth-grade class to shun drugs and seek out challenges  to improve the world.  </P> <P> "What does it matter if you have this opportunity to lead us into the next  century and choose some flirtation or infatuation over using these precious  moments to improve your mind?" Jackson asked graduating Fay School students  Sunday.  </P> <P> "No, the great threat to your generation is not some ancient, archaic law,  denying you access and information based upon race or sex or religion, but  rather a challenge of character and the will to choose hope if you will over  dope."  </P> <P> Jackson waved his daughter's diploma in the air before handing it to her.  </P> <P> Jacqueline Lavinia Jackson was among 56 students who received diplomas from the  private school.  </P></p>

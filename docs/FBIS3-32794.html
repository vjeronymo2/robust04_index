			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on  Havana radio and television in Spanish between 8 and 11 February.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 8 February reports that a  miscellaneous crops plenum was held in Cienfuegos Province at  which it was announced that an additional 400 caballerias of  plantain are going to be planted in Cienfuegos Province, above  and beyond those under the current agricultural plan. Also, in  salute to 26 July, 42 organic plots are to be added to the  present 15.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 February reports that in 1993  Cuba received approximately $50 million in diverse donations --  mainly food, medicine, and school supplies -- channeled by the  Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [ICAP] from 72  countries. ICAP President Sergio Corrieri added that 11  international brigades visited Cuba in 1993, and 32 cultural  delegations traveled abroad.    Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 9 February reports that  the Faustino Vega rice mill in Manzanillo, Granma Province, has  fulfilled its 1993 goal by husking a total of 8,500 tons of  rice. This rice mill belongs to the Fernando Chenique Rice  Company, which must plant 2,000 caballerias of rice this year,  the largest number in the country. With an industrial  performance of 64 percent, the Faustino Vega rice mill is also  one of the best in this area.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 9 February reports that the  Antillana de Acero enterprise produced 8,000 tons of steel in  January. This year's plan per four-month period is 50,000 tons.    Radio Reloj at 1508 GMT on 9 February reports that Pinar del  Rio Province has approximately 170 caballerias of land planted  in miscellaneous crops, earmarked for use by schools. These are  self-sufficiency plots. In 1993, 62 percent of the schools'  needs in food were provided for by these plots. Over 64,000  quintals of miscellaneous food crops were produced in Pinar del  Rio Province in 1993. This year, the School of Medical Sciences  and other centers of higher learning will be given land to  cultivate for self-sufficiency.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 10 February reports that  Federico Ramon Puerta, governor of the Argentine province of  Misiones, announced a donation to Cuba of 28 tons of paper. He  announced this shortly before his departure for Argentina after  a visit to several Cuban provinces. He was accompanied by  Argentine Ambassador (Susana Sara Grane) [Diplomatic List shows  Adolfo Enrique Nanclares as Argentine ambassador to Cuba), and  Pedro Chavez, president of Havana's People's Government.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 10 February reports on an  "experiment" underway in the food industry in Sibanicu  Municipality, Camaguey Province, where workers are receiving a  portion of the profits from sales at all centers, in lieu of  salaries. "The worker earns according to his sales, receiving  some 20 or 30 percent of what he sells." Omar del Risco, the  local first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, explains  that a unit's administrator is authorized to negotiate and  purchase products from specific places and to manage the entire  supply process for the unit. The administrator also decides,  after consulting with the workers, how many workers should be  kept at a given unit. Del Risco notes that "by distributing 20  percent among the workers, the workers try to have as few  workers as possible. They do not keep anyone they do not need.  Since they are paid in profits, they try to reduce costs to a  minimum. They are tripling sales but lowering costs, and of  course, there is an improvement in income." Del Risco notes that  working for profit seems to motivate workers.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 February reports that at the  end of an extensive tour of San Cristobal Municipality  cane-growing areas, Fidel Ramos, first secretary of the  Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Pinar del Rio Province, has  issued a call to catch up and to increase both efficiency and  the amount of sugar produced during the current harvest.  Rebelde's correspondent notes that workers are working around  the clock at the 30 de Noviembre agroindustrial complex to get a  1,000-cubic-meter water tank operative again because problems  with it paralyzed the sugar mill's operations. Ramos also  inspected the Basic Cooperative Production Units' [UBPCs']  planting areas and a Youth Labor Army military grange. Along  with Jose Marrero Camacho, like Ramos a member of the PCC's  Central Committee and also president of the Provincial Assembly  of the People's Government in Pinar del Rio, Ramos participated  in a seminar for the economists of the 47 cane sector UBPC in  the province, as well as in an overall inspection of the sugar  harvest in Pinar del Rio.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 February reports that the  country's objective is to plant more than 18,000 caballerias of  sugarcane by the end of June 1994, the largest figure over the  past 13 years. Thus far, 61 percent of that program has already  been achieved. Havana and Cienfuegos Provinces are leading in  this planting program.    Rebelde adds that the Armed Forces will be in charge of  maintaining more than 11,000 light and heavy tractors, and more  than 11,000 previously inoperative light trucks, to participate  in this new Cuban agricultural project. The Armed Forces has the  most experience and best techniques for maintaining both Armed  Forces and agricultural equipment.    The same newscast reports that despite the economic crisis  affecting the country, there are and have always been the  fraternal hands of many governments and institutions supporting  our government. Such is the case with the Spanish Government,  which in 1993 alone contributed approximately $5 million worth  of donations. Spanish ambassador to Havana Jose Antonio San Gil  said his government hopes to maintain and further develop  cooperation with Cuba. In 1993, the Spanish Agency for  International Cooperation brought 337 tons of powdered milk for  children. Spain also contributed, with $550,000 worth of  medicine in 1993.</p>

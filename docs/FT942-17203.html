			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Eurotunnel settles TML dispute Eurotunnel, the company which will operate train services through the Channel tunnel, has settled a long-running dispute with the construction consortium, clearing the way for a rights issue of up to Pounds 750m. Eurotunnel said yesterday that it had agreed to pay an additional Pounds 70m-Pounds 85m to Transmanche Link (TML), the Anglo-French consortium. This brings the total it has paid TML to Pounds 1.14bn, nearly twice the Pounds 620m original contract price. The amount is, however, considerably less than the Pounds 1.95bn the contractors had been seeking. The ensuing Eurotunnel rights issue, planned for mid-May, may raise up to Pounds 750m, it emerged yesterday. It was originally intended to bring in Pounds 500m alongside a similar amount of debt. The agreement, reached on Friday, settles the final claim outstanding against Eurotunnel, although it still has a Pounds 1bn claim against the British and French railways. The settlement covers the tunnel's fixed equipment but not rolling stock deliveries. As part of the deal, TML has agreed, with the help of Swiss Bank Corporation, to underwrite Pounds 75m of shares. The size of the equity issue will depend on the extent of the delay in the opening of the tunnel; how much the banks will lend; and the exact payment made to the contractors, which is related to Eurotunnel's share price after the rights issue. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel co-chairman, described the deal as 'quite a victory' for the company's shareholders. Eurotunnel might have held out for a lower settlement 'but when you are coming up to a rights issue, a claim is worth avoiding'. Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac and leading UK negotiator on behalf of TML, said: 'No contractor wants to get paid five years after the traffic goes down the track. We have found a line down the middle which both sets of shareholders should be happy with.' Mr Simms said the impact of the deal on provisions made by the contractors would take more than a year to come through. No extra provisions would be needed. An executive at one of the French consortium members said: 'It had to be a compromise agreement, but we received most of what we asked for.' Eurotunnel will seek shareholders' approval to issue a further 150m shares in each of its French and British companies, in addition to the 192m already approved for each of them. Shareholders' meetings will be held on May 9 and 17. Sir Alastair said a full service would operate through the tunnel by 'September/Octoberish'. He estimated the cost of the delays at tens of millions of pounds a month, but less than the Pounds 50m a month which has been quoted, for a total over the summer of less than Pounds 100m. He described this as 'a large but not fundamental loss of revenue'. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (7): Peace dividend brings problems - Richard Evans investigates Plymouth's efforts to revitalise itself PLYMOUTH, a big industrial centre that would probably feel more at home in the Midlands or the industrial north. is an odd city to be in Devon. It has managed in the past to combine the demands of an important regional and industrial centre with one of the most enviable environments in Europe. The balance between the two faces of Plymouth has not always been easy to maintain, but it is becoming increasingly vital to do so. It offers a curious mix of engineering and high-tech industries - along with a flourishing tourist trade based on its spectacular history as the port from which the Pilgrim Fathers sailed to colonise the New World, and Sir Francis Drake set out to defeat the Armada after completing his leisurely game of bowls. Plymouth desperately needs new jobs for its growing numbers of unemployed. It needs also to attract trade, through continued growth of tourism. The city, which regards itself as the regional capital of the south-west, has been hit economically by a double blow. The recession has had as much impact as in other parts of the country; there have been closures and redundancies and a slow-down in inward investment. But in addition, Plymouth has been hit severely by the rundown in defence industries - the impact of the peace dividend. Plymouth's economy is still highly dependent on the naval dockyard at Devonport, the largest in Europe. Jobs in the dockyard have spiralled down from 13,000 to 5,000 in the last six years. It seems likely that they will fall further. Unemployment, approaching 14 per cent, puts Plymouth into the top 20 economic blackspots in the country, and it has the fastest growing jobless rate of any big UK city. However, there is now another black cloud hanging over the city: the indication is that vital nuclear submarine refit work is likely to be concentrated on a single site in future. Essentially this means that a choice will be made by the government in the next few weeks between Devonport and Rosyth in Scotland, the only other royal dock. Earlier this year the city council, local business leaders and DML (a private sector consortium put together by BICC, Weir Group and Brown &amp; Root, which has run the dockyard since 1987) launched a campaign to lobby the government on behalf of Plymouth. It warned that failure to secure the nuclear work for Devonport would result in the dockyard's eventual closure. This would mean a knock-on effect on the 15,000 defence related jobs throughout the area, which amount to 3 per cent of the total workforce. In addition, up to Pounds 1bn would be extracted from the local economy. DML has been trying to diversify by taking on work for British Rail and, among other projects, by refitting luxury yachts, but compared with refitting nuclear submarines at up to Pounds 100m a time, alternative work is small beer. The loss of the refit contract would be a body blow - particularly after the disappointment of failing to win the government's City Challenge competition earlier this year, when a series of ambitious projects to rejuvenate run-down waterfront areas were proposed. However, there is evidence that the launching of the City Challenge bid did a lot to draw the Labour-led city council, private sector businessmen and voluntary bodies together and the intention is to build on this new partnership. As a consolation prize, the government is to establish an Urban Development Corporation with a budget of Pounds 45m over five years to develop the Royal William Yard on Plymouth's waterfront, which is being handed over to the city by the Ministry of Defence as surplus to requirements. This new initiative is likely to be the catalyst for the redevelopment of large sections of the waterfront as part of a broadening of the local economy. It is particularly welcome, as the city has run out of development land, but there are problems. The magnificent dock buildings, built in 1825 to supply the fleet, are Grade I listed. Recent decades have brought neglect; their refurbishment will take a big slice of the available funds. Plans are being co-ordinated by the Groundwork Trust with the help of the city council and local businessmen. But access is difficult through the narrow streets, and it is unclear what will be the most effective use for the site. Some progress has been made in diversifying the economy. Among the most successful locally-based companies are Wrigley, the chewing gum manufacturer, which has defied the recession with successive production records; Toshiba, the television manufacturer, and Murata, the Japanese-owned high-tech producer of ceramic capacitors. The city is also trying to attract more service industry jobs - an area where it has been overshadowed by Exeter. It has built a Pounds 30m complex containing a concert hall, skating rink, 'tropical' swimming pool and conference facilities. The dual purpose of the Pavilions complex, the biggest capital project ever undertaken by the city council, is to bring in more business by promoting Plymouth as a regional conference and exhibitions centre, and to add to the city's all-year leisure facilities for tourists as well as residents. Much hangs on the imminent submarine refit decision, but the city is taking steps to minimise the impact of further losses in defence-linked industries. and to ensure that alternative employment is found.</p>

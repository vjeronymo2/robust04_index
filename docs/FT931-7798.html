			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Christopher's tour takes in Beirut THE US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, acknowledged Lebanon's improved political stability yesterday by including Beirut in his week-long tour of the Middle East. It was the first visit by a US secretary of state to Beirut for nearly a decade. Lebanon is part of the Middle East peace process launched in October 1991, and its refusal in December to accept 415 Palestinians deported by Israel underlined its new assertiveness. Mr Christopher may have been looking for Lebanese help in solving the problem of the deportees, and an assurance from Beirut that it is committed to a quick return to the negotiating table in the US. The secretary of state was welcomed by Mr Faris Bouez, the foreign minister, who accompanied him into the Ministry of Defence for talks with President Elias Hrawi and Mr Rafik al-Hariri, prime minister. Mr Christopher had flown from Cyprus to Beirut and was scheduled to complete his visit to the region with two days of talks in Jerusalem with Israelis and Palestinians. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said yesterday that Mr Christopher could agree a date for the resumption of peace negotiations during those talks. However, the Palestinians have said they will not attend while the fate of the deportees is unresolved.</p>

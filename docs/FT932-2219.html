			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / The Long View: Whales on the beach MANY YEARS ago I sat next to the boss of a now-forgotten mini-conglomerate who explained his business strategy: annual earnings per share had to be 20 per cent. His profit and loss account was designed from the bottom up, and enough deals had to be done to meet the target. As for the actual businesses which happened to be in his group, well, organic growth was a minor matter. More successful and durable conglomerates have not been run quite so crudely, but the whole idea of the conglomerate - an opportunistic selection of businesses under a corporate umbrella, fed with new acquisitions which can be knocked into more efficient shape - has been a curious product of Anglo-American stock market culture. There are plenty of diversified groups in other countries too, but they are usually interlocking networks built by banks or powerful families; they are rarely the creation of stock market-oriented entrepreneurs. The UK conglomerates reached a climax of frenzied dealing at the end of the 1980s, fuelled first by high share prices until the 1987 crash, and subsequently by seemingly unlimited access to bank finance. Now, however, they are withering, undermined by new accounting standards and priced out of the takeover game by the high stock market ratings being given to smaller companies. Even Lord Hanson has been forced to climb down after serious institutional opposition to some of his proposed changes to shareholder voting rights at an extraordinary meeting next week. Meanwhile, his group's profits have hardly grown since 1988. A bored Brian McGowan is retiring as chief executive of Williams Holdings, because he cannot see any scope for exciting acquisitions; the failure of its contested offer for Racal 18 months ago seems to have marked a watershed. A rival conglomerate, Tomkins, is struggling to maintain momentum after its takeover late last year of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the flour mill and bakery group. The deal was always daft in terms of industrial fit, and it is not clear whether it will now make sense in terms of financial engineering. Until only a few years ago the corporate finance departments of investment banks prospered by arranging takeover deals for conglomerates - the more contested and controversial, the bigger the fees. Now the investment bankers are having to scratch around instead with breakups - such as the Zeneca split from ICI and, across the Atlantic, this week's plan by Kodak to spin off its Eastman chemicals division. It has taken 25 years of expensive experience to persuade investors of the hazards of takeovers. Over the years many academic studies have indicated that there are few if any long-term benefits for shareholders, certainly not for investors in the acquiring companies, which typically pay over the odds. In their heyday, however, conglomerates carried a premium rating. It meant they could issue paper on a high p/e ratio to buy companies on a low p/e ratio. Earnings growth was self-sustaining until the ever-growing accumulation of companies became unmanageable. The best conglomerates, such as BTR and Hanson, avoided biting off more than they could chew, but size was nonetheless a limiting factor. Later, conglomerates exploited accountancy loopholes on an increasing scale to create smooth earnings growth histories, contrasting with the ups and downs of more specialised companies lowly ranked as 'cyclicals'. They learned how to exploit pension fund surpluses. Finally, companies like Hanson realised that UK institutional investors craved income growth, so a healthy progression of dividends was created. But the game is up. The tidal wave of accountancy manipulations in the late 1980s, leading to a number of unsignalled corporate collapses, forced the accountants to clean up their act. The basic credibility of takeovers has been undermined, now that investors accept that they cannot generate instant returns. The Goode Committee, meanwhile, is considering how to tighten the law governing pension funds. The investment strategies of big institutional investors have changed in important ways, too. Portfolios are managed much more on the basis of specialised stock market sectors, with weightings carefully monitored and controlled. Fund managers prefer to invest in focused companies - ICI in chemicals, for instance, and Zeneca in health and household - rather than in conglomerates that straddle awkwardly across several sectors. For a surprisingly long time, fund managers seemed to be prepared to subcontract their industrial diversification strategy to conglomerate bosses. But that has all changed. Today the average Footsie 100 company sells on a p/e ratio of 21 times 1992 earnings, and the average small company p/e is more like 30. This leaves the conglomerates, which on average have a p/e of 15, beached like whales. Their geographical orientation is also a problem. Outside the UK they have only found it possible to pursue takeover strategies in the US, whereas British fund managers at present tend to seek exposure to Continental Europe and the Far East. These value relationships reflect the peculiar circumstances of the early stages of an economic recovery. For most of this year so far, the once-despised cyclicals have been in great demand and investors have shown little interest in conglomerates with their artificially-smoothed profit trends. It is possible, however, that the valuations now being placed on small companies may prove over-ambitious. It depends on whether the managements, and the economy, deliver. Conglomerate bosses will argue that only inefficient managements will gain from the disappearance of the predators. But after several years of recession there are too many thin companies around and not enough fat ones. The hunters must make way for the growers.</p>

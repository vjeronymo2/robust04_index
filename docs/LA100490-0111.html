			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FILM;  </P> <P> THE NOT-SO-GOODFELLAS WANDER SCORCESE'S 'MEAN STREETS'  </P> <P> Before the meaner streets of "GoodFellas," there was just "Mean Streets,"  Martin Scorcese's look at a couple of wiseguys trying to push their way through  New York's urban sleaze.  </P> <P> The guys in "GoodFellas" are small-timers, but with a vision. Maybe they'll get  made (invited into the Mafia's inner circle) or maybe they'll whack somebody  for a really big payoff. The guys in "Mean Streets" (screening at UC Irvine on  Friday) are small-timers too, but without ambition. They're not only small  change, they're loose change rolling aimlessly through the alleyways.  </P> <P> Johnny Boy (a charged-up Robert DeNiro) owes minor-league money to loan sharks  all over town and blows up mailboxes for kicks. His pals run embarrassingly  petty scams on kids wanting to buy sparklers and cherry bombs for the Fourth of  July. Hey, what's a guy to do when he doesn't have the right connections? The  mobsters in "GoodFellas" would just laugh.  </P> <P> "Mean Streets," made in 1973, first showed Scorcese's beautiful obsession with  the low-lifes he saw crime-scavenging through New York's tougher boroughs. The  story of loser Johnny Boy and his protector Charlie (Harvey Keitel at his  anxious best) is alive with affection: Scorcese lets his emotions, both  friendly and not so friendly, instill the film with a juicy, comic realism.  </P> <P> "Mean Streets" also got Scorcese thinking about the next level up, where  Mafiosi pulled the strings. After 17 years, the result is "GoodFellas," not the  operatic, majestically decadent world drawn in Coppola's "The Godfather"  series, but a de-mythologized vision where violence is as natural as giving the  doorman a nice tip.  </P> <P> When you're not turning away from the amorality, the gangsters in "GoodFellas"  are hilarious and talk in that dirty city-jive Scorcese is known for, and the  guys in "Mean Streets" are hilarious in the same ways. But their hearts are  different; Johnny Boy, Charlie and the little hoods that hang around them don't  seem like they could pull off a hit -- it's a shock when one finally does at  the film's end.  </P> <P> Charlie, the only one with any hopes (he runs numbers but wants to own a  restaurant), tries to remove himself from the bad influences choking in all  around. He's got a nice girlfriend (Amy Robinson), likes taking care of Johnny  Boy, and he knows what guilt is. In a mood-setting scene just before the  opening credits, Charlie lies in bed, thinking to himself: "You don't make up  for your sins in church, you do it at home, in the streets. . . ."  </P> <P> Too bad Johnny Boy is such a handful. DeNiro plays him like a street sprite who  can't control his dangerous side. He keeps inviting trouble wherever he goes;  it's like a curse. Keitel makes it clear that Charlie doesn't know quite what  to do, but he keeps on trying.  </P> <P> There's a dignity (and a sad-funny hopelessness) in Charlie's devotion, and it  gives "Mean Streets" a kind of gutter nobility.  </P> <P> What: "Mean Streets."  </P> <P> When: Friday, Oct. 5 at 7 and 9 p.m.  </P> <P> Where: UC Irvine's Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium, Campus Drive and  Bridge Street, Irvine.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: San Diego Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south to Campus Drive.  Head east to Bridge Street.  </P> <P> Wherewithal: $2 to $4.  </P> <P> Where to Call: (714) 856-5000.  </P></p>

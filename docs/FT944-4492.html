			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / BT may gain right to raise line rental fees British Telecommunications could be allowed to raise line rental charges under one of the controversial options set out in a consultative paper published yesterday by Oftel, the telecoms regulator. If BT took full advantage of its potential new freedom home line rentals might rise by more than Pounds 50 a year - although Oftel says competition and consumer resistance make it unlikely that BT would raise rental charges significantly. The paper is expected to initiate the most far-reaching debate about telecoms regulation since BT was privatised and Mercury Communications formed as a direct competitor in 1984. The consultative document discusses a range of regulatory issues but comes to few conclusions. A definitive statement is expected next summer after a consultation period running to the end of March. The issues discussed include changes in ways of calculating the interconnection charge paid to BT by its competitors for picking up or delivering calls made through their networks. The interconnection regime has been a point of contention with companies such as Mercury, which say it is unfair and arbitrary. One proposal is that the access deficit contribution (ADC), a charge to competitors to recompense BT for its obligation to maintain a comprehensive network, should be abolished. Currently only Mercury pays ADCs. Interconnection charges represent a significant proportion of a telecom operator's costs. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, makes it clear that he finds the present ADC situation unsatisfactory and will insist on changes. He says BT's present cap on price rises - the retail prices index minus 7 1/2 per cent - will be maintained until 1997, when it is due for review. He says BT will continue to be required to offer the same prices to customers throughout the UK. His underlying message is that it may be time to move to a more openly competitive environment where BT has greater pricing freedoms and Oftel's chief task is policing anti-competitive behaviour, backed by tougher competition laws.</p>

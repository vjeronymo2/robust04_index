			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Anglo Utd falls Pounds 30m in red - Restructuring costs amount to Pounds 19m, including Pounds 8.9m to advisers ANGLO UNITED, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, yesterday reported a loss before tax of Pounds 30.5m for the year ended March 31 1993, after exceptional charges of Pounds 18.8m relating to restructuring. That compared with the previous profit of Pounds 4.8m. Cost of lawyers, accountants, merchant banks and other parties working on the restructuring amounted to Pounds 8.9m. Mr John Gainham, group managing director, deplored the cost and said: 'When you have advisers from eight banks you need a room the size of Wembley. We have no control over them.' Provisions for operational reorganisation came to Pounds 7m and there was Pounds 2.4m mainly in connection with aborted disposals. The interest charge was Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 32.7m). Anglo's core debt has been reduced from Pounds 251m to Pounds 130m. Interest on most of the borrowings is currently fixed at 14.5 per cent. Operating profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 20.3m. Mr Gainham said the result had been affected by another mild winter, the continuing recession, uncertainty over the future of British Coal and the distraction of the restructuring. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said: 'We have all the working capital we need.' Smokeless fuels reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 21m) as many of the company's solid fuel customers continued to destock because of recession. Liquid fuels and chemicals saw operating profits drop from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds 4.6m, mainly because of lower heating oil margins. Operating profits from other activities fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.4m as revenues declined from the Falkland Islands Company because of the reduction in fishing. Losses per share of 8.9p compared to earnings of 0.8p. There is no dividend, compared with a total of 0.85p last time. COMMENT Anglo is in a vicious circle. The interest on the bank debt is bleeding the company dry when it should be expanding its core businesses to help pay off some of its principal debt. Ideally it should be buying some small distributorships, but with what? Disposals is the obvious answer, but that is all but ruled out while its markets are still affected by the recession. One solution could be to sell its main business, namely smokeless fuels. In the short-term Anglo is restricted to its current business plan but in the long-term Mr Gainham says nothing is sacred and all options are open. With the company's options so restricted, its shares, languishing at 3 1/2 p, offer little hope for recovery in the medium-term.</p>

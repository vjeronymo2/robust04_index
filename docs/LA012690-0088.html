			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> ONE GERMANY: U.S. UNFAZED, EUROPEANS FRET  </P> <P> Americans are not worried about the prospect of a reunified Germany once again  dominating Europe, but the notion scares people in Poland and concerns the  British and French, according to a survey conducted jointly by The Times Poll  and The Economist.  </P> <P> In the abstract, Americans and the French overwhelmingly favor the idea of  reuniting West Germany and East Germany nearly 45 years after the crushing  defeat of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. But the British are less enthusiastic,  and the Poles are split on the issue.  </P> <P> The poll posed identical questions to people in the United States, Great  Britain, France and Poland. It was clear from the survey that the wounds of  Nazism have not healed in Poland, whose invasion by Germany more than a  half-century ago ignited World War II.  </P> <P> And varying responses in the United States, Great Britain and France indicated  that it will not be easy for Western leaders with political antennas to reach  agreement on the future of the two Germanys because citizen views on the  subject differ from nation to nation.  </P> <P> For this transatlantic project, The Times Poll, directed by I. A. Lewis,  interviewed 1,160 American adults by telephone last Saturday. During an  overlapping four-day period, The Economist, a British newsmagazine, conducted  interviews by telephone with 504 adults in Britain, 511 in France and 502 in  Poland. The margin of error for the U.S. portion of the survey is four  percentage points in either direction. For each of the three European  countries, the error margin is five points.  </P> <P> The sensitive issue of German reunification has been a prime topic for world  leaders, academicians and journalists since pro-democracy movements last year  began tearing down the Iron Curtain and toppling Communist regimes of the  Soviet Bloc, including East Germany.  </P> <P> When ordinary citizens in the four surveyed nations were asked whether they  believe the two Germanys should be reunited, 61% of the people in both the  United States and France favored the idea. No more than 15% were opposed. But  in Britain, the concept was favored by just 45% to 30%. And the Poles were  statistically split, with 41% in favor and 44% opposed. (The rest were neutral  or didn't know.)  </P> <P> Reunifying Germany in theory is one thing. But if that country should  subsequently emerge as the most powerful nation in Europe, then this prospect  bothers the Europeans who suffered from German military ambitions and Nazi  atrocities in World Wars I and II.  </P> <P> Among the Poles, 69% said they would "worry" about a reunified Germany becoming  "the dominant power in Europe." Only 25% would not worry. In both Britain and  France, a dominant Germany would disturb 50% of those surveyed. It would not  bother 37% of the British and 43% of the French.  </P> <P> By comparison, Americans seemed rather blase about the idea of Germany again  dominating Europe. It concerned only 29% and posed no problem for 62%.  </P> <P> What worried the Poles most about a dominant Germany was the possibility that  it "may try to expand its territory again" or "lead to a revival of Nazism."  The British also feared a resurgence of Nazism. The chief concern of the  French, on the other hand, was that "the German economy may become too strong."  </P> <P> One of the stickiest questions to be answered about possible reunification is  where the new Germany would fit militarily. With West Germany now providing the  front lines for NATO and East Germany serving as the forward outpost for the  Warsaw Pact, reunification would dramatically alter the European military map.  </P> <P> The Poles, by a margin of roughly 5 to 3, said a reunified Germany should avoid  any military pact and be neutral, presumably like Austria.  </P> <P> People in France -- which is not a member of NATO but is an integral part of  the Western military alliance -- believed by a 4-to-3 margin that a reunified  Germany should belong to NATO. In the two surveyed NATO countries -- the United  States and Great Britain -- citizens, by roughly 2 to 1 and 3 to 1  respectively, advocated making a reunified Germany a member of their alliance.  </P> <P> Most Americans and British wanted to keep the U.S. military at its present  strength in Europe. More than 300,000 U.S. troops now are based there. The  French and Poles, however, were split on this question.  </P> <P> Among those who oppose reducing U.S. forces, the Americans, British and French  view these troops principally as a means of maintaining the Atlantic Alliance  and providing the defense against potential Soviet aggression. But the Poles  have another reason, one rooted in the history of Central Europe. They believe  the U.S. military is needed "to help offset Germany's new power" if  reunification becomes reality.  </P> <P> People in all four surveyed countries believe overwhelmingly that the European  Community -- the 12 Western European nations that have formed a powerful  economic bloc -- should accept new members from Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Poland, where Lech Walesa's Solidarity movement sparked an anti-Communist  revolution, appeared to be supremely confident that democratic reforms will  survive in Eastern Europe regardless of whether Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev manages to hold on to power. Nearly three-fourths of the Poles felt  the reforms will stay with or without Gorbachev.  </P> <P> But people in the Western countries were not so sure. The French tended to  believe that the new reforms are sufficiently entrenched to survive without  Gorbachev. But the Americans were divided on the question, and most of the  British thought the fates of the reforms and the Soviet leader are intertwined.  </P> <P> Among those surveyed, 6 in 10 of the Poles and French, slightly more than half  the British and 4 in 10 of the Americans said a relative either had been killed  or wounded in one of the world wars.  </P> <P> The Poles and French directly affected by the wars were slightly less  supportive of German reunification than were people whose families had escaped  harm. But family war histories did not seem to make a difference in the  attitudes of Americans and the British.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Do you favor or oppose reunification of Germany?  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:1.89IN:1.78IN:1.78IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Britain  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> France  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Poland  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> U.S.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Favor  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 45%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 61%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 61%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Oppose  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 13%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Neutral  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Don't know  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 17%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Do you think the democratic reforms would or would not survive in Eastern  Europe if Mikhail Gorbachev lost power in the Soviet Union?

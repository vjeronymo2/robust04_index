			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Signs of change in Golan deadlock The back garden of the Burgh al-Kuneitra restaurant in Syria is a minefield which marks the 1974 ceasefire line with Israel. The terrace offers a panoramic view of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, with lush green fields, neat rows of cherry trees and high-tech surveillance posts. The front entrance opens into the ghost town of 'liberated' Kuneitra, once home to more than 50,000 Syrians but now abandoned and in ruins. While Jordan and the Palestinians are pushing towards peace with Israel, the future of the Golan Heights bedevils talks between Israel and Syria. Damascus demands a complete Israeli pullout from the plateau while Israel talks about withdrawal. No big breakthrough is expected during a visit to the region this weekend by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. But most Syrians believe a peace deal is inevitable. Signs are there that President Hafez al-Assad is preparing for such an eventuality. Nearly 80 per cent of the Golan Heights was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967. Six years later, in the October War of 1973, Syria tried to win it back but failed when Israeli forces pushed Syrian troops to the edge of Damascus. A ceasefire line was negotiated by Dr Henry Kissinger, then US secretary of state, whose shuttle diplomacy entailed 43 visits to Damascus in less than eight months. In June 1974, most of the newly-occupied land was returned, plus around 300 sq km of territory lost in the 1967 war, including 'liberated' Kuneitra and its restaurant. Since then, there has been deadlock. The Israelis have built 40 settlements on the plateau which are home to about 15,000 settlers. They cultivated the fertile soil and set up listening posts in the hills. In 1981 the Knesset, Israel's parliament, formally approved annexation of the area. Syria left most of the Golan left to it as it was at the end of the war. Some 400,000 displaced Syrians got temporary housing in and around Damascus. President Assad proceeded to shape nearly all his foreign and domestic policies around the goal of achieving full return of the Golan Heights. So far, real progress between Syria and Israel has been virtually imperceptible. But serious and detailed negotiations have been going on, primarily through the US administration, with President Bill Clinton's meeting with Mr Assad in January and Mr Christopher's three stops in Damascus this year. This week Syrian officials were saying they have nothing new to offer from their last proposal which demands the following from Israel: It must scrap its annexation of the Golan Heights. It must recognise Syria's sovereignty over the Golan. It must commit itself to a full withdrawal, as required by UN Resolutions 242 and 338. There must be equal security arrangements in the area. Normalisation of relations must be linked to the speed of the Israeli withdrawal. While negotiations continue, President Assad has been quietly making changes in expectation of a peace settlement. A new road is being built from Damascus to the Golan. Scores of long-serving governors and party officials have been or are soon to be replaced. A reshuffle has taken place in one of the main pillars of Mr Assad's regime, the armed forces. New appointees to the civil administration are seen as more liberal and open to peace than their predecessors. But the new generals are hardliners. Much to Britain's dismay the new air force chief Gen Mohammed al-Khouli, is believed to have masterminded the 1986 Nizar Hindawi plot, when Syria allegedly tried to blow up an Israeli aircraft at London's Heathrow Airport. As usual, President Assad is ruling with a two-edged sword. After decades of anti-Israeli propaganda he needs fresh bureaucrats who can work with a peace settlement. But at the same time he needs hardline loyalists to maintain discipline in the 450,000-strong armed forces which have the most to lose from peace. This approach will not be welcomed by Israel or the US, but such is the nature of the president's hold on power.</p>

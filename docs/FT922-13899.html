			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian resource companies shelve rationalisation plans CRA and North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resource groups, have shelved plans for one of the biggest rationalisations this decade in the country's mining and smelting industry. The two companies announced yesterday they were deferring plans to halve their joint interests in the country's biggest smelting company, Pasminco, to about 40 per cent. CRA and NBH Peko announced in late February they were placing stakes of almost 20 per cent each in Pasminco's capital on the market following a ADollars 36.5m (USDollars 28m) slide into the red by the latter company for the December half. However, CRA and NHB Peko yesterday said they had resolved, after considering a recommendation from their advisers, not to proceed with the sale 'as the objectives of all parties could not be met'. They indicated a divergence in NHB Peko's and CRA's attitude to the Pasminco investment. 'North reaffirms its view that its strategic goals will best be achieved by a reduction in its shareholding in Pasminco,' they said. 'North will continue to consider the manner in which a reduction may be achieved.' This contrasted with CRA's view: 'As a diversified resource company, CRA has maintained its long-term interest in the lead/zinc sector. 'This interest underlies its involvement in Pasminco and its commitment to its future success. Currently, CRA is evaluating two major zinc discoveries at Century and Dugald River in Queensland. 'It sees Pasminco's Australian smelters as having synergies with these potential developments. CRA's investment position in Pasminco will be depend on these longer-term considerations and on the structure of the other shareholdings in Pasminco.' The two companies said Ord Minnett Securities in Australia and Credit Suisse First Boston in London would continue to advise on the Pasminco shareholdings. Delta Gold, the emerging Australian gold producer, has announced plans to raise ADollars 41.9m with a 3-for-10 issue of shares at ADollars 1 each. Funds raised will be used to develop the company's Kanowna Belle gold deposit, near Kalgoorlie, one of Australia's richest recent gold finds.</p>

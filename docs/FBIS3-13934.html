			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, </F> originally broadcast by the Voice of Faith in Islam radio  station, by moderator Shafiq al-Musawi, Qasim al-Qasir, and  other unidentified correspondents; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] In the past few years the world  has witnessed major international and regional developments,  including the fall of the USSR, the reappearance of nationalism,  ethnic conflicts, the new world order slogan, and U.S. world  dominance. The most notable theory to describe this change was  that of U.S. thinker [Francis] Fukuyama, who said that "the  world is witnessing the end of history through the triumph of  Western liberal capitalism and its social, intellectual, and  political values and the collapse of communist and Muslim  ideologies."    Your eminence, after the collapse of the USSR some people  said it was the end of history. How do you assess such  international theories? Where does Islam stand on this? Where  do the Islamic movements stand?    [Nasrallah] He who proposes the theory that we are  approaching the end of history and considers the failure of the  communist experiment in the USSR a victory for liberalism and  capitalism is free to do so from his own perspective. However,  when we assess these developments objectively, or at least from  our own perspective, we reach a different conclusion. We agree  with this theory as far as it means an end of history in one  particular aspect. We disagree on the rest. If there were only  two ideologies in the world, leaving no room for a third  ideology, we might regard the collapse of one as a victory for  the other. However, in the presence of other international  ideologies professing to be able to build a civilization, the  failure of the USSR's communist experiment does not necessarily  signify a triumph of capitalist philosophy. The Islamists also  consider, from their perspective, that the Soviet failure is a  triumph for Islam and Islamic ideology. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] You have pointed out that the USSR's  collapse  was a common victory for Islam and capitalism, if one may so  describe it. Nevertheless, what distinguishes Western society  is the issue of liberties and human rights. A major erroneous  belief to which some people adhere is that the Islamists fail  the liberty test. It is said that the Islamists, unlike  Westerners, oppress others. The Salman Rushdie issue and the  killing in Algeria are seen as major difficulties for Islamists  in connection with liberties. What is your opinion?    [Nasrallah] To give a relativist answer to this question, we  must divide it into two parts. The first deals with the West's  presumed military power and strong position on human rights,  liberties, and similar matters. The second part is connected  with the Western accusation that the Islamists will abolish  liberties and leave no room for an alternative opinions if they  come to power.    Regarding the first part of the question, I certainly do not  acknowledge that the West is strong on the human rights issue.  When it speaks of human rights, it is referring more to slogans  than to facts. Liberties have no intrinsic value to the West  but are merely slogans and arguments exploited for the  furtherance of the Western countries' major interests. To use  an example, the West is rallying behind Salman Rushdie under the  slogan of human rights but at the same time is willing to  slaughter an entire nation if it stands up and demands  self-determination, which is, after all, a very basic human  right. [passage omitted]    Let us move to the second part of the question: Western  power today is not intellectual but political, military, and  economic power. Even this power is now buffeted by crises.  Theoretically, any Islamist can simply stand up and declare  that Islam is the religion of liberties, that it allows freedom  of worship, and that it opposes compulsion in religion.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you think other governments in the Arab  and Islamic world will deal with the Islamists in the way the  governments of Egypt and Algeria are now dealing with their  Islamists? Will our turn come in Lebanon? Should we draw a  conclusion from the Airport Bridge massacre [reference to  Lebanese Army's shooting of several Hizballah demonstrators on  13 September 1993]? What is your opinion?    Will the Islamists, in case they come to power, allow any  other group to try to change Islamic rule by democratic means,  or are we going to then say: This is God's government and none  may go against it?    [Nasrallah] The prevailing phenomenon in the Islamic world  today is the suppression of Islamists. Egypt and Algeria are  constantly in the news because the authorities there have failed  to destroy the Islamic movement. Very ugly repression is  occurring in other Islamic countries as well. In some of them,  such as Tunisia and Iraq, the Islamists are oppressed almost to  an unimaginable degree. Merely belonging to a certain party in  those countries is enough to earn one the death penalty. In the  Arab Maghreb the Islamists are brutally suppressed. In some  countries the Islamists have remained steadfast, in others they  have weakened. In what direction will we move in Lebanon? We  cannot give definite answers. Of course, the United States does  not want to suppress all voices in Lebanon; it wants all  pro-Israeli and pro-U.S. voices to be strengthened and given all  kinds of freedom. It seeks to deny Lebanon's option to be a  part of this nation. [passage omitted]    Are we about to face suppression? Judging by the rulers'  mentality, I say yes; but taking into account the Lebanese  people's demographic makeup and enlightenment, I say it will not  be easy for the rulers to do this.    [Correspondent] Will the Islamists allow, in a Western-like  democratic spirit, their opponents to try to bring down an  Islamic government in a democratic election? Will the Islamists  accept this?    [Nasrallah] If some forces can persuade a nation that an  Islamic government is not worthwhile, then I do not believe that  such a government can stay in power. A minority cannot impose  an Islamic government on the majority. This is corroborated by  historical events, except in those cases when the opposition to  Islamic governments was corrupt and bolstered by force of arms.  You spoke about your theory that Islamic thought might triumph  in fact and theory at the end of history. Alternatively, we can  see that many Islamic governments rose and fell throughout  history, meaning that they were not the ultimate theoretical and  practical solution for those societies. In the past,  circumstances were different; even the Islamic governments that  were established did not attain the level that we judge to be  the proper level of Islamic rule. To use a specific example:  When 'Ali [Bin-Abu-Talib, the fourth caliph] was martyred and a  peace treaty was concluded between his son Hasan and Mu'awiyah  [Bin-Abu-Sufayn, the fifth caliph and first Umayyad ruler],  government in the Islamic lands was transformed into an  autocratic, hereditary, and tribal rule. Islam was not part of  that government. We do not allow anyone to judge Islam by the  example of the Umayyads, the Abbasids, and all those who came  after them. We cannot regard them as examples of Islamic  government. In the troubled past, weak governments arose.  Today there is an Islamic state with a great government. It is  the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was not established by a  triumphant family or tribe but by a nation of 40 million. They  are 60 million now. This is an Islamic state that can serve as  a foundation and pillar of world Islamism. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Perhaps a major cause of our society's  backwardness and weakness lies in the socioeconomic factor.  This problem persists, although Islamic writers have for dozens  of years been writing books and delivering lectures on the  applicability of Islam as a solution to this problem,  particularly as Islam is concerned with social matters. When  faced with realities, some Islamic movements have failed to  offer economic and social remedies. Despite the reassurances we  hear about the situation in Iran, countries established on  Islamic lines have not succeeded in extracting themselves from  the turmoil of the international economy. Iran is not sure  whether to adopt a centralized or a market economy and is  directly or indirectly subject to the dictates of the  international market. It faces numerous economic problems and  deals with usurer banks. Where are the Islamic economic  projects that can deal with these problems? How can these  problems be solved?    [Nasrallah] We must give the Islamic experiment a chance to  prove itself before we judge. So far it has not had such a  chance. Sudan has been subjected to attrition in the south since  Islamic rule was established there. Furthermore, the Islamic  movement inherited a very poor Sudan that continues to face  embargoes and constant pressures. Therefore, we cannot say that  its economic experiment has failed because it has not yet had an  economic experiment. The Sudanese people are still trying to  catch their breath and assert themselves despite the crises that  are constantly created for them.    As to the Islamic Republic of Iran, a new well-planned  policy  was pursued after the eight-year war. During the war years, the  Iranian economy basically sought to prevent the country's  collapse and for this reason it was geared to development,  services, and consumption. Some development projects were  specifically established to offer quick services to the people  to enable them to face the war conditions. After the war ended,  the Iranian Government had an important chance to install a new  economic experiment. [passage omitted]    Islam outlines general economic principles and guidelines,  leaving specific programs and detailed plans for the nation's  leadership. The Islamic government in Iran faithfully adheres  to these principles and is looking for the proper plan to  establish a vibrant economy, drawing on the lessons it learned  from the country's problems and taking possible future dangers  into account. It is seeking a strong economy that will fulfill  the standards of social justice, liberty, and property. In this  context, it had a first five-year plan and a second five-year  plan. The latter is now bearing fruit. [passage omitted]</p>

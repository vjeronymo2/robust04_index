			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last night some roads in Bujumbura were barricaded.  Major Safari, in charge of security in Bujumbura, gives us the  details. He is interviewed by our colleague, (Gregoire  Nijimbere).    [Begin recording] [Safari] We do not yet know why barricades  were set up in Bujumbra. At around 0300 our security forces  discovered that barricades had been erected on the following  axes: National Road No. 1, Boulevard 28 November, in Nyakabiga  and on University Avenue. Security forces have already removed  these barricades.    [(Nijimbere)] Do we know who did this?    [Safari] We still do not know who erected the barricades.  But we believe that it was done because of rumors which were  circulating last night. But we have not yet proved it.  [sentence as heard] A rumor has been circulating which says  that Bujumbra would become a ghost town, and that some elements  -- not yet identified -- would stop civil servants from going to  work.    [(Nijimbere)] So, currently everything is back to normal?    [Safari] We have removed all the barricades and we invite  the population of Bujumbura to carry out their usual duties.

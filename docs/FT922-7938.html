			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris leads retreat on US weakness WALL STREET's weakness affected most late-closing markets yesterday, while some of the early closers had problems of their own, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS, after opening weaker, lost further ground in the afternoon session. Apart from the Wall Street influence, disappointing first quarter results from LVMH and Elf prompted heavy selling. The CAC-40 index closed down 36.17 or 1.7 per cent at 2,017.00 in turnover of FFr3.2bn. LVMH slipped quickly to an intraday low of FFr3,901 before recovering to close down FFr235 or 5.5 per cent at FFr4,030. Turnover was estimated at a heavy FFr627m. A sell note issued by US brokers Goldman Sachs also affected sentiment. LVMH units Au Bon Marche and Christian Dior fell FFr31 and FFr14 respectively to FFr721 and FFr336. Elf, which upset the market with a 25 per cent decline in first quarter operating profits, shed FFr10.80 to FFr379.20. Total eased FFr3.20 to FFr266. Elsewhere Saint-Gobain lost FFr16 to FFr579 and L'Oreal fell FFr15 to FFr884. One of the few bright spots of the day was Pechiney International which put on FFr6.30 to FFr208 after falls earlier in the week. AMSTERDAM slipped back in spite of a strong performance by Royal Dutch on its positive first quarter earnings. The CBS Tendency index closed down 1.4 at 128.8 on selling ahead of today's expiry of May options and futures contracts. Royal Dutch rose to an intraday high of Fl 154.50 before easing to close up Fl 2.70 or 1.8 per cent at Fl152.70. Profit-taking was noted in a number of issues following recent gains, including publishers VNU, down Fl 1.30 to Fl 88.70 and Elsevier, down Fl 2.10 to Fl 114. FRANKFURT lost more ground, the DAX index closing 7.16 lower at 1,742.26 after a drop of 2.93 to 704.05 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from DM6bn to DM5.7bn. Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf observed that the apparent stability of German equities in the past month, in the face of bad domestic news, had come at a time when international investors had been putting money into the UK, France and Switzerland. 'In relative terms, the German markets have been weak,' he said. Lufthansa, which has passed its dividend, fell another DM3.20 to DM147.20 and Kugelfischer, the engineer which made a deep dividend cut after hours on Wednesday, dropped DM10.90 to DM254. Carmakers fell again, Volkswagen leading the way down with a drop of DM5.40 to DM385.60. Apart from the looming metalworkers' strike, the sector continued to be a target for profit-taking, and reaction to the weakness in the US dollar. MILAN saw weakness in Fiat, Generali and a range of other blue chips on business pessimism, and the political hiatus in Italy, and the Comit index fell another 4.83 to another new 1992 low of 477.50. Fiat fell ahead of today's 1991 results losing L89 to close at L4,941, and dropping again to L4,860 in the post bourse. Generali fell L460 to L27,800 and Credito Italiano by L44 to L1,706 in a weak banking sector. ZURICH gave up early gains to close with the SMI index 8.5 down at 1,944.8. Insurers' fortunes varied. Zurich certificates topped the active list but fell SFr90 to SFr2,030 on Wednesday's rights issue; Baloise certificates gained SFr50 to SFr2,300 on capital restructuring hopes. BRUSSELS followed other bourses lower with the Bel-20 index ending down 6.62 at 1,215.12 in turnover of BFr723m. Petrofina shed BFr25 to BFr11,450 while Banque Bruxelles Lambert, which said that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, its main shareholder, may sell part of of its stake, lost BFr50 to BFr3,500. MADRID may have been in festive mood, ahead of today's holiday and chose to maintain its equilibrium in spite of Wall Street and a rise of 0.5 percentage points in Spain's core inflation rate. The general index closed 0.56 higher at 261.38.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1186.67  1186.99  1187.32  1186.05  1185.20  1184.12  1181.45  1179.98  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1187.40    Day's Low  1179.51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     May 13    May 12    May 11    May 8      May 7     1187.91   1188.40   1191.63   1188.95++  1182.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ++ Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chiu I (5941 3015) in </F> Shanghai: "Whither Will Nuclear Crisis on Korean Peninsula Go?"]    [Text] Shanghai, 6 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--On 4 April, the DPRK  rejected the recent statement made by the UN Security Council  chairman. The statement urged the DPRK to fulfill the nuclear  safety accord and to allow International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] inspectors to complete the activities prescribed by the  agreement reached between the agency and the DPRK last 25  February. A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said: Since the  DPRK is in the special position of temporarily suspending its  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is  "utterly unjustifiable" to ask the DPRK to fulfill the nuclear  safety accord and to accept additional inspections. On the  other hand, the DPRK urged the United States to stop exerting  pressure on it and to settle the nuclear problem on the Korean  Peninsula through dialogue between the two countries. This move  by the DPRK undoubtedly made the "nuclear crisis" on the  peninsula even more subtle.  <H5>  The United States Is Determined To Exercise a War Deterrent </H5>   Zhuang Jianzhong, senior analyst in international strategy  and researcher at the Shanghai International Strategy Institute,  while analyzing the case, said: As far as the United States is  concerned, the main purpose and direct effect of bullying the  DPRK is to guard against nuclear proliferation. The chief U.S.  strategic consideration since World War II is that the greatest  threat to the United States comprises nuclear weapons. Hence,  the United States is extremely sensitive to the issue of nuclear  proliferation. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union,  the CIS no longer trains its nuclear weapons on the United  States, thus eliminating the greatest U.S. nuclear enemy.  Hence, the United States holds that, with the end of the Cold  War, the fact that extremist countries in some regions may  possess nuclear weapons poses the greatest threat to the United  States. Therefore, its chief task is to ban nuclear development  in these countries.    The abovementioned reason also explains the uncompromising  stand by the United States on the DPRK nuclear issue.  Meanwhile, the United States attaches great importance to  stability in the East Asian region, which is the key part of  Asia as well as an important component of the U.S. Asian-Pacific  strategy, whereas the DPRK nuclear issue has become the serious  hidden danger to the United States. As far as the political  aspect is concerned, the United States intends to play a leading  role in Northeast Asia and to show that both Japan and the ROK  need U.S. support.    The United States is resolute in bullying the DPRK into  accepting nuclear inspection. As far as the U.S. military  strategy is concerned, the 1970's theory of brinkmanship has  changed into the theory of war deterrent in the 1980's and 90's.  The United States holds that, apart from wielding military  pressure to achieve results just as it did during the Cuban  missile crisis, it can also resort to direct military operations  as it did in Grenada and Panama. According to a report published  by THE WASHINGTON POST on 31 March, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry  said that the United States would try its best to prevent the  DPRK from developing nuclear weapons, even at the risk of waging  a war.    Viewed from a deeper angle, the DPRK in U.S. is the most  hardline communist stronghold and the United States wants to  compel the DPRK to give in through this incident.  <H5>  China in a Decisive Position </H5>   China also hopes for a stable and denuclearized Korean  Peninsula. China can be described as occupying a decisive  position and having a great and unprecedented say in this matter  because it interacts with both the DPRK and the United States.  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng remarked separately on this matter,  expressing the hope that the nuclear issue could be settled  through peaceful talks between the DPRK and the United States.  This has been very rare in previous regional conflicts and the  fact that the UN Security Council adopted the chairman's  statement as proposed by China also shows how influential China  is. By comparison, Russia does not have much influence on it.    In Zhuang Jianzhong's view, the DPRK does not really want to  wage war with the ROK and the United States because its national  power is too poor. At present, the DPRK still wants to upgrade  its diplomatic standing by establishing ties with the United  States and engaging in talks with them. It is then looking  forward to receiving economic aid from others.  <H5>  The DPRK To Consent To Reexamination </H5>   To sum up, squabbles and conflicts might arise but  everything  depends on the development of the situation. At present, the  U.S. announcements to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK and to  conduct joint military exercise with the ROK are just responsive  actions, far removed from waging war against the DPRK.  According to Zhuang Jianzhong, the DPRK will finally accept the  UN Security Council's request to reexamine its nuclear  facilities, as long as it is done in a dignified manner.</p>

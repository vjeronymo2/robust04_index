			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Food: Chalet girls who aim for a touch of class NEVER HAVING been on a skiing holiday, I must confess to a jaundiced view of what it must be like: too much organised exercise, garish colours ruining an otherwise sleek white landscape, and that thing they call apres-ski - over-excited people telling boring stories about their triumphs and disasters on the piste over cups of mulled wine and plates of nasty food. The food is a big consideration. On chalet holidays, this is the responsibility of 'chalet girls', a genus which gives rise to many jokes but which is, to the best of my knowledge, meant to cook and keep house for the skiing parties. Given the usual age, sex and social class of chalet girls, I would have assumed that the food they cooked would resemble the sort of thing prepared by well brought up girls in the West End of London: fish cakes, fish pie, shepherds' pie and, if you are really unlucky, overcooked roasts. Everything ineffably English, and boring to boot. My eyes, however, have been opened - not to skiing, I should make clear, but to the culinary abilities of chalet staff - by attending a training course at Ombremont, a Michelin-starred hotel and restaurant on the shores of lac du Bourget near Chambery. All the chalet persons (there was one boy) had been engaged by a travel company called Ski Whizz, which operates skiing holidays all over the Alps. Of the group attending the three-day course, all had some type of cookery diploma and many had further experience; in short, all were capable of rolling out something more interesting than a fish-cake. The star of the show was the chef, Gilles Vernisse, responsible for inculcating Savoyard cuisine into the heads of young cooks more used to an international vocabulary. The menus were ambitious. They included a rustic Savoyard soup enlivened by triangles of tangy Beaufort cheese; a rabbit civet served with a polenta enhanced with bacon (it should be recalled that Savoy remained part of Italy until 1860); chicken quenelles; a potato gratin with Reblochon cheese; pork fillet served in a sauce made from Chambery vermouth; a pork ragout; a Beaufort souffle; Savoy cake, and grape clafoutis. Most impressive was the enthusiasm with which the trainees grasped each technique. Even a vegetarian went to work with gusto and seemed to take a special pride in trimming pork fillets, while the chalet boy seemed the obvious candidate to smash up a great many rabbits into their constituent parts. The students learnt about local products, especially the great local cheeses made from the Alpine Abondance cow: the dense Beaufort and Abondance cheeses, and the creamier Reblochons and Vacherins, and local wines such as Apremont, Abymes and Mondeuse, as well as the local vermouth. At the students' insistance Gilles Vernisse showed them how to put together a couple of vegetarian menus using local produce. In the evening there was the chance to try out Gilles' inventions, such as his duck magret filled with foie gras and served with a truffle vinaigrette; a superb dish of snail ravioli with spinach and ceps; or a mussel soup with saffron and baby clams. For the fish, pollan had been brought from Lake Geneva and was served on a bed of leeks with the local, gentian-flavoured liqueur. Perch came marinated in basil. Among the meat courses, lamb was served under an olive crust; a sausage of sweetbreads was arranged around leeks and morel mushrooms; and pigeon breasts came with minute Royans ravioli filled with Comte cheese. The puddings featured pear ravioli on a chocolate sauce, a brace of souffles - one of Grand Marnier, the other of bananas - and a delicious nougat glace. Now, I think that if Gilles Vernisse would consent to become a chalet girl, I would go to the mountain. Information: Ski Whizz, Astley House, 33 Notting Hill Gate, London W11. Tel: 071-757-5624.

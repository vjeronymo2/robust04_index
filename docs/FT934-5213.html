			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Australia switches budget to May The Australian federal government will no longer deliver its annual budget in August, switching to May instead. The move, strongly advocated by Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, was approved yesterday by the cabinet. In arguing for the change, the treasurer claimed that a spring budget would make it easier for the government to be in step with Australia's financial year. He also hopes to avoid a repeat of this year's budget fiasco, when the government's finance measures were stalled in the Senate for two months, as minority parties - which hold the balance of power there - haggled over measures. The treasurer gave cabinet written assurances from the two minority parties that they back his timetable for dealing with budget matters by June 30. He added that the government would 'engage in a more consultative process in the lead-up to the budget'. The next budget will be on May 10.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Luis Camilo Osorio, registrar </F> general of the National Civil Registry Office, by station  announcer Dario Arizmendi in Santa Fe de Bogota -- live]    [Text] [Arizmendi] Good Morning, Mr. Luis Camilo Osorio.    [Osorio] Good morning, Dario.    [Arizmendi] Congratulations once again. The media, the  observers, and the campaign headquarters have all highlighted  your excellent work and that of your whole team at the National  Registry, particularly, your diligence in releasing the  information.    [Osorio] Why, thank you, Dario. We are very pleased, and I  reaffirm that this was a team effort in which my coworkers  accompanied me all the way.    [Arizmendi] Regarding the claims of alleged technical fraud  made by Deputy Fabio Valencia Cosio, member of the Conservative  Party National Directorate, just 72 hours ago?    [Osorio] There is absolutely no discussion of it.    [Arizmendi] Sir, will you issue Bulletin No. 11 before 1000  [1500 GMT]?    [Osorio] We can try, Dario, but I do not think we will be  able to release it any earlier. I expect to get there as early  as possible to see what we can do before the tallying process  begins. I do think, however, that there has been a significant  amount of information.    [Arizmendi] How will the runoff election ballot work? When  will the position drawing take place? What will the numbering  system be?    [Osorio] I do not think there will be a need for a drawing  or a special numbering system or anything like that. I think  all that would hamper the campaigns. In any case, that is a  decision we have to make in conjunction with the Electoral  Council. Perhaps not to hold a drawing, but surely to approve a  design for the ballot itself. There is not enough time to  change all the advertising materials, nor would there be  numbered positions on the ballot. One candidate would go on the  left and the other on the right.    [Arizmendi] Would they carry the same 005 and 010 they did  on the first ballot?    [Osorio] I imagine so, yes, because there is no other way to  go about that. The funny thing is, however, that for the  presidential election, that issue must be discussed with the  Electoral Council, while the registrar approves all the other  ballots on his own.    [Arizmendi] Based on the celebrity of yesterday's process,  during which there was a very efficient flow of information  throughout, we think you could have almost 90 or 95 percent of  the results in by 1800 [2300 GMT] or 1900 [0000 GMT]. Is that  so?    [Osorio] Dario, it is not so much the smaller number of  candidates. I have said all along that the same number of  voters who voted this time will again vote for one of the two  candidates. Whoever is adding, moving documents, and so on, will  take the same amount of time because the number of votes will  still be the same, if not higher.    [Arizmendi] But there are less candidates, so the process  should be simpler, should it not?    [Osorio] There are less candidates, but there is the same  number of ballots. If 250 people voted at a given table, they  are expected to do so again. Although they will only find two  candidates on the ballot this time, they will vote in the same  way they did the last time. Not much time can be saved here.  Timing also depends on how fast local officials can get the  tally sheets to a transmission center. Basically, the timing  will be the same.    [Arizmendi] Will the electoral officials be the same ones  who acted this time?    [Osorio] Yes. We have already summoned the members of the  electoral boards, the table officials, and the logistics team,  which includes transportation, communications, and supplies.  Everything has been foreseen and practiced already.    [Arizmendi] There is no impediment for the election to be  held in three weeks time, from an organizational, technical, and  budget stand point?    [Osorio] No. Nothing at all. Everything has been planned,  calculated, and foreseen. We had already decided this a while  ago, because 21 days does not give much time for anything.    [Arizmendi] Mr. Registrar, will there be any change in the  voter registration process? Will any voting cards be issued in  the next few days?    [Osorio] Unfortunately not. We will issue voter cards to  those who have that right, such as former rebels who have  reentered civilian life, and we will continue to do so. Those  who are not eligible, because they failed to register at least  four months prior to the first election, will not receive their  cards yet. If there are voter cards that were eligible and have  not yet been delivered, we will go ahead and deliver them.    [Arizmendi] According to statistics and information from the  Civil Registry, was this the closest election ever in Colombian  history?    [Osorio] Without a doubt. Of course. The difference  between the two front runners has no precedent.    [Arizmendi] Would you say there could be a lower abstention  level this time around?    [Osorio] That is something we all hope for, Dario.  Democracy can only be consolidated with a lot of votes and a  lot of people.</p>

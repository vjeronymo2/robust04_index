			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, leader of the </F> Islamic Movement of Kurdistan, by unidentified reporters; in  Salah-al-Din; date not given]    [Text] While Turkey was exerting intensive efforts in the  international political forum [NATO meeting] for the  clarification of the status of northern Iraq, a new force  silently emerged in the region. It is the Islamic Front, and  its leader is Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz. Our colleague  Kursat Akyol met Shaykh 'Uthman in Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq.    [Begin recording] [First off-screen reporter] The Islamic  Front made itself known for the first time last month.  Following a 10-day-long bloody battle with Talabani's  peshmergas, the organization withdrew and its leader Shaykh  'Uthman fell prisoner. One immediately notices the extraordinary  security measures at the entrance of the house where he lives  under the custody of the Kurdish leader Barzani. During the  meeting with the shaykh, prominent members of his party were  also present. What was the aim of this radical Islamic group  that was born so quietly?    [Second off-screen reporter, translating the statement of  Shaykh 'Uthman, who is on screen but unheard] Our aim is to  establish an Islamic state in northern Iraq similar to the one  in Iran; an independent Kurdish state governed in accordance  with the shari'ah, and then to expand this state toward the  north, that is, toward Turkey. Once we take the Kurds in Turkey  into an independent Kurdistan we will establish a great Islamic  state.    [First off-screen reporter] With what force does Shaykh  'Uthman intend to accomplish this? Where is his military power?    [Second off-screen reporter, translating 'Uthman] I cannot  reply to this question, as it is a military secret. We have  peshmergas in every corner of Kurdistan. We have 12,000  peshmergas only in the mountains.    [First off-screen reporter] Shaykh 'Uthman has interesting  links in Turkey. He told us that he visited Turkey 10 months  ago, and held quite beneficial talks during this second visit.    [Second off-screen reporter, translating 'Uthman] We met  with  the leading officials of the Welfare Party, with Necmettin  Erbakan and Sevket Kazan. We also held beneficial and fraternal  talks with the leaders of Nur Society. [video shows guards in  front of a house, Shaykh 'Uthman, others sitting on a couch in a  room, being interviewed]</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Company News: State Bank of NSW to be sold off next month The State Bank of New South Wales, Australia's largest regional bank, is to be put up for sale next month. The state government announced yesterday that it would invite tenders for the bank in December and introduce legislation into parliament shortly enabling the sale to go ahead. Forecasts for the sale proceeds vary widely. A NSW treasury estimate puts the figure at between ADollars 400m and ADollars 700m (USDollars 266m-USDollars 465m), but at the upper end some analysts suggest that a figure of ADollars 900m to ADollars 1bn would not be unrealistic. The NSW government said it was aiming for a trade sale, but specifically excluded the four big Australian banks from the bidding. 'The sale will be limited to regional Australian banks, Australian non-bank financial institutions with the financial strength to make the acquisition, and foreign banks with an identified strategic interest in Australia,' said Mr John Fahey, state premier. The 'preferred' terms of sale include provisions that the existing staffing and branch structure is retained; that the bank's headquarters remain in Sydney; and that the bank remains 'a viable independent entity'. News of the auction comes less than a week after SBNSW announced a ADollars 74.6m net loss for the 12 months to the end of September, down from a profit of ADollars 25.4m in the previous year. The 1992-93 figure, however, came after a ADollars 96m abnormal charge, and the bank was keen to stress that a pre-tax operating loss in the first half turned into a profit in the second six months. Charges for bad and doubtful debts fell to ADollars 140.4m from ADollars 152.4m, and Mr John O'Neill, managing director, claimed that 'the worst is behind us in terms of problem loans'. Like most state governments, New South Wales has been seeking to reduce its budget deficit and contain debt, but maintain expenditure on health and community services. Capital spending has been reined back, and the privatisation proceeds should ease financial pressures. 'The people of New South Wales do not benefit from owning a bank, as much as they would by re-investing the same money in core services of government,' argued Mr Peter Collins, state treasurer. However, Mr Bob Carr, the NSW opposition leader, accused the government of holding a firesale and said that the bank - which he claimed could be worth as much as ADollars 1.5bn - was being sold at 'precisely the wrong time'. A number of potential bidders, including Advance Bank, St George Bank and GIO Australia, have made clear that they will at least review the sale terms.</p>

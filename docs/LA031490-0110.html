			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD AEROSPACE WINS DEFENSE SYSTEM CONTRACT;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE INITIAL ORDER, VALUED AT $21.4 MILLION, COULD GENERATE MUCH MORE  IN SALES AND ATTRACT POTENTIAL BUYERS TO THE FIRM.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace Corp. said Tuesday that it has received its first production  order for a new missile guidance system, a contract that could set the stage  for hundreds of millions of dollars in sales through the 1990s and make the  firm more attractive to potential buyers.  </P> <P> The initial order for the so-called low-cost seeker portion of the Navy's  high-speed anti-radiation missile (HARM) is valued at $21.4 million and calls  for the manufacture of 100 of the guidance system units. The missile became  operational in 1984, but the new guidance system has just been developed by  Ford Aerospace.  </P> <P> If the Navy continues to build the HARM at the current rate of roughly 1,500  per year, Ford could gain substantially larger contracts.  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. announced earlier this year that it wants to sell its aerospace  operation, and the HARM contract should make the subsidiary more attractive,  analysts said. It will be a particularly welcome boost for the subsidiary's  Newport Beach Aeronutronic division, which builds the seeker but is considered  one of the more vulnerable parts of the far-flung Ford Aerospace operation.  </P> <P> "This is a very positive development," said C. E. Grubbs, a former Ford  Aerospace manager and now a defense consultant in Newport Beach. "It lends a  couple of years of stability and is good for morale at Aeronutronic. It  definitely increases the salability of the company."  </P> <P> An initial round of bids for Ford Aerospace was received at the beginning of  March, but the company has not disclosed who submitted bids or whether the  offers were for the entire subsidiary or only for individual divisions. Ford  has said that it wants to sell the company, which analysts value at $500  million to $800 million, in one piece, but many experts believe that it will be  forced to sell it piecemeal.  </P> <P> The HARM missile destroys radar and anti-aircraft systems by homing in on the  radio frequencies they emit. The missile is built by Texas Instruments, but the  seeker portion of the system has accounted for about half the purchase price,  which stands at about $200,000 per missile.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace won a competition in 1988 to develop a lower-cost version of the  HARM seeker that would also perform better against improved enemy radar  systems, and the firm received $13.7 million to develop the technology and  build pre-production units. The Navy's decision to go ahead with production  means that 100 of the 1,604 HARM missiles to be built in 1990 will have the  Ford seeker. The remainder will use existing Texas Instruments components.  </P> <P> Curt James of Texas Instruments' weapons systems marketing group said the 1991  defense budget, which has not yet been approved by Congress, calls for 1,440  HARM missiles, of which 240 would use the Ford seeker. Texas Instruments is  also developing its own version of a new seeker, James added, though it is not  yet in production.  </P> <P> James said there would eventually be a competition between Texas Instruments  and Ford Aerospace for the seeker business. Ford spokeswoman Susan Pearce said  the company may even bid against Texas Instruments to try to become the prime  contractor for the HARM.  </P> <P> But James and Pearce noted that the number of the Ford seekers ultimately  ordered is heavily dependent on the Pentagon budget. The number of HARM  missiles purchased by the Navy already has fallen from 2,400 a year several  years ago to the 1,440 projected for 1991, and no one is willing to rule out  further cuts. Navy officials could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

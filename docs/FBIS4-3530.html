			<p>BFN     [By reporter Gao Jianxin (7559 1696 2450])    [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese  Ambassador to the UN Disarmament Commission Hou Zhitong pointed  out in his speech on 19 April that the time is quite ripe for  China, the United States, Britain, France, and Russia to sign a  treaty undertaking not to threaten the use of, or to use,  nuclear arms against non-nuclear-weapon states and not to be the  first to use nuclear weapons against each other under any  circumstances.    Hou Zhitong said: This treaty, when reached among the five  countries during their negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear  test-ban treaty, will greatly reduce the risk of a nuclear war,  enhance their security, and create a favorable condition for  achieving comprehensive nuclear test ban and advance the nuclear  disarmament process.    He said: China's proposal has received Russia's support.  China hopes that the United States, Britain, and France will  also respond to it in a positive way so that negotiations can  begin at an early date to conclude this treaty.    Hou Zhitong also explained China's position and views "on  the  role of science and technology in international security,  disarmament, and other relevant fields" as well as on  "international arms transfer." He said: Currently, a number of  countries have indicated that they would liberalize export  control of relevant semi-finished materials and technologies.  At the same time, there are countries considering the  establishment of new export control regime. Nuclear  nonproliferation should not hinder international scientific and  technological cooperation, much less be used by a few countries  as an excuse for blocking a large number of developing countries  from obtaining and developing science and technology for  peaceful purpose.    He also pointed out: China has always opposed unrestricted  international arms transfers. As is known to all, the key to  solving the problem of unrestricted arms transfers lay in the  political will of a few countries which have the most advanced  industries and most arms exports.</p>

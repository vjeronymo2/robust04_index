			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Canadian insurers move in on trusts MORE Canadian life insurance companies are understood to be planning links with trust companies to strengthen their defences against growing competition. Last week, North American Life Insurance, with assets of CDollars 7bn (USDollars 5.8bn) and CDollars 64bn insurance in force, paid CDollars 51m to take over First City Trust, part of the ailing financial services empire of the Belzberg family. North American Life is headed by a former banker, Mr William Bradford. Two government deposit insurance agencies put up CDollars 175m in loans to restore the trust company's capital position. Mr Bradford called the deal an excellent strategic fit. First City has 31 retail trust branches across Canada and a deposit base of CDollars 3bn. The deal is fully in step with Canada's new financial services legislation now coming into force and which is aimed at making a more competitive industry. Banks, insurance companies, investment dealers and trust companies can invade each other's territory, subject to federal super-vision. In recent months, insurance companies have taken over 20 trusts. Manufacturers Life, Sun Life and Laurentian Life have bought trusts and North American Life is buying First City Trust. The trend is towards towards more concentration in financial services. The acquisitions allow the insurance companies to move into consumer lending and deposit-taking, as well as developing the traditional fiduciary services. However, trusts have been poor profit-makers in the long recession and some are losing money. Some big life companies are refusing to join the rush. Great-West Life, for example, does half its business in the US and is actively expanding there.</p>

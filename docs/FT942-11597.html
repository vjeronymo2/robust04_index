			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Audience deserted Accountancy TV Accountancy Television, the training service for accountants, had only 200 subscribers to its programmes broadcast on the BBC Select Service when it collapsed last month, it emerged yesterday. There were just 867 names in total for the list of TV and video subscribers, bought yesterday for Pounds 40,000 from the receivers by Television Education Network (TEN), its leading competitor since launch two years ago. The customer figures are much lower than earlier claims by Accountancy Television that it had 1,200 subscribers, and indicate the extent of the company's financial crisis. Initial reports prepared by the receivers from accountants Buchler Phillips suggest the service has lost more than Pounds 1.5m since it opened and owes creditors more than Pounds 350,000. The collapse has proved embarrassing to its backers BBC Select, BPP, the financial training company, and five of the UK's six leading professional accountancy bodies. TEN yesterday said that it would send Accountancy Television customers its own videos until their subscriptions expired. Observer, Page 25</p>

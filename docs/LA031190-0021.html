			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCAVENGER HUNT  </P> <P> As participants in the HumanRace, we enjoyed reading your writer's version of  the so-called "Scavenger Hunt From Hell." Although Linda's experience seems  atypical of the majority of those who raced around the world last November,  (her article) was nonetheless enjoyable.  </P> <P> As she aptly states, there were real problems and mistakes made by the event's  organizers; yet we should remember that this was the first event of its kind  ever attempted and included both logistical and behavioral uncertainties no one  could have ever anticipated.  </P> <P> Linda, we feel, lost sight of the reality that this was indeed a race. Feeling  rushed, skipping meals and running about screaming at locals were the very  least of our problems. More to the point, transportation snafus, language  barriers, along with challenging tasks and resourceful competitors, proved more  difficult obstacles for us to overcome.  </P> <P> Indeed, it was a hectic race and we did miss out interacting with intriguing  natives and enjoying beautiful sights along the way. But we entered this  competition knowing full well that this time around we would only be global  grazers. A photo op here, a tourist trophy there, and away we went  participating in a wild and fulfilling cultural experience of a lifetime.  Whether in first-class hotels or camel caravans through the desert, from  ancient burial grounds in Indonesia or the Louvre in Paris, we experienced this  global village of ours like never before imagined. We thoroughly enjoyed it,  and we'll do it again next year.  </P> <P> WILLIAM D.

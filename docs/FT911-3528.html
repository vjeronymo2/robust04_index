			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Local authorities split over plans for reform - Council reaction The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications LOCAL authorities' opinion on the reforms was split last night. Sir Jack Layden, chairman of the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said: 'It's a Whitehall tax which gives massive control to government ministers. It's excessively complicated and unjust.' Mr John Chatfield, chairman of the Association of County Councils, said his organisation had recommended the move towards a property-based tax and a single tier of local government, which it believed would be the counties. Mr Roy Thomason, chairman of the Association of District Councils, said: 'This is just what we need.' He was convinced that the single tier of government would generally be the district councils. Mr Alan Stenning, director of finance at Islington Borough Council, London, was concerned that there would be little time to implement the new tax once the consultation period was over. Ms Margaret Hodge, leader of Islington council, said the new tax was still unfair because it was not related to ability to pay. 'The poll tax experiment has cost almost Pounds 400 per adult, so it would have been nice if the government had said 'sorry,' she said. The Institute of Revenues, Rating and Valuation, representing private valuers and council revenue officers, welcomed the new tax. 'It will unquestionably be simpler to collect and enforce than the community charge,' said Mr Colin Farrington, director. However, he warned that the timetable to introduce the tax by 1993 was very tight and estimated it would take three to five years after its introduction to return to the very high collection levels present under the old rating system. Mrs Jean McFadden, president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, welcomed the government's green paper 'as the first step away from the hated poll tax.' Mr Roger Cumberland, finance director at Radnorshire District Council, said he had always been in favour of unitary local authority, but hoped the government would not introduce it until after the new financial structure was in place for at least one year.</p>

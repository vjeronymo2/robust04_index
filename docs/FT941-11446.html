			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Backbenchers may wreck shopping bill The government is seriously concerned that the shops bill, which liberalises Sunday trading laws in England and Wales, may be sabotaged next week by an alliance of Labour and Conservative MPs. Supporters of Sunday shopping celebrated in December when MPs voted by a majority of 75 in a free vote to allow all-day trading for small shops, and up to six hours' opening for large stores. The successful formula was put forward by an alliance of big stores as a compromise between alternative proposals for full de-regulation or tight controls. The decision paved the way for ministers to fulfil a manifesto promise to replace the widely ignored 1950 Shops Act. However, the Home Office is worried that the Keep Sunday Special (KSS) campaign, which sought tight Sunday-shopping regulation, may have found a way to wreck the bill. Ministers fear that die-hard Tory supporters of KSS will support a Labour amendment guaranteeing double time to shop workers when the bill's line-by-line committee stage debate resumes on Wednesday. A Home Office official said: 'It is very close. We are not sure how many backbench Conservatives will be willing to defy the government, but it could be the best chance the KSS people have to wreck the bill.' The government would reject such an amendment because it believes that other groups of workers would seek similar statutory protection. There is also concern about an alternative proposal from KSS restricting Sunday opening to small shops, which would also have the effect of wrecking the bill. The government is not allowing a free vote on the amendments, in an attempt to limit any Conservative rebellion. But large-scale abstentions by Conservative MPs would be almost equally dangerous because the amendments would have solid support from opposition MPs, including those who voted for the six-hours option. Even a narrow government majority could lead to serious problems when the bill goes to the House of Lords later this year because peers are often more willing to obstruct the government when its Commons majority is in doubt. The Lords may also point to the absence of a specific government manifesto commitment to the six-hours option to justify substantial amendments to the bill. The government will argue that any attempt to wreck the bill will reinstate the existing unworkable law and could lead to widespread job losses. But ministers have no prepared fall-back position in the event of defeat on the double-time amendment. Ironically, the big stores are less concerned than ministers because most already pay between one and a half and two times normal wages to Sunday staff.</p>

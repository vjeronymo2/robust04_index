			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow 21 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Today's Moscow  newspapers focus on the results of the week-long work of the  Russian parliament State Duma (lower chamber) and the Russian  government reshuffle. Commenting on the present balance of  forces at the State Duma, TRUD newspaper notes that "the first  voting results showed that three factions --the Russian Agrarian  Party, the Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party  (165 votes) -- cooperate at least in settling personnel issues."    It is difficult to appraise the interests of the "New  Regional Policy" group: they will emerge when political and  economic issues are settled. In any case, reformist blocs  (poorly united between themselves) which have only 133 votes,  should be interested in cooperation with the above group and  with the Women of Russia faction.    Commenting on the regulations affecting the working and  living conditions of State Duma members which were discussed by  the Duma on Thursday, the same newspaper writes that "the debate  on material maintenance of deputies graphically showed how  strong the conviction is in our country that it is more  convenient to care for people's interests, enjoying the salary  of a federal minister and looking at the world through the  window of a personal car."    Referring to the calculations done by the experts from  Russia's Choice group within the Duma, IZVESTIYA notes that in  keeping with what the State Duma deputies are planning, the  monthly upkeep of one people's deputy will cost the taxpayer 15  million rubles. The paper quotes the views of Russia's Choice on  this issue: "If, despite everything, such a decision is finally  taken, it must, in the current economic conditions, be regarded  as irresponsible and not conducive to increasing the prestige of  the highest body of legislative authority".    IZVESTIYA also criticizes the personnel changes within the  Russian government. "So, Viktor Chernomyrdin has made his  choice: Soskovets, Zaveryukha, Chubays, and Yarov. He may, of  course, be wrong," the paper writes. The paper says that the  team of deputy prime ministers thus selected "bears witness,  first and foremost, to the fact that the prime minister no  longer wishes to listen to what the president has to say, laying  claims to the role of not just an independent, but, possibly, a  stronger political figure."    Forecasting that the new government will to some extent  distance itself from the previous reform course, ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI says that the main question is "the extent of this  distancing and whether the government and its chairman are going  to have enough will and common sense to halt this process before  it passes the danger mark. There are serious grounds for alarm.  For instance, Chernomyrdin's statement on the readiness to  cooperate with the Duma has taken on an altogether new meaning  after a majority of the lower chamber's committees dealing with  the economy and economics turned out to be in the hands of the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], all the more so if  the Duma's intention to set aside a special hour once a week to  examine the work of the government is taken into account."    IZVESTIYA informs its readers that the Russian procurator-  general's office is studying the possibility of instituting a  criminal case against legislator Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader  of the LDPR.    The newspaper writes that "the administration for the  observance of laws on federal security and ethnic relations of  the Russian procurator-general's office is completing its study  of applications by citizens and mass organizations demanding  that Zhirinovskiy be criminally prosecuted for war propaganda in  his book `The Last Leap to the South' as well as in interviews  and television statements."    Newspapers report some particulars about a land-crash of an  Antei military transport plane near the city of Tver (some 200  km northwest of Moscow) on 19 January. Noting that reasons for  the crash were not fully investigated yet, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  and PRAVDA newspapers claim that there was no explosion aboard  the plane.    The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper writes in this connection  that "all three `black boxes' of the plane were found."  Specialists affirm that the plane's control systems failed.    Noting that today is the 70th commemoration day of Vladimir  Lenin's death, PRAVDA carries an article entitled "What  `Democrats' Are Like and How They Fight Leninism."    The article criticizes the entire road covered by the Soviet  Union and then by Russia, starting from the course for  restructuring proclaimed by Mikhail Gorbachev and ending with  the course for reforms pursued by the present Russian  leadership.</p>

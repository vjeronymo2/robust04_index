			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Observer: Barclays' German catch Is Britain's biggest bank a little too impressed with blue blood? When Barclays purchased the exclusive Munich private bank Merck Finck in 1990, German financiers were fascinated to see how the Brits would fare; the former proprietor, Baron von Finck, was no longer a shareholder, and Adi Kracht, who really ran the bank, left shortly after. Now Barclays is delighted to have landed Michael von Brentano as Merck Finck's fifth partner and overall head of investment banking, including the BZW operation, in Germany. The former head of Deutsche Bank Capital Markets in London, von Brentano comes from a suitably well-known German family - uncle Heinrich was foreign secretary under Adenauer. Before his 17 years at Deutsche, he spent a decade as director of private bank Berliner Handels Gesellschaft (now BHF Bank). He is also a confirmed anglophile - irritating intensely other German bankers during his chairmanship of IPMA, the Euromarkets trade association, for his relentless defence of London and its interests. And he is an old friend of BZW chief executive David Band from the latter's time at JP Morgan. The trouble is, he is aloof and very difficult to work with, and there is the fact that, at 57, he surprised other bankers by taking early retirement from Deutsche Bank. 'He may open some doors, but he is no longer at the cutting edge,' is the assessment of one prominent German banker.</p>

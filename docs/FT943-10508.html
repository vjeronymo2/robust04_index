			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Blue Circle sells New World for Pounds 5.5m Blue Circle Industries, the UK's largest cement company, has sold its lossmaking New World Domestic Appliances subsidiary to a management buy-in team for Pounds 5.5m. The maker of gas cookers and ovens was part of Birmid Qualcast, which Blue Circle bought in a hostile Pounds 330m bid in 1988. The Warrington-based company incurred a Pounds 2.2m operating loss in 1993 on sales of Pounds 39.6m. Blue Circle will incur a write-off on the value of New World's net assets of Pounds 8.7m. The total write-off in the accounts to June 1994, after recognising Pounds 35.1m of goodwill written off against reserves at acquisition, will therefore be Pounds 43.8m. Murray Johnstone Private Equity Limited, the venture capital group, funded the Pounds 5.5m equity portion of the management buy-in and Nat West Acquisition Finance is providing Pounds 5m of senior debt. The buy-in is being led by Mr Mike Hassall, and the new company will be chaired by Mr Jeoff Samson, former chief executive of Yale &amp; Valor and chairman of Hunterprint, the struggling specialist printer. Blue Circle said the sale was consistent with its strategy to concentrate on heavy building materials, heating and bathrooms.</p>

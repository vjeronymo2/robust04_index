			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;A to dispose of 2,000 poster sites HAVAS, the French parent of Mills &amp; Allen, the UK outdoor poster company, yesterday agreed to abide by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's ruling that its British subsidiary must dispose of 2,000 sites acquired last year. Due to the complex history of these particular roadside sites, the parent company was required to give its own undertaking - in addition to that of its UK subsidiary - to sell panels acquired through the purchase of Brunton Curtis in April 1991. An MMC inquiry into MAI, Mills &amp; Allen's previous owner, in 1987 had ordered the disposal of these same sites which were subsequently sold to Brunton Curtis. The purchase of Brunton by M&amp;A revived the commission's original objections, even though it was under new ownership. The sites to be sold include all 48-sheet (10 ft by 20 ft) or larger panels owned by Brunton Curtis when it was acquired by M&amp;A.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Letter: Pitfalls in pursuit of quality standard Sir, Charles Batchelor's article, 'Badge of Quality' (September 1), reflects some of the doubts being felt within smaller companies of establishing a quality system conforming to BS5750. However, the article dwelt only on doubts arising from costs and complexities of getting approval; not on the growing doubts over the benefits which approval can bring. This association was among the first to agree a sectorial scheme for approval of quality systems. Some of the expected benefits such as reduced incidence of errors, improved understanding, productivity, etc, have emerged, but did not require an external assessment to bring them about. However, instead of an expected reduction in the number of assessments, with customers accepting the result of the independent external assessor, many customers still insist on carrying out their own assessments. This involves time and cost to the manufacturer. The emergence of EC approval arrangements for products under various directives can involve regular reviews of the manufacturing process, as do other independently established bodies implementing their own product approval requirements. It does not matter if these are treated as requirements additional to BS5750. To a manufacturer, each is a different quality system, and still involves a separate assessment. A major influence driving the adoption of the BS5750 arrangements was to improve the customer's certainty that the desired quality would be achieved and so save the cost and interruption of multiple inspections. There is a real danger that multiple inspections are simply being replaced by multiple assessments with the heavy costs of implementing and maintaining a BS5750 system on top.

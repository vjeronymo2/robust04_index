Jesse Jackson and  relatives of the murder victim.  </P> <P> William Neal Moore's defenders call him a "born-again" Christian who has been a  positive influence on others. Moore, 39, had been due to die today in the  electric chair but won a stay of execution from the U.S. Supreme Court. He had  been sentenced for the 1974 murder of Fredger Stapleton, 77, during an  attempted burglary. Moore will be eligible for parole after he has served 25  years, in nine more years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU PRESIDENT SAYS $15-MILLION LOAN TO EASE DEBT  </P> <P> United States International University has received a commitment for a  $15-million loan that would complete a "major step" in the financially troubled  university's debt restructuring, USIU President William C. Rust said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rust, in a prepared release, said the loan will "result in the repayment of all  monetary encumbrances secured by the university's San Diego campus." The  long-term loan was arranged by Federal Home Loans Corp., a private company, and  involves a "consortium of lending source," said Rust. The university did not  identify the individual lenders.  </P> <P> USIU's planned financial restructuring includes "selling some of the  University's assets," according to Rust. One of USIU's major non-university  assets is a majority share of a corporation that owns San Diego-based WUSI-TV  (Channel 51).  </P> <P> Word of the loan commitment came as USIU was responding to an accrediting  organization that recently threatened to revoke USIU's accreditation.  </P> <P> In July, Oakland-based Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, which accredits  senior colleges and universities in California and Hawaii, uncovered "serious  financial problems," inadequate staffing and low morale.  </P> <P> In July, USIU Provost Joseph Merante dismissed the association's bleak report  as "a value judgment." Merante contended that USIU was suffering from a  short-term cash-flow problem. He said serious financial deficiencies mentioned  in the report were the result of a "difference of opinion" on whether USIU  should sell some of its assets to alleviate seasonal cash-flow problems.  </P></p>

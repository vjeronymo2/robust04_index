			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Iosifovich Resin, first deputy </F> chairman of the Moscow Government, by TRUD correspondent Yuriy  Ursov: "Vladimir Resin: `We Are Not Building for the Nouveau  Riche'"; date and place not given]    [Text] The first deputy chairman of the Moscow  Government, Vladimir Iosifovich Resin, is well known not just in  the capital; in addition to Russia's builders, he is also known  by people, most likely, in many governments -- in the former  republics of the USSR. The reason for this is worth seeking in  Vladimir Resin's work history, which is associated with work in  Ukraine, Armenia, the Arctic and Siberia. And in the fact that  Moscow's builders have always been in the public eye, using the  most advanced technologies of civil construction.    Some consider Resin, who has spent nearly 30 years on  erecting new buildings, to be a person who is one of Russia's 10  most influential people, while others try to discern in him the  features of a "moss-covered" conservative party member. But,  both critics and well-wishers agree on one thing -- the chief  Moscow builder possesses a high level of professionalism. How is  a professional supposed to work under the conditions of economic  instability? How are Moscow builders living today? Vladimir  Resin reflects on this in a conversation with a TRUD  correspondent.    [Ursov] Vladimir Iosifovich, in my opinion, you could easily  be retrained as a specialist on the history of domestic  construction.    [Resin] I think is is a bit early to make me into a  chronical-writing patriarch. If only because I firmly believe  that the history and the best traditions of Russian and Moscow  builders are far from finished, even though we are experiencing  times which are not the best. I began as a mining foreman in  Ukraine and worked at large industrial construction projects in  the Arctic and in many other regions, until I was transferred in  1965 to Moscow, my native city. So I had plenty of opportunities  to study construction under the administrative-command system.    Then builders were always the last in line. Considered  valuable were the skill to "dislodge" resources from Gosplan  [State Planning Committee], a loud voice and the ability to  "berate" subordinates at a work-progress meeting. But there was  also another thing: participation in the construction of the  most complicated technological complexes forged the highest  level of professionalism, while working under the most difficult  conditions taught them to find a common language with people and  to organize them, managing collectives which were extremely  complex in their composition. It is likely that this is why we,  figuratively speaking, the "directors of the sixties," easily  converse with one another, understanding our conversation  partner's meaning at once. And conversely: I stumble on some  misunderstanding while communicating with undoubtedly gifted  economists-theoreticians.    But it is correct to say that construction is an industry  which is geared to the maximum extent to the market and, after  all, we "produce" an end product -- industrial projects and  housing, which is one of the most important components of human  existence. This is why I can say that it has become both harder  and easier for the builders to work under the market. Harder  because, previously, the customers courted the builders as one  would a fastidious fiancee. We had a specific selection -- those  for whom we would build and those who would have to wait. But  now it is we who "seduce" the customer -- provided he pays cash.    But, after all, the opportunities to earn a living have  emerged! Here is an example: in Moscow, the turnover of  personnel in contracting organizations has been reduced to  almost zero. Very first-rate specialists, 75,000 people, who  were divided into cooperatives at first and who have now  returned to the normal construction subdivisions. People have  begun to value a job and, consequently, construction quality has  risen and labor productivity is increasing. Incidentally, the  so-called problem of "limiters," thanks to whom Moscow was  built, disappeared. I am, after all, also a unique kind of  "limiter," just like many of the highest leaders.    We managed to retain in Moscow skilled contract collectives.  Thanks to this, it was possible to avoid a calamitous drop in  production volumes, as happened, for example, in machine  building.    [Ursov] These words should be heard by the hundreds of  thousands of ordinary Muscovites who are not burdened by  surpluses of money. I have repeatedly encountered opinions which  go something like this: "so, under the communists, construction  and development flourished, but these democrats are building  nothing and just speculating with finished buildings." And, in  point of fact, nothing like large-scale construction projects  has been noted in Moscow.    [Resin] Perhaps the mass media are at fault in this matter?  After all, this is how it was previously: when a housing area  was built, there were reports in the central and Moscow  newspapers. Now, however, journalists very frequently, in my  opinion, prefer to write about chopped-off heads. Or about  financial frauds. The themes, of course, are also not without  interest. But I follow the rule: it is better to be a  conservative in one's youth than a radical in one's old age. And  it is more interesting to me to read about a working person,  about how, all the same, the country is growing richer and how,  for example, the market is helping to increase the exchanges of  new housing.    [Ursov] And just what do you mean?    [Resin] Of course, if a comparison is made with 1984, the  scope of construction in Moscow has been curtailed somewhat.  But, in the period of the last 3 years, we have been steadily  delivering to the city's inhabitants 3 million square meters of  housing each year. This, take note, is a record in Russia.  Everywhere, the pace of social and housing construction has  fallen sharply. In St. Petersburg, in particular, it has been  curtailed by a factor of 2 or 3. But Moscow is building. Look,  the entire center is being renovated. Gertsen, Ogarev and  Myasnitskaya streets are covered with scaffolding. Here are the  figures: the overall volume of contract work in 1993 amounted to  910 billion rubles. This is 100.2 percent of the 1992 amount in  comparable prices and labor productivity has increased by 5  percent. We have built 26 schools, 30 kindergartens, 12  polyclinics, 4 hospitals and 25 police stations -- all the  figures exceed the 1992 level. Among the unique "piecework"  construction projects are Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Gora,  the Palace of Justice, the "Palace Hotel," the theater on  Pokrovka and a museum for private collections. But a new ZIL  cardan-shaft plant? And a dozen other large industrial  construction projects? All these are here. The skepticism of the  people can be understood: still fresh in their memories are the  promises of the numerous radical democrats who were elected to  the Moscow council on slogans which were bolshevistic-utopian,  so to speak: for everyone -- free housing, which we will take  away from the party members, etc. The worst sort of  unprofessionalism is when it is in power. Currently, we must  "shovel out" the promises of that first "Gorbachevian" wave of  "democrats," which, as I see it, gave the impetus to the  processes of the unjustified destruction of the administrative  [management] system.    [Ursov] The figures you have cited are unquestionably  gratifying. Especially with respect to housing construction. I  am just afraid that they will gladden only those few people who  are capable of laying out more than 10,000 dollars for an  apartment.    [Resin] We will try to investigate. Previously, the state  budget in one form or another basically paid for housing  construction. How many, where and what apartments were to be  built was decided on a centralized basis, although Moscow had a  lot of freedom in the selection of priorities. Now, a  redistribution of funds has occurred: the federal and local  budgets are no longer so all-encompassing and powerful and an  enormous amount of financial and credit resources is  concentrated in non-state banks and commercial structures. It is  clear that they are inclined to use these funds at their own  discretion and it will not be possible to "dislodge" them with a  stick for the construction of municipal housing. What  possibilities does the Moscow government have, however slim, for  moving ahead, so that the people who have entrusted their  futures to the Moscow leaders to a great extent do not become  disappointed in them? We are selling at auction 1.5 million  "squares" of housing and the obtained funds are going for free  apartments. We are transferring the long-term leasing rights to  private residences in the center on the condition that they be  renovated based on the principle: half of the housing goes to  home-building businessmen and half goes into the municipal fund.  Based on the same criteria, we are granting the right to  construct new housing. In my opinion, if some entrepreneurs  manage to accumulate enough money, then they can look after the  remaining, larger part of society, ordinary workers, engineers  and pensioners, thanks to whose labor the main portion of public  wealth has been and is being created. Especially since the smart  entrepreneurs understand this and are doing it willingly.    The people waiting on the lists are receiving a million  square meters of housing annually as a consequence of this  policy of the Moscow authorities. And this is approximately  12,000-15,000 apartments. This is not socialist leveling;  rather, this is a normal approach for our country, where  collectivist principles, compassion for one's neighbor and the  feeling of a human community are traditionally strong.</p>

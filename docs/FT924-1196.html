			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Merseybus sold to staff for Pounds 6m MERSEYBUS, which operates a fleet of 1,000 publicly owned buses on Merseyside, is to be sold to its workforce for Pounds 6m through an employee share option scheme. The deal, which the government approved yesterday, was supported by an overwhelming majority of the company's 2,600 employees in a ballot last month. The company is one of the area's 10 largest employers and has been owned by the county's five metropolitan boroughs through the Merseyside Passenger Transport Authority. The deal restricts Merseybus being sold again within three years and requires the company to join all operator travelcard schemes run locally. Merseybus is the 13th public transport company to be sold. There are 36 bus companies still owned by local authorities. Following the Autumn Statement, councils that sell bus companies by the end of next year will be able to keep all the proceeds, instead of the 50 per cent previously allowed, which will apply again from January 1994.</p>

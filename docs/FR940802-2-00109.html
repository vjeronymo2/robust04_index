			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA does not disagree that the potential for false negative results may exist should be a technology be employed in a screening device that is specific to ethanol only and an individual has consumed methyl or isopropyl alcohol. However, the agency is aware of no screening devices using such a technology. Rather, the screening devices available today on the market generally employ technologies that are not specific to any single type of alcohol, and, therefore, are capable of detecting (but not distinguishing between) ethanol and the other alcohols.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result, and since ethanol is the alcohol most often consumed, we believe that the probability of obtaining false negative results by screeners that conform to these Model Specifications is extremely low. The proposed definition has been adopted without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statistical Accuracy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its February 15 notice, NHTSA proposed to test alcohol screening devices at 0.008 and 0.032 BAC under normal laboratory conditions to determine their precision and accuracy at detecting the presence of 0.020 or more BAC (Test 1), and at 0.000 BAC to determine the performance of these devices when providing blank readings (Test 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The notice explained that the .008 and .032 BAC levels were selected based on criteria for precision and accuracy that are equivalent to those used for EBTs. The criteria require that devices perform at a level of accuracy within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.005 of 0.020 BAC (thereby establishing target valves within 0.015 and 0.025 BAC), and a level of precision which yields a standard deviation not greater than 0.0042. To achieve a confidence rate of approximately 95% in the results of these 20 tests, we proposed to establish measurement points at 1.73 standard deviations (or 0.007 BAC) below and above the lower and upper values, respectively (i.e., 0.015&hyph;0.007=0.008 BAC and 0.025+0.007=0.032 BAC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter expressed the opinion that the proposed method of testing does not truly reflect the accuracy standard of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.005 BAC with standard deviation not to exceed .0042 BAC. This commenter recommended that instruments should be tested instead at the .020 BAC level, that results should fall within the 0.15 and .025 BAC range, and that a deviation of not more than .0042 should be maintained. The commenter's response further stated that, to achieve a confidence rate of 95%, only 5% of the tests conducted should be outside the .015 to .025 BAC range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The method proposed by this commenter would require that devices identify the precise BAC level detected by the instrument. The Model Specifications do not include such a requirement. Rather, they simply require that devices are capable of detecting the presence of alcoholic at the 0.020 or greater BAC level. To accommodate the use of non-numerical as well as numerical alcohol screening devices, the Model Specifications use two test points which are 1.73 times the maximum allowed standard deviation on either side of 0.020  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.005 BAC (0.008 and 0.032). The number of false positives and false negative allowed were obtained based on the use of Student's distribution (a small sample approximation to the normal distribution).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter illustrated a range of error that would be permitted under the proposed Model Specifications, and suggested that the Model Specifications be amended to permit a smaller range of error. Another commenter, addressing the same concern, proposed that the Model Specifications be amended to provide for the adjustment of the test at .032. This commenter recommends that we conduct 20 tests at .025 with no more than one false negative result and 20 tests at .015 with no more than two false positives. NHTSA believes these proposals would require that screening devices perform at a higher level of precision than is required for EBTs. The procedures contained in the proposed Model Specifications have been adopted without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Test Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed to use a Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS), non-alcoholic human breath, and a calibrating unit to test breath devices. For non-breath devices, the agency proposed to use preparations of bodily fluids or scientifically acceptable substitutes. For example, the agency proposed to use aqueous alcohol test solutions equivalent to blood or saliva on a one-to-one basis to test saliva devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter, a manufacturer of a saliva device, expressed its view that there are no fluids that are scientifically acceptable equivalents to bodily fluids. The commenter asserted that aqueous alcohol test solutions lack the viscosity, solid content and inhibitors that are present in bodily fluids such as saliva, and recommended that the agency instead collect saliva specimens from individuals known to be alcohol-free. According to the commenter, the non-alcohol saliva pool could then be spiked with various alcohol solutions for device evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA disagrees with this respondent's comment. The agency has data finding that aqueous alcohol test solutions are acceptable substitutes for saliva-alcohol testing purposes. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  In addition, while we agree that aqueous solutions and saliva do have different characteristics, we have no reason to believe that these difference would interfere with the agency's ability to test the capability of saliva screening devices to detect alcohol content. The final Model Specifications continue to provide that aqueous alcohol test solutions will be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Flores, A.L., Spicer, A. and Frank, J.F., ``Laboratory Testing of a Saliva-Alcohol Test Device by Enzymatics, Inc.,'' Washington, D.C., U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Technical Report No. DOT&hyph;HS 807 893, December 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters recommended that NHTSA use alcohol reference material 1828, obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to prepare all standard solutions. One of these commenters also suggested that, following preparation, these solutions should themselves be analyzed against a referee method (enzymatic or gas chromatography) which has been calibrated using NIST standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Intensive Lobbying is Needed in U.S.- </F> Indonesia Textiles Talks"]    [Text] The bilateral U.S.-Indonesia textiles talks in Bali  concluded in failure, the second time that the talks have  collapsed. The first meeting in Washington also failed to  achieve any positive results.    The United States will definitely reject Indonesia's request  for a 14 percent increase for its textiles and textile products  export quota to the U.S.. It was only willing to grant a two  percent increase. Indonesia, however, rejected the offer.  Meanwhile, no concrete decision was reached in connection with  the U.S. request for wider access to Indonesian markets for its  products because of conflicting and disputed opinions. It  warned that it would impose sanctions against any country which  absorbs or circumvents the quota provided to Indonesian textile  producers.    The warning still remains effective even though Indonesia  was  submissive in reducing its import tariffs on U.S. products,  together with its compliance to reconsider the issue of  circumvention [preceding word in English] and cooperation in  cases where another country sends textile exports to the United  States under the export quota.    Newspapers carried reports on reaction to the failed talks  --  ranging from anger and disappointment to rational agruments.  Indonesia was frustrated by the methods employed in the Bali  talks. In fact, everyone anticipated that the talks would end in  failure. Some Indonesian textile producers stated to the press  last month that they expected the textile talks to fail after  noting their previous lobbying efforts in Washington.    Further talks will collapse if Indonesia does not concretely  provide certain "concessions" to the United States in connection  with its request for wider access for its products in Indonesian  markets, coupled with Indonesia's agreement regarding the issue  of circumvention. These two issues were brought up during the  first round of talks in Washington.    It can be surmised what ensued after the talks.    According to our observations, Indonesia was a bit confused  over certain issues. The United States Trade Representative  (USTR) delegation was headed by one of its deputies, Carol  Miller, a new member to the team. Thus, the assumption that the  new team would speedily deal with the existing problems and  grant Indonesia concessions because the meeting was held in  idyllic Bali, a tourist haven, left Indonesia confounded.    The team came to Bali for the meeting equipped with specific  "trends" set by the USTR in Washington. Should Indonesia find  the concession "card" provided to it unacceptable, then the USTR  would revert to the guidelines laid down by Washington. The  concessions, which provided for a two percent increase over the  previous quota, was given only at the eleventh hour.    Besides, the USTR team arrived for an official business  meeting. A tit for tat [preceding phrase in English]. I will  only give you something if you give me something in return. The  USTR team does not take into consideration any clarification on  national development or argumments concerning advocation of the  nation's and people's interests when dealing with the issue of a  possible increase in the existing textiles export quota.    It would be more justifiable if we could convince the United  States that Indonesia's textiles export is the major mechanism  in warranting the country's economic growth -- the primary  source of non-gas exports, which could provide numerous  employment opportunities.    The Indonesian delegation sought an increase for the  textiles  export quota for only certain categories during the first round  of talks in Washington. The USTR side viewed the request as  solely coming from Indonesian authorities and based on the  country's performance with the export quota, beginning with the  process of distribution until it reached the final destination  in the United States. All this data is in the hands of the  USTR, including the dealings conducted on the quota and the  benefit procured by bureaucrats. One issue which the United  States disagreed on for granting an increase in the textile  export quota was an expansion of textiles and textile products  industries in the Third World. The United states had similarly  asked for such concessions for its industries.    The USTR delegations's talks with the Indonesian side was  definitely based on certain flexibilities and with a give and  take [preceding three words in English] attitude. It should be  acknowledged that such flexibilities were afforded through  intensive lobbying by the Indonesian side.    Lobbying was carried out simultaneously while the Indonesian  delegation was attending the negotiations. The Indonesian  textile producers stated that the lobbying, however, was a bit  too late. That was the reason the USTR delegation had to follow  certain "trends" laid down by Washington during the Bali talks.    Lobbying was previously conducted to ascertain how seriously  Indonesia's request for an increased quota would be taken by the  United States and its demand for concessions for its products to  enter the Indonesian market. The Indonesian Government stands  to benefit from the business circle which has long-standing  personal ties and lobbying access with their U.S. counterparts.  Their influence will not only gain access to the USTR, but also  to the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, the State  Department, The Trade Department, the Agriculture Department,  and the Inland Revenue Department -- apart from the American  business circle's assistance in the lobbying. Our country has a  number of influential businessmen with such capability and  Indonesia could have seized on the opportunity before the talks  commenced in Bali.    Therefore, the success of the bilateral talks cannot be  assured through formal and businesslike [preceding word in  English] talks at the negotiating table, unless the negotiations  are carried out in an informal manner with a personal  relationship. Indonesia can achieve its expectations only  through this method. This was done during the 1989  U.S.-Indonesia bilateral talks on textile trade in Bali.    As such, the opinion of Dr. Mari Pengestu, an Indonesian  economist, is considered convincing as he has proposed that the  country embark on an early lobbying process before the next  round of talks and prior to the expiration of the U.S. textile  quota for Indonesia, which ends on 30 June.    Finally, should there be a third round of talks, Indonesia  needs to field a more effective negotiating team which will be  as equally effective as the USTR team. In the structure of the  U.S. administration, the USTR is a body directly under  presidential jurisdiction and its chief executive official's  status is equivalent to that of a minister. Besides, the USTR  has more jurisdiction than the U.S. Trade Department. Apart  from this, the Indonesian delegation could also incorporate  itself with the business circle which conducts lobbying with the  United States. The business circle is much respected by the  U.S. due to its long-standing personal relations with the  Americans who effect their influence through negotiations. All  this is necessary for the sake of achieving a successful outcome  for the talks, which will be mutually beneficial for the United  States and Indonesia.</p>

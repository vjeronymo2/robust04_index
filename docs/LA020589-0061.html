The budget includes  $45,731 for public service projects, $377,107 for a residential property  rehabilitation program, and $64,716 for improvements such as curbing and  underground utilities at the city's senior housing project, to be built at  153rd Street and Condon Avenue.  </P> <P> Acting Mayor Harold E. Hofmann opposed the city taking responsibility for the  improvements at the senior project, but after some discussion he voted with  Councilmen Larry Rudolph and Dan McKenzie to approve the budget. Councilwoman  Carol Norman voted against the allocations, urging that some funds be set aside  for a truancy program.  </P> <P> Following the recommendation of a Citizens Advisory Committee, the council  approved funds for graffiti removal, a senior nutrition program, the Center for  Independent Living, South Bay Free Clinic, a center for the homeless called  House of Yahweh and the South Bay Youth Service Center.  </P></p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ericsson retains its Swedish style - But the group's background has drawbacks Ericsson, the telecommunications company, provides a reassuring picture for Swedes worried by a swelling tide of foreign influence over the country's industrial bastions. Against examples such as the proposed merger of Volvo's cars and trucks with France's Renault, and the takeover of Nobel Industries by Akzo of the Netherlands, Ericsson stands out as a company that has flourished in a highly competitive industry and which remains firmly under Swedish control. Tomorrow Ericsson, a dominant force in world mobile telecommunications, will announce nine-month results expected to show it well on the way to its target of full-year profits of at least double last year's SKr1.3bn (Dollars 160m). In revenue terms, it ranks sixth among the world's telecommunications equipment suppliers, after Alcatel of France, Siemens of Germany, AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US and Canada's Northern Telecom. Ericsson has seen its share price more than double this year, closing yesterday at SKr408. Along with Astra, the pharmaceuticals group, it has been a driving force in this year's bull market on the Stockholm stock exchange. True, 44 per cent of the company's capital is owned by foreign investors. But its preferential share structure ensures that the joint control of the powerful Wallenberg family and Svenska Handelsbanken is unshaken. Yet Mr Lars Ramqvist, the chief executive, is less than euphoric about the company's prospects in a business undergoing regulatory and technological changes. 'Nothing is for free. I am very pleased with what we have achieved, but I am also realistic. No-one is safe in this business,' Mr Ramqvist said. His worries are multiple. A big concern is that Ericsson can continue to grow fast enough to support the large commitments to research and development required to keep up in the fast-changing telecommunications world. The group spends 22 per cent of its Dollars 7bn annual turnover on R&amp;D - compared to the 11 per cent spent by Alcatel, which has twice Ericsson's turnover. Even with that level of investment, Ericsson must stay on its toes to hold its place in the face of developments such as the push to establish communications super-highways and the emergence of network operator powerhouses such as the Dollars 30bn merger in the US between Atlantic Bell and TCI, the cable operator. Ericsson must contend with newcomers to the equipment supply business, such as computer companies which can challenge suppliers in areas such as systems management. On top of these challenges, Mr Ramqvist is concerned that Ericsson suffers from its Swedish background. It lacks the large home market enjoyed by its main rivals. It swallows about 60 per cent of Sweden's export credits, but still has access to only a fraction of the support available to competitors. Sweden cannot muster the political clout of the US or France, a factor that can be important in winning big state contracts around the world. However, Ericsson has carved out an impressive position in the fast-growing area of mobile telecommunications. It now claims 40 per cent of the world's 20m-strong installed cellular telephone market. Ericsson has been quick to develop digital systems. It dominates the European GSM digital cellular standard and can supply to all the leading different standards adopted by telecoms authorities around the world. This flexibility and geographical spread has given Ericsson competitive advantage and it expects to do well when new cellular wavelengths are licenced in the US next year without a common standard being applied. If industry projections are right that cellular telephone subscribers worldwide will grow in number to as many as 120m by 1998, Ericsson looks well placed to benefit. The company appears to face a tougher time in fixed telephony systems. But it has been spending heavily on upgrading its transmission, switching and network management systems and developing new broadband systems to keep up with moves towards single line multi-media delivery of telephone, computer and television services. And it has entered partnerships in different areas with Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, General Electric and Toshiba to ensure it is not outflanked by its rivals. 'We cannot relax and just collect the money,' said Mr Ramqvist. 'We have just seen the beginning of competition. But we will not easily be knocked down.'</p>

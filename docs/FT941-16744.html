			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Legal timetable spurs councils to sell off bus companies: The reasons behind the privatisation of 25 municipal operations Just when you thought one was never going to arrive they have all come along together. Spurred on by a change in the rules governing their finances, local authorities up and down the country have been racing to sell off their bus companies. Brighton Borough Transport was sold to its employees just before the new year. In recent weeks Southampton City Council and the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority have disposed of their bus operations to their managements. Grimsby and Cleethorpes have sold their jointly owned bus company to Stagecoach Holdings, a quoted bus operator, and Leicester CityBus has gone to GRT Holdings, another bus company. This spate of sales was prompted by a change to the rules which from January 1 required local authorities to devote half the proceeds of assets sales to paying off debt. Before, they could spend the money where they liked. So far, 25 of the UK's 48 municipally owned bus companies have been sold, although it is unlikely, in the absence of legislation requiring them to sell, that all councils will do so. A dozen mainly Labour boroughs are expected to retain control. The 1985 Transport Act requires all boroughs to set up their bus operations as separately managed companies. This same legislation swept away many of the restrictions on bus services and allowed new operators to compete for business. The government's intention was to free the buses from local political interference and the constraints of public spending limits. Operators would be able to raise private sector finance and diversify into other areas of activity. Costs and local authority subsidies have been reduced but continuing declines in the numbers of passengers using the buses coupled with increases in the route mileages run has pushed up average costs per passenger. The most recent annual review by the Transport Advisory Service, a consultancy, showed the average bus company's profit margin (pre-tax profits as a percentage of turnover) at 3 per cent in 1991-92 - better than the 2.3 per cent for the year before but still not enough to allow them to renew their fleets. Some bus operators have blamed the recession for the continued decline in passenger numbers, but others have managed increases despite the downturn. Plymouth Citybus, still municipally owned, has increased passenger numbers by 5 per cent a year over the past five years and converted a Pounds 400,000 annual subsidy into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.3m. The ingredients for a successful bus operation include an aggressive approach to bus frequencies, often combined with a switch from cumbersome double-deckers to mini or midi buses; improved financial controls and a crackdown on costs. Mr Brian Fisher, managing director of Plymouth Citybus, said it had switched from two double deckers an hour on some routes to eight mini-buses. The smaller buses are cheaper to buy, operate and maintain and are nimbler in traffic. Badgerline, the quoted Bristol-based bus operator, put midi-buses on less-travelled routes to allow no opening for competitors, explained Mr Trevor Smallwood, executive chairman. Plymouth Citybus now compiles monthly management accounts within five days of the month end. Previously it produced quarterly ac-counts which took another three months to prepare. Many of the companies involved in the spate of municipal bus company sales are small in terms of the overall size of the market - the planned privatisation in 1994-95 of the 10 London bus companies, with combined revenues of Pounds 370m, will represent a far more significant change. Some people in the industry say the shake-up of the market has only just begun. The next year or so is expected to see several more bus companies taking the route to a London stock market listing. Badgerline and Stagecoach, which together account for 8 per cent of the bus market, are the only two listed bus companies. Possibles for flotation include GRT Holdings, Go Ahead Northern and British Bus. At the same time the large operations are expected to absorb many of the smaller companies. Mr Smallwood said he expected 80 per cent of the local bus market to be dominated by three or four large companies within 10 years. Flotations and mergers may change the structure of the bus industry but organic growth will depend to a large degree on planning policies which favour public transport. Local authorities see car-free zones, bus-only lanes and park-and-ride schemes as ways to reduce traffic congestion. Increasingly, bus companies are working on such schemes with the very local authorities from whose clutches they have just been freed.</p>

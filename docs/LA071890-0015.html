			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> LOW-INTEREST LOANS OFFERED FOR REPAIRS  </P> <P> Although traffic congestion and the water shortage strictly limit new housing  in Ojai, city officials say they have an ample supply of federal low-interest  loans to make home repairs for low- and moderate-income residents.  </P> <P> The city has accumulated $250,000 for a housing rehabilitation program that  began this year. So far officials have begun processing seven loans for home  repairs, averaging $15,000 each. But officials say they need other loan  applicants to take advantage of the low-interest loan program before the  federal grants expire.  </P> <P> "We either use it or lose it," said Elaine Willman, assistant to the city  manager. She said city officials are pleased with the new program because it  helps them provide affordable housing required by the state.  </P> <P> Robert Taylor of the Area Housing Authority of Ventura County said the program  has gotten off to a slow start. "It's like anything new, it requires a lot of  advertisement," he said. The agency runs the program for Ojai under an  agreement finalized in January.  </P> <P> The program provided Ojai resident Betty Cundiff with a new roof for her home  of 50 years, and she won't have to repay the no-interest loan until she sells  the brick bungalow off Park Road.  </P> <P> "I was desperate for a new roof," Cundiff said. "Everything was deteriorating.  Now it's in pretty good shape. I think it will last another 10 years."  </P> <P> Taylor said most of the loans have interest rates of between 4% and 6%, which  result in low monthly payments. Some elderly residents on fixed incomes are  eligible for no-interest loans.  </P> <P> The loans can also be used to cover bank and escrow fees, termite inspection  and eradication, weatherization, some landscaping, and for repairs to satisfy  building and safety codes.  </P> <P> To be eligible, an owner-occupant or renter must have an annual income of less  than $25,000 for a one-person household, rising to a maximum of $44,650 for a  household of eight or more.  </P> <P> "We encourage the homeowners to get their own contractors," Taylor said. "We  just provide the technical assistance." THIA BELL  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR VETOES AIRPORT BILL EXEMPTING COUNTY  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Tuesday rejected legislation that would have exempted  Los Angeles County from a law designed to control growth around the state's  airports.  </P> <P> Under current law, county planners have until 1992 to fashion comprehensive  land-use plans to ensure that commercial and residential development around Los  Angeles International Airport and the county's other airports -- including  those in La Verne, El Monte and Burbank -- are compatible with flight safety  and noise control regulations.  </P> <P> Those supporting the bill to exempt the county from this requirement argued  that such plans are unnecessary because land around most local airports already  is densely developed.  </P> <P> But in vetoing the bill Tuesday, Deukmejian said, "Without such planning,  airports and the businesses surrounding them may be forced to close as  development encroaches" because the increasing population would put airports in  violation of state law.  </P> <P> The governor's action is the latest twist in a controversy that surfaced in  1989 after Deukmejian signed a bill to put teeth into a 20-year-old requirement  for land-use planning around airports statewide. That measure prompted an  outcry from a number of Los Angeles County cities complaining that their  planning authority around airports would be usurped by the county.  </P> <P> The exemption proposal was introduced by Sen. Robert G. Beverly (R-Manhattan  Beach), who earlier this year successfully shepherded legislation that gives  Los Angeles County an extra six months to comply with the law. But in vetoing  Beverly's follow-up bill, Deukmejian said he would not allow the law to be  eased any more.  </P> <P> Clancy Leland -- a lobbyist for Los Angeles County, which pushed for passage of  the exemption measure -- said he was unsure if the proposal will be revived  next year.  </P> <P> Leland complained that the current law is "so vague, so general, it doesn't  tell you what you are supposed to do."  </P> <P> Other critics of the current law have argued that Los Angeles County's Regional  Planning Commission, designated by state law as the airport planning agency,  does not have the staff to handle the workload involved in planning around  airports.  </P></p>

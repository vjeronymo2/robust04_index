			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- The welfare state has reached  the limits of its capacity, according to Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  The future of Germany cannot be dealt with using the principles  of "a leisure park," Kohl said today addressing the CDU/CSU  [Christian Democrat Union/Christian Social Union] industrial  committee in Munich.    The CDU leader announced a "tough austerity course" for  1995.  The watchword in the future must be "rethinking, not  redistribution." Kohl said that the cornerstones of the tax  program for the next period in office are to be submitted in the  near future. Under this program, a cut in business tax is  proposed to protect Germany as an investment location.    In view of the increasing competition on world markets, the  German economy can no longer allow itself to stay in second-last  place among the EU countries in terms of machinery utilization  times, Kohl said. The chancellor noted "encouraging signs" in  the progress of the economy despite the existing problems. He  highlighted the recent "sensible wage agreements," the cuts in  key interest rates by the German Bundesbank, and the low  inflation rate. He said that the major challenge is  unemployment. To preserve Germany as an investment location,  high-performance elites will have to be called for and accepted  again.</p>

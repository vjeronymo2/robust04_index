			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / German engineering employers revoke eastern pay deal GERMANY'S engineering employers are abandoning an agreement to bring east German wages up to the level of their west German counterparts by 1994. The decision is likely to provoke a major confrontation between IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, and Gesamtmetall, the employers' federation. It could lead to a wave of strikes among IG Metall's 300,000 workers in eastern Germany. More than 10,000 workers in Chemnitz, Saxony demonstrated on Wednesday against any attempts to revoke the contract. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the deputy chairman of IG Metall, yesterday described the employers' decision as a 'spectacular breach of the law'. It would not be accepted without a struggle. Mr Hans Peter Munter, head of Saxony's Metal and Electrical Industry Association, said the contract was no longer valid because the economic circumstances in both west and east Germany had deteriorated considerably since it was signed in March 1991. Mr Munter repeated yesterday that the employers were prepared to award the engineering and electrical workers in the five east German states a 9 per cent rise for 12 months from April 1. IG Metall has insisted, on the basis of the 1991 contract, on a 26 per cent pay increase for its members starting from April 1. East German rates in the sector are currently 71 per cent of western rates. A 26 per cent pay rise would take this to 82 per cent of western rates. Productivity levels in the east are about 70 per cent below west German levels, and unit labour costs are 140 per cent higher. Union officials in Berlin said arbitration talks would begin today, despite the breakdown of talks earlier this week in Saxony and Thuringia. But Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin, said Gesamtmetall would try to use yesterday's announcement to break off talks in the capital. 'It's not only the breach of contract, and the 26 per cent pay rise we are fighting for,' he explained. 'It is for the whole future of collective wage bargaining, which has existed since the war. That is the real issue for us,' he said. Union officials are now considering what action to take. They could go court and try to prove that Gesamtmetall had broken the contract, or ask workers to go the courts if they do not receive the 26 per cent increase, or call a strike. Failure to reach a compromise could mean the breakdown of central wage bargaining between employers and unions as employers seek local deals.</p>

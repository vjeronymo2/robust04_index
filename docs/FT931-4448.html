			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Canadian transport Sweeping changes in Canada's transport sector, including the privatisation of Canadian National Railways have been proposed by the National Transportation Act Review Commission, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Under the proposals, foreigners will be allowed to own 49 per cent of a Canadian airline, up from the present 25 per cent, and all transport subsidies will be phased out. Canada's central bank rate declined 23 basis points yesterday to 5.66 per cent from 5.89 per cent a week earlier. The total decline since late last November is now 316 basis points and the Canadian dollar has weakened after two weeks of continuous strength. The banks were expected to drop their prime lending rates to 6.25 per cent, a 20-year low.</p>

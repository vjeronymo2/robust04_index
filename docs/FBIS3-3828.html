"We pursue many important common goals on a bilateral,  regional and global basis," Christopher said in his article  published in THE WASHINGTON POST today.    "Our economic interests are also converging," he said,  "China's explosive growth is increasingly attractive to American  exporters and investors."    "We are determined to expand American participation in the  Chinese market. China has an even more significant stake in  open and profitable access to the American market," he added.    Christopher said that the U.S. Administration's foreign  policy stands for open societies as well as open markets and  "this balance shapes our approach toward China."    He said that the purpose of his recent trip to Beijing was  to  inform China's leaders of the need to make further progress on  human rights and to reaffirm U.S. intentions to engage China  constructively on the many issues where the interests of the two  countries coincide.</p>

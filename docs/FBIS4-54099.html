			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 25 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has notified  the United Nations Command (UNC) that it has established "the  Korean People's Army representative mission at Panmunjom" to  replace its component of the Military Armistice Committee, the  UNC announced Wednesday.    A command spokesman said the UN Command plans to ask North  Korea, which unilaterally withdrew from the Armistice Committee  recently, to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the committee  soon to discuss the issue.    North Korean Army Lt. Colonel Yu Yong-chol made the  notification on Tuesday morning at Panmunjom, in his capacity as  chief liaison officer for the newly organized mission, when he  contacted UNC Lt. Colonel R. Flury, the command reported.    North Korea, however, told the command that it would  maintain  its telephone lines at the joint duty officers' room at  Panmunjom.    North Korea unilaterally withdrew its representatives from  the Military Armistice Committee on April 27, demanding the  Korean armistice agreement signed in 1953 be replaced by a peace  accord. Pyongyang also sought the withdrawal of the Polish  representative from the communist side of the Neutral Nations  Supervisory Commission.</p>

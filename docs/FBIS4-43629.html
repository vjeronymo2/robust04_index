			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Radical Liberals and </F> Christian People's Party To Fight On Against the Bridge"]    [Text] Despite the defeat after Sweden's yes to the  Oresund bridge the Christian People's Party and the Radical  Liberals will not be abandoning their fight against the project.  Now the responsibility for the "blunder" must be placed at the  right door, Jens Bilgrav-Nielsen (Radical Liberal Party) has  said.    Despite sympathy with their Swedish sister party, the Center  Party, the Danish Radical Liberals are not taking inspiration  from Swedish Environment Minister Olof Johansson and leaving the  government. Alongside the Christian People's Party, the Radical  Liberals will, however, continue their fight against the Oresund  bridge.    Radical Liberal Folketing group chairman Jens  Bilgrav-Nielsen  stressed yet again that the Radical Liberals -- although the  bridge cannot now be stopped -- will use it in the election  campaign. He is also demanding that the responsibility for the  "blunder" be clearly placed where it belongs -- such as, the  Audit Department's study of the bridge's economic aspects.  According to Bilgrav-Nielsen the parties that support the  bridge have a giant problem because the Oresund bridge cannot be  paid for by those people who will use it.    Ole M. Nielsen, the Christian People's Party's finance and  environment spokesman, stressed that the matter has not been  removed from the political agenda here in Denmark.    "We will continue to work for a sober and realistic  reappraisal of the whole project. We will therefore, if  necessary, bring the matter into the context of government  formation negotiations after the elections," he said.    From the environmental viewpoint it is "a tunnel we need"  and  "as far as finance is concerned, there is still no reason to  think that the figures will hold," Ole M. Nielsen said.    The Socialist People's Party is now demanding that when  seeking tenders the Oresund Consortium should seek bids for a  tunnel which, according to Greenpeace, could be built for 9.5  billion kroner.    "I agree with Olof Johansson that the project is  misconceived, environmentally incorrect, and expensive," party  group chairman Steen Gade said.    He praised the Swedish environment minister for leaving his  post after Prime Minister Carl Bildt's "power play."    "But the battle is not lost until the contracts with the  entrepreneurs are signed," Steen Gade said.</p>

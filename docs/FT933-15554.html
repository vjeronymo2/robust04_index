			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Private cash sought for 30% of CrossRail THE GOVERNMENT hopes that private investors will fund at least 30 per cent of the cost of the CrossRail project to build two tunnels under central London. Ministers anticipate a public contribution of between Pounds 800m and Pounds 1.2bn, leaving a possible 60 per cent of funding for the Pounds 2bn scheme to be raised from the private sector. But they believe moves to revamp inflexible design and project-management procedures could conceivably shave Pounds 300m off the final price-tag. This could leave just Pounds 500m for the private sector to make up. CrossRail would enable passengers travelling on suburban trains into British Rail's Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to reach the West End and the City without having to change to the Underground system. It is central London's biggest public transport project since the Victoria line opened in 1968. Ministers hope to be able to inject competition by asking potential investors how much financing they would be prepared to provide, given certain fixed assumptions about future fare levels. They indicate that the size of the public contribution would be based on quantifying the project's wider benefits such as reduced traffic congestion and other environmental benefits. One possible source of private funding which is under consideration by ministers is a new London transport trust that would draw its income from a levy on businesses - perhaps in the form of a business rate increase. A penny on the business rate in greater London would raise more than Pounds 100m - enough by some estimates to support about Pounds 1bn in bond issues. Ministers see an opportunity for introducing such a levy relatively painlessly following the 1995 rating revaluation. This is expected to see the burden of business rates shift away from the south-east towards the Midlands. By some estimates, the rates bills of offices in the City could more than halve. The timing could fit neatly with CrossRail which is thought to be at least 18 months away from full clearance, following last month's second reading of the parliamentary bill needed for it to go ahead. The government's drive to attract private finance to projects such as CrossRail is motivated by the urgent need to modernise the country's infrastructure at a time when the spiralling public sector borrowing requirement is forcing it to crack down on public spending. London First, the business-led initiative set up last year to promote strategic thinking about the capital, estimates that more than Pounds 17bn will be needed over the next 10 years to fund the renewal of London's rail and underground systems and to finance new projects. Current government investment plans will provide only half of what is needed over the next five years. During last month's second reading debate Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said the government wanted the private sector 'fundamentally' involved in CrossRail. He said the government was not contemplating a project to which the private sector 'might merely make a small contribution'.</p>

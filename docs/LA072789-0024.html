			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP!: SALVATION OF CARL'S SOLE CAN BE A STICKY SITUATION  </P> <P> Carl Camp of Granada Hills is wondering whether it is still possible to buy  glue-on soles for resoling shoes; lately he has not been able to locate any.  Can you help Camp squeak by just one more time, or is he no shoo-in to ever get  his sole saved?  </P> <P> Bernd Ahrens of Pasadena has been frustrated in efforts to locate short-sleeved  blue-and-white and red-and-white checked sport shirts. Can you see to it that  Ahrens keeps his shirt on, or will his new dress code force him to pay cash  from now on?  </P> <P> James Graham of Arcadia is looking for someone who can hand-braid a wool rug  for him. Can you give him a hand with this, or might Graham just as well start  woolgathering because everybody's trying to pull the rug out from under him?  </P> <P> For a daughter with three young children, Mrs. J. H. Bukaty of La Mirada needs  a Flip-It bathtub drain stopper, a metal disk that opens and closes with a  little lever. Can you apply some leverage before the babies throw the mother  out with the bath water, or will this be another hope that goes down the drain?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: Because her family has grown, Bonnie at (714)  496-1507 needs a few additional Charles Eames dining room chairs -- molded  plywood with molded plywood legs; the ones she has now were bought in 1948.  Please see to it that her family won't have to stand around forever while  dinner is being served. . . . Patti at (714) 860-4446 or (213) 829-6811 will be  happy to pay for an M&amp;M wristwatch that was given away by the candy company  as a promotional item a year or so ago; at that time, she was busy elsewhere,  and now the company says they have no more in stock. Please give Patti  something to chew on so that the next time she won't watch precious seconds  tick away.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> Last week, when we published Lyla's request for a Dressie Bessie doll, we  listed an incorrect phone number. So, if you have information for Lyla, please  be a doll and call her again. The correct number is (714) 951-1083.  </P> <P> For C. H. Walker of Downey, who wanted an antique lamp shade replaced, we have  only one definite ray of light. A Lawndale reader says she does this type of  work as a pastime, so we sent her phone number to Walker. If anyone else is  interested in having antique lamp shades worked on, please send us a stamped,  self-addressed envelope and we will forward it.  </P> <P> Leonard Ross of Hollywood, who needed to replace glass chimneys in  Colonial-style wall lamps, may not have to climb the walls after all. Neal  Singleton of Okell's Fireplace, 134 Pacific Coast Highway in Hermosa Beach,  (213) 376-3448, says he may be able to help Ross. June Jordan of Walnut  mentioned the Lamp &amp; Shade Shop, 147 W. Badillo St., Covina, (818)  339-7278. And Robin Brisco of Tustin suggests Kona Lighting, 8372 Katella Ave.,  Stanton, (714) 828-0910; they are open only Wednesday to Saturday. (These last  two places might also be able to help C. H. Walker find a lamp shade.) In  addition, we have a mail-order source: Renovator's Supply, Millers Falls, Mass.  01349, telephone (413) 659-2211 (submitted by an anonymous Long Beach reader).  </P> <P> Hain cannot answer mail personally but will, space permitting, respond in this  column to readers who need -- or have -- helpful information. Write (do not  telephone) to You Can Help!, You section, the Times, Times Mirror Square, Los  Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

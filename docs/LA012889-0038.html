			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS  </P> <P> Last week I had the unhappy experience of burying my father, a veteran of World  War II. Sadly, when I first saw my dad's casket covered by the American flag, I  felt a confused mixture of emotions: On the one hand, my father had earned the  flag (as I did mine in Vietnam), but on the other hand the flag has in recent  months been made to symbolize an opportunistic and often empty patriotism for  which neither my father nor I have anything but contempt.  </P> <P> During the presidential campaign, my dad and I had been able to laugh at Bush  and Jim Baker's ludicrous efforts to turn our national symbol into a partisan  emblem; it was only standing in front of that casket that I realized what they  had stolen from us just making that effort.  </P> <P> George Bush had better be one hell of a President because he now has a long way  to go just to get back to zero with me.  </P> <P> JEFF ASHLEY  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

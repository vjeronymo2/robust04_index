			<p><P> September 8, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS SUE TESTING FIRM OVER DISQUALIFIED SCORES  </P> <P> More than two dozen students from a La Crescenta high school filed suit  Thursday against the Educational Testing Service, claiming results of their  advanced placement exams were invalidated without justification.  </P> <P> The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles alleges that the national  testing organization in Princeton, N.J., violated Crescenta Valley High School  students' right to due process when it invalidated exams given in May because  seven of the 79 students were caught cheating.  </P> <P> The suit asks for unspecified damages and the reinstatement of the test scores  of students who did not cheat on the exam. The tests are scheduled to be given  again on Saturday and Sept. 16 and 23.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson denied the students' request for an order  postponing the retesting until the court rules on whether the original test  scores should be released, said Craig N. Rossell, attorney for the students.  The judge set an Oct. 31 trial date on the suit.  </P> <P> Most colleges give credit for introductory college courses to students who do  well on the exams, which students can take in either their junior or senior  year of high school.  </P> <P> But 13 of the La Crescenta students who took the tests will be enrolled in  college for months before they get their scores.  </P> <P> The cheating was revealed in May after several students conveyed their  suspicions to school administrators.  </P> <P> Several days later, seven students admitted that they had copied the answers of  other students or opened test booklets too soon.  </P> <P> Parents of students who filed the lawsuit have sought to have the scores  reinstated for those who did not cheat for more than a month.  </P> <P> "We feel that these kids are being punished for being honest," said Sheryl  Wirt, whose daughter, Melissa Dodd, will have to enroll in two biology classes  at UC Irvine while she awaits the results of the retest.  </P> <P> "They've prepared for these exams for nine months," Wirt said.  </P> <P> "Now, not only will they have to go through the whole grueling experience  again, but they won't do as well."  </P></p>

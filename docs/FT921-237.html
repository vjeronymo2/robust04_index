			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / TV plan to show company meetings COMPANIES are to be offered the chance of broadcasting their annual meetings on national television for Pounds 60,000 an hour. BMH Communications, a company set up by film producer Mr Bryan Hall, has signed a deal with BBC Select, the corporation's subscription arm, for access to night-time hours on BBC 1 and BBC 2. The service, being marketed as The Business Channel, would transmit between 2am and 6am. No decoder or special equipment would be needed. Broadcasts would be listed in Radio Times. Detailed talks are already under way with utilities which have large numbers of individual shareholders following privatisation. The first deals are expected to be signed soon and broadcasts could go out before the summer. The Pounds 60,000-an-hour charge will include both the BBC's and BMH's fees, but not production costs. The Business Channel will be able to broadcast the full proceedings of an annual or extraordinary meeting, but says it will not be allowed to advertise specific products. Mr Paul Ellis, BMH chairman, said the service could lead to a large increase in the number of shareholders who could see what was going on at AGMs. Mr Ellis, a private investor in the scheme who is also a director of Crown Communications, the company which owns the commercial radio station LBC, believes the venture could eventually transmit up to 250 hours of broadcasts a year. If successful, the scheme could generate additional work for independent television production companies. BBC Select has about 2,500 night-time hours a year to use for special and subscription services.</p>

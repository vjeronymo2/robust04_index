			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Quick switch to the attack Sir, We are all entitled to change our opinions, but your art critic, William Packer, seems to have been persuaded to change his extraordinarily quickly. In his account of the Jerwood Painting Prize ('Damned by lack of controversy', September 24) he attacks most vehemently the decision of the judges to award the prize to Craigie Aitchison. Yet only two weeks earlier he welcomed the purpose of the prize ('Excellence is the only criterion', September 10), saying it was long overdue and 'what a relief it is to confront a shortlist that is entirely acceptable. There is no token presence and each artist has a chance of winning - well worth a punt'. William Packer is also inaccurate in saying that one of the judges, Judith Collins, is deeply distressed. The choice was accepted by all the judges except Hilton Kramer, who has made his views known. Peter Wakefield, chairman of the judges, Jerwood Painting Prize, Jerwood Foundation, 22 Fitzroy Square, London W1P 5HJ</p>

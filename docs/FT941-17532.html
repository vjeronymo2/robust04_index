			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Analysts predict PSBR will fall to Pounds 37bn The chancellor's decision to raise taxes and cut public spending has led to sharp revisions in the forecasts of 39 analysts surveyed by the FT last month. Mr Kenneth Clarke's measures, announced in the Budget, have convinced economists from the City, academia and independent think tanks, that the public-sector borrowing requirement will drop to about Pounds 37bn this financial year and Pounds 30bn in the next. In the last FT survey, in the spring, forecasters believed the PSBR would be Pounds 42.5bn in this financial year. Economists are sharply divided over what Mr Clarke's tactics will do to the recovery, particularly in the spring when tax increases are introduced. Mr Robin Aspinall, of Panmure Gordon, who has the highest forecast for unemployment both this year and next, said: 'The Budget will stop it (the recovery) dead in its tracks.' Mr Gerard Lyons at DKB takes a similarly gloomy view. 'The Budget was too tough,' he said. 'In view of the weak international environment I thought the Budget was very risky, the biggest risk being that the savings ratio remains high and consumer spending is weaker than the Treasury expects.' Others are less downbeat. Mr Michael Saunders, of Salomon Brothers, said: 'The Budget will not have a dampening effect on growth, provided it is offset by a long period of low interest rates.' The state of the housing market also prompts contrasting views. Mr Alan Davies, of Barclays Bank, said: 'The housing market recovery should definitely gather momentum, boosted by pent-up demand, the fact that affordability is at its lowest for several decades and the widespread availability of fixed-rate mortgages.' But Mr Richard Freeman and Mr David Thomas, of ICI, said that the slow growth of real incomes and further cuts in mortgage interest tax relief would 'retard any recovery' in the housing market. Mr James Barty, of Morgan Grenfell, said: 'The housing market will not surge in 1994. It is closely linked to real incomes and these will be squeezed.' The vulnerability of the economy, according to many of those surveyed, is on the consumer side. Mr Richard Jeffrey, of Charterhouse Tilney, said: 'The most important figures to watch will be the monthly retail sales figures. Should they begin to falter towards mid-1994, it will be a warning that the recovery, itself, is under threat.' Mr Peter Warburton, of Robert Fleming, who has the lowest forecasts for consumer spending both this year and next, said: 'This Budget contains little encouragement for employers to increase labour use or for households to borrow more confidently. If neither employment nor credit growth has revived in six months' time, then Mr Clarke will rue his single-minded Budget.' One surprise in the Budget was the Treasury's forecast for the current account this year. It predicted that the deficit on the current account would be Pounds 9.5bn this year, roughly half the deficit it was forecasting in March. Many of the economists have followed suit, although the consensus for this year is some Pounds 3bn higher than the official forecast. Cambridge Econometrics, which has one of the lowest deficit forecasts for this year and 1995 - Pounds 5.2bn and Pounds 1.8bn - expects a big improvement in earnings from interest, profits and dividends. Indeed, a sharp improvement in invisible earnings appears to be the assumption behind most of the more optimistic forecasts for the current account. But Mr Neil MacKinnon at Citibank said: 'Normally economic recovery is associated with a widening trade gap. I see no reason to believe that the balance of payments constraint has become a thing of the past.' Both this year and next year, the consensus forecast for underlying inflation - retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments - falls within the government's target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. In line with the generally benign inflation forecasts, most of the economists surveyed believe average earnings growth will remain subdued. Average earnings - currently rising at a rate of 3 per cent - are forecast to be growing by 3.9 per cent at the end of this year and 4.7 per cent by the end of next. Optimism here reflects pessimism on the jobs front. Even though unemployment is falling, most economists clearly believe that the growth forecast for the next two years will not be enough to make a significant dent in today's high levels. Mr Peter Dixon, of DRI Europe, said: 'In 1994, better prospects should lead to a pick-up in employment growth, but this will be constrained by the need to restore margins.' Mr David Kern, of National Westminster Bank, expects unemployment to fall to 2.5m by the end of 1995 and to remain above 2.2m during the remainder of this decade. Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, who would normally have contributed to the survey, was unable to take part because of work commitments in the US.</p>

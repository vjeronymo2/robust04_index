			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Future of health chief in doubt over payments THE FUTURE of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, the controversial director-general of the World Health Organisation, has again been put into question by revelations yesterday of financial irregularities involving payments to executive board members. In January, Dr Nakajima, a Japanese, was re-nominated by an 18-13 majority of the 31-strong board to serve a further five-year term, amid allegations of vote-rigging. The renomination, which was opposed by the US and the European Community, is subject to confirmation by the WHO's 183 members at the World Health Assembly next month. This confirmation, previously assumed to be a formality, must now be in doubt following yesterday's release of a report confirming irregular payments by WHO's external auditor, Britain's Comptroller and Auditor General, Sir John Bourn. Dr Nakajima is bound to come under strong pressure from western governments to withdraw, in order to avoid adamaging row in May. A spokesman for the US mission in Geneva said Dr Nakajima had mentioned the option of resigning in a private meeting on March 29 with Mr James Sarn, a senior official in the US Health Department. While the auditor's report imputes no blame to Dr Nakajima personally, it details five dubious contracts in the second half of 1992. All involved Japanese funds and executive board members, and all were approved by Dr Yugi Kawaguchi, a fellow Japanese and Nakajima protege who is director of planning, co-ordination and co-operation. Of the five contracts, totalling Dollars 215,000, only one - though by the far the biggest at Dollars 150,000 - was found to breach existing WHO procedures. The others, all relating to travel expenses, highlighted shortcomings in WHO financial controls. A WHO statement said Dr Nakajima had noted 'with satisfaction' that no fraud had been uncovered and would 'soon' be announcing 'several organisational changes and administrative measures, including personnel actions'. Mr Denis Aitken, WHO's assistant director-general for administration, said yesterday the report revealed 'lapses, shortcomings and deficiencies' for which 'we all take responsibility'. The worst case involved a Dollars 150,000 research grant to a Philippine institution run by an executive board member for a project of questionable value.</p>

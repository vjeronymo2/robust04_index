			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Reinvasion Moves of Japanese Militarism" </F> -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese  reactionaries are now zealously joining the United States in its  policy of stifling the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,  fully revealing the wild ambition of revived militarism for  reinvasion, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    The Japanese reactionaries are going ahead with legislative  arrangements to quickly send "Self-Defense Forces" to the Korean  peninsula in "the event of contingency," declaring that they  will take an active part in "collective security measures" in  case "sanctions" were taken against the DPRK, the analyst says,  and continues:    They are crying over the DPRK's "nuclear threat" so  hysterically for the purpose of converting Japan into a military  power equipped with nuclear weapons under that pretext and  realising with the backing of the United States the old dream of  "the greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" which Japan failed  to do in the past.    To dominate Asia is the invariable design of the Japanese  reactionaries. It is to this end that they are now making haste  with the conversion of Japan into a military power and her  nuclear armament. They intend to divert the worldwide  denunciation elsewhere from Japan and justify their moves to  turn Japan into a military power armed with nuclear weapons by  widely spreading the rumor about the DPRK's "nuclear threat."    They are also scheming to stage a comeback to Korea and  other  Asian nations by actively partaking of the aggressive military  actions of the United States.    The peace and security of Northeast Asia and the  Asian-Pacific region are gravely threatened by Japan.</p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Satellite and cable offer excellent choice Sir, So who does have original programming on television these days, Christopher Dunkley could have asked before he savaged cable and satellite channels ('Scrambled Sky at a premium', August 25). Look at the schedules for that day. At peak time, 9.30pm, all four terrestrial channels had repeats. Of course they also produce lots of their own material. So, in time, will the cable and satellite channels in the UK - just as, for example, Discovery's US parent is doing after only a few years in business. It already has fresh programming: last month it showed the four-part series, The Dinosaurs, later repeated by Channel Four. Both Sky News and CNN International carry original programming of the most expensive kind all day (including FT Reports). I, for one, would not be without them. Meanwhile, this weekend the cable and satellite sports channels had live cycling, motor racing, motorcycle racing, horse racing, golf, tennis, athletics, soccer and rugby league. Not to my taste, perhaps not to Mr Dunkley's. But to offer such programmes is hardly 'repackaging parasites'. What is wrong with repeats, anyway? The BBC has revived a 1960s cult by digging out Thunderbirds and today it is dedicating the whole day to a celebration of that decade. Is this very different from having Sunday's choice of The Six Wives of Henry VIII and Oliver Twist on UK Gold, Brighton Rock and Loot on Bravo?

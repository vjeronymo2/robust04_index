			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POPCORN POPS UP AS NEW WAY TO PACK BREAKABLE ITEMS  </P> <P> Businessman Steve Sommer didn't like feeling guilty about possible damage to  the environment, so he started substituting popcorn for plastic foam packing in  the boxes he uses to ship foods.  </P> <P> He has a lot of company from other entrepreneurs in his area.  </P> <P> Popcorn, said Sommer -- the same food people munch in the movies -- "is  naturally biodegradable, so you may feed it to the birds or use it as mulch in  your garden," adding that it is probably too stale for human consumption.  </P> <P> Sommer figures also on a tidy fallout for his Alexander Fruit &amp; Trading Co.  He thinks that packaging-popcorn sales might rival his existing $500,000-a-year  gourmet wine and food company. Prospective customers are excited by the idea,  he said.  </P> <P> Still, there are important questions about the unique use for the exploded  kernels of hard corn. It has to possess all the right cushioning properties.  </P> <P> "We've just started using it and we haven't had any complaints from customers  yet," said Janet Churchill, packaging boss for Montessori Services in Santa  Rosa, Calif.  </P> <P> The welcome mat for popcorn-for-plastic also was offered by Joan Graham,  co-owner of a Sonoma crafts gallery, Good Day Sunshine.  </P> <P> She said she started looking for a substitute for plastic packing when some  customers mentioned that plastic is ecologically unsound and reflected badly on  her business.  </P> <P> Buyer John Clark, whose company distributes plastic foam packing, said his  company, Santa Rosa Paper, is interested in popcorn but is awaiting a general  ruling from United Parcel Service on whether it can be used in any shipping.  </P> <P> Unlike the butter-flavored, $2.50-a-pint stuff served in movie houses, Sommer  charges about $15 for a 14-cubic-foot bag of oil-free popped corn. That's $4  less than the cost of the same volume of plastic foam kernels. Sommer estimated  a 30% profit.  </P> <P> Sommer said he is working with a chemist to discover a way to hold popcorn  together in large shapes such as those used to pack stereo components and other  fragile devices.  </P></p>

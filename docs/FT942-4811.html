			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Polly Peck assets set for early sale Administrators to Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate formerly controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, expect to sell its main remaining assets in the next year. Mr Chris Barlow, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, who has taken over as a joint administrator from Mr Michael Jordan, said yesterday the group's holdings in electronics groups Vestel and Sansui were likely to be sold in the next few months. Preliminary estimates suggest that proceeds from all the remaining assets may raise more than Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m). Mr Barlow was speaking as a copy of the latest six-monthly report on Polly Peck's administration was circulated to the group's creditors. It says a draft statement of claim is being finalised for a potential legal action against Stoy Hayward, Polly Peck's principal auditors, and approval to begin proceedings will shortly be sought from a sub-committee of creditors. It sticks to its previous estimates that creditors will ultimately receive a dividend of 3.7p to 12.5p in the pound, and that there is 'no likelihood' of any payments to shareholders. Unsecured creditors will receive proceeds through an entity called Arvi, which has claimed assets owned by Polly Peck's Dutch holding company, Holdings BV. Arvi will receive between 27 per cent and 39 per cent of the assets, depending on the outcome of possible litigation with two other claimants, Finance and Finance NV, which owe certain creditors. Polly Peck International receipts since it entered administration in October 1990 were Pounds 101.8m at May 24 this year. Payments were Pounds 100.1m - of which Pounds 33.7m went to the administrators and other professionals.</p>

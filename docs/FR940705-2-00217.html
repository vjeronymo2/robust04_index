			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This appendix will be considered for revision as experience in evaluating proposals accumulates and as new scientific developments occur. This review will be carried out periodically as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposal involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects will be considered by the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA only after the protocol has been approved by the local Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board in accordance with DHHS Regulations for the Federal Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46). If a proposal involves children, special attention should be paid to subpart D of these DHHS regulations. The Institutional Review Board and Institutional Biosafety Committee may, at their discretion, condition their approval on further specific deliberation by the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA. Consideration of human gene transfer proposals by the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA may proceed simultaneously with review by other involved Federal agencies (see Appendix M&hyph;VII&hyph;A) provided that NIH/ORDA is notified of the simultaneous review. Meetings of the full RAC and its subcommittee will be open to the public except where trade secrets or proprietary information would be disclosed. The committee prefers that proposals submitted for RAC review contain no proprietary information or trade secrets, enabling all aspects of the review to be open to the public. Public review of these protocols will serve to inform the public about the technical aspects of the proposals as well as the meaning and significance of the research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The clinical application of recombinant DNA techniques raises two general kinds of questions: (i) the questions usually discussed by Institutional Review Boards in their review of any proposed research involving one or more human subjects; and (ii) broader issues. The first type of question is addressed principally in Appendix M-I of this document. Several broader issues are discussed throughout Appendix M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix M-I requests a description of the protocol with special attention to the short-term risks and benefits of the proposed research to the patient and to other people, the selection of patients, informed consent, privacy, and confidentiality. Appendix M-II addresses special issues pertaining to the free flow of information about the clinical trials. These issues lie outside the usual purview of Institutional Review Boards and reflect general public concerns about biomedical research. Appendix M-III summarizes guidelines for submission of human gene transfer protocols for RAC review. Appendix M-IV specifies reporting requirements. Appendix M-V describes the procedures for Accelerated Review of human gene transfer experiments. Appendix M-VI describes the procedures to be followed for Expedited Review of single patient human gene transfer experiments. Appendix M-VII contains the footnotes to Appendix M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

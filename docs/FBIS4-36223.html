			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that President Yasir 'Arafat's  state of health is not reassuring. He is suffering from  irregular heartbeats, fever, and acute influenza, in addition to  a deteriorating morale and nervous system.    Reliable sources told AL-MAJD that 'Arafat's health is more  serious than declared and that his aides are extremely worried  about his health although they downplay the seriousness of his  illness in their public statements.    'Arafat's entourage was split over his treatment. One team  proposed transferring him to the al-Husayn Medical Center [in  Amman]. Another team proposed summoning a French medical team  to treat 'Arafat in Tunis and thus keep his critical health  condition a secret.    'Arafat, weakened by the plane crash in the Libyan desert,  has recently been exposed to many psychological and political  pressures which exacerbated his health condition and greatly  sapped his strength.    One of his aides told AL-MAJD that 'Arafat's fear of the  self-rule experiment, the opposition forces' firm refusal to  participate in the National Authority, and the failure of  Europe, America, and Japan to provide him with the promised  billions, in addition to the abstention of many personalities  from supporting him and sharing power with him, have made him  susceptible to anxiety, sleeplessness, constant tension, and  loss of balance and concentration. The close aide added: What  can Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] do when he finds that his closest  companions like Faruq Qaddumi, Khalid al-Hasan, and Muhammad  Jihad have disappointed and abandoned him? They object to his  plans and refuse to accept any post he is proposing to them.    Concluding, the aide said with a sigh: "I am afraid that  Abu-'Ammar's proponents and opponents have started to think of  the stage after him and of the need to fill the leadership  vacuum expected after his departure."</p>

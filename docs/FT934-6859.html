			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Technology: Project control by disc Britain and other donors and lenders lose large sums on overseas projects because no one can check paper and computer records to see if contracts were awarded to best effect. Linesman, in Nottingham, England, has spent four years developing a way to change that, while getting projects completed more quickly and efficiently. The company supplies software for personal computers which can help control projects, from the initial ordering to the hand-over of equipment to users, with maintenance information on disc. The software pulls together the common equipment required for different sites, making it feasible to place larger orders with manufacturers, instead of smaller ones with many different suppliers. Under the system, bidders for contracts make their offers on disc. The buyer, or whoever is financing the deal, can easily scan the offers; if a competent supplier bid the lowest but did not get the job, this becomes plain. The software also helps plan how best to collect equipment for shipping - not to a warehouse but to the sites where it will be used. Tecquipment, a UK company, is using Linesman software to equip 120 laboratories in 33 Turkish universities with more than 55,000 pieces of equipment of 3,500 different kinds. The software is also being used on a USAID-funded scheme for equipping seven agricultural schools in Egypt and on World Bank-funded schemes in Hungary and Kazakhstan. Kevin Whitt, Linesman's managing director, spotted the need for the company's system while selling educational equipment in the Middle East. He realised this was often delivered without the appropriate information and saw the importance of reforming the whole procurement process. He formed Linesman after winning a competition for a procurement system for Hong Hong's University of Science and Technology.</p>

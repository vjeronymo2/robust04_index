			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 3 (TANJUG) -- The spokesman of the  special U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi, Micheal Williams, said Friday  [3 June], quoting a telephone conversation with Gorazde, that  the withdrawal of the Serb forces from the three kilometer  exclusion zone around Gorazde, eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, had  started but that it was still not satisfactory. Williams told a  press conference that cease-fire talks would not go ahead until  the last element of the Serb militia, army and the last armed  civilian of Serb nationality leaves the three-kilometer  exclusion zone around Gorazde. He also said that the latest  situation in the region was presently being discussed by  UNPROFOR commanders for former Yugoslavia General Bertrand de  Lapresle and for Bosnia-Herzegovina General Michael Rose with  the officials of the Bosnian Serb Republic President Radovan  Karadzic and bosnian Army Commander Ratko Mladic.    Williams told the press that two formations of Canadian blue  helmets were dispatched from Sarajevo to Gorazde Friday morning  as reinforcements to ensure that the demands for the Serbs  withdrawal from the three-kilometer diameter are being complied  with. According to Williams, the premier of the Muslim-Croat  federation and head of the Muslim delegation Haris Silajdzic was  currently in Paris. He did not specify if he was there for  consultations. The vice-president of the Muslim-Croat  federation Ejup Ganic, and the delegation accompanying him, is  on his way to Zagreb and is due to reach Geneva Friday evening.    The Muslim delegation conditions its participation in the  cease-fire talks with the withdrawal of the Serb forces from  around Gorazde. If the Serbs withdraw Akashi could reschedule  the cease-fire talks for Friday evening or Saturday morning,  Williams said. If the cease-fire talks start on Saturday, the  meeting of the contact group on the territorial division of  Bosnia-Herzegovina between the warring Muslims, Serbs and  Croats, scheduled for Saturday, will be postponed by 24 hours.    The meeting of the contact group with the Bosnian warring  sides was initially scheduled for June 6 and 7 in Talloires,  France, but the French Foreign Ministry Thursday postponed the  meeting to June 4 and 5 in the French Embassy in Geneva. It  could now be further postponed by another 24 hours.</p>

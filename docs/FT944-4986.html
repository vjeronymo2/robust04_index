			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Leading Article: A transport levy Mr Kenneth Clarke last week sweetened the pill of renewed cuts in public infrastructure investment by promising that the government's Private Finance Initiative would fill much of the gap. On paper, however, the UK chancellor's grand Budget forecasts were a triumph of hope over two years' disappointing experience. Most are agreed that modern governments should seek new ways to involve the private sector in transport and other large-scale infrastructure investments. The UK government's answer, first launched in 1992, was the PFI. This may yet win over the many doubters, but only a handful of projects has managed to meet the combined objections of the Treasury and would-be private investors. The Corporation of London yesterday proposed a rather different, and promising, approach to bridging the private-public divide: an 'Infrastructure Fund for London', financed by a levy on local businesses, to be raised alongside business rates. The fund, if supported by a majority of local companies, would be used to support efficiency-enhancing investments throughout the area, thus, it is hoped, raising London's commercial value and attractiveness to investors. The Treasury - and the government - will have many quibbles with the proposal. But a business levy would have the advantage of linking payment for infrastructure improvements more directly to the ultimate beneficiaries, namely local property owners. Many details have yet to be worked out, but the government would be foolish to let its fondness for PFI blind it to the benefits of a better way.</p>

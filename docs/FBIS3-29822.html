The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Today our  people are filled with the burning resolve to defend our party  politically, ideologically, and with life in the face of any  tribulations and storms and to share fate with the party to the  end.    The meetings to take an oath of loyalty to the great leader  [yongdoja] to the end were held in institutions, plants,  enterprises, cooperatives, schools, units of the Korean People's  Army [KPA] and the Korean People's Security Forces, [word  indistinct] in the mountains, television stations, [word  indistinct] islands, and even on navigating trade ships.    The meetings were attended by the people of all strata  throughout the country, including old anti-Japanese  revolutionary fighters, who are seniors of our revolution;  veterans of the fatherland liberation war; functionaries of the  party power organizations and the working people's  organizations; workers; farmers; soldiers; intellectuals; and  youths and students.    Officers and men of the three services of the KPA held a  meeting at the face of the native home of the historic Mt.  Paektu secret camp. At the meeting, the KPA officers and men  deeply expressed the conviction that as long as there is General  Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of our revolutionary Armed  Forces, the one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary forces will be  powerful and ever-victorious. They solemnly pledged to firmly  uphold the chuche-oriented revolutionary cause by fulfilling the  missions assigned by the country, people, times, and revolution.    They chanted slogans, which showed their firm pledge to  become a fortress and shield to defend with armed forces our  supreme commander, to become rifles and bombs, and to smash any  strong enemies in a stroke under the great commander's  leadership.    Heroic working classes of each district plant and enterprise  -- such as Musan coal mining complex, Kim Chaek iron-steel  complex, Namhung youth chemical complex, other large-scale  extracting bases, metallurgical bases, and large-scale chemical  industry bases -- solemnly resolved to uphold Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the fate of our nation and incarnation of victory and  glory, as the pillar of faith and will for good.    Agricultural working people, who are accelerating final  preparations for new year's farming with the single resolve to  glorify this year marking the 30th anniversary of the  publication of the socialist rural theses with bumper crops,  took an oath of loyalty on the occasion of the significant  February national day.    In the meetings held at various cooperatives, including  Mangyongdae cooperative, Chongsan cooperative, and Wonhwa  cooperative, agricultural working people pledged to firmly  uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, to brilliantly  implement the party's agriculture-first policy, and to discharge  the mission of revolutionary fighters who should glorify the  socialist fatherland with grain.    Intellectuals across the country, who live and struggle with  the glory and pride as our party's eternal companions, loyal  defenders, and good advisers, took an oath of loyalty to bring  into full bloom the worthwhile life of the revolutionary  intellectuals, by more firmly rallying around Comrade Kim  Chong-il, father [oboi] and great teacher [widaehan susung] of  valuable political life.    Youth and students throughout the country, like the young  communists who followed Hanbyol during the dawning of the Korean  revolution, took an oath of burning loyalty to live a genuine  life as the youth vanguards of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il and to create miracles and feats in difficult and tough  outposts to defend and glorify the socialism of our own style  centered on the popular masses, that is, the life and living of  our people.    The oath of loyalty taken on the historic February holiday  is  the unprecedented expression of infinite respect and loyalty to  the great leader [yongdoja], who provides our people with the  most valuable dignity and happiness in the world. The oath of  loyalty is also the demonstration of the firm faith and fidelity  of the people of all strata and officers and men of the  revolutionary Armed Forces to believe and follow Comrade Kim  Chong-il, who is the fate and loadstar of our nation, like the  God, and to resolutely defend and glorify the socialism of our  own style to the end.</p>

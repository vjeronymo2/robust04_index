			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Three commenters asked why section 3 is administered by the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The commenters stated that since section 3 is actually implemented in public and Indian housing, and housing, and community development programs, it should be administered by the offices for these programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has delegated the functions and responsibilities of the Secretary under section 3 to the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO). The delegation of authority to the Assistant Secretary for FHEO dates back to the issuance of the first regulations for part 135 in 1973. One of the reasons for delegating responsibility to the Assistant Secretary for FHEO is that, nationally, a disproportionate number of low- and very low-income persons residing in family public housing developments, and in neighborhoods receiving housing and community development assistance, are racial and ethnic minorities, a group that has been subject to discrimination in employment, housing, financing and other areas. Since section 3 specifically pertains to matters of employment (whether individual hiring or through the award of contracts) FHEO is the office with expertise in addressing matters of discrimination in employment. This expertise will be beneficial in addressing complaints of recipient or contractor noncompliance with section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Twenty-eight commenters stated that the rule imposes a tremendous administrative burden on recipients and a costly one. The commenters stated that additional Federal funding is needed to undertake the monitoring and reporting and recordkeeping required by the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department acknowledges that compliance with section 3 is not without cost or burden to recipients and contractors, but that burden, in large part, is imposed by statute. The statute requires recipients, their contractors, and subcontractors, to provide, to the greatest extent feasible, economic opportunities to low- and very low-income persons. To meet this statutory requirement, recipients, contractors, and subcontractors must undertake certain actions and efforts to make low- and very low-income persons aware of economic opportunities generated from the expenditure of HUD financial assistance, and to encourage their application for these opportunities. The statute requires the Secretary of HUD to ensure that economic opportunities generated from the expenditure of HUD financial assistance are being directed, to the greatest extent feasible, to low- and very low-income persons. To meet this statutory requirement, the Secretary of HUD must solicit certain information from recipients to ensure that they are undertaking the actions and efforts required by statute. The Department, however, has made every effort to minimize the burden on recipients and contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to comments on the proposed rule, staff from the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity invited various groups representative of recipients, contractors, and residents for an informal meeting held at HUD Headquarters on February 23, 1994, to discuss the monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements proposed to be imposed on recipients by the October 8, 1993 rule. (A summary of the meeting's discussion, and a list of the attendees at the meeting is part of the docket file for this rule.) Following consideration of comments at this meeting, in addition to comments received on the proposed rule, the Department has revised the rule. The interim rule reduces, to the greatest extent possible, the administrative burden on recipients from that set forth in the October 8, 1993 proposed rule. The ways in which the administrative burden has been reduced were discussed in Section V of the preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters stated that the Department must commit to working closely with housing authorities to implement and comply with the new section 3 regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) has announced a 30-site technical assistance initiative beginning in FY 1995 to help recipients understand their section 3 responsibilities and to help them design and implement effective programs and procedures to make training, employment and contracts available to section 3 residents. FHEO is planning to provide further guidance through participation in conferences with associations representing recipients and contractors. With support from the private sector, FHEO is developing detailed guidance material that will assist recipients and residents with understanding section 3, and the responsibilities imposed on recipients. Additionally, the FY 1995 legislative proposal would make expenses associated with implementation of section 3 eligible costs under section 3 covered programs. Further, the FY 1995 Budget includes a request for funding to establish ``economic opportunity centers'' that will link low-income persons with jobs and contracts generated by HUD-assisted projects and activities. These centers will provide technical and financial assistance to qualified residents, as well as assistance to HUD recipients in recruiting, training and hiring of low-income persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other commenters stated that the rule should require recipients to provide training and other supportive services to low- and very low-income persons to ensure that these persons will be qualified for employment opportunities that become available through section 3 efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated in Section V of this preamble, section 3 does not require recipients or contractors to create training programs for low- and very low-income persons, or to create or provide any other services to low- and very low-income persons solely for the sake of providing opportunity programs for low- or very low-income persons. Section 3 requires that where section 3 covered assistance will generate economic opportunities (i.e., not out of necessity to serve low- or very low-income persons, but out of necessity to serve the employment or contracting needs of the recipient or contractor), these opportunities must be directed to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters offered suggestions on implementation of section 3, including establishing section 3 target zones in which individuals residing in those zones would be given the section 3 preference; maintaining the affirmative action plan that is currently required in the codified part 135 regulations; providing a financial reward to recipients and contractors that exceed minimum section 3 requirements; providing for ``first source'' agreements with resident councils and community organizations; and establishing permanent section 3 committees in each jurisdiction to oversee the planning and implementation of section 3 within the jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department is appreciative of all these suggestions and others that were offered by commenters. The statute does not permit the Department to adopt many of the suggestions made by the commenters. The Department believes that the streamlined procedures and increased flexibility provided in the interim rule will make for effective implementation of section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Assistance/Program Covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that section 3 should apply to programs that serve purposes similar to programs funded by sections 5, 9, and 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The commenter specifically cited the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program, which is similar to the section 14 modernization grant program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the statute is very specific concerning the types of public and Indian housing assistance covered by section 3, to the extent that any HUD housing or community development assistance is expended for housing rehabilitation, housing construction or other public construction, the HUD assistance is covered by section 3, and that would include assistance provided under the Urban Revitalization Demonstration Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that section 3 should apply to housing and community development programs administered by other Federal Agencies. The commenter noted that the Department of Agriculture has not only the Farmers Home Administration rental and homeownership programs for low-income people, but water and sewer community development programs, and the Department of Commerce administers a number of programs designed to stimulate small businesses and other investments that promote the development of communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> QUE PASA?;  </P> <P> PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> * Attorney John Huerta has joined Los Angeles' Western Center on Law and  Poverty as a specialist in land use and housing law, and he has also been named  to the city's new Affordable Housing Commission.  </P> <P> "I enjoy helping poor people, the people who don't have the means to assert  their rights," said Huerta, once an attorney for the Mexican American Legal  Defense and Educational Fund. "In today's legal market, people with low and  moderate income cannot afford attorneys," he said. Huerta said his goal on the  commission "is to make more affordable housing available in Los Angeles for  low-income and moderate-income individuals -- not just in ghetto areas." EDWARD  J. BOYER  </P></p>

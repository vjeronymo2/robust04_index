			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / After Kalms' speech - vigilance or vigilantes?: The Dixons chief's suggestion that stores will have to become fortresses to fight crime IN SPAIN, licensed vigilantes carrying revolvers are employed to guard some retail chains. In the US stores display signs boasting their prices are low not because they are such efficient retailers, but because 'we have theft under control'. The suggestion on Tuesday by Dixons chairman Mr Stanley Kalms that UK retailers might have to adopt vigilante tactics and turn their stores into 'fortresses' to deal with a rising tide of crime may not have been welcomed by all retailers. But its substance met with little disagreement. The British Retail Consortium believes crime costs UK retailers at least Pounds 2.5bn a year. The true figure may be much higher because many retailers do not bother to report small crimes as there is little chance of getting a conviction. Marks and Spencer, the UK's biggest clothing and food retailer, says the problem is 'the equivalent of a Brink's Mat bullion robbery every four days'. M&amp;S says: 'Some people think retail crime is relatively insignificant because it is seen as victimless. But it makes victims out of all of us because we are paying for it every time we do our shopping.' The company says customers are paying up to 1p out of every Pounds 1 to cover the costs of crime. Mr Kalms focused on the problem of organised crime, describing how 'alternative entrepreneurs' robbed shops, often through ramraiding, then sold the goods through an elaborate network of 'squatter stores' and car-boot sales. But shops suffer from a range of problems, from petty pilfering - sometimes by their own staff - and casual shoplifting, to attacks on staff and, increasingly, armed robbery. Credit-card and cheque fraud are also thought to cost retailers up to Pounds 300m a year. A survey in 1991 by Touche Ross, the management consultancy, found retailers spending an average of 0.3 per cent of turnover on security measures. For large retailers with turnovers of billions of pounds that represents tens of millions of pounds of investment in security. It also found that stores were increasingly investing in sophisticated computer systems, video equipment and alarms rather than relying on store detectives. Mr Kalms said crime and investment in measures to prevent it were costing Dixons Pounds 20m a year. M&amp;S says it is losing Pounds 30m a year through crime, and spending Pounds 21m on combating it. The subject is a sensitive one, some retailers being wary of creating too much of a fuss, or making their security measures too visible, for fear of intimidating shoppers. M&amp;S, however, says its own research suggests shoppers are reassured by visible security measures such as cameras and guards. It may have been frustration at the unwillingness of many retailers to talk openly about the problem that prompted Mr Kalms to speak out. But some believe he has gone too far. Mr Frank Pegg of Volumatic Systems, a manufacturer of security devices with 30 years' experience of advising retailers, says: 'Things are getting worse in the retail trade, and we all appreciate that today's crime is tomorrow's price rise, but I don't think what Mr Kalms said was helpful. To say British shopkeepers are being forced to adopt vigilante tactics is a bit much, and may put off shoppers.' One large store chain suggests Mr Kalms has 'overstated the case'. Retailers also feel he is wrong to criticise the police. Certainly, his remarks did not go down well with the Metropolitan Police, who described his jibe that the police were little more than a data-collection agency as 'absolute nonsense'. Most retailers say they do not agree with his vision of 'vigilantes' patrollingshops and shopping centres. Mr William Hucklesby, head of group security at Sears, and chairman of the security committee of the Oxford Street Association, says it is 'vital that retailers should work in partnership with the police'. He agrees that the police need more resources. Action is being taken at an industry level to deal with the problem. The British Retail Consortium has launched a special initiative on crime following a meeting of retailers in January with Mr Ian Jack, Home Office minister. The meeting agreed to fund jointly a director for the initiative - recently named as Mr John Burrows, a partner in Morgan Harris Burrows, a consultancy specialising in crime risk management, and a former security adviser to Dixons. The initiative plans to develop a database on the extent of retail crime, something on which neither the Home Office nor the police now has reliable information. By monitoring the success of the initiative, it hopes to produce recommendations on best practice for consortium members. The security industry, meanwhile, is developing ever more sophisticated methods of dealing with retail crime, and has seen a big increase in its business. The British Security Industry Association says total turnover of member companies grew from Pounds 1.1bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.4bn in 1992. Spending on closed-circuit television equipment rose from Pounds 37m to Pounds 64m. In addition to physical barriers such as laminated glass, reinforced shutters and car-traps to deter ramraiding and smash-and-grab raids, stores can choose from a range of in-store technology. Modern closed-circuit television systems can produce a high-definition image of suspect shoppers even at considerable distances. Radio-based product tags which activate alarms at shop exits have long been common in the fashion business, but are increasingly being replaced by electromagnetic tabs which can be incorporated into bar codes on even the smallest items and deactivated when the item is scanned at the check-out. But Mr Grenville Peacock, chief executive of the Bentalls department store chain in south-east England, warns that tagging can be of little use against the hardened criminals who now attack shops. 'Shop crime is becoming much more blatant, much more open, much more daring. It's difficult to deal with because you are exposing your people to being thumped - or worse.'</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Royal Mail performance pay plan for managers THE ROYAL MAIL is to pay senior managers bonuses worth up to Pounds 20,000 if they meet new efficiency, profit and individual targets. The inducements are aimed at putting the Post Office on a footing akin to that in the private sector by introducing 'a strong business culture' into the corporation. Managers taking charge of the nine independent business centres, replacing the old 64 divisional districts early next year, will be offered bonuses worth up to a quarter of their salaries, which are expected to range from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 60,000. Mr Bill Cockburn, Royal Mail managing director, re-fused to say whether there would be penalties for those who failed to meet the targets. He said: 'If they are not successful there are a whole range of things we can employ to make them successful.' Managers of the new business centres, organised in geographical areas, will be in charge of their own pay bargaining, quality of service and profit-and-loss accounts. They will also be expected to generate initiatives aimed at boosting profits and turnover. Mr Cockburn said: 'They will have much more freedom to think up their own ideas on how to generate additional profits. They will be judged on specific individual targets related to their personal performance.' That might lead to fierce competition between managers in different areas. If the manager in charge of Scotland, for example, initiates a scheme that increases productivity, those in the rest of the country will be under pressure to trump it with an idea of their own. In a separate move, the Post Office has established a joint body with the Mail Users' Association, a pressure group that claims to represent businesses with postal bills totalling Pounds 40m a year. The Postal Forum, which will also include representatives from other trade organisations, such as the British Direct Mail Association, is aiming to improve postal services.</p>

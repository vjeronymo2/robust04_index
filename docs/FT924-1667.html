			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Brazil economy minister Krause resigns office BRAZIL'S economy minister, Mr Gustavo Krause, resigned yesterday. This first big upset to the government of President Itamar Franco heightened the country's economic instability and provoked fears of a return to state interventionist policy. Mr Krause, whose job was taken over by Planning Minister Paulo Haddad, decided to quit after Tuesday night's presidential decree suspending the privatisation programme for three months - a decision Mr Franco took in a meeting attended by none of the economic team. The third economy minister in two years, Mr Krause was criticised for lacking experience and he survived only two months. His departure had been predicted since Mr Franco rejected a document outlining government economic strategy prepared by Mr Krause and Mr Haddad. The president criticised their insistence on maintaining high real interest rates to contain inflation - now 25 per cent a month. The departure of Mr Krause and the suspension of privatisation suggests that those within the government favouring free-market policies are losing out, and is heightening fears of a return to more a state interventionist policy and abandonment of the modernisation programme. However, at a news conference in Braslia, Mr Haddad said the government remained committed to free market reforms and rejected any plans to control prices or wages. But Mr Fernando Gentil, president of ING Bank, described the resignation as 'at the very least a detour in Brazil's path towards modernisation.' Yesterday the central bank had to intervene heavily to contain a rush on dollars and gold and the price of Brazilian debt on the secondary market fell to just 25.5 cents in the dollar - the lowest in Latin America except for Peru. Although Mr Franco has reiterated his commitment to privatisation and issued a new timetable of sales, investors fear the suspension shows his true colours.</p>

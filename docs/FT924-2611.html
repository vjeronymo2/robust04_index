			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Midlands shows 24% advance - Improved efficiency gives boost to regional electricity companies SHARP COST reductions helped Midlands Electricity raise pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 33.4m for the half year to September 30, in line with expectations. The outcome was achieved on turnover up by almost Pounds 44m to Pounds 661m. The West Midlands-based utility is raising its interim dividend to 6.35p, against 5.65p last time. This is expected to be about one third of the year-end total (17.25p). Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman and chief executive, said the strong financial performance had been achieved while reducing tariffs, increasing investment in the electricity distribution network, and continuing to improve customer service. The interim result reflected the seasonal nature of Midlands' business, with the first half producing a weaker result than the second. In the core electricity business, distribution activities earned an operating profit of Pounds 61.2m, up slightly from Pounds 60.2m in last year's first half. The supply business lost Pounds 23.7m - an improvement on last year's interim loss of Pounds 32.1m, which became a profit of Pounds 8m in the full year result. The retailing and contracting businesses were both in the black, with a combined operating profit of Pounds 2.4m. Mr Richard Young, managing director, said cost reductions played a big role in the result. The company has cut its payroll by 500 in the past two years, and overall costs were down 4 per cent. Mr Peter Chapman, finance director, said gearing had been reduced to virtually zero, with a resulting fall in interest charges. He expected to repay remaining government debt early next year. Midlands' policy would be to pay dividends on the back of solid earnings growth which matched that of other regional electricity companies, Mr Chapman said, although he declined to state specific numbers. Earnings per share were up 20 per cent on last time at 11.3p. COMMENT The combination of solid earnings gain and further strengthening of the balance sheet confirmed Midlands' place as one of the better favoured recs. Key points in the result are further gains on the cost reduction front and continued fall in gearing. True to its conservative style, the company refused to be drawn into specific dividend forecasts yesterday, and the pay-out was slightly below expectations, which may have accounted for the 2p shed by the share price. However, the result gives only a partial indication of the full-year outcome because of the heavy weighting of the second half. Although the electricity supply business repeated its heavy first-half loss, it was less than last year's and points to a profit in double figures for the full year. The shares show a prospective yield of 5.6 per cent, putting them at the low end of the rec range.</p>

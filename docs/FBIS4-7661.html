			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 3 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel said today he had never favoured much a bicameral  parliamentary system, but stressed that the Constitution had to  be respected and therefore the Senate should be elected this  year.    Speaking in his regular Sunday radio programme "Talks from  Lany", Havel said that if the parliamentarians reached the  agreement that the Cezch Republic should have a unicameral  parliamentary system, this would require not only "the deletion  of several articles from the Constitution, but the rewriting of  the whole Constitution." The way of filling the second chamber  of the parliament, Senate, is currently the object of a broad  and often heated discussion in the government coalition.    The strongest coalition party, the Civic Democratic Party  (ODS) of Premier Vaclav Klaus has insisted on the elections to  be held in 81 one-mandate constituencies. In the first  elections the constituencies would be divided into three groups:  In the first senators would be elected for two years, in the  second for four years and in the third for six years. Under the  Constitution the senators are to be elected for six-year terms  with one third of them being replaced every two years.    The three other coalition parties have proposed 27  constituencies each of which would have three mandates in the  first elections and one mandate in the following balloting. The  elections would probably be held in the autumn along with local  elections. Elections to the existing Chamber of Deputies are  scheduled to be held in 1996. The deputies are elected for  four-year terms.    Havel welcomed the compromise solution proposed by deputies  at the end of March. Under it three senators would be elected  in 27 "large constituencies." Each of them would comprise three  smaller ones which would make a total of 81 as proposed by the  ODS. Havel said this would not breach the Constitution.</p>

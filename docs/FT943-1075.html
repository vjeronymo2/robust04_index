			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Jardine prompts Hang Seng shake-up The Hang Seng Index will receive one of the biggest shake-outs in its recent history in November with the replacement of four constituent stocks. This will be followed in February with another round of switching, this time affecting three shares. The changes were sparked by the de-listing of the five companies in the Jardine camp. From March 31, only Jardine International Motors will remain listed. The Jardine group is withdrawing its secondary listing over regulatory concerns which analysts believe mask a deeper fear about the post-1997 administration. The group is currently the focus of an attack from Beijing, which wants to see the Jardine consortium ejected from a key container terminal project. On November 30, Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings will be withdrawn from the Hang Seng Index, one month before they quit the exchange. At the same time, Lai Sun Garment and Winsor Industrial Corporation will be withdrawn following their under-performance of the market. The four will be replaced with Amoy Properties, Guangdong Investments, whose interests span securities, travel and transport, hotels and property, Johnson Electric Holdings and Oriental Press Group, the newspaper and publishing group. On February 28, the remainder of the decamping Jardine companies - Dairy Farm International Holdings, Hongkong Land Holdings and Mandarin Oriental International - will be replaced by Shangri-La Asia, the hotel group controlled by Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok; Sino Land, the property company chaired by Singaporean Robert Ng; and South China Morning Post (Holdings), Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper now also under the control of Mr Kuok. According to the latest stock exchange figures, the departing stocks are worth a total HKDollars 161.4bn (USDollars 21m) while the newcomers represent HKDollars 143bn.</p>

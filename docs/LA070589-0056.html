			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: HOLD THAT TIGER  </P> <P> Hurray for the Red, White and Blue. A rare white tiger owned by illusionists  Siegfried and Roy has given birth to three cubs in Osaka, Japan, where the  entertainers are appearing. The tigress, Sitarra, has mothered 12 of the 17  white tigers born into the Siegfried and Roy collection, the largest privately  owned collection of white tigers in the world. The new additions, born on the  eve of the Fourth of July, will be named Red, White and Blue in honor of  Independence Day. The German-born illusionists, Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy  Horn, became American citizens last October shortly before opening a six-month  engagement in Japan. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

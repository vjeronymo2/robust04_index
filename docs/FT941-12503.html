			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Japan's PM averts crisis with diluted reform deal Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night averted a crisis which had threatened his survival by watering down his controversial proposals for political and economic reform. The deal with the opposition Liberal Democratic party was struck at a last minute meeting with Mr Yohei Kono, LDP president. Failure to reach a compromise could have fatally undermined Mr Hosokawa's five-month-old government and stalled its plans for an economic stimulus to pull Japan out of recession. The agreement represents a big concession by the seven-party coalition, but it keeps the important principle of scrapping Japan's system of multi-seat electoral districts, blamed for encouraging corruption by pitting candidates from the same party against one another. It will go to a parliamentary panel for ratification this morning. Plenary sittings of the upper and lower chambers will be asked to vote on the government's original bills later in the day, on the understanding that amendments will be made in the next session, starting next week. A simple majority is needed before midnight tonight when the present session expires, along with unvoted bills. Success is likely, because the lower house approved Mr Hosokawa's original reform plans by 270 to 226 last November. Senior politicians on both sides were yesterday confident of success. However, the compromise was immediately criticised by anti-reformists in the LDP, suggesting it will further split the opposition. Mr Yoshinobu Shimamura, a member of the LDP's conservative Watanabe faction, said Mr Kono had no right to strike such an accord on the party's behalf and called for fresh discussions. A senior member of the Social Democratic party, the largest coalition group, said it accepted the plan. 'It was a hard decision, made with pain, but it was unavoidable,' said Mr Koken Nosaka, director of the party's Diet administration committee. Many Socialists have reservations over political reform, fearing it will further damage their electoral performance. Mr Hosokawa was forced to negotiate changes with the opposition after his original plan was voted down in the upper house of parliament last Friday by the LDP with the help of Socialist defectors. The compromise would replace the present 511-seat lower house of parliament with a 500-seat chamber, of which 300 members would come from single-seat constituencies with the remaining 200 elected by proportional representation from 11 regions. Politicians would be allowed, as at present, to receive corporate donations, but they would only be allowed to employ one fund-raising group, rather than several, as now.

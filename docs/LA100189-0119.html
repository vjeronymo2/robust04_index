			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JARRYD, GILBERT PREVAIL IN SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> Unseeded Anders Jarryd of Sweden upset fifth-seeded Kevin Curren, 3-6, 7-6  (7-5), 7-5, Saturday to advance to the final of the $425,000 Volvo tennis  tournament in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Jarryd will play third-seeded Brad Gilbert, who defeated Kelly Evernden of New  Zealand, 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-2).  </P> <P> Jarryd said he grew stronger as the match progressed.  </P> <P> "I picked up my game a little bit," he said. "This surface (an indoor  rubberized sheet) suits my game very well. The way I'm playing now, I am very  confident."  </P> <P> After neither player broke serve in the second set, Jarryd took a 4-0 lead in  the tiebreaker. Curren rallied to gain a 5-4 edge, but Jarryd evened the score  with an unreturnable serve and then hit a cross-court backhand passing shot to  win the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl, the world's top-ranked tennis player, defeated Jaime Yzaga of Peru,  6-3, 6-3, to reach the final of a $255,000 tournament at Bordeaux, France.  </P> <P> Lendl will meet second-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain in today's final. Sanchez  defeated France's Jean-Philippe Fleurian, 6-7 (8-6), 6-4, 6-1, in the other  semifinal.  </P> <P> Sanchez had a tough time with Fleurian, who had previously upset third-seeded  Horst Skoff of Austria and fifth-seeded Goran Prpic of Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> After losing the first-set tiebreaker, Sanchez held to win the second set. He  then dominated the third set, winning six consecutive games after Fleurian held  service in the first game.  </P> <P> "I was doubting myself after the first set," Sanchez said. "But I felt I could  win because I knew it would be difficult for him to keep up the pace."  </P> <P> Said Fleurian: "I did very well in the first two sets, but my legs gave out."  </P> <P> After struggling in the previous two tournaments, Lendl had no trouble beating  the fourth-seeded Yzaga. In the first set, Lendl broke Yzaga's service in the  third and ninth games when Yzaga faltered.  </P> <P> Argentina's Guillermo Perez-Roldan, the seventh and only remaining seeded  player, rallied to beat Pavel Vojtisek of West Germany, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, and  reach the final of a $123,400 tournament at Palermo, Italy.  </P> <P> He will face Paolo Cane of Italy, who defeated eighth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic  of Yugoslavia, 6-4, 6-3.  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova defeated Betsy Nagelsen, 6-2, 7-5, to win the women's  tournament at Haverford, Pa., for the third consecutive time.  </P> <P> After three consecutive service breaks to start the match, Navratilova never  again allowed Nagelsen a break point.  </P></p>

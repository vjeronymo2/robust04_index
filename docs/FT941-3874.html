			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Investors optimistic on inflation - New York In recent weeks, long-term US interest rates have climbed rapidly amid growing concerns about resurgent inflation and the concerns have spread to the stock market, where prices have struggled to make headway in spite of mostly bullish news on the economy. This week, the stock market will have the opportunity to judge for itself whether inflation is really on the rise again, and some good news should allow stocks to shake off their inflation fears. Tomorrow, the February producer prices index is released, and a day later, the consumer prices index is published. Although analysts expect the two indices to show slightly stronger growth than in January (the brokerage house Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette forecasts that both the PPI and CPI rose by 0.4 per cent last month), the inflation alarm bell is likely to stop ringing. If analysts' forecasts prove correct, the annual consumer inflation rate will measure close to 2.4 per cent. That is a full point below the comparable rate recorded at the same stage of 1993, a remarkable reduction considering the economy over the past two months has been growing at a significantly faster pace than in the same period a year ago. A hint of how the markets are likely to respond to favourable inflation reports came last Friday, when after a poor start, share prices rose steadily on the back of declining bond yields. Stocks firmed on Friday as investors turned more optimistic about this week's inflation data. Above all, they were able to take a step back from some of the economic, and political, analysis that disrupted trading earlier in the week. Yet, even if the inflation picture brightens, political problems that have unsettled investors recently are unlikely to fade into the background especially quickly. Most of Wall Street agreed by the end of last week that the fuss the bond market, and later the stock market, made over rumours swirling around the Whitewater affair was overdone, but the White House is unlikely to emerge from the clouds of the 'scandal' particularly soon. As long as the perception holds that President Clinton is politically hampered by the growing inquiry into Whitewater, and by press revelations of a possible cover-up, then it is of concern to investors. Why? While that is not easy to answer, it is often said that if the President gets into deeper trouble, so does his political agenda, which includes such a market-sensitive programmes as healthcare and welfare reform. Politics aside, the stock market's immediate future depends on what happens next to long-term interest rates. The yield on the 30-year government bond has leapt more than 100 basis points, to 6.9 per cent, since October. While the yield may edge a bit higher from here, bond investors may soon realise the Treasury market correction has gone far enough. This scenario would give the stock market some much-needed breathing room, and allow investors to digest the events of the past few weeks in a more considered fashion.</p>

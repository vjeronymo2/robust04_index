The evaluation of the work of  the government and parliament worsened against a similar poll  from February by six and two per cent respectively.    Czech President Vaclav Havel is trusted by 69 percent of  those polled, Premier Vaclav Klaus by 70 per cent and Parliament  Chairman Milan Uhde by 41 per cent. Citizen confidence in these  politicians slightly declined against the February results.    Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, favored  by  86 percent of Czech citizens, remains the most popular  politician. Klaus placed second (73 per cent), and Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec third (69 per cent).    In comparison with the February poll, the most marked  decline  of popularity was registered with Defense Minister Antonin  Baudys (from 52 to 32 percent) and Agriculture Minister Josef  Lux (from 41 to 33 percent).    The poll showed a permanent increase in preferences for  Zieleniec and recently appointed Culture Minister Pavel Tigrid,  who was favored by 59 per cent of those questioned.</p>

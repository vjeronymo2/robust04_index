			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- While meeting with  former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger this morning  at Zhongnanhai, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said that  development and peace remain the two issues confronting the  world.    Jiang Zemin said: The current international situation is  still changing in a complicated and profound way. The world is  developing in the direction of multipolarization, and  regionalization and conglomeration of the world economy are  tending to accelerate. However, the various contradictions and  conflicts concealed by the Cold War are gradually being  uncovered, leading to disturbances, clashes, and even the  spilling of blood in some areas.    On Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang Zemin said: China has always  attached much importance to developing relations with the United  States. More mutual trust and cooperation between China and the  United States will help the two countries to play a more active  role in handling international affairs.    He said: Sino-U.S. relations have seen some positive  developments since the meeting between the presidents of the two  countries last year. Exchanges of high-level visits have  increased, and bilateral trade and economic cooperation have  been strengthened. All these are helpful in promoting mutual  understanding and solving differences.    Jiang Zemin believed: As long as both sides have their eyes  on the over-all situation and the next century, grasp [ba wo  2116 2250] the long-term interests of the two countries,  strictly observe the principles of the three joint communiques  between the two governments, respect the facts, increase  consultations, and seek common ground while reserving  differences, Sino-U.S. relations will be able to maintain  constant development on a normal track.    During the meeting, Eagleburger said the changes that have  taken place in China are very impressive, and all those who are  concerned about stability in the next century must be aware of  the importance of correctly handling U.S.-Chinese relations,  because a sound Sino-U.S. relationship is beneficial not only to  the two countries, but to world stability, and peace as well.    Eagleburger is here as a guest of the Chinese Foreign  Ministry, leading a U.S. "China investment and trade"  delegation. The delegation arrived in Beijing on 21 February  for a goodwill visit to China.</p>

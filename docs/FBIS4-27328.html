			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 30 May Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] On the morning of 30 May, the Budget Committee of  the House of Representatives continued its comprehensive  interpellations on the fiscal 1994 draft budget. At this  session, Yoshio Hachiro (of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ]) raised the question of how the government intended to  deal with the breach between the DPRK [Democratic Poeple's  Republic of Korea] and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) on consultaions on the nuclear inspection issue.    In reply, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stated: "They are  engaged in extracting fuel rods from the five-megawatt  experimental nuclear reactor. If this operation should  continue, it would become -- within two or three days --  difficult to carry out further inspection. And we are concerned  about this."    His comments indicated that the government is seriously  concerned about the situation.    He added: "We have made proposals in various forms to North  Korea, asking for its sincere handling of the issue. And to  carry out further inspection, consultations are being held  between the United States and the DPRK, between Japan, the  United States, and the ROK, and also with China."    His remarks disclosed the fact that consultations are  currently being held on the issue among various countries.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: West Trust expands via Pounds 2.5m buy IN A further step in its expansion into the food industry, in particular the ethnic food sector, West Trust is to acquire La Mexicana Quality Foods, a producer of Mexican food specialising in the production of tortillas. Consideration amounting to Pounds 2.48m will be met via a placing and open offer of new ordinary shares. Some 8.2m shares have been placed by Bell Lawrie White &amp; Co with institutional and other investors at 32p per share subject to a clawback by existing shareholders on a 5-for-11 basis. Over the last three years to end-January 1993 La Mexicana's profits before exceptional items and tax have risen from Pounds 94,000 to Pounds 297,000. Turnover has risen from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.37m. West Trust also reported a swing from losses of Pounds 3.18m to profits of Pounds 129,000 pre-tax for the year to March 31. The results reflected a 'growing profit trend' from Bart Spices, acquired in 1992, and a Pounds 30,000 contribution from Veeraswamy's (Food Products) for the eleven weeks from acquisition to the year end. Profits from the food division were counteracted by a further deterioration in tading conditions in the two textile subsidiaries. Earnings emerged at 0.21p (losses 50.67p) and as forecast, the dividend for the year is maintained at 2.5p. The directors intend to maintain this level of dividend for the current year and, dependent on half year results, commence payments of interims. West Trust's shares rose 4p to 41p.</p>

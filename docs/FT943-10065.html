			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Trawler held after clash An Icelandic trawler was held in the Norwegian port of Tromso last night after a violent clash in Arctic waters with Norwegian coastguards on Friday over disputed cod fishing rights. Norwegian authorities were set to bring charges against the crew of the Hagangur 2, which they accused of firing shots at coastguard officers attempting to stop the trawler fishing in Norwegian-controlled protected waters off the Svalbard islands in the Barents sea. The coastguards fired blank shells at the Icelandic ship during a subsequent chase before boarding it and escorting it to Tromso. The Icelanders denied firing directly at the coastguards. It was the most serious clash to date in a long-running dispute in which Icelandic fishermen facing diminished cod stocks in home waters are seeking quotas in the Svalbard area and in another protected zone jointly controlled by Norway and Russia called the loophole.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENDA FOR CLEANING UP OUR DIRTY AIR  </P> <P> Even the most fanatical of the anti-smog zealots at the SCAQMD would probably  agree that a 10% reduction of travel time in the metropolitan area would result  in cleaner air. Such a reduction would be akin to the daily removal of 300,000  to 400,000 vehicles from city streets on any given day. Instead, however, these  pro-oxygen militants put forth overwhelming proposals for the imposition of  draconian measures which could force us to become a bicycle society.  </P> <P> Recent restrictions on rush-hour left turns implemented on Crescent Heights  Boulevard have significantly improved traffic flow on this heavily traveled  thoroughfare, with travel time between Culver City and Hollywood cut  practically in half. At the same time, the bureaucrats' response to heavy  congestion on La Cienega at the Beverly Center is the installation of mid-block  traffic signals. If, however, the Traffic Department banned left turns into and  out of the Beverly Center and the new mall across the street, traffic flow  would improve at the expense of a few shoppers who would have to go around the  block.  </P> <P> Before we are all relegated to methanol-powered skate boards by the SCAQMD, I  would suggest that the traffic flow problem be addressed. It doesn't require  Manhattan Project mentality to deal with left turns, parking restrictions and  synchronized signals.  </P> <P> JACK BAILEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

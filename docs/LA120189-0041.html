			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLAYWRIGHT, 17, BRINGS CHARACTERS TO LIGHT IN DARKNESS OF BARROOM  </P> <P> Seventeen-year-old Logan Abbitt thinks his life lacks excitement.  </P> <P> "Life in itself is too mundane," he said. "If you don't have an escape you will  wither and die. Take my life, for example. I wake up, eat breakfast, go to  school, come home and do chores."  </P> <P> To combat his restlessness, this Chatsworth High School senior has found an  antidote. His elixir is his imagination.  </P> <P> "I create," he said. "I can dream anything. I'm one of the world's greatest  dreamers."  </P> <P> Abbitt's fertile mind manifests itself primarily through his writing -- among  them a one-act play titled "Scratch" that was one of three winning entries in  the first Young Playwrights Contest sponsored earlier this year by A Directors'  Theatre in Hollywood.  </P> <P> The more than 70 entries, all one-acts, represented 23 high schools and junior  highs in the Los Angeles Unified School District and Los Angeles County.  Besides Abbitt, the other winners were Ji Yoon Francis Kim, 17, of Whitney High  School in Cerritos with "La Fantasia," a play about a priest and his young  penitent's quest for fulfillment, and Michelle Fugate, 14, of Hill Junior High  School in Long Beach with "The Unborn Problem," a drama about teen-age  pregnancy. The three winning entries -- which were not ranked -- were chosen by  a panel of 12 readers and seven industry judges.  </P> <P> In addition to having their plays produced in December at the Lex Theatre in  Hollywood, the three winners each received a $1,000 savings bond, and their  schools will be given $500, said Dorothy Lyman, founder of A Directors'  Theatre, which owns and operates the Lex.  </P> <P> Established as a nonprofit corporation in January, 1987, A Directors' Theatre  focuses on producing plays by contemporary playwrights that deal with a variety  of subjects. The producers, directors and actors are all professionals.  </P> <P> Lyman was interested in developing the Young Playwrights Contest to encourage  young people to write for the theater. "We're interested in developing writers  from the next generation," she said. Described as a black comedy, "Scratch"  deals with the struggle of Scratch, who learns that he is dying of cancer at  the age of 40. Coming from a wealthy family that never quite met his needs,  Scratch instead makes a "family" of his acquaintances at the bar where he plays  pool. But when he learns of his illness, Scratch lacks the courage to tell his  friends -- and thus he avoids having to say goodby.  </P> <P> A pool enthusiast, Abbitt said his mother was once a bar manager, "so I used to  go to the bar sometimes to help clean up. . . . I got to know the inside of the  bar. Mom told me so many stories about the people that would go there. Some of  the jokes in the play are from actual stories she told me."  </P> <P> Although "Scratch" includes the theme of dying, Abbitt says that "when you get  right down to it, it's about relationships. It's about the separation of  friends and the ending of relationships."  </P> <P> Lyman chose Caroline DuCrocq Hesseman, the wife of actor Howard Hesseman, to  direct Abbitt's play. (The cast of four men and one woman will be selected  through open auditions.) Hesseman said she was particularly impressed with the  way Abbitt handled the subject.  </P> <P> "I think it's a remarkable piece for a young person," she said. "He's dealing  with a profound American tragedy -- parents giving in to material values and  dedicating their lives to accumulating money. The individual that happens to be  their child feels he has lost.  </P> <P> "This is the case with the main character. He's incapable of building a life  for himself. He has a terror of love and attachment," she said. "In pool,  someone who cannot win is called 'Scratch.' Even his name means he has become a  loser. He is a man who is doomed."  </P> <P> "Scratch" was Abbitt's first attempt at a play. The idea came to him about  three years ago but it wasn't until he saw a poster at school announcing the  contest that he decided to turn it into a play. Abbitt said the writing took  only about a week, although he did three rewrites before entering the contest.  </P> <P> Since finishing "Scratch," Abbitt has started two other plays, both set in  bars. "I like bars because they're social places," he said. "Everyone is equal  there. All the regulars are like family. And it's dark. I like dark."  </P> <P> Among Abbitt's other works in progress are two novels: One dealing with a group  of friends who become shipwrecked, the other focusing on a challenge between a  boy and his stepfather.  </P> <P> Abbitt said he never considered writing as a career until about a year ago.  After completing a paper on "Huckleberry Finn" and getting a good grade on it,  he figured he must have some talent. "It hit me, if I enjoy doing this -- and I  do it well -- why not do it for a living?" he said.  </P> <P> To help with character development, Abbitt said, he relies on years of  role-playing games, among them "Dungeons and Dragons."  </P> <P> "I look at the situation from the character's point of view," he said. Since  Abbitt is involved with acting at school, the role playing has also helped him  develop the characters he portrays.  </P> <P> Besides living in Oregon, where he attended grades seven through his sophomore  year in high school, Abbitt has also lived in Kentucky, Indiana, Oklahoma and  Northern California. His parents divorced when he was 6 and he lived with his  mother until last year, when he moved to Reseda to be with his father, a  theater professor at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> Abbitt is undecided what he'll do after he graduates from high school. Along  with writing, Abbitt has also toyed with the idea of moving to Alaska to study  broadcasting. At 17, armed with abounding eagerness and optimism, the  possibilities seem endless.  </P> <P> "I guess I want to do everything," he said. "I want to be in the entertainment  field. I want to be like Woody Allen -- direct, act and produce. Anything  that's creative, I'll do it."  </P> <P>  The Lex Theatre is at 6760 Lexington Ave. in Hollywood. Performances of the  three winning one-acts are at 8 p.m. Dec. 21-23 and 26-30, with additional  performances at 2 p.m. Dec. 23 &amp; 30.

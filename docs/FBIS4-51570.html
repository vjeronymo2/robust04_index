			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Message from Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of </F> Democratic Kampuchea, to King Norodom Sihanouk; dated 1 May --  read by announcer]    [Text] To His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia,  Royal Palace, Phnom Penh:    Your Majesty, I would like to express my most profound  thanks  to Your Majesty for sending me another message dated 30 April  1994. Like your previous messages, this one clearly shows your  constant consideration for the destiny of our country and the  Cambodian race in your role as the father of peace and national  reconciliation who wants to hold a roundtable meeting to achieve  national reconciliation and peace quickly.    In accord with the constant position of the Party of  Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], all of us -- to the best of our  ability -- have always studied and thought about how to assist,  support, and fulfill Your Majesty's national reconciliation  initiative. This responds to the profound aspirations of the  Cambodian nation and of every Cambodian.    For reasons Your Majesty is already well aware of, though, I  am of the opinion that under current circumstances, in order to  ensure security and provide equal status to all sides attending  the roundtable meeting, the meeting should be held in one of the  places Your Majesty suggested in your second formula or another  neutral place.    Your Majesty is already aware that Phnom Penh is not safe  for  the PDK delegation and is also not a neutral venue.    Please forgive any improprieties.    [Signed] PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan    [Dated] 1 May 1994</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fang Wangzhi (2455 2598 0037): "A Critique of </F> the Integration of the Party With the Government"]    [Text] As the party central committee has repeatedly  emphasized that its reform objective is the self-perfection of  the socialist system, our reform is principled, objective, and  directed, not arbitrary, and subjective in neither substance nor  end-result. Reform must develop China's productive forces to  increase the overall national might of our country, which is a  socialist country, not any other kind. Forgetting this point  would lead our reform astray.    For a time now, some have been setting forth the so-called  "party-government integration" political reform view, wantonly  publicizing it in the press, beginning to practice it in some  regions, and regarding it as a successful reform experience for  dissemination and introduction. Its great impact and rapid  spread merit much attention.    "The integration of the party with the government" means  integration all the way from the center to provinces, cities,  and townships in one version, and integration of the party and  government within enterprises in another. The first version is  detailed as: "The so-called merging of the party and government  into one refers to merging party and government organs where  certain functions are identical or similar, to reduce operating  links and staffs, and basically achieve a single organization  flying two flags, with one capable hand taking on the two jobs  of the party committee and the government." This plan says  that "as every administrative level from the center to  provinces, cities, and townships has the two huge governing  organs of the party committee and the government," they must all  be merged into one. The second version is detailed as: "This  mechanism has four features: 1) It makes staffmember duties  consistent, with overlapping party and government jobs, and dual  responsibilities for dual posts; 2) It integrates the  organizational leadership structure, forming two separate  leading bodies into one integrated group in charge of both  economic and party work; 3) It consolidates the organizational  structure, dissolving and merging administrative offices with  similar functions into a single track; 4) It unifies work goals,  using systems such as joint party-government meetings and  responsibility zones to coordinate party and government work."    These two positions both violate the party central committee  spirit on political reform.    The party constitution passed by the 14th CPC Congress  points  out that "the party's grass-roots organs are its combat fortress  in primary social organization, as well as the foundation for  all of its work and combat effectiveness."    Can this "foundation" be merged with administrative organs?  And if it is, will the party still be combat effective?    Comrade Deng Xiaoping notes that: "The substance of  political reform needs deliberation. I believe that political  reform should be aimed at stimulating public initiative to raise  efficiency and overcome bureaucracy. The substance of reform is  primarily to separate the party from the government, with the  key being to resolve the matter of how the party should lead and  be adept at leadership."    So can "party-government merger" replace separating the  party  from the government as the particular key to political reform,  to become our reform direction?    Just take a look at Comrade Jiang Zemin's opinion: "To deal  correctly with party-government relations within enterprises, we  need to bring the crucial political role of the enterprise party  organization into full play, while ensuring the effective  application of the factory director responsibility system.  Leading party and government personnel can have appropriately  overlapping jobs, and qualified enterprises can have one person  concurrently holding the key party and government posts. But we  need to intensify our political and ideological work to bring  the role of grass-roots party organs into full play, by teaching  professional ethics to the vast numbers of party members and  employees, advocating a spirit of contribution, strengthening  the sense of responsibility of the working class as the master  of its own fate, and firmly opposing money worship, hedonism,  and extreme individualism, in an attempt to build a corps of  employees that can unite in struggle in the midst of market  competition." (From a speech on 24 August 1993 at a conference  of some large and midsize enterprises from the north and  northeast regions)    This speech indicates that while party and government  leaders  can be appropriately overlapping, and key party and government  posts can also be held concurrently by one person, enterprises  must bring the key political role of party branches into full  play, with enterprise party branches having the major  responsibility for ideological and political work among the vast  numbers of employees. So enterprise grass-roots party organs  must not be dissolved and merged with administrative organs,  making "party-government integration" impossible.    The argument that party and government organs need to be  merged all the way from the center to provinces, prefectures,  counties, and townships--advocating the merger of leading organs  with those that are led, the CPC Central Committee with the  State Council, all provincial party committees with people's  provincial governments, prefectural party committees with  prefectural commissioner's offices, and county party committees  with county people's governments--stands essentially for  dissolving the party into the government, and substituting the  government for the party, to completely change China's political  system. While the separation of the party from the government is  in order to ensure that party committees at all levels focus  their energies mainly on keeping close ties to the masses, by  studying new situations and issues to better implement the  party's line, principles, and policies, and in order to improve  and strengthen party leadership, "party-government integration"  dissolves the party into the administration (which is so even  though the sign party committee still hangs over the doorway),  thus downplaying and even eliminating the leadership of the  party. Some time back, the press criticized the fallacy of  "political pluralism." While this so-called "political  pluralism" denies the leadership status of the CPC, holding that  all political parties in China can become ruling parties, by  assuming power and ruling in turn just like in the various  European and American countries, the current "party-government  integration" is even worse than "political pluralism," dimming  even the very name of the Communist Party itself. If the CPC  could not speak in the just and honorable name of the CPC, but  had to speak jointly with administrative organs, what would be  left of it!    The practice of "party-government integration" within  enterprises, by eliminating grass-roots party organs, would  leave the party hanging in midair, severely divorcing it from  the masses and ultimately resulting in its demise. Early in  Comrade Zhao Ziyang's tenure as general secretary, he used the  pretext of thoroughly practicing the factory director  responsibility system to issue documents weakening the key  political role of enterprise party organizations, severely  undermining the combat effectiveness of grass-roots party  organs. The stand for "party-government integration" within  enterprises would similarly weaken the key political role of  enterprise party organs. As to the huge role of grass-roots  party organs, as far back as November 1928, Comrade Mao Zedong  pointed out in an article entitled "Jinggang Mountains Struggle"  that "a key factor in the Red Army's brave fight instead of  defeat and dispersion were the company party branches." These  "company party branches" ensured the absolute leadership of the  party over the army, becoming the heart of the company,  enforcing party orders, sharing weal and woe with the rank and  file, and having a common destiny, to ensure combat victory.  This was the origin of the post-Liberation establishment of  party branches in enterprise shops or teams and groups. This  is a very effective organizational establishment that has stood  a longstanding test of practice. It is only when shops or  teams and groups have party branches that they can have a  leadership center and guiding organization to keep direct and  widespread ties to the masses, by transmitting to the masses the  party's principles and policies, without which they would turn  into a loose sheet of sand, or even be controlled by unhealthy  trends and evil practices. It is only the party branches that  bring the unity to complete production tasks, make the situation  at the lower levels known to the higher levels in a timely way,  and inculcate and standardize the words and deeds of every party  member, so that they can play the role of advanced models,  understand and teach the surrounding masses, and attract  advanced elements from the masses into the party ranks, to  strengthen party might. Liu Shaoqi pointed out in "On the  Party" that: "As party branches are the party's working units  among the masses, as well as its bridge linking leadership  organs with the masses, they must closely connect the masses  with the party's leading organs." From the perspective of  leadership work, this "bridge" is absolutely indispensable, as a  party with only leadership organs but no party branches would be  inconceivable. A party without a sound grass-roots organization,  just like water without a source or a tree without roots, would  eliminate both the regular ties to the masses, as well as work  among the masses, so could not exist.    Saying that enterprise party organizations must play a key  political role demonstrates precisely their irreplaceable  impact. While enterprises are production and economic  organizations, not political ones, they absolutely cannot be  divorced from politics. In China, while state and collective  enterprises must strictly submit to socialist political demands,  private, Sino-foreign joint-venture, and individual enterprises  also cannot violate basic socialist interests, which is the  politics of enterprise. It is absolutely wrong to think that a  socialist market economy can deemphasize politics and does not  need political indoctrination. While those who promote  bourgeois liberalization say that it is unnecessary to emphasize  politics so much, they actually do all they can to promote  bourgeois politics and eliminate proletarian politics. So who  ensures the realization of proletarian political objectives? It  is only enterprise party branches, as this is their major  responsibility. As enterprise administrative organs are heavily  burdened with production tasks, they have very little energy to  devote to this. The party committee secretary at the Beijing  Internal Combustion Engine Plant says that: "If I was now  forced to carry all of the weight [of party and government  duties] on my shoulders alone, I would be exerting 99 percent of  my energy on business, leaving only 1 percent for party  building. As I have been a party committee secretary for so many  years, I am still tied to the line of thinking that I ought to  be strengthening the party establishment." Such  straight-from-the-heart talk provides much food for thought.    The key grounds of those who advocate "party-government  integration" is that it will raise work efficiency, an argument  which is very one-sided. Higher work efficiency depends on  many factors, mainly increased personnel initiative, not  "party-government integration." While enterprises must of course  focus on economic development, this focus needs political  guarantees. An economy without political guarantees can hardly  adhere to a socialist orientation, to strictly enforce party  principles and policies. In particular operations, while  enterprise party and administrative organs must both emphasize  business, they each have their particular slant, substance, and  style, which are not interchangeable. It is only when both  parties display their strengths that they can fully arouse the  initiative of talented personnel in all areas to jointly push  forwrad with enterprise economic development. Merging the party  with the government would "meld" the method of diversified  channels and substance into a dependence mainly on  administrative means, sharply weakening political and  ideological work, not helping to stimulate initiative, and even  leading people astray into money worship.    As "party-government integration" centralizes power, it  easily leads to the patriarchal system in which one person alone  has the say, weakening the party's democratic centralism. While  some use the pretext that enterprise party and government  leaders are often subject to "internal waste" (dissenting work  views) as a stand for "party-government integration," except for  unprincipled disputes, differing work views is actually a normal  thing, which is similarly unavoidable under "party-government  integration." While "one person laying down the law" involves no  "internal waste," it is also undemocratic. Unprincipled disputes  need to be settled with the criticism and self-criticism style,  not being in the category of political reform.    "Party-government integration" loses the force of mutual  restraint between the party and government, making it hard for  administrative organs to exercise self-control, and engendering  corruption.    As "party-government integration" often leads to factory  directors having the say, it also abets rule by man, being  adverse to the establishment of rule by law.    Theoretically, "party-government integration" is also wrong.  A political party is a class organization, representing class  interests, which is the case in all contemporary social systems.  So the CPC is a Chinese proletarian organization, representing  the interests of the Chinese working class and all working  people. The Chinese regime is a people's democratic dictatorship  organization, in which all democratic parties that support the  CPC can take part in organizations of political power.  Enterprises are economic organizations under the leadership of  the state. As the Communist Party, state power, and domestic  economic organizations differ completely in nature, they cannot  be merged. Merging them would mean eliminating the leadership of  the proletariat over the state represented by the party, which  would basically violate our constitutional provisions, as well  as China's political reform directions and principles.    In short, the "party-government integration" view is hardly  tenable!</p>

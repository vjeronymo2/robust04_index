The Secretariat rejects these charges, because there is no  evidence, much less suspicion, to support these claims. On the  contrary, what is evident is the disproportionate tone in which  the matter is discussed in the report which seems to be a  typical case of yellow journalism aimed at forcing the  government to take forceful measures disregarding individual  guarantees.    With regard to the reports in question, the Government  Secretariat wants to make it very clear that they are not based  on facts or official statements. They are only based on the  assumptions of the journalist who wrote the report, based on  informal interviews with public officials during his visit to  Mexico.    The Government Secretariat does not acknowledge the truth of  the headlines, headlines that assert that the ETA mafia has  established itself in Mexico through business fronts for  international terrorism or that ETA is establishing a sanctuary  in Mexico to finance itself through kidnapping and extortion.  Thus, it is also not true that the ETA has established an  operations' base in the States of Mexico, Guanajuato, and  Queretaro.    These reports claim Mexican authorities possess important  leads on businesses connected to the weapon's cache found in  Managua, a few months ago. This is also false. It is true that  we investigated a report which connected Mexican citizens who  work at a consultant firm with the Managua arsenal. Based on  this, the reporter assumes the existence of Mexican businesses  connected not only with the ETA but with other international  terrorist groups.    It is true that Basque citizens have legally resided in  Mexico since their admission in the early 1980's. However, one  cannot surmise, as Mr. Jesus Maria Zuluaga does with exaggerated  irresponsibility, that they are terrorists and much less ETA  mafia members as he calls them. One must reiterate that  concerning matters of legal residence, the Government  Secretariat does not pass judgment on the basis of the political  preferences of foreign residents in Mexico. It only asks them  to meet legal requirements, and acts on the basis of irrefutable  evidence and fully respects the human rights of its residents.    Regarding Mexico's immigration policy, it is very  conscientious and demands adherence to all legal regulations.  At the same time, it is open to reciprocal agreements  facilitating the exchange of persons, for tourism and commercial  purposes. The benefits granted by these reciprocal agreements  must not be confused with a lack of strictness in the admission  of foreigners into Mexico.    In conclusion, the Government Secretariat reiterates that  the  corresponding authorities scrupulously watch over the nation's  security and that, under no circumstances, will illegal  activities be permitted. In the case of accusations against  foreigners, these must not be groundless, and no actions will be  taken based on prejudice or political differences that are  foreign to this country.</p>

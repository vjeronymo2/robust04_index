			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> FREEWAY DEMOLITION PUT OFF UNTIL APRIL  </P> <P> Federal Highway Administration bureaucrats have decided that San Franciscans  will have to put up with the earthquake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway at least  until April, state officials said.  </P> <P> Mayor Art Agnos, his staff and the state Department of Transportation had been  under the impression that demolition of the elevated roadway could begin in  January. But Caltrans officials said federal regulations require an  environmental report before the 80,000 tons of freeway can be removed. The  $15-million tear-down project is now slated to begin 1 1/2 years after the Loma  Prieta earthquake. City officials, merchants and critics of the double-decked  freeway want to demolish the roadway as soon as possible to help solve traffic  problems.  </P></p>

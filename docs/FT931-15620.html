			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Although it is being shown at an awfully inconvenient time, Germany Means Business (BBC2, 5.00) is an absorbing programme about the nuts and bolts of doing business in Germany. It is also guaranteed to make anyone who has bothered to learn German ahead of the single European market, feel deliciously smug. Strange to relate, one still meets plenty of middle-of-the-road opera lovers who still have not discovered Janacek. Heaven knows, there is a lot of him about. Tonight there is another chance to discover his wonderfully tuneful, endlessly inventive musical world - and at no cost to your pocket - with The Adventures of Mr Broucek (Radio 3, 7.25), broadcast live from the Coliseum. After 30 years of high quality investigative journalism, World in Action (ITV, 10.40) gives itself a well-deserved pat on the back in a one-hour special. Omnibus, old-timer among the arts programmes, has postponed its scheduled re-showing of Ken Russell's celebration of Delius, 'A Song of Summer' for a special tribute to Rudolf Nureyev who died last week. (BBC 1, 10.25).</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINE CLEARED IN HANGING DEATH OF HIS WIFE  </P> <P> An El Toro Marine Corps sergeant has been cleared of charges that he strangled  his wife, then hanged her body in the garage of the couple's Corona home last  year to make it look like suicide, Marine Corps officials say.  </P> <P> Charges of premeditated murder were dropped Monday against Gunnery Sgt. Murray  D. Payne because of insufficient evidence. The action came after a yearlong  investigation by civilian police and the Naval Investigative Service into the  cause of death last May of Ella Mae Payne, 39. Her 22-year-old son found her  hanging from the garage rafters.  </P> <P> Two months ago, military prosecutors requested that the murder charge against  Payne be dismissed. He was returned to duty while the recommendation was being  studied by the investigating officer and the commanding officer of Payne's  Marine Wing Support Squadron 373 at El Toro. He was officially cleared Monday,  said Marine 1st Lt. Gene Browne, assistant public affairs officer at El Toro.  </P> <P> "He has weathered the storm pretty well," said his civilian attorney, Kevin  McDermott of Santa Ana. "There was never a doubt in my mind that he was  innocent. I would not have hesitated a second to put him on the stand to  testify."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Administrative Punishment  </P> <P> McDermott said he fears that the military may now try to punish Payne  administratively by discharging him from the Marine Corps.  </P> <P> "He (Payne) has requested that he be transferred to another facility so he can  start over again," McDermott said, adding that the "whole thing" has cost his  client dearly.  </P> <P> "He lost his wife, his house, and he was jailed and the Marine Corps turned its  back on him," the attorney said.  </P> <P> The case originally was investigated by Corona police and transferred to the  Marine Corps in January. Payne was arrested Dec. 1 and jailed at Camp  Pendleton. He remained there until January, when evidence at his Article 32  hearing indicated that his wife could have killed herself.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suspicious of Knot  </P> <P> Police were suspicious of a complicated knot that formed the noose on the rope  found around Ella Payne's neck. They said the knot was a military type and too  complicated for Payne's wife to have tied.  </P> <P> An initial autopsy conducted by the Riverside County coroner's office  determined that Ella Mae Payne had died from hanging, and her death was  declared a suicide. After a second autopsy on Ella Payne's exhumed body, a  military medical examiner said her death could have been a homicide.  </P> <P> The case was turned over to the Marine Corps because Payne was a Marine and  Corona police officials said they believed Payne would get a quicker trial in  the military justice system.  </P> <P> Payne was the second Marine in Orange County last year to be charged with the  murder of his wife.  </P> <P> Sgt. Joseph Thomas was sentenced to death in November for bludgeoning his wife  to death in their military apartment at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station.  </P> <P> The sentence was reviewed and approved by Maj. Gen. Donald E. P. Miller,  commanding general of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing.  </P> <P> Thomas, held at the Camp Pendleton brig since his conviction, will be  transferred to the U.S. Army Detention Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., this  week, according to a public affairs officer.  </P></p>

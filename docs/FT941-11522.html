			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Davila admits 'error' in Chile's futures scandal The man at the centre of the Chilean Codelco futures scandal, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, has broken his silence, telling journalists he committed an error but not a criminal offence. Mr Davila, former chief futures operator of Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is alleged to have lost the company Dollars 200m in a four-month period from September 1993. 'I don't believe that I have committed any crime,' said Mr Davila. 'I made a mistake and I will assume all responsibility for that mistake.' Mr Davila, who faces possible criminal charges, repeated his account that a computer inputting error set in train the cycle of events that led to unprecedented losses on the copper, gold and silver futures markets. Codelco executives, until now insistent that Mr Davila acted alone and without their knowledge, showed signs of breaking ranks. Mr Fernando Molina, who represents President Patricio Aylwin on Codelco's board, said: 'It is difficult to believe that one person could mount such an enormous operation - for Dollars 180m and 1m tonnes of copper - without anybody else finding out about it. He would have to be a genius.' The 20,000-strong Federation of Copper Workers reiterated its attack on Codelco's management, rejecting suggestions that it had sent its support to Codelco president, Mr Alejandro Noemi. However, the federation sharply criticised statements which had been made by some politicians that the futures fiasco was further evidence of the need to privatise the state corporation.</p>

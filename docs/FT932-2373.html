			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Scandal touches Berlusconi executive THE tentacles of Italy's corruption scandal yesterday embraced Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group with the issue of a cautionary warrant against one of its executives. Mr Aldo Brancher, responsible for special projects at the Fininvest communications subsidiary but understood to be a lobbyist, is being sought by Milan magistrates for questioning about irregularities at the Ministry of Health. The warrant, for illegal funding of political parties, follows allegations by Mr Giovanni Marone, secretary to a former health minister, that Fininvest paid L300m (Dollars 200,000) in kickbacks on a television advertising contract during the government's anti-Aids campaign. The money allegedly went to Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, a former health minister, who this year resigned after his father, a prominent Naples doctor and ex-politician, was investigated on corruption allegations. Magistrates subsequently informed Mr De Lorenzo, a senior member of the small Liberal party, he was under investigation in connection with a Naples jobs-for-votes scandal. The involvement of Mr Brancher in the corruption scandal is a big setback for Mr Berlusconi, who has faced growing difficulties following a government decision to re-examine Italy's controversial revision of broadcasting frequencies. Fininvest, which controls three TV channels, has about 45 per cent of the audience. Mr Berlusconi has been complaining of a media campaign against him. In recent weeks, he has been targeted by parts of the media controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, an arch-rival. The attacks followed reports that Mr Davide Giacalone, an adviser to a former posts minister, subsequently obtained a L420bn consultancy with Fininvest. Mr Giacalone assisted Mr Oscar Mammi, the posts minister responsible for the broadcasting frequency allocations now due to be re-examined.</p>

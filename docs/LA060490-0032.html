			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> VIVECA VASQUEZ DEFIES EXPECTATIONS AT LACE  </P> <P> Puerto Rican choreographer Viveca Vasquez makes works that seem to announce  their themes but then defy expectations by expressing something entirely  different.  </P> <P> At LACE on Friday, the three parts of Vasquez's "Malad Justed" began with a  slide show, movie and/or videotape establishing a subject or context: footage  of a woman in bed ("Mira y que -- 3rd Wash"), glimpses of a woman doing laundry  and snapshots of growing up ("Bothbirth"), views of a produce market, people on  a beach and a landscape rushing by ("Vieques Ain't Nor Was No Fish").  </P> <P> Vasquez's choreography occasionally referred to this screen imagery -- the use  of a mattress in "Mira y que," for instance, along with the rocking-a-baby  gestures in "Bothbirth" and the swimming motions in "Vieques." However, much of  the time she explored only formal dance issues.  </P> <P> Loss of balance formed the heart of her choreography, with hopping on one foot,  knee-walking and lunge-like falls occurring throughout the program. Shared  weight and other tactics of support between Vasquez and Eduardo Alegria  dominated "Mira y que." Even more than the frequent, sudden shifts of impetus,  the action of teetering unified the "Bothbirth" solo. And though "Vieques"  added a text to its visuals spelling out the devastation wrought upon a small  island by both the U.S. Navy and Hurricane Hugo, the dancing (especially in the  solo for Dorcas Roman) again made tests of equilibrium its primary concern.  </P> <P> Is Vasquez commenting ironically on the new political imperatives of '90s  artmaking -- or trying to cloak a hermetic movement style in contemporary  multimedia effects and social references? Impossible to determine in this first  West Coast performance. But the suspicion lingers that she is a very private  artist making an uneasy bargain with the world outside her dance studio.

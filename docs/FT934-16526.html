			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Threat of strike ballot at Vauxhall A STRIKE ballot of Vauxhall's 9,000 manual workers is expected if the company fails to improve its present two-year pay offer at today's negotiating session with the unions, Robert Taylor writes. Union officials have rejected the company's proposal for a 2.1 per cent pay rise this year and 2.6 per cent in 1994. Union officials said last night that they would be pointing out to Vauxhall that it had made more than Pounds 1bn profit over the past three years. Vauxhall said it had suffered a 13 per cent cut in its production because of falling demand in the Continental market.</p>

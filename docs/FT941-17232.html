			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Mobil takes Dollars 250m write-down The slump in world oil prices has forced Mobil, the US energy group, to announce a Dollars 250m charge to cover a write-down in the value of its inventory. However, the one-off hit is unlikely to be matched by write-downs at other big oil groups when the industry reports its full-year results shortly. Mobil's charge, a non-cash item which will be recorded in its results for the fourth quarter of 1993, arises from the timing of the company's move to last in, first out accounting (lifo) for the oil inventory of its international operations. The company made the switch in 1982, after the oil price surge of 1979. Other big oil groups are all believed to have adopted lifo accounting before 1979. As a result, the book value of Mobil's inventory is higher per barrel than its competitors, forcing it to take a charge when oil prices fall sharply. Mr Paul Ting, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, said the next reporting season was unlikely to reveal any other large write-downs among the oil majors, though some independent oil companies could be affected.</p>

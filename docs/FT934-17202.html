			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Consortium sparks battle to run lottery THE BATTLE for the right to run Britain's proposed national lottery began in earnest yesterday as a second contestant entered the field. The new consortium, known as Camelot, links a group of corporate heavyweights: the confectionery and drinks group Cadbury Schweppes, the computer manufacturer ICL, security printer De La Rue, Racal Electronics and GTech, a US company which claims to be the world's biggest lottery operator. The cost of setting up the lottery is estimated at between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m. Analysts suggest that its gross turnover in the first year could be Pounds 1.5bn, rising to Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn in the next three or four years. The other contender, the Great British Lottery Company, consists chiefly of media companies such as Granada, Carlton Communications and Associated Newspapers. Camelot, headed by Sir Ron Dearing, the former Post Office chairman, is made up of companies claiming expertise in running the lottery. The exception, Cadbury, is presented as the expert in consumer marketing and distribution. Camelot said ICL would manufacture terminals to be installed at outlets such as corner shops, and would train retailers. De La Rue would supply tickets, and Racal would provide the communications through its existing nationwide electronic system, the Government Data Network. The lottery system used would be that already developed by GTech, which claims to operate 62 lotteries worldwide, including 15 in Europe. Other contestants known to be contemplating bids include Rank Organisation, the leisure group, and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, which is teaming up with the Australian lottery operator Tattersall's. Ladbroke Group, the hotel and leisure company, said yesterday: 'We are in discussion with various people on putting a consortium together, but until we get a closer look at the government's proposals we are holding fire.' Another rumoured contender, Thorn EMI, the music and rentals group, confirmed it had been approached by 'another large company' about joining a consortium. While no decision had yet been made, any involvement would be as a passive investor, Thorn said. The Post Office said it was 'very interested' in the lottery. It would not be bidding to operate it but would seek an agreement with the winning consortium to distribute tickets and winnings through its 20,000 outlets. Lex, Page 22</p>

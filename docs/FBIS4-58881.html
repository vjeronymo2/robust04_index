			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 8 May (MENA)--The People's Assembly held a  meeting today chaired by Speaker Dr. Ahmad Fathi Surur. It  approved the president of the Republic's decree extending Law  No. 29 of 1972 empowering the president of the Republic to issue  decrees having the strength of law. The law is extended for  three years and expires at the end of fiscal year 1994-1996.  The bill was opposed by 11 members of the opposition and  independents.    Commenting on opposition to the bill by deputy Lutfi Wakid  of  the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party, Kamal  al-Shadhili, minister of state for the People's Assembly and  Consultative Council affairs, said that secrecy and speed in  approving arms deals are necessary. Thus, the president of the  Republic was authorized to issue such decrees, noting that  submitting the bill to the People's Assembly in accordance with  the law takes place after the president authorizes it and while  the authorization is still valid. He stressed that the  circumstances the Arab nation has been passing through require  that Egypt have a strong army. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / BT launches call screening device British Telecommunications is to make it possible from November for people to identify a caller's number before answering the telephone, and for phones to store the numbers of unanswered calls. Under an agreement with Oftel, the telecoms regulator, callers will be able to prevent the display of their number by dialling 141 before the number. A permanent blocking facility will also be available, and BT is examining the possibility of offering a service which automatically rejects calls where the caller has prevented the display of his or her number. BT will offer two separate services, each priced at between Pounds 4 and Pounds 7 a quarter. Caller Display will allow users to see the number of the person calling them before answering, provided the user has a special phone or an additional display unit which will cost about Pounds 50 to buy or Pounds 1.50 a month to rent. The upgraded phones currently retail for about Pounds 90. Users will also be able to recall the numbers of callers attempting to reach them in their absence. A second service, Call Return, will enable users without a special phone or display unit to find out the number of the last person to call them by dialling 1471. Oftel said yesterday it wanted BT to provide facilities for competing phone operators to offer the same services if requested. 'Unreasonable refusal by BT to agree these arrangements would be seen by Oftel as a potential abuse of dominant position,' it said. Negotiations are taking place between BT and competitors about an inter-connection arrangement.</p>

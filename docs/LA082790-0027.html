			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> READING DISABILITIES MISLABELED  </P> <P> Schools are up to four times more likely to label boys as reading-disabled than  they are girls. But when standard research criteria are used to diagnose  reading disability, the problem is found to occur about equally in both sexes,  scientists reported last week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.  </P> <P> Researchers at Yale University and the University of Texas evaluated 445  Connecticut schoolchildren whose intelligence, behavior and academic progress  were regularly assessed from kindergarten through the third grade. When reading  disability was defined as a discrepancy between IQ and performance on a reading  test, it was found in about 9% of second- and third-grade boys and in 6% to 7%  of girls -- not a statistically significant difference. But teachers identified  10% to 14% of boys in those grades as reading-disabled, compared to only 3% to  4% of girls.  </P> <P> Children whom schools considered reading-disabled but whose tests did not  confirm the diagnosis were significantly more likely than average to show  behavior problems. Conversely, children whose tests indicated a reading  disability but who had been "missed" by schools were significantly less likely  than average to be classroom troublemakers.  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Companies seen to tighten discipline Many of Britain's companies have tightened disciplinary procedures for employees and increased the range of disciplinary offences during the past six years, according to a survey published today by the independent Labour Research Department. It found that 79 per cent of 147 procedure agreements covered in the survey had been tightened or modified over the period. 'The range of possible offences is increasing and cover a wide variety of issues not previously the subject of discipline including smoking, sex and race harassment and computer-related offences,' says the report. The body suggested there was 'some evidence to suggest that companies have used the recession and the lengthening unemployment queues to tighten up on discipline'. The proportion of workplaces considering sexual and racial harassment as matters of gross misconduct by employees has risen from 3 per cent in 1988 to 16 per cent. The survey found that 54 per cent of company procedure agreements provided for a formal hearing before the imposition of any discipline. Employees had the right to union representation in a disciplinary case in 77 per cent of workplaces but in only 49 per cent did this provide for a formal hearing. Only 3 per cent of workplaces allowed their employees to see their personal files. As many as 98 per cent of agreements provided a right to appeal, compared with 79 per cent in 1988. While 61 per cent of workplaces gave employees at least three warnings before dismissing them, one in three companies provided for the suspension of an employee in a disciplinary case, with the average suspension being five days. The survey suggests employee representatives are experiencing difficulties with procedures either because management want to amend them or because the procedures may not be operated quite in the way they had been laid down.

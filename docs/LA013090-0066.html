			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER OFFERS SHOPPERS $50 FOR A COMPARISON TEST-DRIVE  </P> <P> Consumers who test-drive a Chrysler Corp. product against any comparable car or  truck will get $50 cash, even if they buy the competing vehicle, Chrysler said  Monday.  </P> <P> The new offer could be costly to the nation's No. 3 auto maker, which is  seeking to cut $1 billion from its $26-billion annual budget by 1991.  </P> <P> If all of Chrysler's December car buyers had test-driven another company's  model, Chrysler would have doled out $3.2 million. That figure does not include  sales of Chrysler trucks or consumers who test-drove a Chrysler but bought  another brand.  </P> <P> "Nobody ever said promotion was cheap," Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said.  "The name of the game is to get people in the driver's seat."  </P> <P> Auto makers do not disclose specific incentive costs. Charles Brady, an  automotive analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, said he does not  think that the cost of the test-drive promotion will be exorbitant.  </P> <P> "I don't think many people will go through the hassle for $50," Brady said.  "Probably half of them are going to end up buying a Chrysler. When viewed in  light of all the other incentives, that's 1/20th of a $1,000 rebate."  </P> <P> The $50 test-drive offer and new incentive programs were announced by Chrysler  Chairman Lee A. Iacocca in commercials aired nationwide Sunday during the Super  Bowl and the Senior Skins golf tournament.  </P> <P> The new program tinkers with previous incentives and extends rebates and  low-interest financing deals through the end of February.  </P> <P> Missing from the extended program are Chrysler's popular minivans. Incentive  offers on those vehicles will expire on Wednesday as originally planned.  </P> <P> Consumers who bought a Chrysler under incentive plans announced Dec. 15 that  were scheduled to expire Wednesday will receive the difference if Chrysler  increases the incentive through Sept. 30.  </P></p>

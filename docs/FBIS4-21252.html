			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Helping Friend Costs Vendor $3,000"] </F>   [Text] Clive Alphonso Alleyne was helping his friend, now  deceased, to dry out a recently-arrived shipment in his backyard  at Godding's Road when the police swooped.    The two men were actually spreading the green stuff out to  dry, when the police interrupted the operations, and both of  them ran off.    But Alleyne, 31, was later apprehended and confessed that he  had helped lift bags, containing over 100 pounds of marijuana,  from a car.  <H5>  Pleaded Guilty </H5>   Yesterday, with Sergeant John Hinkson prosecuting, in  District "A" Criminal Court "B", the young vendor pleaded guilty  and Magistrate Carlisle Greaves ordered him to pay $3,000 in  three months, or spend 18 months in prison.    According to Alleyne, the stuff had "just come into the  island," and he was helping a friend to sort it out.</p>

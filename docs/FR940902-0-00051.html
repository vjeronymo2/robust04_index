			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A few commenters indicated that revised financial reporting requirements need to be issued by the Department, consistent with &sect;627.455, so that changes to accounting and other financial systems could be made that also meet the reporting requirements. Revised financial reporting requirements for JTPA title II programs were issued by the Department in Training and Employment Information Notice (TEIN) No. 6&hyph;93 dated July 30, 1993 (OMB No. 1205&hyph;0323). Revised financial reporting requirements for title III programs were issued by the Department in TEIN's Nos. 14&hyph;93 and 12&hyph;93, dated August 30, 1993, and September 8, 1993, respectively (OMB Nos. 1205&hyph;0326 and 1205&hyph;0318).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to participant data systems, a few commenters sought clarification regarding eligible applicants for whom information must be maintained under &sect;627.425(c). As used in the regulation, a ``formal'' determination of eligibility refers to a situation in which sufficient information has been obtained by the program for a staff person to make a determination of eligibility. The Department expects that such a determination will be made within a reasonable time after the information is obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Grant Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.430 establishes standards by which the Department will make payments to States as well as standards for States, SDA's, SSG's, and other subrecipients for making payments to lower tier subrecipients. Included within this section are standards for when advances to subrecipients are appropriate, when the reimbursement method is appropriate, and provision is made for using the working capital advance payment method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters addressed the provisions of this section. A few commenters raised concerns related to the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) and primarily suggested that the Department should delay CMIA requirements since SDA's/SSG's are waiting on the Department to publish CMIA standards. One commenter pointed out that at the current time, the Treasury Department regulations at 31 CFR part 205 do not go beyond the State level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CMIA applies only to States and does not carry through to subrecipients that are not a part of the State government. The Treasury Department published final regulations to implement CMIA at 31 CFR Part 205 on September 24, 1992. The Department does not plan to publish any additional CMIA standards applicable to grant funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that the September 24, 1992, Treasury Department regulations dropped the requirements that previously existed pertaining to subrecipients of States as well as non-State recipients. Therefore, the basic cash management standard of paragraph (b) of this section is revised to incorporate the standard that is generally applicable to other Federal grant programs. That standard is also generally consistent with the standard applicable to the JTPA program prior to the publication of the interim final rule. In addition, the requirement to maintain procedures as a part of the standard is deleted so that the standard is based only on the demonstration of effective cash management results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters raised questions of whether subrecipients other than CBO's and non-profit entities could receive advances or working capital advances. A few commenters wanted clarification on the specific requirements for payments to contractors. It is the intent of this section to provide for advances to any subrecipient as long as the subrecipient is in compliance with the basic cash management requirement that cash on hand shall be limited to actual immediate disbursement needs for program purposes. A subrecipient that does not meet that standard may be paid by either of the other two payment methods outlined in this section. The Department recognizes that, given the definitions in &sect;626.5 for subrecipient and contractor and the procurement requirements of the Act and these regulations, there is no need to establish separate payment requirements applicable to contractors. Therefore, paragraph (b)(2) of the interim final rule is removed from the final rule and corresponding language adjustments are made throughout the remainder of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters requested clarification of the requirement, in paragraph (f) of this section, which requires disbursement of cash received as a result of program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries, and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments in light of the time frame for the use of program income at &sect;627.450, Program income. The requirement in &sect;627.430(f) is a cash management requirement to ensure that cash attributable to JTPA does not remain in a bank account while at the same time the entity is drawing additional cash from the Treasury Department to meet immediate JTPA disbursement needs. Any cash attributable to JTPA should be immediately disbursed for whatever JTPA disbursement need exists. That need does not have to be the same as the entity's planned use of program income earnings nor does it relieve the entity of its liability to provide, within the funding period, an amount of program services equivalent to the amount of program income earned. At the time cash is needed for disbursement for the purposes for which the program income was planned to be used, it can be accessed through normal JTPA grant payment processes. Language is added to paragraph (f) of &sect;627.430 to more clearly apply this requirement to cash proceeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Cost Principles and Selected Items of Cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

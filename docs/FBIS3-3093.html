			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 16 (XINHUA)-- Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen said here today that China's defence budget  for 1994 has not gone up in real terms.    Qian made the assessment at a news conference here today.    China's military expenditure was 43.2 billion yuan in 1993  and in 1994, the figure is 52 billion yuan, Qian said.    On the surface, there has been an increase, but inflation in  1993 hit 13 percent. And this year inflation is expected to  reach 10 percent. An increase in this year's military  expenditure is to offset inflation, he said.    "For the Chinese military, therefore, the actual buying  power  has not gone up," the foreign minister said.    Military expenditure in 1994 accounts for 11 percent of the  state budget, a proportion which has remained largely unchanged  in recent years, he said.    And military spending accounts for less than 1.7 percent of  the country's GNP, which actually represents a slight drop from  last year's level.    In U.S. dollar terms, there is no change in the level of  China's military spending, Qian said.    Compared with the military spendings of the United States  and  Japan, China's military spending is "a pittanc," Qian said.    China's central budget shows that the Chinese Government is  concentrating its financial resources on developing its national  economy instead of seeking to be a military power, he said.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Ireland aim to conquer Mexico and midday heat After their dour win against Italy, Ireland play Mexico in Orlando today in Group E, the World Cup's toughest first-round group - and are spoiling for an early entry into the second round. Ireland's coach Jack Charlton is counting on his players to pressure the Mexican defence and its 5ft 9in goalie, Jorge Campos, and hoping that Irish stamina does not wilt under the midday sun. In turn, Mexico is set to boost its attack with added speed and skills. 'They live in this kind of heat, we don't,' said Charlton of the Mexicans, wondering about today's game-time temperature. During the first World Cup game at the Citrus Bowl, Orlando, last Sunday, it peaked at 109'F (43'C) on the pitch itself. 'This match is a great incentive to qualify and top our group,' said Charlton. That would mean Ireland would play in New Jersey in the second round, with overwhelming local support. Charlton said the Mexicans needed a win today to stay in the tournament. Mexican coach Miguel Mejia Baron said: 'We will try to be more offensive, more aggressive on the attack. The way they are going to play is just wait for counter-attacks. They'll try to take advantage of mistakes.' After the loss to Norway, Baron is expected to bring on Alberto Garcia Aspe. The mid-field star was suspended for the first game. 'He will be of great help,' said captain Ignacio Ambriz. Garcia Aspe is known for pin-point passing and a lethal left-foot shot. Baron could also call on striker Carlos Hermosillo, a veteran from the 1986 World Cup team, when Mexico reached the quarter-finals. Ireland will count on their traditional game of long passes, crosses and headers to pressure the comparatively small Mexican defence. But Tony Cascarino will not be in the Irish side. The striker ruled himself out because of a calf muscle injury. Charlton is hoping that Tommy Coyne can take the heat. Coyne suffered from severe dehydration against Italy.</p>

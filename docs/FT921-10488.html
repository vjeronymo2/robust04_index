			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Business site plan for Black Country THE Black Country Development Corporation announced plans yesterday to establish a manufacturing and business focus on a 250-acre site at Wednesbury, north-east of Birmingham. The state-funded body, which has the task of regerating one of the UK's most depressed areas, said it was negotiating with Sandwell Borough Council to buy the 93 acres of land that were once the Patent Shaft steelworks, which closed in 1979. Completion of negotiations, or compulsory acquisition through a parliamentary vesting order, would complete the assembly of land for the business area and make the site the largest available for development in the Black Country. Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, has said he would consider a vesting order, a measure which, after parliamentary debate, permits transfer of land from one public body to another. Sandwell has already designated the land at Wednesbury as suitable for business use. The decision of the development corporation to purchase Patent Shaft means that plans for a retail and leisure centre have been abandoned. Speyhawk Land and Estates, the London property group, has outline planning approval for such a centre, but its plans have been set back by a combination of financial troubles, the collapse of the commercial property market and the development of the nearby Merry Hill shopping centre.</p>

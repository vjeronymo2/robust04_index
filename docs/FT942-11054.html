			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Company failures reduced by 3% Fewer companies foundered in the first quarter of this year, providing an indication that the economy is emerging from recession, official figures showed yesterday. Seasonally adjusted figures for failures in England and Wales were down 3 per cent to 4,513 for the three months to the end of March compared with 4,634 in the last three months of last year. The figures, prepared for the British Chambers of Commerce by the government statistical service, were down 22 per cent on the same quarter of 1993.

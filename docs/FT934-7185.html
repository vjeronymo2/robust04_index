			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: How to find forgotten investments - Are you worth a fortune? / Tracking lost riches CHAOTIC home filing is a common failing. Investors who salt away money in shares, trusts or building societies may lose vital documents at the bottom of cupboards, or keep them in cardboard boxes. Years later, the papers are rediscovered and the owners wonder whether they could be worth anything - but finding out can be difficult. Here is a guide to tracking down some of the most commonly forgotten investments. Insurance-related investments, for example investment bonds, and endowments. Write to the last address you have for the insurer. If the company has moved, appears to have gone bust or merged, you could try writing to the Association of British Insurers, at 51 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ, which has a register of company changes, and should be able to tell you who is now responsible for the policy. Many people have old insurance policies issued by friendly societies or similar bodies. The Register of Friendly Societies has a telephone inquiry service on 071-437-9992, or write to 15 Great Marlborough Street, London, W1V 2AX. Building society accounts. First try writing to the last address you have for the society. Over the years, many societies have merged and may no longer exist under the same name, or have moved headquarters. If you write to the Building Societies Association, Consumer Affairs Department, 3 Savile Row, London, W1X 1AF, with the details, they should be able to track down which society took over the old business, or give you an up-to-date address. Investment trusts. The Association of Investment Trust Companies may help if you can find no trace of the fund in which you invested, because it has merged, changed names or been wound up. Write to the AITC at: Park House, 6th Floor, 16 Finsbury Circus, EC2M 7JJ. Unit trusts. The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds has records can help trace your unit trust investment through name changes and mergers. Write to Autif at: 65 Kingsway, London, WC2B 6TD. Company shares. If you discover an old share certificate, check first whether the company's shares are still listed in the FT, then try writing to the last registered address you have on the share certificate. The next resort is the public library. Until 1989, the Stock Exchange published an annual Register of Defunct and Other Companies which were no longer listed, because of merger or collapse. Since 1989, a supplement to the Stock Exchange Yearbook has updated this annually. Larger libraries should have copies. Companies House, official repository of company information, has an archive search service for companies registered since 1844. It costs Pounds 15 per company. For details, write to Nicola Lynch, Archive Search Service, Room G16, Companies House, Cardiff, CF4 3UZ. Tel: 0222-380928. If the company failed a long time ago, the share's only value may be as a collector's item - see the information on scripophily, under bonds. Premium bonds. Many people have a sneaking suspicion Ernie has forgotten their holding. If you have moved home, or changed your name without letting National Savings know, there could be an unclaimed prize waiting. Inform National Savings of your changed details, either by returning your yellow holder's card or sending in a special form obtainable from the post office, and the department will run a check on outstanding winnings. As at October this year, more than 200,000 prizes, adding up to Pounds 11.2m, remained unclaimed 18 months after they were drawn. Otherwise, you could consult the list of all unclaimed prizes dating back to 1957, kept in main post offices. National Savings warns that you would need 'a long wet afternoon' to work your way through this bulky document. If a premium bond holder has died, winnings from a draw up to a year after the date of death can be claimed by the estate, with no time limit. Bonds issued by countries. In the late 1980s there was a rush to check drawers and files for old bond certificates, as Russia, China, and many eastern block and Latin American countries agreed to redeem old bonds, often dating back to the 1920s or earlier, as a pre-condition for raising new money on the international bond markets. Bonds had to be submitted by fixed deadlines for the holders to receive a portion of their face value. Most countries have gone through this process and deadlines have passed. One possible exception is the former East Germany. If you have a bond from a country which you think has not yet come to an arrangement, you could try writing to David Wooten, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Nationality Treaty and Claims Department, Clive House, Petty France, London, SW1 9HD. If your bonds stand no chance of redemption, they could still be worth something to collectors - known as scripophilists - who often buy the more decorative and exotic bonds or shares to frame and hang on their walls. There are specialist dealers and Phillips, the auction house, holds quarterly sales. Rare certificates can fetch thousands of pounds. For advice, write to the Bond and Share Department, Phillips, 101 New Bond Street, London, WIY 0AS. Pensions. If you worked for a company for a few years, even decades ago, you might be entitled to a small pension. Or if you belonged to a personal pension scheme, and lost track of your investment, the Pension Schemes Registry, run by the Occupational Pensions Board, has a database of 170,000 occupational and personal schemes. It offers a free tracing service if you provide as much information as possible about the employer's/pension scheme's last known name and address. The database goes back to the 1970s, but can often help with entitlements dating back 40 years. The service's success rate is 90 per cent. Write to the Pension Schemes Registry at: PO Box 1NN, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE99 1NN.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL L.A. DEBUT FOR CELIBIDACHE  </P> <P> The Munich Philharmonic, which made its much ballyhooed U.S. debut over the  weekend with concerts at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and UCLA, is a solid,  uneven, sometimes brilliant, sometimes untidy orchestra. Most experts agree  about that.  </P> <P> What they don't agree about is the conductor of the Munich Philharmonic, Sergiu  Celibidache.  </P> <P> He is, without question, an original -- an iconoclast, a mystic, a philosopher,  a teacher, a cult figure, a bona fide musical maverick. He demands endless  rehearsals. He refuses to make recordings. He strikes innocent, democratic  poses while ruling the band like a willful autocrat.  </P> <P> At 76, he has become an international celebrity almost by default. He plays by  his own, old-fashioned, indulgent, anti-commercial, intellectually and  physically demanding rules, or he doesn't play at all.  </P> <P> That makes him either a sinner or a saint, depending on one's perspective. That  explains why we haven't seen him until now.  </P> <P> The fundamental disagreement about Celibidache involves his actual prowess on  the podium. Some observers regard him as a genius, pure and complex. To the  devout he represents a living bond with the standards and aspirations of a  distant golden age. The unmoved view him -- and dismiss him -- as a gimmicky  eccentric who hides his weaknesses behind a network of carefully manipulated  mannerisms.  </P> <P> The standing ovations that he elicited -- an uncharitable observer might say  orchestrated -- at the Music Center on Saturday would suggest that Celibidache  belongs among the lonely elite in a profession dominated by malpractitioners.  Still, there were moments when a cool, objectively analytical head could wonder  if the visiting and conquering emperor was really all that well dressed. A few  boos reportedly punctuated the cheers on Friday.  </P> <P> For his second program here, Celibidache concentrated on the massive,  sprawling, convoluted, potentially uplifting rhetoric of Bruckner's Fourth  Symphony. Originally, he had scheduled Mozart's "Jupiter" as a curtain-raiser,  but the bonus ultimately was abandoned. In context, one was grateful.  </P> <P> Without much personal fuss or histrionic flair, Celibidache delineated  Bruckner's romantic impulses on a heroic, majestic scale. This was Germanic  music-making in the broad yet brilliant, increasingly obscure tradition of  Furtwangler and Knappertsbusch.  </P> <P> Celibidache carefully unraveled all the linear knots. He lingered over inner  voices. He lent new meaning to the concept of pianissimo. He gauged the zonking  climaxes with infinite care. He allowed the lyrical utterances to soar. He  concentrated on sustaining organic tension, mindful that this is one long --  very long -- cumulative statement, not four isolated movements.  </P> <P> It was wonderful.  </P> <P> He also tended to slow everything down, often without warning or obvious  motivation, sometimes with willful determination. Bruckner's markings for the  grandiose finale include the instruction, "nicht zu schnell" (not too fast). In  this instance, the composer needn't have worried.  </P> <P> The maestro lavished 90 minutes on this symphonic journey. He paused along the  way for all manner of expressive detours, surprising accents, distortions and  distentions.  </P> <P> It was awful.  </P> <P> Admittedly, the performance was interesting even when it was awful. At a time  when so many celebrated conductors are faceless, efficient technicians,  Celibidache remains, if nothing else, a stubbornly compelling, fiercely  independent force.  </P> <P> We will, no doubt, have to hear more of him to judge whether he is a genuine  interpretive giant or a talented, egomaniacal eccentric. It might be noted,  however, that the impression he created last week at an open rehearsal for a  staggeringly mannered Brahms Fourth reinforced the possibility of the latter.  </P> <P> The Muncheners responded attentively to their boss' subtle urgings.  Nevertheless, one heard a lot of strident winds, blaring brass and scrambled  strings. Although spirits were obviously high, unanimous precision seemed a low  priority. The playing tended toward the "gemutlich." One wondered where all  those vaunted hours of rehearsal had gone.  </P> <P> In some ways, the best part of the show came when it was over. The house had  been bathed in darkness for the Bruckner, but the lights came on for the a  magnificently choreographed series of curtain calls.  </P> <P> First the maestro stood rigidly with his back to the adoring crowd and absorbed  the good vibrations. Then he issued sharp commands for the orchestra to sit and  rise and sit and rise, acknowledging the applause en masse. Then came  painstakingly manicured bows by every soloist within the orchestra, followed by  militaristic bows by individual sections.  </P> <P> Then and only then did a frail and tired Celibidache turn, descend from the  podium and face his admirers. He did this oh-so humbly, standing amid the lowly  violins. He seemed to want to insist that he is merely a team player, a  selfless member of the ensemble.  </P> <P> Wethinks he doth protest too much.  </P></p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / German bourses combine to take on Europe: David Waller on the dawning era of Finanzplatz Deutschland Germany's fragmented stock exchanges, divided between eight different centres, have at last decided to share a common future. The announcement yesterday that the exchanges would be brought under a single holding company  -Deutsche Borse, the German Exchange - from the beginning of 1993 is intended to put an end to decades of damaging rivalry between Frankfurt, by far the dominant market, and its smaller sisters. The decision is a big step towards the realisation of Finanzplatz Deutschland, the often-postponed ideal of Germany as a strong financial centre. Yet it also leaves some difficult questions unanswered. By providing for the exchanges in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Munich, Hanover, Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Bremen to retain their independent existence, it ensures that regional tensions will linger within the new structure. And by providing for the parallel development of screen and floor-based trading, it leaves scope for rivalry between the two systems. Still, the agreement is an important achievement, actively encouraged by the federal government. Ten months ago, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, visited the Frankfurt exchange for the first time, calling for stronger capital markets in Germany. Days earlier, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, had presented a package of policy proposals designed to strengthen Finanzplatz Deutschland. The creation of Deutsche Borse was only one such measure. Mr Waigel also called for an insider dealing law and a centralised supervisory body for the German securities industry. The plan was to implement these measures by the end of the current year. That timetable will be impossible: Germany is unlikely to have a law against insider dealing law or a new supervisory body until the end of next year. However, as Mr Friedrich von Metzler, chairman of the Frankfurt bourse, said in a recent interview, the creation of Deutsche Borse is the necessary first step. The agreement represents a series of compromises: between Frankfurt and the other exchanges; between the big banks and the smaller dealers; between the proponents of screen-based dealing and trading on a physical exchange floor. The Frankfurt exchange, accounting for some 70 per cent of German securities business, will be transformed into a new holding company which will acquire the Deutsche Terminborse (the German screen-based futures and options exchange) and the Deutsche Kassenverein, the hitherto-independent clearing and settlement agency for German securities. The seven other bourses will then buy 10 per cent of the new holding company between them, and will be entitled to four seats on an enlarged supervisory board. A further 10 per cent will be offered to the Makler, Germany's official broking community. The balance will be owned by Germany's credit institutions. At first glance, Mr Rolf Breuer's appointment as chairman-designate of the Deutsche Borse - he is a main board director of the Deutsche Bank - might suggest a victory for the large Frankfurt financial institutions over the smaller banks and brokers. It will suit the commercial aims of the larger institutions to have a more centralised exchange, but the fact that the smaller exchanges have backed the scheme as it stands shows that Mr Breuer has compromised enough to assuage fears of domination by big banks and Frankfurt. He has done this, in part, by a firm commitment to retain floor trading, in Frankfurt and at the other seven exchanges. New technology, originally seen as a threat to the smaller exchanges, has in fact worked to reduce tensions. Ibis, the Frankfurt bourse's screen-based dealing system, has overcome initial hostility from the seven smaller exchanges, and now provides a significant part of their business. The new Deutsche Borse has ambitious plans to introduce a fully-electronic screen-based dealing system for the 30-50 most frequently traded equities and bonds in three to four years' time. That will still leave many securities traded only on the exchange floors, providing them with a continued raison d'etre. Mr Breuer said yesterday that the regional bourses and the Makler supported the idea of a dual stock exchange: a network of electronic trading for a 'European League' of the most heavily traded company shares and bonds; and a 'regional league' of domestic securities with a strong regional connection. The regional floors will be enhanced by providing them with electronic support services. Mr von Metzler claimed that the new arrangement will ensure that Germany has one of the most sophisticated stock exchange structures in Europe. But he acknowledges that there are still many challenges ahead. German capital markets are underdeveloped, he says, reflecting the fact that bank finance, not equity, has been the engine of post-war Germany. Even now, there are only about 660 quoted companies on the German market, representing a far smaller proportion of the country's economic output than in the US or the UK. Moreover, Germany's federal structure works against the speedy solution of other issues. The lack of centralised regulation will not be solved without haggling between Bonn and the governments of the Lander (states). 'We have established the groundwork for future developments,' says Mr von Metzler. 'We have the structure, and now we have to fill it with life.'</p>

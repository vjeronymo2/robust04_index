At the beginning of 1994  there were 154 joint-stock companies (45 percent of the total  number), 26 commercial partnerships (8 percent), and 14 leased  enterprises (4 percent) engaged in industrial production. The  number of joint-stock companies was six times as high as at the  beginning of 1993, and the number of partnerships was three  times as high. The number of leased enterprises was reduced by  more than half.    Oblast industry produced goods worth 7.2127 trillion rubles  in existing prices, with state enterprises accounting for 94  percent, mixed enterprises accounting for 5 percent, and  municipal and private enterprises accounting for 0.4 and 0.6  percent respectively. Enterprises of the Khanty-Mansiysk  Autonomous Okrug produced 71.2 percent of the total output,  enterprises in the Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug produced 19.6  percent, and enterprises in the south of the oblast produced 9.2  percent.    The growth of production volume (or the maintenance of the  previous volume) at enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation  and Gazprom concern began to stabilize the output of  manufactured goods in the oblast as a whole and in the  autonomous okrugs in October 1993. Production volume is still  decreasing, however, at enterprises in the southern zone. Output  decreased at the turbo-machine and Ishim Agricultural Machinery  plants, the Zavod ATE joint-stock company, the Ishim  Machine-Building Plant, the Tobolsk Petrochemical Combine, and  other enterprises.    Production Output in Physical Terms: The output of  petroleum and gas condensate at oblast enterprises in 1993 was  35.6 million tonnes (or 13.7 percent) below the figure for 1992  and amounted to 224.7 million tonnes, including 218.6 million  tonnes of oil. Most of the oil (98.8 percent) was produced by  enterprises of the Rosneftegaz corporation, and the rest was  produced by enterprises of the State Geology Committee (0.7  percent), the Urengoygazprom Production Association (0.4  percent), and the Krasnoleninskneftegazgeologiya state  enterprise (0.1 percent).    The Kalchinsk subdivision of the Tyumenneftegaz Scientific  Production Association and the Tyumennedra state enterprise  produced 50,300 tonnes of petroleum in Uvatskiy Rayon.    The average daily output of petroleum and gas condensate at  the end of 1993 was equivalent to the 1977-78 level and amounted  to 615,600 tonnes. This was 13.5 percent below the 1992 figure  and 0.5 percent below the figure for January-November 1993. The  output decreased at all enterprises of the Rosneftegaz  corporation, with the exception of the Varyeganneftegaz  joint-stock company.    The output of natural gas was 3.1 percent below the 1992  figure. The average daily output was 2.8 percent below the  previous year's figure.    Urengoygazprom, the largest gas production association,  produced 24.8 billion cubic meters, or 8.6 percent, less than it  had produced the previous year.    There was a decrease in the output of electricity, liquefied  hydrocarbon gases, synthetic resins and plastics, metal-cutting  and woodworking machine tools, oil production equipment,  technological equipment for light industry, tractor and vehicle  trailers and semi-trailers, agricultural machines, building  brick, prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and  elements, and other items. The output of all of the main  products of the timber and woodworking industry also decreased.    The output of diesel fuel, batteries, and disposable needles  and syringes increased.</p>

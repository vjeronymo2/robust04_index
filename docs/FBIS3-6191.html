			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean press,  placed squarely under the boot of the Workers' (Communist)  Party, has sharpened the "pens of revolution" to spearhead the  North's recently stepped-up campaign against the South. The  press joined the North's mud-slinging drive in earnest late last  year when the workers' party prodded journalists to intensify  propaganda against the South.    "The press should step up propaganda campaigns in firm  support of the struggles of the South Korean people, who are  fighting for self-reliant and democratic unification," the party  said. The party's instructions were contained in a  congratulatory message sent to the seventh general meeting of  the North Korean Journalists Union held last Nov. 17. As a show  of their faithful adherence to the instructions, the Journalists  Union pledged firm unity and loyalty to the great leader, Kim  Il-song, and the party on March 10 at its 48th anniversary  celebration.    North Korean journalists abet subversion in the South  because  they fail to uphold freedom of the press -- that is, to satisfy  the people's right to know -- in their own country, and because  their main goal is to muster unswerving public support and  loyalty for the great leader and his party. The regime's use of  newspapers for its political purposes is not so strange given  the party's press policy.    A press guideline handed down by the party describes the  press as "a medium of chuche" and "a revolutionary medium of Kim  Il-songism."    Of course, the North Korean Constitution does provide for  "freedom of the press" in Article 67. But in interpreting this  constitutional provision, the official history glossary of North  Korea says, "we at no time can accord these freedoms and rights  to the enemy of the fatherland and people." It is thus clear  that "freedom of the press" as mentioned in the North means the  "freedom" to demonstrate loyalty to the great leader and party.    This is a "freedom" under which no criticism of the North  Korean official ideology, system or state policies is tolerated.  The "theory of the press," a North Korean textbook on  journalism, sheds a brighter light on the nature of the  Stalinist state's press. It explains that the press must perform  the "function of propaganda and agitation, the function of  organizer and the function of culture and indoctrinator."    In other words, North Korea forces the press to serve as an  "ideological tool for class struggle" and a "socio-political  tool" designed to link the policies of the great leader and the  party to the people. It is under this basic press policy that  the North Korean media as a whole are required to place emphasis  more on purpose than on reality in handling news.    This is why such significant news items as the suspension of  the '94 Team Spirit exercise and the decision to hold the third  round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks were reported by  North Korean media only on March 6, three days after they had  been announced. The media's anti-South programs are carefully  orchestrated by the Choson (North Korean) Central News Agency,  which is under the direct control of the Administration Council.    The agency has a "South Korean News Bureau" and a "South  Korean Research Department" that prepare news on the South and  items related to unification programs for distribution to all  print and broadcast media. Little wonder then, that the regime  seems satisfied with the performance of the only North Korean  News Agency.    "The Choson Central News Agency has performed a great role  in  letting the South Korean people rise up in anti-U.S. and nation-  saving struggles and in strengthening the international  solidarity of revolution," said a report on the agency's 30th  anniversary in December 1976.    Among the broadcast media, Pyongyang Broadcasting Station  specializes in programs covering the South and abroad. Its  programs about the South are all designed to instill communist  ideas in the minds of South Koreans and agitate them into  staging a popular uprising. A typical example of such programs  is the serialized "chuche thought is the true view of the world  in the contemporary age and the most accurate guidance thought  for campaigns for change in South Korea." There is also the  "Minminjon Broadcasting Station," which the Workers' Party runs  directly and which North Korea disguises as an underground radio  operated somewhere in the South. The duty of the psychological  warfare station is to spread slanderous propaganda and wild  rumors among South Koreans to discredit the Seoul government.    The specific organization that tightly controls all of the  print media is the propaganda and agitation department of the  Workers' Party. Individual journalists are not immune from party  control, either. In the first place, all of them have to be  ideologically screened by the Party's Central Committee before  being recruited by the press.</p>

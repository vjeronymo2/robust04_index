			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 25 May (EFE) -- A large area of Quito was  left without drinking water when two charges of dynamite  exploded in the city's main water processing plant early  yesterday. Today, the police continue defusing explosives in  the installation, Patricio Ribadeneira, manager of the  Municipal Drinking Water Enterprise (EMAP), stated.    The explosives destroyed the energy tower that allows the  plant to function. No group has claimed responsibility for the  attack, which "regrettably means the suspension of drinking  water service in a large area of the city for several days," the  manager noted. "The police are also helping workers of EMAP and  the electricity enterprise handle the problem, because some  charges have not exploded and constitute an imminent danger,"  Ribadeneira added.</p>

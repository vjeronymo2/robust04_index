			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe by </F> corrspondent Emmanuel Mugunga "today"; place not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] After meeting Jean-Michel Marlaud, the French  envoy to Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] chairman,  Alexis Kanyarengwe, today gave an interview to our colleague,  Emmanuel Mugunga. Let us listen to the RPF chairman who starts  by giving us his reasons for holding talks with the French envoy.    [Kanyarengwe] Indeed, I said last time that it was not  necessary to receive the French delegation, given that the  problems at hand were well known and that the RPF position on  the current situation concerning France's intervention was very  clear. However, this morning, I met the French envoy in Kigali,  Mr. Marlaud to know exactly why he insisted on meeting me.    [Mugunga] What was the explanation?    [Kanyarwengwe] Well, during the meeting, he briefed us on  his  government's position concerning the French intervention in  Rwanda: That it would be a purely humanitarian intervention and  nothing to do with exerting power. He also sought to inform us  about the decision of the UN Security Council authorizing the  French intervention in Rwanda. In reply, I explained that even  with the UN authorization for the French intervention, the  French presence was not at all appreciated by the RPF, and we  considered the presence of these troops a dangerous element for  the security and the success of operations in our country.    [Mugunga] Did envoy Marlaud talk to you about the state of  progress of the so-called humanitarian mission?    [Kanyarwengwe] In fact, a resolution was adopted at the  Security Council in New York. And you know that even before the  UN decision, France had already taken the initiative of  preparing everything, placing all its equipment and troops in a  country neighboring Rwanda. This means that the French  operation was already ready at the border, despite our  apprehensions which indeed persist. [passage omitted]</p>

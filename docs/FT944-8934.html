			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / International Company News: National Gypsum receives Dollars 940m bid National Gypsum, the second largest US maker of plasterboard, has received a Dollars 940m bid from a North Carolina-based investor group led by Golden Eagle Industries, an investment company. The head of Golden Eagle, Mr C. D. Spangler, has been non-executive chairman of National Gypsum since February. National Gypsum said the offer had come as a surprise, and the board had not yet had time to consider it. Golden Eagle first bought into the company on its emergence from bankruptcy last October, in conjunction with Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials group. Both took a 10 per cent stake, with Golden Eagle's holding rising to 19 per cent and Lafarge Coppee's remaining unchanged. Golden Eagle said yesterday it had offered Lafarge Coppee the opportunity to participate in the takeover, under the terms of an agreement struck at the time of the initial investment. Lafarge Coppee, which also expressed surprise at the announcement, has yet to respond. Golden Eagle said it would have as equity partners in the bid, First Union and NationsBank both of North Carolina. The offer price of Dollars 43.50 per share is 33 per cent above the previous day's close. National Gypsum's shares rose Dollars 12.25 to Dollars 45 in early trading on Wall Street. The offer is the second attempt to take National Gypsum private in recent years. The first, a Dollars 1.6bn management-led buy-out, ended in collapse in 1990 as a result of recession in the US construction industry. Since emerging from Chapter 11 a year ago the company has traded profitably, with net earnings of Dollars 56.5m on sales of Dollars 463m in the first nine months of this year. It has 24 per cent of the US plasterboard market, compared with 33 per cent at USG, its larger rival.</p>

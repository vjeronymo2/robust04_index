			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Tied down by bonds The equity market has again fallen foul of events in bonds. Yesterday's 47-point fall in London was the product first of disappointing public sector borrowing figures for August and later of the sharp rise in US industrial production which raises fears of further increases in transatlantic interest rates. That equities should react badly to signs of economic growth always suggests valuations are stretched. But this week has shown them again in thrall to bonds, where the outlook is not particularly promising. There is no particular need to worry about one month's poor borrowing figures. The cumulative trend in government spending this year still suggests the PSBR will undershoot the government's Pounds 36bn target. But the positive response to Monday's higher base rates has quickly evaporated and the government funding programme is no longer as comfortably ahead as it was at the start of the year. For the time being, the authorities seem to be playing safe. The September auction will be of 10-year paper which is usually attractive to international investors and deliverable into the futures contract. With a stronger sterling and a yield premium of 150 basis points over German government bonds, it may meet reasonable demand. But the German market is spooked by the realisation that the government is behind with its financing while the interest rate cycle has turned. Against that background, there is not much relief in sight.</p>

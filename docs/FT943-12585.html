			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / UK companies still sceptical on lower inflation, says CBI Most British companies have not adjusted their investment criterion for low inflation and interest rates, in spite of warnings from the government that this is stifling investment, a new business survey has found. The Confederation of British Industry survey shows many companies still demand that investment projects should either yield a rate of return above 20 per cent, or else pay back the investment within three years. Most companies assume the government will not deliver its inflation target. Their average prediction for inflation when considering investment projects is 5 per cent, compared with the government's target of bringing it below 2.5 per cent by the end of the parliament. The survey is likely to fuel the government's appeals to companies to lower inflation expectations to boost investment, currently running at relatively modest levels in spite of the overall pick-up in manufacturing. The report says that uncertainty about demand appears to be the key constraint for business investment, although it admits that companies' scepticism about inflation is a factor. The report, which surveyed almost 500 manufacturing companies, found that two-fifths of companies that use a nominal or real rate of return to assess investment projects want a return in excess of 20 per cent. Two-thirds of firms that use 'payback' assessment want periods of two to three years. The pattern varies, with almost one-third of companies using a nominal rate of return prepared to accept a return of less than 11 per cent. One-fifth of companies using this method have lowered investment expectations in the light of low inflation. However, the investment appraisal has remained unchanged among two-thirds of companies using a payback assessment and half of those using real rates of return. Mr Sudhir Junankar, CBI associate director for economic analysis, said the results showed that 'long-term investment in the UK still depends largely on the achievement of a more stable macro-economic environment.' The Bank of England welcomed the survey as 'bearing out' the results of its own informal survey of companies. Mr Eddie George, the Bank's governor, warned at the weekend that 'very profitable' investment opportunities were being missed because of industry's failure to adjust to the new low inflation environment.

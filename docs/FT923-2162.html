			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: Valentine's Day - Theatre Bernard Shaw said that, in writing plays, his dramaturgical models were Mozart's operas. Maybe that's why his plays are so often (against his will) on the cusp of becoming musicals. But not every Shaw play turns into song as well as Pygmalion (or My Fair Lady). There is plenty going for Valentine's Day, which - first staged last year in Chichester - is a musical version of Shaw's You Never Can Tell. (It has Shaw's dialogue, for one thing.) What it chiefly lacks is music; music, that is, memorable enough to put Benny Green's clever lyrics on wings. Everything the composer, Denis King, does is accomplished, derivative and forgettable. Still, there is Edward Petherbridge, as in Chichester, playing William (or Walter) the white-haired waiter, and he is a wonder. He sings on the frailest thread of voice, he dances in brief little spurts of low-key energy, and yet he has the musicality and the wit to make his numbers entrancing. William, a wistful observer of other people's acts, a model of tact, is a perfect Petherbridge role. The new ingredient, which stops it from being just another Petherbridge role, is a secret glee. Each of his songs starts to turn into his own happy fantasy. What he gives you is not wonderful song or dance but - more touching and funny - William's pleasure in song and dance; the side of William that might have performed in music-hall. William, however, is just on the sidelines. Valentine's Day is about male-female relations. The plot concerns two couples - the middle-aged couple, Crampton and Mrs Clandon, who separated long ago; and the young adult couple, Valentine and Gloria, who meet in the first scene and who fall in love. Gloria, daughter to Crampton and Mrs Clandon, is the central figure. She is the emancipated modern woman, poised ready to conquer the forthcoming twentieth century - until love confuses her and stops her being a heroine all the time. As she comes to terms with herself, so she comes to terms with both her parents It's a good plot, but King's music and Green's lyrics make it too diffuse. Gloria, in particular, is given too little prominence. Only late in Act Two  -and then because of Shaw's dialogue rather than song - do you feel the charm of her dilemma, as this latterday Diana the huntress descends from her pedestal and dwindles into a wife. Teresa Banham's performance has far more spirit and animation than Fiona Fullerton's had in Chichester - though she could carry herself with more perfect nobility. Her happy bewildermentis truly moving. Too bad that the show doesn't make more of her role. Likewise the role of her mother, Mrs Clandon, is better taken now by Elizabeth Counsell (looking like Marcia Falkender) than it was by Judy Parfitt; but the part itself seems less important now. For Alexander Hanson as Valentine  -manly, energetic, engaging - every praise. The director is Gillian Lynne, and she is responsible the best and worst features of the show. It's she who gives William such good dance material; and indeed almost all the choreography is good (echoes of Ashton's Facade and A Wedding Bouquet). But it's also she who has the chorus of waitresses and servants perform with such wretchedly bright-eyed cuteness. As Petherbridge shows, less is more. The Globe Theatre</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / I spy with my little eye: Jimmy Burns uncovers a snoopers' corner in London's Belgravia JOHN Major may have pledged to 'sweep away some of the cobwebs of secrecy', but there still seem to be an awful lot of people around who think they are James Bond. The opening of a shop in Lowndes Street in London's Belgravia called Spycatcher is the latest evidence of the spying epidemic that appears to be sweeping post cold-war Britain. According to security industry sources, the use of surveillance and counter-surveillance equipment for private or business use is on the increase with the open marketing of devices which once would have been the preserve of professionals. Spycatcher - rather more sophisticated than the gadgetry shops along the Tottenham Court Road - stocks everything from the tongue-in-cheek to the deadly serious, although according to Conrad Sandler, its managing director, only 10 per cent of its clients come in just for fun. Into the tongue-in-cheek category slot a pair of 'see-behind' sun glasses (Pounds 25), telephone voice-changers (man to woman or woman to man) at Pounds 150 as well as a range of 'revenge and harassment books' which persecuted secretaries can give as Christmas presents. More serious are state-of-the art bugging devices (including office-style personal organisers with miniature tapes) at Pounds 800 to Pounds 1,000, bullet and knife proof vests (Pounds 450-Pounds 1,000), 'special' telephone recorders, and handset scramblers of use to both predator and potential victim. Sandler gives away little about his own background or about the company's owners, and he suggests that not all equipment available is readily on display to the inquiring journalist. One suspects there is more than a touch of marketing ploy behind the apparent climate of secrecy. He is certainly bullish when it comes to talking about the people he sells to. To that extent Spycatcher is as upfront as its namesake, Peter Wright, the British intelligence agent, who told us everything we are ever likely to know about M15 in a controversial bestseller. Robert Maxwell, who bugged most of his directors and some of his enemies, was not one of Sandler's clients. But many other businessmen - usually acting through intermediaries - are. 'A hell of a lot of people bug their own companies,' says Sandler, who describes himself as a former locksmith with years of experience in the security business. 'Most of the clients we get come from the upper-middle to wealthy class. They are the ones who have the most to lose and who are the most worried about themselves. To worry about security you have to have something to lose, whether its your life or your possessions.' Spycatcher's client profile is broad. It ranges from paranoid marriage partners, to company executives who want one to keep one step ahead of the competition. Sandler, who clearly enjoys his work, is ready to give examples as long as names are not mentioned. 'We have some unusual clients . . . there was a woman in the other day who was quite convinced that someone had followed her all the way from Arizona to London just to fool about with her underwear. Another customer came in and wanted a watch that would enable him to listen to what his wife was up to in Abu Dhabi.' According to Sandler, one growing sector of clients comes under the heading 'social'. This is is the client who goes to a cocktail party and does not want to be seen taking notes between mouthfuls of canapes. A micro-recorder the size of a matchbox, neatly tucked into the inside pocket of a dinner jacket or inside a bra, ensures that the businessman or woman can pick up on that essential tip or even check on any personal indiscretion. 'Offensive' bugging devices like those on sale in a shop such as Spycatcher have been known to be used by a temporary absentee board member who wanted to know what his fellow directors were saying just before making an apparently 'chance' entry. Sandler remembers being approached by a gold dealer who suspected he had been undercut by his customer and wanted to intercept his telephone. 'I told him it would cost him Pounds 20,000. I would have helped him with the equipment if he'd paid the money upfront (which he didn't) although I told him that what he was trying to do would have been difficult lawfully,' he recalled. In fact one of the reasons that James Bonds are on the increase is that UK law is rather fuzzy when it comes to the use of equipment available through companies such as Spycatcher. The Home Office said this week that the buying and selling of bugging devices which usually operate on UHF and VHF frequences was legal. Theoretically, certain activities connected with the installation of bugging devices could lead to the user being prosecuted under Company Law, the Official Secrets Act, or Common Law. The interception of other people's phones is also an offence under the Interception of Communications Act 1985 which makes it illegal to tap a phone without a warrant. However, John Wadham, legal adviser to the National Council of Civil Liberties, says there are huge practical difficulties in implementing the law. He said: 'Because the activities have become so secretive, they have become out of control.' Sandler insists that nothing he stocks is illegal but is not reassuring when he talks about the real James Bonds for whom the kind of equipment he displays in his shop window are of limited interest. 'Government intelligence agencies are now using much more sophisticated equipment than anything that is available on the open market. What is on sale commercially is what intelligence agencies were using ten years ago . . . there is no antidote against what they have now,' says Sandler.</p>

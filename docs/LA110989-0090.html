			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PROFESSOR'S 'PENDULUM';  </P> <P> BOOKS: IN HIS SECOND NOVEL, UMBERTO ECO FOCUSES ON MAN'S AFFINITY FOR GRAND  SCHEMES BUILT ON DUBIOUS PREMISES.  </P> <P> It was a glorious Indian summer day in Manhattan, the kind that Umberto Eco  ordinarily might spend roaming the city streets and drinking in the sights and  sounds.  </P> <P> But these are not ordinary times for the portly, bearded university  professor-turned-novelist, who created a literary sensation almost a decade ago  with the publication of his first fictional work, "The Name of the Rose."  </P> <P> His long-awaited second novel, "Foucault's Pendulum," has just been released in  an English-language version by his American publishers, Harcourt Brace  Jovanovich, and his schedule overflows with the usual rounds of interviews,  book signings, lectures, readings and receptions to promote the book.  </P> <P> "My only pleasure is to obey my publicist," he said with a sigh during an  interview in the sun-filled tearoom of the elegant Fifth Avenue hotel where he  was staying. "It is a pity, because I am a compulsive walker."  </P> <P> Still, the amiable expression on his face seemed to say, that it is a small  sacrifice for the adulation he and his new novel are receiving.  </P> <P> In Italy, where the book came out last year, it sold more than 600,000 copies  in the first three months of release and launched a new wave of "Ecomania." At  one point, it was outselling its closest rival on the Top 10 list by about 100  to 1.  </P> <P> In this country, in the space of three short weeks, it has already climbed to  the top ranking in the Washington area and holds the No. 3 spots on the Los  Angeles Times and New York Times best-seller lists. His book signings have been  mobbed by eager fans, and his readings, lectures and debates have played to  packed houses. In addition, his American publishers are printing 25,000 more  copies of the book to augment the initial run of 250,000 copies.  </P> <P> Along with its commercial success, the book has been greeted by overwhelming  critical acclaim.  </P> <P> No one, of course, is more pleased at all this than the 57-year-old Eco, who,  until the publication of "The Name of the Rose" in 1980, was little known  outside of academic circles in his chosen field of semiotics, the study of  symbols and signs.  </P> <P> "Every author has two dreams," said Eco, who speaks fluent English with a  lilting Italian accent. "One is to sell a lot of copies. The other is to have  written such an important book that it is difficult to read. But to have both.  . . ."  </P> <P> There is no denying that his latest book is difficult to read -- in many ways,  perhaps even more so than "The Name of the Rose."  </P> <P> For starters, it is 641 pages long -- almost 1 1/3 times as long as "The Name  of the Rose." What is more, it has a far more convoluted structure and ranges  in subject matter over what at times seems like the whole of Western culture,  from Jewish cabala, the medieval Knights Templars, Shakespeare and Celtic  legend to Karl Marx, Afro-Brazilian voodoo, computer theory and Mickey Mouse.  </P> <P> But in much the same way that he wrapped the medieval theological disputes and  disquisitions in "The Name of the Rose" around a good old-fashioned murder  mystery to hold the reader's interest, so he has plotted "Foucault's Pendulum"  around a compelling adventure mystery.  </P> <P> What is more, his presentation of the often arcane and abstruse history in the  book is seldom dull or unreadable.  </P> <P> For example, in describing the rise of the Knights Templars, a militant  religious order established among the Crusaders in the early 12th Century,  Casaubon, the narrator and one of the chief characters of the book, says:  "Remember, the new kingdom of Jerusalem was sort of the California of the day,  the place you went to make your fortune. Prospects at home were not great, and  some of the knights may have been on the run for one reason or another. I think  of it as a kind of Foreign Legion."  </P> <P> Eco says the fascination his books hold, despite the difficulties they pose for  readers, is easily explained.  </P> <P> "There are many books that are adventures, in which someone is going through a  forest, in which a lot of strange trees with exotic names are mentioned," he  said. "You may not know the names or the shapes of the trees. But you continue  reading because you participate in a sort of an agreement with the author. Now  suppose that, instead of using nature, the author uses culture, as I do. The  effect is the same."  </P> <P> "Foucault's Pendulum," eight years in the writing, is the story of three  editors at an obscure publishing house in Milan who get caught up in a hoax of  their own making involving a supposed Knights Templars plan to tap a mystic  source of power greater than any other known on Earth.  </P> <P> In the end, they are hoist by their own petard -- in the case of one character,  almost literally so.  </P> <P> Eco says the book is a cautionary tale against a problem that has plagued  mankind for centuries: the all-too-human passion for concocting some grand  scheme -- usually conspiratorial in nature -- then, finding hidden meanings in  the least little things to back it up.  </P> <P> In many cases, Eco says, such intellectual machinations are relatively harmless  -- like the 19th-Century literary tracts that sought to prove, through their  eccentric interpretations of "The Divine Comedy," that Dante was a Rosicrucian,  even though he lived hundreds of years before the mystic order's founding.  </P> <P> At other times, however, the results of this "plotomania," as Eco calls it, can  have disastrous consequences.  </P> <P> He gives as an example the so-called Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a  fabrication of anti-Semitic czarist Russians alleging a Jewish plot for world  conquest that the Nazis used to help justify their systematic extermination of  European Jews during World War II.  </P> <P> "The Protocols are a classic example of a concoction born of pure paranoia,"  Eco said. "They are a pure comic text, full of contradictions. You can't take  them seriously." But this, he added, does not stop anti-Semites from continuing  to accept them as Gospel truth -- or some close approximation of it.  </P> <P> "Take the attitude of one Nesta Webster, a reactionary, anti-Semitic  Englishwoman," he said. "She was mad but not stupid. She recognizes that the  Protocols cannot be authentic. But, she says, that doesn't matter because they  say exactly what the Jews think.  </P> <P> "It's fundamentally fascist, this way of looking at things and continuously  finding connections. Why are you wearing a red tie?" he asked, his gravelly  voice taking a suddenly peremptory tone as he noted an interviewer's bright  crimson knitted tie.  </P> <P> "Were you a premature anti-fascist of the times of McCarthy? Are you a secret  Communist? . . . You see what I mean? You can do anything once you start down  that path of reasoning."  </P> <P> In "Foucault's Pendulum," the three plotomaniac editors are started down the  path when approached by Col. Ardenti, a former Foreign Legionnaire who sports  an Adolphe Menjou mustache. He starts the ball rolling by telling them he has  discovered a centuries-old coded message involving the supposed Knights  Templars plan to harness the mystic power source.  </P> <P> Shortly afterward, the colonel disappears and is presumed to have been  murdered. From then on, the story spins out in an ever-growing web of intrigue,  deception and intellectual excess that eventually snares the editors.  </P> <P> Although Eco says that the moral of the story is contained in every chapter in  one way or another, it never seems more directly and eloquently stated than  when Casaubon, the story's narrator, says: "I have come to believe that the  whole world is an enigma, a harmless enigma that is made terrible by our own  mad attempt to interpret it as though it had an underlying truth."  </P> <P> Oddly enough, Eco did not know whether he had another novel in him after he had  completed "The Name of the Rose," which has gone on to sell more than 9 million  copies in 24 languages in hard- and soft-cover editions.  </P> <P> "I have to start writing from some personal obsession," he said.  </P> <P> The obsession, in the case of "Foucault's Pendulum," came in the form of two  images with which he had long been fascinated.  </P> <P> One was the pendulum designed by the 19th-Century French physicist Jean  Bernard-Leon Foucault to demonstrate the Earth's rotation. Eco first saw one of  the devices 25 to 30 years ago hanging in a Paris museum, the Conservatoire des  Arts et Metiers.  </P> <P> The other image was of a scene out of his childhood in Italy during World War  II, when he played the trumpet at a burial ceremony in a country village for  some anti-fascist partisans.  </P> <P> "I started thinking about what could be in between those two images in a book,"  Eco said. "One year later, I started finding out."  </P> <P> How precisely he fitted everything between those two images is evident in the  book. The opening chapter finds Casaubon gazing upon Foucault's pendulum as he  hides out in the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers. The penultimate chapter is  a haunting lyrical one based on Eco's trumpet-playing experience.  </P> <P> "I love that cemetery story," Eco said with a wistful look in his dark eyes. "I  have told it a lot to my friends over the years. Also, to many women to seduce  them."  </P> <P> Although he has had several offers, Eco said that he has no intentions of  allowing the book to be made into a movie because of what he describes as the  risk to the novelist.  </P> <P> "When the book is like 'Death in Venice' and the movie arrives 40 years later,  there is enough distance from the book so that people won't make a comparison  between the two," he explained. "But when the movie arrives too early on the  shoulders of the book, there will be too many people who read the book through  the movie, and this betrays the book."  </P> <P> Besides, he added with a smile, "I don't think it's possible to make a movie  out of 'Foucault's Pendulum' -- except to make a sort of Vincent Price movie."  </P> <P> No doubt, too -- although he prefers not to discuss it -- his experience in  seeing "The Name of the Rose" translated to film has soured him on having  "Foucault's Pendulum" turned into a movie.  </P> <P> Ironically, for a book written as a caution against making unwarranted  connections, "Foucault's Pendulum" has stimulated many a reader to try his own.  </P> <P> Eco said that he is often questioned about the possible significance of the  fact that the last names of the three editors start with the initial letters B,  C and D -- Belbo, Casaubon and Diotallevi -- and that they are furthered in  their scheme by three characters whose names each begin with the letter A --  Col. Ardenti, Signor Aglie and a computer dubbed Abulafia after a Jewish  cabalist.  </P> <P> "And another person has noted that Jacopo Belbo drinks a lot and that his  initials are the same as a popular whiskey, J &amp; B," Eco said, dismissing  such speculation as nonsense with a wave of his hand. "Once you start, as I  said, you never can stop."  </P> <P> However, he does not deny that there may have been some unconscious intent of  which he was and remains totally unaware.  </P> <P> "A friend of mine once asked me why I chose the name Amparo for the Brazilian  woman Casaubon has an affair with," he recalled. "'He said it was pretty  strange because it's a Spanish name and not Brazilian -- a fact I note in the  novel. He asked me if I had known someone named Amparo."  </P> <P> Eco told the friend that he had once had an affair with a Latin American woman  who served as the model for his fictional creation. But she was not Brazilian  and her name was not Amparo. Only later, however, did he recall that when he  was writing the scenes between Casaubon and Amparo, he would think of his old  Latin American flame and how she used to played "Guantanamera" for him on her  guitar.  </P> <P> "And then I remembered in one of the lines of that song there is a reference to  a mountain called Amparo," he said. "So probably from my guts it came up in my  writing. Did I have any conscious intent? No."  </P> <P> Success as a novelist has not changed Eco much, although he finds celebrity  consumes a lot of precious time that he would rather devote to writing and to  his scholarly pursuits. He still teaches classes at the University of Bologna.  </P> <P> But there are compensations -- like seeing his first book, "The Aesthetics of  Aquinas," which was based on his doctoral dissertation, printed recently in an  English-language version by Harvard University Press.  </P> <P> "It is absolutely true that I am happier of those 2,000 copies of the Harvard  University Press than the millions of 'The Name of the Rose,' " he said. "It  was the only one of my books that had never been translated because it was  difficult. Even in Italy, the first edition was a small university press run of  about 500 copies."  </P> <P> Is there another novel in the works?  </P> <P> "It's possible," he said. "One reason I started the second was to separate  myself from the first. Otherwise, you become a prisoner to the book. It's  possible that, at a certain point, if I feel too pressured by the 'Pendulum,' I  will be obliged to start thinking about another story."  </P></p>

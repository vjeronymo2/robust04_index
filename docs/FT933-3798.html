			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo's investors ignore the bad news - Hopes of lower interest rates have been supporting equities The Tokyo stock market has a lot to worry about: the floundering economy, plunging corporate profits and an unstable coalition government. Yet investors have been hanging on to hopes of lower interest rates and a number of new issues to spur sentiment. In spite of the dramatic political changes, as the Liberal Democratic Party was ousted after its 38 year rule and a new coalition government formed, the Nikkei average has remained surprisingly stable. In yen terms, the index has gained 4.4 per cent since the beginning of July. Share prices have also been resilient against negative corporate news, such as Daiwa Bank's rescue of Cosmo Securities, following its Y69.8bn loss over tobashi, or shuffling of clients' accounts to hide unrealised losses. Mr Alexander Kinmont, strategist at Morgan Stanley in Tokyo, says that share prices are being supported 'purely by interest rates'. The Bank of Japan is expected to lower the official discount rate next week. Some analysts point out that share prices have discounted a 50 basis point cut, but a wider cut could move prices higher. Meanwhile, the government has started to envisage the possibility of another fiscal stimulus package, and some cabinet members have called for an income tax cut. The increase in new issues has also created activity. The over-the-counter market has seen a jump in trading due to new listings. More than 60 companies have listed there this year, up from 34 last year, and the OTC index has risen 7.7 per cent since the start of July. The listing of DDI, the long distance telecom company, on the second section of the TSE has also been welcomed. The listing of East Japan Railway in October may help to lift the government's ban on new listings on the first section. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities hopes that the listing of JR East will lure back individual investors. However, negative factors which many have chosen to ignore are steadily worsening. The gloomy outlook on an economic recovery has deepened during the past few weeks, with a spate of downward earnings revisions by leading corporations and the announcement of the tankan, or quarterly report on business sentiment. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone said it would cut 10,000 staff through early retirement, while it also announced a cut in long distance call rates to sustain market share. Leading steel companies revised profit estimates downward for the year, with Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, setting up a task force to reduce administrative staff. Nissan Motor also announced last Thursday that it may sell part of its cross shareholdings in banks and insurance companies to cover its losses of Y40bn. The tankan, released yesterday, confirmed fears of a worsening economy, with business confidence of manufacturers falling to the lowest level in 18 years and of service industries declining to a record low. Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, revised downward its profit forecasts of leading companies for the current year to next March. NRI said pre-tax profits would fall 14.2 per cent, lowering its earlier projection by 7.2 percentage points. The government's vague stance on the economy is also a worrying factor. While it has announced deregulation policies and the need to control political donations, it has also been slow in addressing the worsening economy. Mr Kazuo Aichi, of the Japan Renewal Party, one of the core coalition parties, says the main objectives of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition is political and electoral reform, and the cabinet will focus mainly on achieving those goals. However, analysts say it may take time for investors to react to bad news. 'As long as the government can maintain the impression that things are moving forward, people are going to buy stocks,' says Mr Kinmont. He expects the Nikkei index to reach 22,000 to 23,000 during the last quarter of the calendar year. While pessimists have given up waiting for the Nikkei to fall below 20,000, Mr Kazuo Tamayama, strategist of Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management's second investment division, remains a faithful bear. 'Some investors haven't realised how bad the economy and corporate profits are,' he says, warning that the Nikkei average's record low at 14,309 seen last August, could be broken in the near term.</p>

			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG TEN ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IOWA WINS WITH NEW QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> Sophomore Matt Rodgers, son of Boston Celtic Coach Jimmy Rodgers, passed for  276 yards and three touchdowns in his first game as the Hawkeye starter  Saturday, leading Iowa to a 31-21 victory over Iowa State in Ames, Iowa.  </P> <P> After trailing, 21-14, at halftime, Iowa tied the score when freshman defensive  end Larry Blue recovered an Iowa State fumble in the end zone in the third  quarter and got the go-ahead touchdown on Rodgers' 10-yard pass to John Palmer  on the second play of the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Rodgers also threw touchdown passes of 37 yards to Danan Hughes and 40 yards to  Travis Watkins in the first half as Iowa (1-1) beat Iowa State (1-2) for the  seventh consecutive time.  </P> <P> The holder for placekicks last year, Rodgers completed 20 of 33 passes and was  intercepted once. He started in place of senior Tom Poholsky, who lost the job  after Iowa's 44-6 loss to Oregon.  </P> <P> Rodgers' dad was in the stands for the game. But that didn't bother the young  quarterback. "I didn't feel any pressure at all. I'm used to him watching,"  Rodgers said.  </P> <P> Illinois 41, Utah State 2 -- Apparently recovered from the embarrassment  suffered last week at Colorado, the Illini made the most of their home-field  advantage and beat the Aggies.  </P> <P> Jeff George threw two touchdown passes, and the Illini defense held Utah State  to 24 offensive yards in the first half.  </P> <P> George hit Dan Donovan with a two-yard touchdown pass early in the second  quarter, and two minutes later lofted a 27-yard scoring pass to Mike Bellamy.  </P> <P> Illinois led, 31-0, at halftime and coasted to victory before 61,553.  </P> <P> Illinois' leading rusher this season, Howard Griffith, suffered a knee injury  late in the first half and did not play in the second half.  </P> <P> George completed 12 of 18 passes for 180 yards. Ken Thomas was the leading  rusher with seven carries for 77 yards.  </P> <P> Rutgers 38, Northwestern 27 -- Scott Erney completed scoring passes of 90 and  83 yards to Randy Jackson and ran for another touchdown at Evanston, Ill., to  give the Scarlet Knights a victory in their 1,000th intercollegiate football  game.  </P> <P> Erney's two scoring passes made him Rutgers' all-time leader with 30 touchdown  passes.  </P> <P> The Wildcats (0-3) had taken a 27-26 lead on Bob Christian's second touchdown,  a two-yard run in the third quarter. Christian had a career-high 161 yards  rushing.  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories scornful of rises ANALYSTS at Conservative Central Office hit back at Labour's tax and National Insurance blueprint yesterday with a scathing critique of the impact of proposals laid out in the shadow Budget. An eight-page Tory document - The Claims and the Reality - argues that those who gain under Labour's proposals will benefit by a small amount, while many middle-income families will lose. It says top rates of tax in other European countries affect only those on very high incomes. Mr Steve Webb of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said most of the Tory claims were factual, though he added that the statistics in the document did not give the whole picture. The Tory paper ridicules the idea that Labour taxes would target just the rich and suggests that many 'ordinary middle-income families' will suffer. It quotes from the government's April 1991 New Earnings Survey figures, which show that the proportion of the population earning over Pounds 360 per week was 28.7 per cent in England as a whole, 38.4 per cent in the south-east and 45.1 per cent in Greater London. But these figures are for full-time adult working males, and do not take women into account. The proportion of full-time working women earning over Pounds 360 a week in Greater London, for example, is only 19.9 per cent. Presenting the paper to a London news conference yesterday, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, contrasted a 2p a week tax gain for most of those who benefit from the Labour plan with 'millions of losers' who, he argued, would pay 'through the nose.' The Tories will press their argument in the coming weeks by illustrating the impact of the tax proposals on individual taxpayers.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Clarke sets out conditions for rates rise Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has agreed that it will be necessary to raise interest rates 'promptly when signs of inflationary pressures emerge', Treasury minutes of a meeting between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, showed yesterday. But both agreed at the meeting on July 6 that there was no need yet to raise base rates from 5.25 per cent. The minutes show that the two agreed broadly about the state of the economy. Mr Clarke agreed that 'interest rates might have to be raised sooner or later', and appeared to be slightly more receptive to the idea of monetary tightening than in the past, though his approach continued to be more relaxed than that of Mr George. Mr George said the economic data that had become available since their previous meeting on June 8 had not changed his overall assessment of the economy. The short-term outlook was of steady expansion without renewed inflationary pressure. 'Questions remained about the outlook for inflation further ahead,' he said. 'But, taken overall, these had not yet become more pressing.' The chancellor 'broadly agreed with the governor's assessment', adding that 'data over the last month had not caused him to revise his own assessment'. The minutes report Mr George's conclusion 'that it was necessary to remain especially alert to signs of cost pressures and to signs of an undue acceleration of the expansion of activity'. But Mr Clarke summed up his review of the economy by observing: 'It was now less likely that the economy would grow too rapidly.' Both men focused on the Confederation of British Industry's June industry survey, which showed a sharp increase in the balance of companies expecting to raise prices in the coming four months. 'These potential price pressures would clearly need to continue to be watched very closely,' Mr George said. Mr Clarke argued that the survey 'did not necessarily indicate a rise in inflation'. Manufacturers 'continued to face very strong competitive pressures, which were likely to restrain prices increases', the chancellor said. 'Commodity price rises were potentially worrying, but some commentators expected the increases to ease off later this year. The overall picture remained one of low inflationary pressures, with producer output price inflation down to 2 per cent, the lowest since 1967.' Mr George said in summing up his position that 'the case remained for moving (interest rates higher) sooner rather than later' in order to prevent underlying inflation moving into, and staying in, the upper half of the government's target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent over the next two years. But there was still not sufficient evidence to cause him to recommend a change in policy. City economists said the account of the meeting showed a rate rise was still likely even though the chancellor did not want to rush the move. There is general agreement that the most recent meeting between the chancellor and the governor on July 28 decided against a rate increase. Mr Don Smith, a UK economist with Midland Global Markets in London, said: 'The minutes suggest that the authorities need more than survey evidence to justify an increase in rates, although clearly it appears that the bias of their judgment is shifting towards favouring a rate increase.'</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Letter: Amendment put 'cap' on benefit in kind for cars Sir, I refer to the Weekend FT article 'The luxury that has become a necessity' (July 24/25). The writer of the article suggests that 'there is no 'cap' on the system' of assessing the benefit in kind of a car provided to an employee on the basis of the list price. He goes on to quote the example of 'an actual cash payment of more than Pounds 58,000' on the provision of a Jaguar XJ220 costing Pounds 415,000 where the driver covers less than 2,500 business miles a year. While this was the original proposal announced in the 1993 budget, an amendment was made to the Finance Bill by the sixth sitting of the Finance (No 2) Bill Standing Committee whereby the maximum list price of a car for the purposes of calculating the benefit in kind would be Pounds 80,000. The financial secretary to the Treasury, Steven Dorrell, stated that there was justification to 'depart from the principles of fiscal purity' - the argument being that the original budget proposal would be detrimental to the British car industry and in particular manufacturers such as Rolls Royce. The Finance Bill is due to receive Royal Assent on July 27 and it is likely that the Pounds 80,000 limit will become law. The effect is that the potential tax bill of more than Pounds 58,000 referred to in the article will be reduced by almost Pounds 47,000 to just over Pounds 11,000.

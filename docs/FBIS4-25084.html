			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- A textile street will be  built in eastern Beijing in the coming years.    The street will be built at the sites of Guanghua Street and  Chaoyang Street in the Chaoyang District of the city. At  present, ten large textile enterprises, with total fixed assets  of 900 million yuan and 35,000 workers, and covering an area of  two million sq m [square miles], are located in the area.    According to the city's new programs, the workshops of these  enterprises will be moved out to the suburbs or to materials  production areas, while this area will be developed into textile  and clothing research and information centers, trading centers  and commercial apartment buildings.    The city plans to build two million sq m in residential  space  in the area by 2000, which will bring much more profit than the  sluggish textile enterprises.    Meanwhile, all textile production facilities will be moved  out of the downtown area by 2000. On the sites, stores, hotels  and trading centers will be built.    Experts predict that the annual sales volume of Beijing's  textile industry will reach 10 billion yuan by 2000, 1.5 times  that of the present.</p>

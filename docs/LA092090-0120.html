			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOWSER DECIDES TO RETURN TO CSUN BASKETBALL TEAM  </P> <P> The area underneath the basket at the Cal State Northridge gymnasium hasn't  gotten any smaller, but it may well appear that way because The Incredible Bulk  has returned.  </P> <P> Todd Bowser, for three seasons the Matadors' pivotal player in the pivot, is  back on the Northridge basketball team.  </P> <P> Bowser, 6-foot-8, 300 pounds-and-counting, left the team a year ago -- before  the 1989-90 season began -- citing "personal reasons." He averaged 10.7 points  and six rebounds a game in three seasons after signing with Northridge out of  Montclair Prep in 1986.  </P> <P> "Nobody made me leave and nobody made me come back," said Bowser, who attended  classes at CSUN last year but did not compete in athletics. "I have one year  left to play basketball and a whole life to coach and do other things. I guess  in my mind I always knew I should finish it out."  </P> <P> On Monday, Bowser rejoined the Matadors for unsupervised afternoon workouts.  "I'm happy to have him back," Coach Pete Cassidy said.  </P> <P> Bowser's return takes on added importance because Northridge will be without  6-7 forward Percy Fisher, the team's top newcomer as a freshman last season.  Fisher, who became a top shot-blocker by season's end, is academically  ineligible.  </P> <P> "He was our most improved player and our top freshman off last year's  ballclub," said Cassidy, whose team finished 12-15 in 1989-90, its last season  on the Division II level. "It's a big blow."  </P> <P> Fisher is enrolled at Northridge and could regain his eligibility for the  second semester and the majority of the basketball season. Until then, Bowser,  among others, will attempt to fill the void.  </P> <P> "I think it's a great thing," Cassidy said. "Here's a guy who didn't want to  look back 10 years from now and wonder, 'What if . . . ' I'm happy. I've always  been fond of Todd and I know he can help us.  </P> <P> "He's very tough positioning people up, he draws fouls, he shoots well from the  (free-throw) line, and despite his girth, he's always run the floor pretty  well. He's going to help our ballclub, no doubt."  </P> <P> There's just one not-so-minor matter left to contend with: getting fit.  </P> <P> "He's in terrible shape," Cassidy said. "He's very strong because he's been  pumping iron, but his cardiovascular system has not been conditioned for  basketball. But he has such great work ethic that my greatest fear is he'll try  to get it all done at once."  </P> <P> Bowser, who in July married former CSUN volleyball player Franci Bowman, said  that regaining playing shape is "going to be a helluva thing to do."  </P></p>

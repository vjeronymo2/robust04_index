			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- France is hoping for "more  active support" from the European Union for its intervention in  Rwanda at the EU's two-day summit in Corfu starting on Friday  [24 June], French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure  said on Thursday.    "We need the support of the whole international community,  we  got it with the United Nations Security Council vote -- at the  same time we expect much greater support from our European  partners," Lamassoure said in an interview on France Inter radio.    Meanwhile Pierre Lellouche, foreign policy advisor to  Gaullist presidential hopeful Jacques Chirac, criticised alleged  lack of support from Germany for the Rwanda operation.    In a reference to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation  to German troops to take part in the annual Bastille Day  military parade next July 14, Lellouche said he would prefer  "that the German units do a detour via Kigali to carry out this  peace mission before parading in Paris."    For his part, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe denied  that  France was isolated over Rwanda.    Juppe told a press conference that Paris had won a pledge of  "logistical support" from the United States and backing from its  European partners and French-speaking African countries.    Juppe, speaking after briefing the Senate foreign affairs  committee, said other countries might also offer logistical  support and mentioned Italy, Belgium, Portugal and Spain.    The foreign minister, who played down Organisation of  African  Unity opposition to the Rwanda operation, also said there was no  conflict with the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF),  which has vowed to fight the intervention.    "There is agreement to pursue dialogue. We shall maintain  contact (with the RPF) during the operations," Juppe said,  insisting that one of the objectives was to "save Tutsi lives in  the western part of Rwanda." The Tutsi-dominated RPF mistrusts  France for past backing of its Hutu rivals.    Juppe refused to answer questions on the progress of  operations and to say whether French troops had entered Rwanda.    Lamassoure said that although there would be "technical  support within the framework...of the EU," France wanted "other  Europeans to take part in the military operation."    He said "There is a duty to come to the aid of a people in  mortal danger" and "it is in this spirit that we are going  there."    Lellouche, who was speaking on Radio Monte Carlo, said the  "Europe as a whole will have to be reviewed" if Germany could  not be counted on when "major political and strategic issues"  came up.    He said that if Europe consisted of "the Germans looking  after the Deutschmark, the British looking after trade while we  are the mercenaries called upon to spend our money and have our  young men killed for the stability of our periphery, then this  Europe cannot work."    Lellouche added that the US had stabilised Latin America,  the  Japanese had contributed to political and economic stability in  their region and "Europe's duty is to do this job in the south."</p>

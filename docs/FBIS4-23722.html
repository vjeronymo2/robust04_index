			<p>BFN     [Text] In Maputo today, the government and Renamo  [Mozambique National Resistance] agreed to send their men to the  various barracks where they will wait for the start of the  second phase of training of Mozambique Defense Armed Forces  [FADM] personnel.    Sources with the Joint Commission for the Formation of the  Mozambique Defense Armed Forces [CCFADM] say the decision is  designed to speed up the closure of government and Renamo  assembly points at a time when idle troops are mutinying. A  senior government army official says that is an important  decision and will be implemented through the creation of  logistical conditions to receive and select personnel for the  FADM. The sources noted that once the troops enter the  provisional barracks, they will cease to belong to the warring  armies and come under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Command of  the FADM. While waiting for specialized training, the troops  will undergo basic training provided by Mozambican instructors,  probably advised by foreigners.    Today's session of the CCFADM named the first officers from  the two sides and specified who will join the various branches  of the FADM Supreme Command. The officers have completed a  leadership course given by Portuguese experts.    Government and Renamo officers have not ruled out the  training of the new army's 30,000 men after the October 1994  elections. They noted, however, that a clear program has been  adopted for the training of troops within a reasonable period.  Renamo Major General Herminio Morais said his movement has  already submitted the list of Renamo men that will undergo navy  commando training at Catembe. The group will be sent to Catembe  by UN Operations in Mozambique. The government's personnel for  the course have already arrived in Maputo.    The role played by Italian military experts in the training  of the new army will be clarified over the next two weeks.</p>

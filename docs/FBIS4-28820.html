			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry  will introduce a system to consider technical standards, as well  as the bidding price, in choosing successful bidders for public  works contracts, ministry officials said Monday [13 June].    They said the new system is to apply on an experimental  basis  to ministry-controlled public works projects, beginning fiscal  1994, which started April 1.    The present system, which awards a public works contract to  the lowest bidder, contributes to bid rigging and unfair price  competition, critics say.    The new system gives overall numerical ratings to bidders,  including noise and vibration control measures and designing, in  addition to the bidding price, the officials said.    The government had earlier used a bid evaluation system  based  on technical standards and cost in choosing successful bidders  for supercomputer supply contracts.</p>

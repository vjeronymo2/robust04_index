			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Irvine's fledgling Backstage Theatre netted about $400 from a benefit held  earlier this week, according to the theater's artistic director, Al Valletta.  But publicity was "more important" than the money, he said, noting that the  event drew about 100 people.  </P> <P> Backstage, which has staged one musical revue to date, will mount a second by  mid-October, Valletta said. Its first, "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and  Living in Paris," closed Friday and "has done so well," he said, "that  something tells me people want us to stick to a cabaret-style show rather than  leap into a drama."  </P> <P> Valletta said he is considering two possibilities: "Starting Here, Starting  Now," a 1977 revue with lyrics by Richard Maltby Jr. and music by David Shire  or "The Me Nobody Knows," a 1970 rock musical adapted by Robert Livingston from  a collection of children's writings with music by Gary William Friedman and  lyrics by Will Holt.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Valletta has decided to seek a new location for the theater  because he wants to double its capacity, which is limited to 45 seats. "I will  keep this place till the lease runs out in February and then I'll look for a  bigger place," he said. "I've got 50 seats in storage." Valletta had  contemplated renovating the theater, now in an industrial office park at 2691  Richter St., but changed his mind. He said he prefers to stay in Irvine, where  he believes he has developed an audience, but would also consider moving to  Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Compiled by Kenneth Williams  </P></p>

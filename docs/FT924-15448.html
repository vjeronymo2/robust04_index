			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / EC ministers in push to restore trust: Talks to lay groundwork for emergency summit EUROPEAN foreign ministers will today seek to restore a climate of trust among member states shaken by the Anglo-German rift and turmoil in the money markets. During two days of talks in Luxembourg, the Twelve will lay the groundwork for the emergency EC summit in Birmingham on October 16. The goal is to reinforce an emerging consensus on early ratification of the Maastricht treaty, to dispel uncertainty about the community's future. A prime topic on the agenda will be subsidiarity - the code-word for devolving decision-making to member states at national and regional level. Larger states, led by Britain, France and Germany, are at loggerheads with the smaller nations who want to prevent attacks on the powers of the European Commission, their traditional protector. The Council of Ministers will also deal with pressing trade issues, including prospects for progress on the Gatt multilateral trade talks ahead of meetings with US negotiators scheduled for next weekend. EC ministers hope to show the rest of the world that the Community has not been paralysed by the political and economic divisions which have surfaced in the wake of last month's lukewarm endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in a French referendum. The British government, too, is under pressure to deliver results as chairman of the rotating EC presidency. Some member states have been dismayed by divisions on Europe within the ruling Conservative party, while others have expressed private frustration with the high-handedness of some British ministers. Prime Minster John Major's pledge to seek early ratification of the Maastricht treaty in parliament has reassured Brussels, but questions remain about the UK's policy on Europe following its decision last month to withdraw from the Exchange Rate Mechanism for an indefinite period. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary who will chair today's talks, will lead discussions on the Delors II proposals for the 1993-97 EC budget, including 'cohesion' funds for poorer EC member states. An agreement on this funding is required before formal talks on enlargement can begin with Austria, Finland and Sweden. A lunch with the foreign ministers of Poland, the Czech Federation, Slovakia and Hungary should produce a declaration on closer ties. But it will fall short of offering the timetable for EC accession which the countries would like. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said yesterday that French interest rates would be lowered 'now that the franc has been recognised (by the foreign exchange markets) as a solid currency, based on a sound economy', Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / The European Market: Telecommunications sector looks to the east - Joint ventures abound in former communist bloc but there is a long way to go Telecommunications was one of the most underdeveloped sectors of the old eastern bloc. But it is now brimming with life. Scores of joint ventures between domestic and western enterprises have been formed, and governments are giving top priority to investment in telecommunications. Part of the reason for the burst of activity is that eastern Europe has a long way to catch up. Under communism, telecommunications was given a low priority, for ideological reasons. Party bosses realised that allowing it to develop untrammeled might encourage democratic forces. The region's new governments have taken an opposite approach. They believe more telephones are needed to protect democracy and to underpin the development of free market economies. Only two years ago, the region's telecommunications infrastructure was in a parlous state. Few people had phones; most were concentrated among the communist elite. Much of the equipment was shoddy, in some cases dating from before the second world war. Business services, such as faxes and mobile phones, and international communications were particularly hard to come by. Until recently, for example, all foreign calls from the Soviet Union's 290m people had to be channeled through one exchange in Moscow, which had only 16 circuits to the US and 34 to the UK. These bottlenecks, particularly in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have been the first to be tackled. 'Business services are already adequate and will be up to western standards in two years,' says Mr Blake Swensrud, president of International Technology Consultants, a Washington consulting firm specialising in eastern Europe. Businesses have been given priority and foreign telephone companies have been installing special networks to cater for these customers. Their joint ventures fall into three main categories: Internationaj evahanges. Improving international communications is a rapid way of earning money, because of the high price of foreign calls and the increased need for eastern Europe to communicate with the rest of the world. Most of the new countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States are putting in their own international networks. US West of America is installing exchanges in Moscow and Lithuania. Australia's OTC has put an exchange in Kazakhstan, American Telephone and Telegraph has installed one in Armenia, and Canada's Teleglobe has been commissioned by Moldova. Cellular networks. These are a quick way of providing companies with telephones because they use radio links and so no roads need to be dug up. Once fixed networks are in place, the cellular ones will be used for mobile communications. The largest deal was in Poland, where France Telecom and Ameritech of the US are said to have paid Dollars 80m to Dollars 100m (Pounds 58m) for a licence. Overlay networks. These fixed networks are often separate from the countries' public networks, giving a better service for a premium price. Sovintel, a joint venture between GTE and Sovam, both of the US, is putting in such a network for Moscow's international business community. The UK's Cable &amp; Wireless is building a modern network for the Polish port of Gdansk. Providing telephone lines to the masses of eastern Europe will take much longer. The UK-based Telecommunications Research Centre estimates that it will cost Dollars 60bn to increase the number of phone lines from the current average of 10-15 per 100 people to 25-30, which would still be less than the 50 common in the west. The outlook for most of the CIS is particularly bad. Mr Swensrud says, 'Russia is just so big it's going to be very difficult to develop the network. In the Ukraine, nothing will happen overnight.' Nevertheless a start has been made on this massive job. First, the western embargo on exports of high technology is being relaxed. Second, foreign telecommunications manufacturers have formed joint ventures to make exchanges and transmission equipment locally. Germany's Siemens, France's Alcatel, AT&amp;T and Sweden's Ericsson have been particularly active. Third, the state-owned telephone companies are being re-organised. Telephone companies in Hungary and Poland have been separated from the national post offices and similar moves are planned in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Most countries are also putting up prices to make their phone companies more profitable. That will help generate finance for investment, but most countries are also looking for other sources of funds. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank will help fill part of this gap. Four of the 14 loans made so far by the EBRD have been for telecommunications, including the largest, an Ecu142m (Pounds 101.5m) loan to bring 1m modern telephone lines to Romania. But countries will be looking to the private sector for the lion's share of their external financing needs. The big money will come when governments privatise their telephone companies, selling large chunks to foreign operators which could bring finance and management skills. Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are going down this route and could complete sales in the next year. But, with Latin American and south-east Asian telephone companies also up for sale, other eastern European countries will have to move smartly or the supply of buyers may run out.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] While Croatian Government  representatives have hailed the agreement on the cessation of  hostilities and separation of forces signed with the Krajina  Serbs in Zagreb on 29 March as a "step toward normalization of  relations on the entire territory of Croatia" (Zagreb VJESNIK 31  March), the reaction of most Croatian opposition parties to the  agreement has been considerably more cautious and even negative.    In a statement to VJESNIK that appears in the paper's 31  March issue, Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] President  Drazen Budisa says that, while he had not yet have a chance to  review the document, his party supports "efforts for the  peaceful reintegration of the UN Protection Areas [UNPA] but  does not see how this can be achieved without changing the  UNPROFOR mandate. Budisa believes that, under the present  conditions, the cease-fire agreement between the Croatian  Government and the Krajina Serbs offers "no guarantees" that  displaced persons will be able to return to their homes or that  Serbian paramilitary groups will be disarmed. The HSLS insists,  Budisa says, that the effects of ethnic cleansing must be  reversed.    The 7 April VJESNIK carries a report on a news conference  held the previous day by five opposition parties -- the HSLS,  the Croatian Peasants' Party, the Istrian Democratic Assembly,  the Croatian National Party, and the Social Democratic Party  [SDP] -- at which they demanded that all political talks with  representatives of Serbia be halted until:    -- "Serbia and Montenegro recognize Croatia within its  internationally recognized borders, terminate logistical and  political support for the Serb insurgents, and withdraw the  Serbian dinar [as the official currency] from the occupied  territories."    -- "The Serbian Army and Serb insurgents cease ethnic  cleansing and criminal attacks on Croatian settlements and the  insurgents accept the solution of their political demands within  the Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the principles of  the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and  international documents on the rights of national communities."    The five opposition parties also demanded the closing of the  Croatian Government Bureau in Belgrade and its Serbian  counterpart in Zagreb and made the extension of the UNPROFOR  mandate conditional on the protection of the Croatian borders  with Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and the implementation of the  UN Security Council resolutions.    Zdravko Tomac, chairman of the SPD Council, told reporters  that one consequence of the Zagreb agreement would probably be a  "long-term solution modeled on Cyprus" and that "everybody who  remains silent about it" would bear a "historic responsibility,"  VJESNIK reports.    Savka Dabcevic-Kucar, head of the HSN, said in an interview  published in Zagreb VECERNJI LIST on 11 April that, while she  welcomes "any step" leading to a cease-fire, negotiations, and a  "just peace," she is "reserved" and "skeptical" and considers  the agreement "unfavorable" because it appears to "sanction the  present situation." In her opinion, the most important issues  have not been resolved: The "occupying army" and the Croatian  Army are treated identically; the Croatian state is not even  mentioned in the agreement; the "Pink Zones" are not excluded  from the agreement, and the return of displaced persons has not  been defined. She also asks why the "questions of aggression"  had not been raised and states that the "only positive thing"  resulting from the agreement might be the cease-fire.    The 9 April VJESNIK reports on a news conference held on 8  April by the Croatian Christian Democratic Union [HKDU], at  which its secretary, Dr. Milan Bicanic, enumerated the  shortcomings of the Zagreb Agreement, stating that the aggressor  was not named, "which raises the question whether this is an  agreement on separation or delineation of the opposing sides,"  and that the "dynamics" for the reintegration of the occupied  territories into the Croatian constitutional and legal system  had not been established. HKDU President Dr. Marko Veselica  found fault in the government's approach to the talks with the  "Serb rebels" and felt that the cessation of the war was being  discussed in a manner that "destabilizes Croatian military power  and creates a defensive strategy." Ilija Rkman, the party's  executive secretary, mentioned the danger of a "Cyprus  solution." The official party statement carried in the 13 April  VJESNIK added that the agreement does not mention Croatia as a  sovereign and internationally recognized state and fails to deal  with war crimes, the punishment of war criminals, and war  reparations.    The 9 April issue of the same paper contains a statement by  Croatian Christian Democratic Union President Ivan Keglevic, who  proposes that, in addition to the present negotiators, Croatian  refugees from the Krajina should be authorized to negotiate with  the "Serbian rulers" in the UNPA, because the refugees "would  know much better how to facilitate returning to their homes."    The Socialist Party of Croatia issued a statement, published  in the 1 April VJESNIK, which welcomes the agreement, describes  it as "the first step toward the establishment of the  territorial integrity of Croatia," and concludes that,  apparently, "the two sides had not been able to achieve it  without maximum engagement and pressure by the international  community, especially the United States and Russia."</p>

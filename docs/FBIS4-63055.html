			<p>BFN     [Text] Unless the arrested Russian citizen Boris Suprunyuk  is released in Kazakhstan before June 1, we shall work out our  own variants for his liberation. The statement called an  Ultimatum to President Nazarbayev was made Wednesday at the news  conference in Moscow by Chairman of the Congress of Russian  Communities' Executive Committee Dmitriy Rogozin.    He said that one of the leaders of the Russian community in  Kazakhstan, the editor of the newspaper "GLAS", Suprunyuk, was  arrested in Patropavlovsk on April 12 and then carried to Almaty  where he is kept in prison. He is accused of stirring up  inter-ethnic feuding. Rogozin, however, is sure that Suprunyuk  was arrested for political reasons.    Rogozin sent a letter to Russian president Yeltsin asking  him  to play a personal part in the fate of the Russian citizen.    Asked by Interfax what is behind the statement "own variants  for his liberation", Rogozin said that he had no right to make  public any plans on this score. He referred to mass  demonstrations of the Russian-speakers in Petropavlovsk in  support of Suprunyuk and on the sentiments of the local Cossack  community.</p>

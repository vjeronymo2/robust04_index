			<p>BFN     [Text] Fire has broken out briefly in Amman's Forte Grand  Hotel, killing an Italian tourist and injuring at least 10 other  people. Security officials were able to evacuate 430 people  from the nine-story hotel and put down the blaze in a short  period of time.    An Italian Embassy spokesman identified the dead tourist as  (Michel Otorino). He had tried to escape the fire by jumping  from the second story. Thick smoke reached the ninth floor and  at least 10 people were hospitalized for broken limbs and smoke  inhalation. Security officials are investigating the cause of  the fire. The hotel is equipped by self-operated fire  extinguishers, but were not used due to panic that gripped the  hotel staff.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Gatt deal hopes hinge on US audio-visual demands Successful completion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks appeared last night to hinge on proposals presented in Brussels by Sir Leon Brittan, European Union trade commissioner, detailing US demands on access to Europe's television and film markets. EU foreign ministers, after their briefing from Sir Leon, broadly endorsed his negotiating stance on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal. Sir Leon told them it offered unprecedented market openings and the prospect of fair competition in international trade but said the EU should resist the US demands on access to Europe's cinema and television markets. After the talks, ministers agreed to reconvene tomorrow to discuss the Gatt deal. Sir Leon returned to Geneva where he went into late-night negotiations with Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative. Sir Leon's spokesman said: 'It is extremely delicate . . . there is still a considerable climate of tension.' On the audio-visual dispute, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said: 'The Americans are pushing very hard but equally there is very strong resistance.' A senior German official said there had almost been a solution to the controversy on Sunday night but the American team had presented new demands on President Bill Clinton's instruction. Mr Kantor refused to expand on the proposals he had laid out to Sir Leon, nor on how the US would respond if the EU rejected them. He remained adamant that settlement of the audio-visual issue was critical to successful completion of the round. Although the audio-visual issue continued to block settlement of the round just two days ahead of the deadline, Gatt officials reported hectic progress in all other areas. Settlement of a row over US demands for changes to protect its anti-dumping laws provided an overnight impetus. One official said that 'the gavel had dropped' on almost 97 per cent of the Uruguay Round text. 'We have achieved an extraordinary series of agreements in a very short period of time,' said Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt. The US audio-visual proposals included calls for US programmes not to be restricted from prime-time viewing; for Europe's broadcast directive not to apply to new technologies; for Europe's royalties on blank tapes to be payable to US as well as European artists, but spent in Europe; and for no restrictions on video-on-request channels. It was suggested that Sir Leon proposed to EU foreign ministers that only the last of these proposals be accepted. He told ministers that the EU should reserve the right to keep the audio-visual sector out of the Gatt deal altogether, as France has demanded. Fears receded that political crisis in Japan might scupper the round when the Social Democrats, who form part of the ruling coalition, softened their stance by backing plans to allow limited rice imports.

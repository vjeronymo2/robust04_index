			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / In search of a crime rate mechanism: Justice ministers' talks about policing the EC EUROPE in the 1990s is proving easier for the criminal than for the forces of law and order. That is the disquieting message for the meeting today in Brussels of EC justice ministers, who will discuss the growing threat of organised crime, among other security issues such as extradition and harmonisation of national laws. The meeting was requested by Italy, which recently has felt most threatened by the increasing power of organised crime and the willingness of the Sicilian mafia to challenge the government. But the Italians are not alone in ringing alarm bells. Germany's interior ministry recently warned that the planned scrapping of EC border controls at the start of next year, with political changes in eastern Europe, could lead to an upsurge in drug-related crime in Europe. In London, Mr Douglas Tweddle, chief investigation officer of UK Customs and Excise, also warned that the relaxation of customs controls will widen opportunities for criminality in other spheres such as tax and excise fraud. Supporters of Europol, the planned criminal intelligence agency, see it as a symbol of growing co-operation within Europe in the face of a criminal fraternity which, as one senior police officer put it, 'does not respect boundaries'. However, Europol continues to generate debate and division about where it should have its permanent offices and about the scope and scale of its future operations. This is a debate that would bring a knowing smile to any Eurosceptic - all to do with issues of sovereignty, accountability and, ultimately, of power. The initial idea mooted by the Germans last year was that Europol should be based at the German police BKN headquarters at Wiesbaden and should transform itself as soon as possible into a European version of the American FBI. Wiesbaden is central in Europe and already has sophisticated intelligence systems, but the German idea provoked immediate resistance from other EC members, which considered this would not only concentrate political power in Germany, but also prove impractical in terms of existing national law. Britain would prefer that the Europol offices be based on more neutral political soil, either at Strasbourg or next to the Interpol offices at Lyons. However, some in the community question Interpol's political accountability. The agency serves more than 154 subscribing countries, and the view persists that some of these should be kept well away from sensitive European intelligence. Italy and the Netherlands have been pressing to have Europol on their territories, while France appears happy with Strasbourg. EC member states, meanwhile, are far from agreed on what Europol should do, if and when it gets off the ground by its target date, January 1 1993. Within the UK, senior police officers such as Sir Roger Birch, chief constable of Sussex and chairman of the UK police's international affairs committee, have argued that Europol risks duplication of information. Also, they say national data protection laws continue to limit the exchange of information that might be useful in tracking international criminals. Meanwhile, the attitude of signatories to arrangements for 'hot pursuit' across frontiers and extradition requests is still far from harmonious, often exacerbated by rivalries between police organisations and intelligence agencies. A basic problem is how increased co-operation in information can be translated, first, into the arrest of criminals and, second, into their conviction under relatively consistent judicial procedures. International criminals - whose names are known to police, customs officers and intelligence agencies - can hide behind shell companies, nominees and expendable lieutenants. This is why the Italians, in particular, are anxious for the Europeans to accept in law the concept of conviction on the basis of membership of a criminal organisation. In many European legal systems, such a concept is difficult to establish; even in Italy, courts have been divided. Even so, as crime syndicates become increasingly transnational, it is becoming more urgent to establish criteria mutually acceptable to the EC governments for the prosecution of such organisations.</p>

The  commander-in-chief Allied Forces Baltic Straits zone has overall  direction of the exercise and the ship grouping is subordinate  to the commander, U.S. Navy Destroyer Squadron 14.    Along with other countries for which participation in such  exercises is new (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and to some extent  Poland), Russia is represented relatively modestly in Baltic  Operations-94. Nevertheless, the patrol ship Neustrashimyy, to  which the exercise plan assigns a serious mission of taking  American specialists aboard after they land on the water from an  Orion aircraft, is the newest and one of the best ships of the  Baltic Fleet.    According to a Russian Federation Navy Press Center report,  in addition to interworking with U.S. special forces during the  exercise, the ship will rehearse elements of joint maneuvering  and communications, practice firing will be carried out against  a naval target, and a rescue operation will be conducted. The  participation of three submarines in the exercise also implies  conduct of an ASW operation. Neustrashimyy already is the second  Baltic Fleet ship to take part in NATO naval exercises. In the  past year the patrol ship Bditelnyy was "sent on TDY" to  BALTOPS-93 and successfully coped with the mission assigned.    The exercise, held annually for 22 years now, will last  until  10 June.    The ships put to sea yesterday after a briefing and  clarification of exercise details in the German port of Kiel.  Our correspondent also set off for the exercise area aboard the  Neustrashimyy. We intend to publish his detailed account in  upcoming issues.</p>

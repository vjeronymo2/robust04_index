			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Murdered at morning prayers: David Horovitz in Hebron talks to Arab and Jew in the wake of Israel's worst atrocity On the narrow slope leading down into Hebron from the Cave of the Patriarchs, four silver-coloured portable barriers, covered in blood, were drying in the winter sunshine. The trail of blood led further up the hill, to the huge Herodian-built entrance to the Cave. There, by the green entry doors, a sign in Hebrew, English and Arabic requested of worshippers: 'Please preserve the sanctity of the site.' A little after 5am yesterday that sanctity was shattered as never before. Clad in his army reservist's uniform, and carrying a Galil automatic rifle, Baruch Goldstein, a doctor who lived at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, slipped past the sleepy soldiers on duty outside, and made his way into the tomb, filled with Palestinians just starting their early morning Ramadan prayers. In a shooting spree that witnesses said lasted at least 10 minutes, he murdered over 40 Palestinians, possibly as many as 50, and wounded scores more. In a call of condolence and apology to the PLO chairman Mr Yassir Arafat last night, Israel's premier, Mr Yitzhak Rabin said Goldstein had tried to murder the fragile Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Most of Hebron was deserted in the hours after the shooting, its stores shuttered, just a few elderly men, heads bowed, walking slowly through the market. But the streets were peppered with rocks and smouldering tyres - lingering signs of the violent clashes between Palestinians and soldiers that raged soon after the shooting, before the army clamped on a curfew. At least six Palestinians were shot dead in clashes outside a hospital. Outside the tomb itself, small clusters of dazed Palestinians milled around, anxious to recount the details of the massacre. When, periodically, soldiers came to shoo them away, smirking groups of young Jewish settlers took their place, their guns slung casually over their shoulders. 'It's good, what happened,' jeered one young settler at the Palestinians. 'We're at war with the Arabs. It's just a shame that a Jew had to die.' Zuleha Muhtaseb, a Palestinian woman in her thirties who was inside the tomb when the shooting started, said the worshippers were just kneeling down to pray when she heard what sounded like a bomb, followed by the rapid fire of an automatic weapon. 'I couldn't see the man,' she said. 'We all lay down on the floor. Whenever anybody stood up, there was more shooting.' Across town, at the Al-Ahali hospital to which many of the wounded were taken, Sharif Zahidah lay propped up in bed, the bloodstains on his pillow and sheets testimony to the bullet wound in his left side, perilously close to his heart. In the chaos when the shooting started, he said, 'I thought at first it was coming from outside. But then I saw that my whole row of worshippers had collapsed. The man next to me was hit, and part of his brain fell on my face.' At one point, said Zahidah, the gunman's weapon jammed. Eventually he was overpowered. 'I think he was killed.' Natshe Shabaan had been kneeling beside his brother Jamil, 48, the muezzin who had called the Moslem faithful to that morning's prayers. Now Jamil's name is just another on the photocopied list of the dead, stuck in the window at the hospital's reception desk. Walking through Hebron to the tomb, Lt-Col Yehuda Weinraub of the Israeli army spokesmen, was hit on the head by a rock thrown from a rooftop. His white bandage slowly turning red, he insisted to reporters that at no point had soldiers opened fire. In fact, he said, countering witnesses' assertions that a soldier had killed a man who tried to disarm Goldstein, there were no soldiers inside the tomb; they were keeping a low profile in deference to the Ramadan prayers. Lt-Col Weinraub was at a loss to explain why the soldiers outside had allowed Dr Goldstein into the Cave, and promised a thorough inquiry. Just a few hundred yards away through deserted streets, at the Beit Hadassah complex where several hundred of the most radical Jewish settlers maintain their symbolic presence in the heart of Hebron, Danny Hismi, a friend of Dr Goldstein, had his explanations ready. The doctor, he said, 'was the kindest man - he wouldn't hurt a cat.' He had simply treated too many Jewish victims of the Palestinian Intifada. 'He was always the first on the scene. A few weeks ago, two of his neighbours, from the Lapid family, were murdered. He had tried to save them. I think it was too much for one man. His opinions were very radical, but then there are people with radical opinions everywhere. You think, sometimes, that you want revenge, but you never do it.' A spokesman for the settlers in Kiryat Arba said more bluntly that Goldstein had become mentally unbalanced since his friends died. Determined to preserve Friday afternoon 'normality,' Mr Hismi was on his way to deliver gifts of food to mark the Jewish Purim festival before preparing for the sabbath. In the courtyard behind him, small Jewish children were laughing though nothing out of the ordinary had been taking place down the street. In a basement at Beit Hadassah, a museum commemorates the 69 Jewish residents of Hebron killed by Arab mobs in 1929. It was their deaths, and the consequent severance of the Jewish presence in Hebron, that galvanised Jewish settlers to return to this 60,000 strong Arab town in the spring of 1968, months after the West Bank had been captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Since then, more than 120,000 Jews have followed their example and made homes in the occupied territories, but only the most ideologically-motivated settlers can survive here and in the Kiryat Arba settlement that overlooks the town, reviled as intruders by their Palestinian neighbours. Barred from the Tomb of the Patriarchs for 700 years, the Jews have gradually established equal praying rights with the Moslems, the two communities tensely sharing the same place, at different times. The main hall serves as a mosque, two side rooms as synagogues. Except on Fridays, when Moslem prayer mats are laid out in all the rooms, and Jews are denied entry. Or should be.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            A VIOLENT PAST  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Some of the worst incidents of violence since Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967: OCT 8 1990: Israeli police shoot dead 18 Arabs on Jerusalem's Temple Mount after a Palestinian protest flares into violence. JULY 6 1989: A Palestinian from the Gaza Strip seizes the steering wheel of an Israeli bus and sends it plunging into a ravine, killing 16 Jews. MARCH 11 1978: Arab guerrillas infiltrate into Israel from the sea, killing 37 and wounding 82 in an attack on a bus and other traffic. APRIL 1974: 16 civilians and two soldiers killed by Arab gunmen entering Israel from Lebanon.

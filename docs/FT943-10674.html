			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Equity and bond prices rise in Europe as dollar gains Equity and bond prices rose strongly across Europe yesterday reflecting optimism about economic recovery and interest rates. The dollar, meanwhile, recovered above Y100 as markets took a benign view of the prospects for US-Japan trade talks. It closed in London at Y100.415 against Y98.85 on Monday. News that German industrial production had risen 1 per cent in June, together with favourable review of the chemical industry by a Deutsche Bank research unit, focused attention on the pace of economic recovery across Europe. The bourses in Paris and Frankfurt closed at their highest levels for more than two months. In Paris, the CAC-40 index rose more than 2 per cent in moderate trading, while the Dax in Frankfurt finished 1.5 per cent ahead. The London stock market enjoyed its strongest session of the year. The FT-SE 100 gained 60.1 points, or 1.94 per cent, to 3,157.5. In London, concerns over base rate prospects were allayed further when the Bank of England again showed in its money market operations that it did not want rates to rise at present. Currency analysts said the breakdown in the US-Japan talks was not seen as significant since there was still a lot of time to reach a compromise, and both sides seemed anxious to strike a deal. A Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters in Tokyo that talks could probably resume by early September. A further factor bolstering the dollar is an apparent shift in capital flows. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, commented: 'We have seen some quite important switching out of yen assets into dollar assets by international investors. There may be a tide turning in favour of the dollar.' Lex, Page 14 UK inflation warning, 14 London shares, Page 23 Currencies, Page 28 World stocks, Page 30</p>

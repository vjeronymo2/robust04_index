			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DANUBE'S WILD DELTA SAVED BY UPRISING  </P> <P> The overthrow of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu has averted the  destruction of one of Europe's last unspoiled wildernesses, the Danube delta.  </P> <P> At this time of year the delta, which covers about 1,660 square miles, is a  bleak and gray expanse of sodden marshland and lagoons punctuated by unique oak  forests.  </P> <P> In the summer, however, it comes alive with huge flocks of migratory birds,  ranging from Dalmatian pelicans to Caspian terns that nest there.  </P> <P> Ceausescu wanted to change that. Among the many grandiose plans he had for  Romania was to drain the delta and transform it into fields of wheat and corn,  using huge amounts of fertilizer.  </P> <P> "Ceausescu personally plotted the destruction of the delta," said Ananie  Ivanov, chairman of the government ecology commission in the Danube port of  Tulcea, gateway to the delta.  </P> <P> "He planned to go ahead with the destruction as fast as possible but now his  plans have been abandoned."  </P> <P> Ceausescu, overthrown and executed in a popular uprising in December, also  wanted large areas of the delta planted with figs. Why, nobody knows; figs do  not grow well in the area.  </P> <P> "After his initiative to plant figs was announced, fig trees were planted  especially for him," Ivanov recalled. "They were watered for the occasion, but  after that everyone forgot about them."  </P> <P> Alexandru Rosu, professor of geography at Bucharest University and vice  president of the recently founded Ecology Movement of Romania, said 20% of the  delta had already been destroyed, but he was confident that the rest could be  saved.  </P> <P> He said a comprehensive conservation strategy was being formulated for the  delta that would include plans to promote tourism, fishing and hunting under  strict controls so as not to disturb the area's unique ecology.  </P> <P> The plan must also resolve another problem -- how to control one of the main  industries in the delta, the harvesting of reeds for papermaking. Rosu said it  was not feasible to ban the cutting of reeds entirely, but it was necessary to  place strict controls on the industry or the delta would be ruined.  </P> <P> He said the area was seriously polluted with fertilizers and other chemicals,  although this was not entirely Romania's fault. On its way to the Black Sea the  Danube runs through eight countries, all of which have tended to use it as a  sewer.  </P> <P> Rosu, who suggests an international body be formed to tackle the problem, said  that environmental safeguards hardly existed under Ceausescu, except on paper.  </P> <P> "There were controls but fines were low," he said. "The most important thing  was exports and in places where there were (anti-pollution) filters, factories  did not use them because of the energy crisis."  </P> <P> Ceausescu geared production almost exclusively to exports and ordered Draconian  cuts in energy consumption as part of his obsession with wiping out the  country's $10-billion debt.  </P> <P> Local officials said a bauxite smelter and ferrous metals plant in Tulcea  caused serious air pollution, as did a sulfur factory in the Soviet border town  of Izmail, 20 miles away.  </P> <P> "We pollute them and they pollute us in their turn," said Dorian Dumitriu,  secretary of the Tulcea branch of the Ecology Movement, who added that local  ecologists now were making contact with their Soviet counterparts to try to  tackle the problem.  </P> <P> Ceausescu's attitude to ecological problems was highlighted last November when  Romania blocked a European agreement on the environment, saying it constituted  unwarranted interference in its internal affairs.  </P> <P> It ignored last-minute appeals from the Soviet Union at a conference in Sofia  and was the only country to refuse to endorse the pact, thus blocking final  agreement on the rights of the individual to a say in environmental affairs.  </P> <P> Officials close to the new government admit that its environmental policies  have not yet been worked out in any detail. But they are adamant that  Ceausescu's total disregard for the environment is a thing of the past.  </P></p>

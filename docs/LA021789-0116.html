			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALTON SUIT GOES BEFORE ARBITRATOR  </P> <P> The Clippers' dispute with Bill Walton went before an arbitrator Thursday  afternoon in New York and the leader of the players' union said a decision  against Walton might be viewed as a threat to the union's agreement with the  National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> Arbitrator Dan Collins, a professor at New York University Law School, received  information from both Walton and the Clippers in a one-hour session. The  dispute is about whether the 36-year-old former Clipper is entitled to receive  about $1.6 million in deferred payments.  </P> <P> Walton was represented by Larry Fleisher, former players' union chief, and  Clipper attorney Bob Platt represented the team, which is contending in a suit  that Walton violated his contract by being physically unfit to play and  therefore forfeited his right to the deferred salary.  </P> <P> Charles Grantham, executive director of the National Basketball Players Assn.,  said he expects Collins to make a decision on the dispute soon, possibly as  early as this weekend.  </P> <P> Clipper President Alan Rothenberg said he expects Collins to rule in favor of  Walton.  </P> <P> "We're still going to continue in the courts with our litigation, no matter  what the arbitrator says," Rothenberg said. "We objected in the beginning that  the (case) was outside his jurisdiction, but I don't know any arbitrator in the  world who would disqualify himself.  </P> <P> "We'll continue with the suit and seek damages because of what (Walton) did.  There's no way an arbitrator can determine how we were damaged."  </P> <P> That the matter between Walton and the Clippers belongs in arbitration and not  the courts is considered vital to the union, Grantham said.  </P> <P> "It's sort of a cornerstone of the (collective bargaining) agreement," Grantham  said. "Without a grievance-and-arbitration process, and having disputes  resolved in a timely matter, the entire collective bargaining agreement as we  see it, we don't have anything that's resolvable. It would be a threat to the  way we do business."  </P> <P> The Clipper suit contends that "certain activities" by Walton during the term  of his five-year $5-million contract between 1979-1983 impaired his ability to  play basketball. Gary Vandeweghe, Walton's attorney, said the Clippers are  implying in the suit that Walton used drugs while a Clipper.  </P> <P> Present at the arbitration hearing, in addition to Walton, Fleisher, Grantham  and Platt, were Gary B. Bettman, NBA vice president and general counsel, and a  lawyer representing the players union.  </P> <P> It is Grantham's opinion that the arbitration procedure is the proper place for  such a dispute to be settled.  </P> <P> "Not in the courts," he said. "From our perspective, disputes between teams and  players should go through the arbitration process. The question (the Clippers)  are raising is, can their dispute be arbitrated? They think it should be  resolved in the courts. We are saying, 'That dispute between you and Bill  belongs in arbitration.' And what the Clippers are saying is that the  arbitrator doesn't have the right to hear this case."  </P> <P> Grantham refused to discuss the issues of the dispute, but said: "We think we  have a good case."  </P> <P> He also speculated that should Collins decide the case can be heard in  arbitration and should he rule in Walton's favor, then another court, such as  the one in which the Clipper suit may be heard, would not overturn the outcome  of the arbitration.  </P> <P> Bettman said the NBA has no right to decide whether binding arbitration or the  courts is the proper form to decide the issue.  </P> <P> "Sooner or later, one will prevail," Bettman said. "It is a question of law  that has to be resolved."  </P> <P> However, Vandeweghe said it could become the league's responsibility to tell  the Clippers to abide by the arbitrator's ruling and drop the lawsuit.  </P> <P> "Telling them that they have to (accept the ruling), or ultimately taking their  franchise from them," he said. "That's what's at risk here. If they defy the  NBA and the players' association and the NBA thinks they're wrong, which I  think they do, they'll take their franchise. They'll be out of business.  </P> <P> "The Clippers would probably be delighted. They wouldn't have to play any more  games. Then the Clippers are going to file a giant lawsuit against the league  saying the league was wrong in doing it and the Clippers are going to lose.  Meanwhile, their lawyers are going to make a lot of money.  </P> <P> "Let's look ahead to see what happens in the year 2007. If you choose to  maintain for yourselves some tough-guy, macho image, you know, constantly  putting up your dukes, the little boy constantly crying wolf. Pretty soon, Alan  Rothenberg -- with all due respect to a guy I like very much -- standing there  with his fists balled, filing lawsuits with his law firm's name all over it, it  means nothing to anybody anymore. Who the hell do you think he's scaring. Now,  they're a joke."  </P></p>

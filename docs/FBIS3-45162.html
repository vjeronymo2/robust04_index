"It is regretful that France decided to discontinue arms  sales to Taiwan under Beijing's pressure," the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs said in a press statement.    Paris and Beijing issued a joint communique Wednesday in  which France promised that the 60 Mirage fighter planes it  agreed to sell to Taiwan in late 1992 will be its last arms deal  with the ROC. In return, Beijing would end its year-long ban on  giving lucrative contracts to French companies.    A Foreign Ministry spokesman blasted Beijing for repeatedly  interfering in Taiwan's defensive arms purchases. "It is  unthinkable that Beijing, while expanding its own military  muscle and arms exports, has constantly demanded other countries  not sell defensive weapons to Taiwan," he noted.    The spokesman stressed that the ROC's arms purchases are  mainly for defending national security and maintaining peace in  the Taiwan Strait.    "The joint communique between France and Mainland China will  not contribute to the peace in the Asia-Pacific region," he  observed.    The French Government announced the sale of 60 Mirage  fighters to Taiwan shortly after former U.S. President George  Bush agreed to sell 150 F-16s to the island in November 1992.    In 1991, Taiwan signed a contract with France to purchase 16  Lafayette-class frigates as part of its plan to beef up its  naval force.    Reports from Paris quoted French Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe  as saying Wednesday that France will honor its previous arms  deals with Taiwan.</p>

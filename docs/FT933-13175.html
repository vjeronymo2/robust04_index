			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / German car orders fall THE slight improvement in German car orders, detected during May, ground to a halt last month, the VDA automobile industry association said yesterday. June production of all vehicles, adjusted to allow for an extra working day this year, was 29 per cent lower than a year earlier at 344,000. Unadjusted output was down 25 per cent. However, the VDA said the decline in the car industry appeared to have reached bottom, but conditions for commercial vehicle makers were continuing to deteriorate. June's poor performance brought the cumulative decline in German motor manufacturers' output to 25 per cent for the first half of this year. In absolute figures, car production has tumbled 625,000 to 1.975m units. Car exports, which account for around half the industry's output, were 19 per cent lower in June than a year earlier. Output of light trucks up to 6 tonnes fell 34 per cent or 37,000 units to 72,000 between January and June. The output of other commercial vehicles was down 36 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p>

The meeting was part  of the second phase of the proximity talks on the  confidence-building measures, which began today.    Speaking afterward, Feissel repeated that the reports of the  UN experts on the confidence-building measures are not part of  the measures package. The situation, he added, is very clear.  He said the negotiations only concern the confidence-building  measures package and that anything beyond this is material that  each uses according to his will. Asked if he thinks the  situation is clear in [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas'  mind, Feissel said: Absolutely. Feissel also said that the goal  of the current phase of the proximity talks is to move swiftly  to common positions on various points that are included in the  confidence-building measures package. He also noted that he  does not think he need state his evaluation after each meeting.  Feissel refrained from making any reference to the substance of  the talks and added that there should be more meetings before we  make an evaluation.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the United  Nations asked the two sides not to comment at this stage. He  said the United Nations believes that this will make the  negotiations easier.</p>

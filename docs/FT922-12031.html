			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Strike by Jobcentre staff A STRIKE by Jobcentre staff has failed to prevent the removal of protective screens from unemployment benefit offices and Jobcentres, the government claimed yesterday. A total of 100 members of the CPSA Civil-Service union in three Jobcentres in London and Bristol have been in dispute with the Department of Employment for more than a year over a policy to make offices open-plan. 'The Employment Service remains committed to its open-plan programme,' the department said. The union claimed there had been an increase of 50 per cent in violent attacks on Jobcentre staff since the removal of security screens and counters began in 1989. The union's figures were disputed by the government. An official announcement of the end of the dispute is expected today after meetings between union officers and the strikers. The union would not comment on claims that its members faced an embarrassing climbdown, and said the strikers would look at proposals for a return to work today. The action, which has included a one-day national strike, has cost the union more than Pounds 1m.</p>

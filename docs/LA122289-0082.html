			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DIVIDENDS INCREASE IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS;  </P> <P> EQUESTRIAN: SISTERS CECE AND LYNDA YOUNGER HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO  TRAINING AND RIDING CHAMPIONSHIP JUMPERS. THEIR EFFORTS HAVE PAID OFF IN CASH,  PRIZES AND INTERNATIONAL PRESTIGE.  </P> <P> Two Mercedes 190s are parked outside the stables at Conejo Valley Riding Club.  They belong to the Younger sisters, CeCe and Lynda, internationally known  equestrians who jump horses for a living. The $30,000 cars -- one black pearl,  the other smoke silver -- are reflections of the sport's high-society image,  but to the sisters, they're illusions.  </P> <P> What's real is the high cost of riding and the low financial returns. The long  trips and the hard work. The ever-present danger.  </P> <P> "What we do is very stressful," says CeCe, who at 28 is two years older than  Lynda. "Competition is very stressful. So is all the traveling." Forget about a  jet-set life style. The Mercedes weren't gifts from Arab sheiks; the sisters  won them in lieu of prize money.  </P> <P> What's real are the squadrons of flies attacking like dive bombers in a small  tack room at the riding club. There's nothing glamorous about flies buzzing  your face. But horses attract flies. Horses also cost a lot to keep. Shipping  one on a plane from L. A. to New York is $6,000 round trip, and the airlines  don't even give frequent-flier mileage.  </P> <P> A normal athlete has to worry about taking care of only himself and his  equipment, maybe shining the irons once in a while. The sisters are "very  serious athletes," Lynda says, but horses complicate their lives. "Horses are a  24-hour-a-day job," says CeCe, a petite 4-foot-11 brunette who lives in  Woodland Hills. "They also last a lot longer than most boyfriends." But who  wants to compete with a horse for his girlfriend's attention?  </P> <P> Until CeCe became engaged recently, neither sister had time to date. Even when  they were youngsters in Bakersfield -- competing nationally by their teens --  horses had been an all-consuming passion. For most of their teen-age years and  adulthood, "We had zero to no social life," says Lynda, a 5-2 blonde living in  Malibu.  </P> <P> And when they're not competing in shows in and out of the country -- the  American Grandprix Assn. season and international events take up 10 months of  the year -- the sisters manage to run a full-time business training and selling  jumpers for their Banner Farm company. They recently moved their base of  operations from Malibu to the new riding club facilities between Thousand Oaks  and Simi Valley where they stable 10 horses and soon will be employing a  full-time groom/caretaker.  </P> <P> It takes six years to train a jumper, but the rewards can be great:  Olympic-level horses can sell for as much as $1 million. The sisters want the  business to help support their riding. In their best years, they each collected  about $85,000 on the AGA show-jumping tour, but the figure includes the price  of the Mercedes they each received for winning the Mercedes Grand Prix Jumper  series.  </P> <P> The Youngers are hoping that prize money and corporate sponsorships increase in  their sport. Show-jumping, according to the AGA, is the second-most popular  sport in Europe behind soccer and the fastest-growing spectator sport in this  country. The AGA's first tour in 1978 had 16 events with only $247,000 in prize  money, but this year $1.7 million has been given out in 31 events.  </P> <P> The sisters say they're lucky because their father -- a Bakersfield trial  lawyer -- initially helped finance both their riding and horse business. But  this is the sport of kings. Even lawyers don't make the kind of money it takes  to launch and sustain a major equestrian campaign. Riders with either a rich  family or corporate backers historically have ruled grand prix jumping.  </P> <P> "That's the conflict in our sport," CeCe says. "Talent doesn't automatically  buy you a ticket to the Olympics. A lot of riders can afford to go to Europe  and buy the best horses."  </P> <P> Horses are fragile creatures, however.  </P> <P> Malcolm, the Youngers' black Scottish terrier, snaps his jaws at the flies  buzzing his head in the tack room, then follows the sisters outside to a corral  where Lynda's 14-year-old American stallion, The Oregon Kid, stands forlornly.  Injured for much of the past three years, the Kid has been been receiving  magnetic-field and ultrasound therapy, acupuncture and even chiropractic  adjustments.  </P> <P> "We treat our horses like pro athletes," Lynda says. "When they break down, we  have to repair them. My horse has been a wonderful competitor for 10 years, but  now the maintenance level is high, like -- I hate saying this -- an old car."  </P> <P> CeCe has had better luck keeping her horse tuned up and running. Poking his  head out of a stall is Young Fleet, a 13-year-old distant relative of 1943  Triple Crown winner Count Fleet and "the only grand-prix-jumping quarter-horse  stallion in the world," CeCe says.  </P> <P> CeCe spots a young horse with his tongue hanging out of his month like a wet  dishrag. It's Santiago, a Dutch stallion that's her No. 2 horse. "When he  sticks out his tongue, he wants attention," she explains.  </P> <P> Standing on the dusty earth, the sisters reach mid-flank on Santiago. They  certainly don't look big enough or strong enough to be sitting on the back of  an airborne 1,000-pound beast, but size, they say, no longer is a limiting  factor. Up until a decade ago, courses were physically demanding for both rider  and horse. But the horses couldn't take the punishment.  </P> <P> Jumping is the only Olympic sport in which men and women compete against each  other. "Men used to dominate," CeCe says. But then, to keep horses healthy,  weight requirements were lowered and the courses redesigned, becoming more  intellectual and technical and opening the way for women to compete with men.  </P> <P> "Before, people wondered how a little girl like myself could handle a  stallion," Lynda says. "But now, it's finesse that counts."  </P> <P> And the right horse. "You've got to find a horse who's sensitive to women,"  says Lynda, who describes The Oregon Kid as "hot-blooded, sensitive and very  athletic, a genuine American thoroughbred."  </P> <P> Hard as it is to picture either of the small women atop a horse as it flies  over a fence, imagine them doing the same thing before they were tall enough to  ride the Colossus at Magic Mountain. Growing up outside Bakersfield on a  25-acre farm -- once owned by country singer Buck Owens -- they were jumping at  age 6.  </P> <P> Their older sister Lisa got them into the sport after seeing a horse movie on  television.  </P> <P> Although Lisa eventually dropped out of competitive riding, CeCe and Lynda did  practically nothing else but go to school and ride. "It was a hobby that went  out of control," CeCe says. No proms. No dates. No football games. The sisters  bought and sold horses even then and took private riding lessons. One of her  coaches, CeCe says, "just filled my head with dreams of making the Olympic  team. I was just obsessed."  </P> <P> At 18, CeCe was the youngest member of the U. S. Equestrian Team, but the U. S.  boycott wiped out any chances she had of going to the 1980 Moscow Olympics. But  riding still pulled fiercely at the Youngers. They went east to college -- CeCe  attending Drew University, Lynda going to Richmond -- to get involved in the  powerful East Coast jumping scene. When their friends were partying or  studying, the sisters were flying to shows or taking riding lessons from such  world-renown coaches as George Morris, who has ridden and coached with the U.  S. team in the Olympics. "I remember them as both being very competitive,  aggressive and determined," Morris says.  </P> <P> Although CeCe majored in art history and Lynda in political science, they  decided against careers in their fields and went into riding full time. "We  both had top horses," Lynda says, referring to Young Fleet and The Oregon Kid.  Each horse cost the sisters less than $15,000 in the late 1970s but their worth  has soared to about $500,000 each because in only three years, the Youngers --  the only sister team in grand-prix jumping -- consistently have placed among  the top 10 in AGA events.  </P> <P> Lynda sees the irony. "We've developed this worldwide reputation on our little  junior jumper horses we've had since childhood," she says.  </P> <P> Despite their seemingly narrow focus, the sisters insist they've led "a  balanced life," Lynda says. "We ski, go to art museums, have friends. Our  parents made sure we weren't so consumed by the sport that we'd lose  perspective."  </P> <P> Despite accidents -- the Youngers have suffered concussions after falling off  horses -- there's still nothing like flying over a barricade on the haunches of  a great animal to get the blood boiling. "It's the same sensation you get  driving a race car very fast and being on the edge of control," CeCe says.  </P> <P> Lynda admits to being "an adrenalin junkie. Skiing's the only thing that comes  close to giving me that rush."  </P> <P> After a momentary lull in their schedule this month, the sisters will be back  to their routine of riding horses six hours a day during the week and traveling  an average of two weekends a month to shows. At the shows, they'll "compete  against the course and not each other," CeCe says.  </P> <P> Although they "argue all the time," according to Lynda, their divergent  personalities mesh. CeCe is more organized, Lynda more people-oriented. "We can  generally rely on each other," CeCe says. "It's hard to find good reliable  people in any business."  </P> <P> And in times of stress, they lean on each other. Now that's real.  </P></p>

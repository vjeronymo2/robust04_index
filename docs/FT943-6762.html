			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / August sales disappoint carmakers New car registrations in the first 20 days of August, the most important new car sales month of the year, rose by only 0.5 per cent from the same period a year ago, prompting concern among carmakers that the recovery in sales is faltering. Registrations after the first 10 days were 3.7 per cent higher, already well below the industry consensus that sales would rise by 13-14 per cent to about 500,000 registrations for the month. Sales weakened even further during the second 10 days. It is thought about 327,448 new cars were registered in the first 20 days, only a marginal increase from the 325,792 registered in the same period last year. UK new car registrations in August are traditionally boosted by the change of registration prefix. The month accounts for about a quarter of all new car sales. Dealers and manufacturers are particularly concerned that it is the weakness of retail sales rather than fleet orders that is undermining the market. A leading car importer explained: 'The industry usually enters August with advanced retail orders and with advanced fleet orders, and then there is a further surge in retail sales. This year there does not seem to have been the second wave of retail customers coming in.' August is the most important month for retail sales, with purchases by private customers and small businesses making up 70 per cent of sales with the balance taken by fleet operators. During the first 20 days retail sales fell by 5.8 per cent year-on-year. The car market as a whole was only sustained by a 13 per cent increase in fleet sales. A senior executive with a leading UK carmaker said last night: 'Showroom traffic slowed from the end of the first week of August. It is not a disaster, but it is less than we hoped for, and we are surprised that there are fewer retail buyers. There's lots of advertising in place, but it just does not seem to be coming through.' The UK has helped lead the European new vehicle market out of recession this year. In the first seven months new car registrations rose 13.3 per cent year-on-year to 990,752.</p>

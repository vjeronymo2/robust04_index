			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar by </F> Reporter Roberto Reyes Pineda at Toncintin Airport on 11 April;  from the "This Very Day" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Paz] The Honduran Government is very pleased with  the working visit by the president [title as heard] of Costa  Rica, by President Figueres. There is no doubt that we have  made progress on the road to integration, on the road to  rapprochement with the Central American peoples.    [Reyes] Is the position Costa Rica has maintained in the  past  few years going to change with the arrival of Jose Maria  Figueres?    [Paz] Yes, we believe that the National Liberation Party's  leading of the Costa Rican Government, will ease the Central  American integration process. It will ease the rapprochement  Costa Rica should undertake with the rest of the Central America.    [Reyes] Was an agreement reached with President-elect  Figueres?    [Paz] No joint communique was signed, given that he will not  take office until 8 May. Nevertheless, the doors have been  opened for a dialogue, the channels of communication have been  opened between both governments.    [Reyes] Is there anything specific with regard to trade  relations, the increase that could take place in this sector?    [Paz] Basically we talked about the impact the signing of  NAFTA has had and its repercussions on Central America; what  position should we Central Americans take on this free trade  agreement which is a challenge to our nations. We also talked  about structuring a common strategy to face problems such as the  marketing of coffee, the price of bananas, and so forth.    [Reyes] Was Mr. Figueres asked about Costa Rica's experience  as a member of GATT, given that Honduras is on the verge of  becoming a member?    [Paz] If I recall correctly, at the Latin American level  there are just two nations that are not members of the GATT,  that is Panama and another South American nation. These,  however, will join in the coming months. Costa Rica does have a  long history and vast successful experience in the integration  of the Costa Rican economy in the new international business  structure.    [Reyes] How are the good relations between Honduras and  Costa  Rica seen in the coming years?    [Paz] I can say we have very good relations, and we expect  to  develop and enhance them even further.</p>

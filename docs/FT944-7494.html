			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / SmithKline makes Dollars 1.45bn sale SmithKline Beecham, the UK drugs company, yesterday agreed to sell its animal health business to US rival Pfizer and called a halt to the Dollars 7.7bn of corporate transactions it began last May. The Dollars 1.45bn (Pounds 920m) deal is the biggest acquisition ever made by Pfizer, the fourth biggest US drugs company, and signals its intention to grow through takeovers. 'We have several core health businesses, and we're looking for acquisitions in all of them,' said Mr William Steere, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive officer. Mr Jan Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive, said the disposal was probably the last corporate deal for the moment. Since Mr Leschly was appointed in April, SmithKline has spent Dollars 5.2bn on buying Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services, a US drugs distributor, and Sterling Health. It later sold the north American operations of Sterling to Bayer, the German chemicals company. 'I can't rule out further acquisitions, but what's next is to make sure that we make the most of our investments through synergy and restructuring,' said Mr Leschly. That restructuring has already started, with the merging of all businesses outside Europe and north America into a single division called SB Healthcare International, he said. With the purchase, Pfizer will control the world's biggest animal healthcare business, ahead of Rhone-Merieux of France, according to Mr Matthew Phillips, animal health sector analyst with London stockbroker Wood Mackenzie. SmithKline's animal health business had sales in 1993 of Dollars 614m and operating profits of Dollars 104m. Pfizer's division had Dollars 578m in sales, Dollars 37.5m in operating profits and is growing more slowly than SmithKline's. With this deal, Pfizer is buying an entry into European and Australian markets to complement its strengths in the US and Japan. It will also add animal vaccines and pet medicines to its product portfolio. The companies said the transaction would not dilute earnings. The sale should more than halve SmithKline's gearing. Last September, the company expected year-end gearing to be 250 to 300 per cent. However, after this sale it should fall to about 120 per cent.

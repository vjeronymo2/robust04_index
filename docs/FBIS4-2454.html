			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Xu  Wenli, arrested Friday in Beijing, was picked up by police for  having broken the law, the Chinese foreign ministry said Monday.    "China public security organs summoned Xu Wenli according to  law for he has violated relevant regulations on parole," a  spokesman from the ministry told AFP. "This entirely falls  within China's sovereignty and has nothing to do with China's  relations with other countries," the spokesman said.    Xu, 49, leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in  Beijing, was released on parole in May 1993 after 12 years in  prison.</p>

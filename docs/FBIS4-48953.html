			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, April 30 (XINHUA)--Soaring foreign investment  over the past few years has spurred economic development in  Shandong in East China, earning 35 percent of the province's  hard currency, a provincial official said today.    In 1993, the official said, Shandong Province approved 8,012  foreign-funded projects with 7.55 billion U.S. dollars in  investment, equivalent to the total amount for the previous 14  years.    These enterprises, he said, produced nine percent of the  total industrial output value and the foreign investment in  these firms makes up 14.8 percent of the total capital  investment in fixed assets.    Foreign investment has also brought in advanced technology  and facilities to help improve the industrial set-up of  state-owned enterprises. In 1993, some 30 percent of aging  enterprises or nearly 10,000 aging enterprises benefited from  technical renovations with the help of foreign investment.    Yantai city, for instance, attracted 790 million U.S.  dollars  to renovate 55 percent of the enterprises above county level.    Up to now, over one million people in the province have  found  jobs in foreign-funded enterprises. "Shandong cannot experience  such rapid economic development and profound improvement in  people's living standards without foreign investment," said Zhao  Zhihao, the provincial governor.</p>

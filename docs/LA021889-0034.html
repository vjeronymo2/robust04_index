			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: WHALE OF A TIME FOR YOUNG LANDLUBBERS  </P> <P> Whale watching from land is an inspired arrangement for families. Not only is  it cheaper than a boat trip, it allows antsy youngsters to walk around when  they've reached the limit of their whale-watching enjoyment. The National Park  Service opens its whale-watch station today at Point Dume State Preserve for a  six-week session.  </P> <P> Last year, two to 20 gray whales were spotted every Saturday and Sunday, often  just 100 to 200 feet from shore. Naturalists will be on hand from 10 a.m. to 3  p.m. to answer questions and provide information on whales, dolphins and other  marine life.  </P> <P> Although the whales can be spotted with the naked eye, the naturalists will  have a few spotting scopes or binoculars.  </P> <P> Even from land, visitors can observe "spouting" (the fountain-like spray), "spy  hopping" (when the whale pokes its head out of the water to look around) and  "breaching" (rising completely out of the water, turning sideways and falling  back).  </P> <P> The station is at the end of a sandy trail on an elevated area of coastline. It  is not a difficult walk but is inaccessible to wheelchairs and strollers. Bring  a picnic basket and enjoy lunch on the beach below. The station is open 10 a.m.  to 4 p.m. weekends through March 26.  </P> <P> Point Dume State Preserve is off Pacific Coast Highway, south of Zuma County  Beach in Malibu. Information: (818) 888-3770.  </P></p>

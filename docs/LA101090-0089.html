			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> FOR GIS, IT'S A DIET OF BOREDOM;  </P> <P> FRONT-LINE TROOPS IN SAUDI ARABIA FEEL THE STRAIN OF ENDLESS WAITING. NOT EVEN  THE STAGED SCORPION FIGHTS KEEP THEM AMUSED THESE DAYS.  </P> <P> In the Arabian desert, reveille comes by air. Clouds of pesky flies buzz in at  first light, the beginning of a daylong torment.  </P> <P> Beneath an umbrella of Marine Corps camouflage, Lance Cpl. Lawry Cuthbert fends  off the attackers with his shower shoe. Some miles away, Army Staff Sgt.  Raymond Horne takes his aim with a piece of cardboard wrapped in tape. Horne  has plenty of time to swat flies: His official job is persuading soldiers to  re-enlist. So far, he says, there have been no takers.  </P> <P> The adrenaline rush of deployment has ebbed.  </P> <P> Staging scorpion fights has become a bore. Cleaning sand from rifles no longer  focuses the mind. Even combat drills and mock battles staged under  once-unfamiliar conditions smack of lessons long-since learned.  </P> <P> As the massive U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia enters its third month,  the great challenge facing thousands of ordinary American soldiers dug in  across this bleak moonscape has become the emptiness of their days. And,  frustrated by uncertainty about what the future will bring and when, the  patience of front-line American troops has begun to fray.  </P> <P> "It all comes down to this: We should either go fight or we should go home,"  Cpl. Steve Ellis, a 25-year-old Army infantryman from Appleton, Wis., said  recently.  </P> <P> "You might just say we're all getting a little antsy now," said Ellis'  20-year-old squad mate, Pfc. Rod Terrill of Tucson, as he brushed the sand off  yet another cigarette.  </P> <P> These untested troops also have time to wonder about the realities of war and  how they will meet them if combat comes. It is at night, says a former Army  Special Forces officer who fought in Vietnam and now serves as a chaplain to a  Marine battalion here, when the troops most often approach to ask what war is  really like.  </P> <P> "You see a lot of death, a lot of destruction, a lot of horror, really," says  Navy Lt. Dan Hall, who became a Roman Catholic priest in reaction to what he  saw in Vietnam. He says he told one Marine the other day: "When you see me  start to worry, then you worry."  </P> <P> Waiting is rarely easy, but a grunt's life in Saudi Arabia is particularly  trying. Soldiers and officers at the forward-most U.S. positions say they are  sustained by letters and news of public support from the folks back home. After  weeks in the sand, they find comfort in little else.  </P> <P> To be sure, there is no sign of outright dissension. Many soldiers speak with  vehemence about the importance they attach to their pledge to serve the nation.  If some question why their President has ordered them to this bleak place, most  quickly add that it is not for them to doubt.  </P> <P> But with tens of thousands of Saddam Hussein's heavily armored troops  entrenched just across the border and no clear indication whether the Americans  will be asked to drive them out, the strain of waiting shows. Corporals say  captains have failed to tell the whole story. In the absence of ready answers  to the endless questions, tempers sometimes flare and rumors fly.  </P> <P> For GIs, the rare recreational break means little more than swapping one  isolated compound for another. And Saudi Arabia's cultural strictures always  intrude: Not only are alcohol and women off limits, but even Sports Illustrated  is banned for baring too much skin.  </P> <P> "I hate to say it," says one commander, whose 82nd Airborne company was one of  the first to be deployed here nearly two months ago, "but most of my guys just  want to go home."  </P> <P> The scorching afternoon on which infantryman Ellis spoke marked his squad's  first opportunity to stand down after more than 40 days of manning a  107-millimeter mortar pointed toward Iraq. The rare chance to relax consisted  of watching "The Godfather" on videotape and drinking cold sodas -- all in  stifling tents just a quarter mile back from the big gun.  </P> <P> Not all the 170,000 American military personnel in the Persian Gulf theater  have it so grim. For sailors, there is occasional shore leave with the prospect  at least of a beer in Bahrain. The Air Force, when not in air-conditioned  barracks, sleeps in air-conditioned tents. The Army's entire 101st Airborne  Division is housed in a vast tent city, a dusty, primitive sprawl that at least  provides regular showers and other home-base amenities.  </P> <P> But for those infantrymen and tankers, ammunition haulers and mechanics whose  small encampments compose the front lines, there is no such relief. A bed is a  cot under camouflage or a mattress on a tank. Meals, while sometimes hot, are  rarely recognizable. Showers arrive by truck.  </P> <P> The lucky ones rotate back to climate-controlled base camps for a couple days  every two weeks. But grunts like Ellis in the 197th Infantry Regiment got their  first break only last week -- the two-day stint in so-called Panther's  Paradise, where soldiers still sleep 34 to a stifling tent.  </P> <P> And while commanders seek to crowd the days with classes and calisthenics,  meals and make-work, soldiers say there can never be enough to fill the empty  hours. They read or write letters or play cards. Some lift weights fashioned  from ropes and water cans. But in the end, they say, the boredom is unrelieved.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of settin' and waitin'," says Marine Sgt. John Kaneaster, whose  job is to repair the rifles of the 1st Tank Battalion whenever they break down.  </P> <P> Indeed, he and Cuthbert, the shower-shoe wielding tank mechanic, spend most of  their time these days sitting around the dusty compound, a ghost town in the  sand, hiding from the fierce sun under netting and waging war upon the flies  who try to share their shade.  </P> <P> "To me it's a game," says Cuthbert, a 20-year-old from Lakeview Terrace in Los  Angeles. "I kill as many as I can."  </P> <P> Others hunt half-heartedly for scorpions and camel spiders. The arachnids are  set upon one another in title bouts that once seemed exciting. As the thrill of  those fierce fights has faded, most soldiers say they would rather listen to  music than mount another search.  </P> <P> Now that cooler weather has set in, there is less nocturnal training. Days  begin at dawn -- unless the flies arrive first. By 5:30 a.m., American soldiers  across the front lines are face down in the dust, finishing up the mandatory  push-ups before a few innings of softball in the sand.  </P> <P> Breakfast arrives by 7 a.m., hauled in from the rear. The food is heaped in  lumpy piles on flimsy Styrofoam trays. Later, there may be sand-table classes  on Iraqi tactics, even realistic training exercises that pit Marine against  Marine.  </P> <P> But more often, the day in the desert means sitting in a foxhole, on guard  against a so-far dormant Iraqi enemy. Or cleaning one more rifle. Or changing  yet another sand-clogged filter in another Humvee jeep. And, soldiers say,  officers can always find another berm in need of building or another sandbag  for a private to fill.  </P> <P> "They try to keep us busy," shrugs Sgt. Michael Londergan, whose days are spent  shuttling supplies of ammunition and spare parts to the combat troops he  serves.  </P> <P> After an afternoon reprise, quitting time comes early to take advantage of  fading light. There may be time for one last workout or writing a letter home  in the desert dusk. But darkness falls by 6 p.m, and a blackout is enforced.  Even with games of spades and nighttime weightlifting, the hours stretch on.  </P> <P> "The thing about the desert," says Lance Cpl. Derrick Farwell, a 21-year-old  Camp Pendleton-based Marine scout, "is that there's not a lot of external  stimulation to get the old noodle going. Your mind just wanders."  </P> <P> Most try to focus on anything but the obvious. It is wives and girlfriends that  soldiers' thoughts gravitate to, along with cars and motorcycles and the  almost-forgotten delights of fresh food and ice-cold drinks.  </P> <P> Among the crew of "Bad Company," the Marines' name for a light armored LAV-25  vehicle that would charge across the battlefield in the early stages of a tank  war, the nightly topic revolves around the relative merits of filet mignon and  lobster.  </P> <P> "I prefer the lobster myself," says Cpl. John Harvey, Bad Company's New  England-born gunner. The commander is an Oklahoman, though, and he argues the  merits of "real beef for real Marines."  </P> <P> Over at the Army mortar platoon, between late-night yawns on watch, Ellis and  Terrill seek a silver lining in the monotony, planning aloud what they will do  with earnings they now have little way to spend.  </P> <P> "It will be like, 'Hey, Rod, are you still going to put those new seats in your  truck?' " Ellis says. Sooner or later, though, even such daydreaming gets down  to the basics. "Back home I drive a '65 Buick Riviera with a 425," he says. "I  can't afford to pay $1.50 a gallon."  </P> <P> Thinking about simple pleasures sometimes also just makes their absence felt.  "We've got nothing out here," says Londergan, the Army sergeant from Corning,  N.Y., surveying terrain broken only by scattered camouflage nets.  </P> <P> "Women and beer," he says. "You take that away from a man and what else is  there?"  </P> <P> The waiting also makes it harder for soldiers to remember why they are here.  </P> <P> "I have to tell myself again and again: 'You signed that contract,' " says  Horne, the fly-swatting Army sergeant. " 'You promised to support and defend  the Constitution of the United States.'  </P> <P> "That's what goes through my mind every day," the sergeant says, a gold tooth  gleaming in the sun. "Why am I here? Why am I here?"  </P> <P> As the initial bravado about "kicking ass and taking gas" dissipates, other  troops across the desert said they were beginning to ask the same question. And  frustration with defending against an Iraqi force that shows no interest in  invading and orders that give no permission to attack has inspired a certain  revisionism.  </P> <P> "They say we're here to defend Saudi Arabia and drive Saddam out of Kuwait,"  one Army sergeant says as a squad of infantrymen around him nods in agreement.  "The thing about it is, Kuwait used to be his land. Why can't he have his land  back?"  </P> <P> The sergeant was referring to a claim by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that  Kuwait is part of Iraq because Kuwait and southern Iraq were administered as  the same province of Basra in the Ottoman Empire before World War I.  </P> <P> Following the war, both Kuwait and Iraq were administered by Britain under a  League of Nations mandate in which Kuwait and Basra province of Iraq were  separated. Kuwait received its independence from Britain on June 19, 1961, and  survived as an independent nation until the Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> In other units, talk has spread that the United States in the 1950s sought and  failed to win permission to establish a permanent base here. Maybe, soldiers  say, that explains their current predicament.  </P> <P> Kuwait was not an independent nation in the 1950s. Since then, the United  States has, from time to time, sought basing rights in the gulf region. For  instance, Bahrain serves as home port to the U.S. Navy's Persian Gulf task  force. Kuwait, which since independence sought to maintain a neutral foreign  policy, has never permitted any foreign bases on its territory.  </P> <P> "Saddam tipped it off, I know," says the Army's Londergan. "But the longer we  stay, the more I start to think the President was just looking for a reason to  get a grip on all the oil."  </P> <P> "Just to grab a piece of the rock," echoes Spec. Michael Douglas, of  Youngstown, Ohio.  </P> <P> And the longer the U.S. forces sit in place to defend Saudi Arabia, the more  some soldiers wonder why they must stay here at all. "All they need now is a  peacekeeping force," one Marine corporal says. "If they need us, we can come  back."  </P> <P> There are no signs that such complaints have yet diminished combat readiness;  the discontent, soldiers say, only makes them more eager to get the job done  fast. And for every voice of cynicism, there are several who -- at least to  reporters -- profess wholehearted commitment to the mission.  </P> <P> "America's got to do its part to protect the free world from tyrants like  Saddam Hussein," said Lance Cpl. James Morgan of Dayton, Ohio, the squad leader  in a Marine anti-tank missile platoon.  </P> <P> But other soldiers say weeks at close quarters with little outlet have left  nerves raw and tempers worn, prompting periodic flare-ups. Short of blows, the  play becomes more physical, with an entire platoon observed recently sprinting  across the sandy dunes to tackle and pile on top of one hapless young private.  </P> <P> Army officers wearily explain that the game is known as "911" -- the universal  code for help. "You can 911 all you want to," a fed-up staff sergeant shouts at  his men as he seeks to disentangle the mob. "But no more of this dog-pile  bull----."  </P> <P> The uncertainty about what lies ahead touches off waves of late-night gossiping  and grousing. Lately, the whispering has produced the slogan "Go home or go  fight."  </P> <P> Then there are the ubiquitous rumors. Why won't the officers tell us what is  going on? soldiers ask. In the past two weeks, commanders have been forced to  stand before assembled soldiers to deny, variously, that Saddam Hussein is  dead, that American servicemen were killed in a terror attack, and that a date  has been set for their flight home.  </P> <P> "The soldiers really feel like we're holding out on them," one Army company  commander says. "Their morale has really dropped a lot."  </P> <P> Another commander said some of the frustration has been channeled at the host  government, with soldiers confused by conflicting signals suggesting that "the  Saudis want us here and at the same time don't want us here."  </P> <P> Frustrated soldiers recount stories of the private whose parents sent him a  religious medal but the box arrived empty, or the sergeant whose buddies sent  him a skin magazine, but Saudi censors inked over all the pictures.  </P> <P> "They wonder why, here we are supposedly protecting their freedom and  everything, but we're still stuck in this little encampment," says Lt. Col.  Matt Belford, whose battalion in the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the first  dispatched to the front lines in Saudi Arabia, is now in an isolated facility  in the rear.  </P> <P> "I tell them, no matter what we do, we are basically two cultures, and we're  not going to mix," Belford says.  </P> <P> There remain some who insist they are content with things as they are now.  Marine Lance Cpl. Farwell, who plans to buy a new motorcycle with all the money  he saves, is assigned to a scout platoon that would likely bear the first shock  of a gas attack. He points to the chemical suit above his driver's seat to make  clear he is in no hurry for fighting to break out.  </P> <P> KUWAIT RESISTANCE FADES: Iraqi reprisals have caused the opposition to scale  back.

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUDGET IMPASSE;  </P> <P> IN SHOWDOWN OVER SHUTDOWN, BUSH SEEKS THE WINNER'S IMAGE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: FACING THE WORST DOMESTIC DEFEAT OF HIS PRESIDENCY, HE ADMITS 'YOU'VE  GOT TO TAKE A LITTLE HEAT.' BUT HE SEEKS TO FOCUS THE BLAME ON CONGRESS.;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> President Bush does not like to lose -- nor look like a loser. And so,  challenged by a recalcitrant Congress and surrounded by symbols of a government  shutdown, he did his best Saturday to come out looking like a winner.  </P> <P> Over and over, with the anger in his voice rising dramatically, the President  -- who portrayed himself during the 1988 campaign as a Washington insider  capable of working with Congress -- insisted he can no longer tolerate  "business as usual" in dealing with the budget crisis.  </P> <P> Working in front of a partially darkened White House, which sent home domestic  workers and canceled public tours as part of the shutdown, with a chorus of  senior White House officials standing to the side, the President delivered a  performance worthy of, well, Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> With his voice rising in dramatic irritation, he declared: "I'm very sorry if  people are inconvenienced, but I am not going to be a part of business as usual  by the United States Congress.  </P> <P> "The average American knows what's going on. I think they know that the  Congress has continued to kick this can down the road, and they think they  ought to act," Bush said.  </P> <P> But even as he sought to focus the blame on Congress, the President presented  the image of a leader ready to follow Harry S. Truman's advice that those who  can't stand the heat should get out of the kitchen.  </P> <P> "You've got to take a little heat," Bush said. "You have to take some hits."  </P> <P> Maybe, he seemed to suggest, Congress should heed that advice, too.  </P> <P> "A lot of these congressmen can jump up without any responsibility for running  the country, or even cooperating with their leaders, and make a point that's  very happy for the home folks," Bush said, referring to the pressure many  lawmakers said they felt from voters concerned about increased Medicare costs  or higher taxes on gasoline or home heating oil.  </P> <P> Still, what the President faces is the worst domestic defeat of his presidency.  It came early Friday, when the House resoundingly rejected a budget compromise  blessed by the President after its intricate details were negotiated by  congressional leaders and, for the White House, Chief of Staff John H. Sununu  and Budget Director Richard G. Darman.  </P> <P> The President met with the most senior members of the House and Senate for  about an hour and a half Saturday morning, and told them he would veto any new  measure to continue government funding for a week while a new attempt was made  to resolve the budget impasse.  </P> <P> Afterward, the President walked out the front door of the White House West  Wing, where the Oval Office is situated, and told reporters that despite the  protestations of the Democratic leaders, he would stick by his veto plan.  </P> <P> While his talk was tough, it did not necessarily befit the man at the top, said  presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, a Washington  public policy and research organization. "To start posturing on this after he  took a defeat is the opposite of presidential -- it's not George Bush at his  finest hour," Hess said.  </P> <P> "He's angry, and that's not always the best posture for a President," said  Hess, whose association with the presidency goes back to his days as a member  of Dwight D. Eisenhower's White House staff.  </P> <P> In vetoing a measure designed to keep the government functioning for another  week, Hess said, Bush was demonstrating "a certain pettiness." He said the  President had "set up a straw man" by, in effect, seeking to create the  impression that he was the only person worried about running the country.  </P> <P> "The truth of the matter is, he and his minions bear a large share of  responsibility for what happened. There is a little scapegoat-ism in that one,"  Hess said.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on Bush's get-tough  approach, said that after the Administration lost the budget vote in the House  early Friday, "the question was how to turn it around and get the ball back in  Congress' court."  </P> <P> To do that, Bush needed not only to send the veto back to Congress, but to do  it with a quick and forceful display of presidential dissatisfaction.  </P> <P> "The longer we held it, the harder it would be to get that focus on Congress,"  he said.  </P> <P> For Bush, this was to be a long weekend spent in Kennebunkport, Me., preparing  the old family home for the winds and frosts of coastal Maine's winter.  Instead, First Lady Barbara Bush headed home to Maine and the President  remained in the White House, meeting in the morning with the Democratic and  Republican leaders of the House and Senate.  </P> <P> But if he was unable to wear the winner's mantle in the morning, there was  always the opportunity for a comeback of sorts in the afternoon.  </P> <P> And so, looking for a challenge -- if not an easy mark -- he summoned his stout  but speedy press secretary, Fitzwater, half an hour after the veto message was  signed.  </P> <P> The conversation had nothing to do with Congress or the closed government.  Budget or none, the presidential tennis court remained open, the President  reminded his press secretary -- said to be considerably more able with a  racquet than his physique would suggest. Could he find a partner to take on  Bush and his brother John?  </P> <P> Fitzwater was confident he could find a doubles partner. When last seen by  reporters he was dashing off to get his racket and shoes after grumbling to the  President: "We'd lose to you and John."  </P> <P> The tennis match couldn't have turned out better for the President.  </P> <P> "They killed us," Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

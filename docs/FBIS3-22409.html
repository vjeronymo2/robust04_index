In January 1991 the Environment and Forest Ministry had  identified 17 categories of industries that caused maximum  pollution in the country and 1,551 industrial units set up prior  to 1981, were asked to install pollution control equipment and  bring down emissions in air and water to the standards  prescribed. The deadline was December 31 1993.    At a meeting this January, it was pointed out that about 50  industries had not even begun to implement the order. Among them  were 14 sugar units, five distilleries, four cement plants, four  thermal plants, four leather and two pharmaceutical units. Of  the 50 defaulting units, 23 were in Andhra.    Within the Ministry itself, there were differences as to  whether a few of these firms should be shut down to show the  Ministry's determination, or whether the ministry should just  continue to flex its muscles, since closure would throw  thousands of workers out of a job.    The matter was finally taken to Cabinet, which ruled out the  closure of any industry since it could cause large-scale  unemployment. Chief Ministers also opposed the closure move.  Several units, it was pointed out, were sick and there was no  money even to resuscitate them.    Orissa Chief Minister Biju Patnaik argued that the polluting  thermal power plant at Talcher was set up in 1952, long before  the pollution laws were introduced. He said 2,500 people would  lose jobs if just this one unit was closed. The State would also  suffer for want of power. Since isolated polluting industries in  rural areas did less harm than polluting units in urban  industrial clusters, they should be shown leniency, he argued.    Now, the state pollution control boards have been asked to  prosecute these units under the Environment Protection Act for  not complying with standards set. Ironically, the penalty will  not be for failing to install pollution control measures but for  not complying with the standards prescribed for emissions. The  sentence could be five years imprisonment or a fine of Rs  [rupees] 1 lakh or both.    However, it is pertinent to point out that the official  dealing with these cases in the ministry could not recall a  single case of successful prosecution of such industrial units.  Industrial units that do not have funds to install pollution  control equipment, do manage to raise resources to fight the  litigation.    The chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board Dilip  Biswas has asked state boards to:    1) verify wilful defaulters of the 17 highly polluting  industries;    2) determine the time required by each units for completion  of pollution control programme on case to case basis and give a  time frame not exceeding six months;    3) take immediate action against wilful defaulters.

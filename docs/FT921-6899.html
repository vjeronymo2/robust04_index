			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (7): 'Backstop role' for the west - Defence KUWAIT signed a military co-operation agreement with Britain this month, similar to a 10-year pact agreed earlier with the US. A deal with France, the third active western member of the Desert Storm coalition will follow soon. None of these agreements - as each government is keen to emphasise - includes any wording committing the three allies to the automatic defence of Kuwait in the event of further aggression against the emirate. But that is not entirely the way Kuwait prefers to interpret these pacts. 'Let's just say their perception is a bit stronger than ours,' says an official from one signatory country. The two deals so far signed, and the French one to follow, are essentially undertakings to conduct joint manoeuvres with the Kuwaitis, offer increased training to Kuwaiti forces and co-ordinate arms sales packages. The US pact also includes provisions to pre-position tanks, armoured personnel carriers and artillery in Kuwait. No one is in any doubt that Kuwait, which lacks either strategic depth or sufficient manpower for a substantial army, would have finally to rely on western assistance to repel another outright attack. But the western powers are determined that Kuwait should not read this an excuse not to, first, steel its own domestic forces and second, to weld itself more effectively than before the war into a collective Gulf security arrangement. Kuwait has, in fact, made a priority of rebuilding its armed forces, which were left depleted, disorganised and demoralised by Iraq's swift invasion. A full reorganisation of the forces will be made following completion of a detailed US study to be presented to the Defence Ministry this month. While details of the reorganisation, and therefore of the the army's procurement needs, await the results of this study, it is already plain what will be required of Kuwait's rebuilt force: that it should be able to resist an aggressor for long enough to allow foreign reinforcements to arrive. In practice, this would amount to holding out against Iraqi forces - which remain the likeliest longer-term threat to Kuwait - for two or three days. 'If the army could hold out for seven days, it would be incredible,' comments one defence analyst. But even this circumscribed ambition will require substantial work to achieve. To begin with, Kuwait must somehow find the manpower to fill an army which before the war boasted 20,000 men under arms, but which has slumped since to about half this figure following the government's decision to disbar on grounds of questionable loyalty some 10,000 Bidoun, or stateless Arabs, who had made up the bedrock of the ground troops. The Defence Ministry optimistically aims to build a total force of 30,000, partly by insisting more vigorously than before the war that Kuwaitis actually perform their formally obligatory 18 months' national service - an obligation most Kuwaiti males have hitherto managed to circumvent. Although the government wants an army purely of Kuwaiti citizens - and at least 1,000 Kuwaitis have been recruited since liberation - a small number of Bidoun are, out of necessity, being readmitted into the force. As part of the government's professed desire to see its forces armed with the latest and highest technology, Kuwait's ground forces will almost certainly purchase either Abrahams M1A2 tanks from the US or the British Challenger II, but a decision on which or how many is not expected until later this year. Defence analysts say estimates that Kuwait may purchase 200 tanks are, for now, broad guesses. Kuwait's airforce has already received three of the 40 F-18 jets ordered from the US as part of a Dollars 1.6bn order originally made in 1988 to replace the airforce's dated A4 Skyhawks and Mirage F1 aircraft. Refurbished bases to accommodate these aircraft will be ready by the end of this year. Earlier this year, the government awarded US companies contracts to repair the emirate's two devastated airbases under an overall Dollars 81m foreign military sales package. Morrison Knudsen Corporation is to rebuild Ahmed al Jaber base, north of Kuwait City, in a Dollars 24m deal, while George A Fuller and American International Contractors secured a Dollars 18.5m contract to restore the Al-Salem base, south of the city. However, while revival of Kuwait's own forces is in train, much less progress has been made towards securing what western governments insist Kuwait must see as its second line of defence - its Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) allies. A residual 'Peninsular Shield' force of two brigades, one from Saudi Arabia and one from a mix of GCC countries, has remained in central and southern Kuwait since the war. However, this small force falls far short of representing the sort of Gulf security arrangement which the US and Britain formally insist their own defence pacts should only 'underpin'. Since the effective demise of the Damascus Declaration, which aimed after the war to bond the six GCC states, Syria and Egypt into a joint Arab force, GCC states have shuttled chiefs of staff around the region in an attempt to construct some sort of strategic defence structure for the region. So far, however, this has yielded little more fruit than a string of studies. Oman's suggestion of creating a pan-Gulf force of 100,000 remains technically on the books but suffers from disagreements over command and control structures - and the potentially fatal question of where the thinly-populated Gulf states will find that many soldiers. While Iraq remains strategically crippled and two US aircraft carriers remain in or around the Gulf just in case, Kuwait and its GCC fellows have time to mull over details of a joint arrangement. Continuous US and British military manoeuvres in the Gulf, as part of the joint military agreements, will also underline what western defence officials prefer to call their 'backstop role'. However, the US and Britain, in particular, are pressing Kuwait and the other Gulf states hard to make a go of collective defence. Both governments have also made a point of highlighting to Kuwait that whatever the immediate threat from Iraq, no country in the Gulf should lose sight of the fact that Iran has quietly been busy re-arming itself for the past year. Iran's rearming may offer no immediate threat in itself, but as one military expert puts it: 'In a year or two, no-one will be able to make a single decision in the Gulf without considering the Iranian reaction.' Given Iran's distaste for any western military presence in the region, Britain and the US are seeking to impress on Kuwait that there may be a longer-term political cost to being too overtly dependent on its western protectors - not least to those protectors themselves.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: Trizec to reduce debts by selling stake in Rouse TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, will make a modest dent in its CDollars 9.8bn (USDollars 8.03bn) debt by selling the bulk of its 25 per cent interest in Rouse Company, a large US shopping-centre developer. Trizec said yesterday that it has agreed to sell 9.5m of its 11m Rouse shares to seven US institutional investors and Rouse itself. The shares, which represent 21.5 per cent of Rouse's equity, are being bought at USDollars 12 per share for a total price of Dollars 114m. Trizec will also receive warrants to purchase 500,000 Rouse common shares at a price of Dollars 18 each within the next five years. The deal is expected to close within the next week. Trizec is controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family, with another 25 per cent of its equity held by Olympia &amp; York.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> RULES BAR SHIPS FROM DUMPING PLASTIC  </P> <P> The federal government barred ships from dumping plastic garbage into the  ocean, saying hundreds of thousands of birds, marine mammals and turtles die  each year after eating or becoming entangled in the debris. In announcing the  new regulations, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said plastic debris  accounted for 4% of all refuse that is tossed into the ocean each year and its  resistance to natural breakdown means it can persist in the environment for  long periods of time. The Coast Guard rules comply with an international  agreement known as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution  from Ships. The regulations apply to U.S. flag vessels anywhere in the world  and to foreign ships within 200 miles of the U.S. coast.  </P></p>

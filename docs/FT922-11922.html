			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Leading Article: Teachers and their unions EASTER is a depressing time of year for parents with children in state schools - and indeed anyone concerned with the UK's education system. One by one, the teachers' unions gather at seaside resorts to hold their annual conferences. Their leaders strut the stage claiming that the education system is in crisis and blaming the government. The delegates bellow from the rostrum that their schools are in terminal decline. Bloodcurdling resolutions are passed threatening strikes if change is not stopped in its tracks. This year has been no different. The National Union of Teachers has reasserted its opposition to most of the education policies of the Conservative government it must deal with for the next five years. The president of the NASUWT urged his members to challenge the government's education reforms which were bringing 'chaos' into the schools. It was left to Mr Peter Smith of the moderate Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association to observe that the 'opted-out' grant-maintained schools were here to stay and should be made to work. Much of these conference proceedings are posturing by activists who are unrepresentative of the teaching profession. Last year's NUT conference, for example, voted to boycott the national testing of seven-year-olds. A ballot of the members who would have had to implement the boycott rejected it by eight to one. A separate ballot of all NUT members also rejected a national campaign against testing by six to one. Lost sympathy But the posturing invariably hits the headlines over a bank holiday weekend when news is in short supply. Education is the loser, bad-mouthed by representatives whose behaviour is guaranteed to lose teachers the sympathy of those whose support is most vital - the parents. A new entrant to the teaching profession might sensibly ask whether there is any need for teaching unions. After all, the creation of an independent teachers' pay review body has ended collective bargaining over pay (and probably done more to improve the pay and status of teachers than any number of resolutions passed in Blackpool or Scarborough). And union influence over local education policy is weakening as more and more schools opt out of the control of local education authorities which often worked in partnership with the unions. Yet there remains a role for union membership, to provide advice, benefits and representation at work. Such mutual insurance may even be more helpful in this period of flux, as schools increasingly become independent entities managing their budgets under the leadership of the head teacher. Alliance building Nor need the benefits of union membership stop at the school gate. A competent union will seek to influence the pay review body with well-argued submissions on behalf of its members. It will lobby policymakers intelligently through the sort of campaigning which has made the Royal College of Nursing such a successful advocate of its members' interests. Above all, it will seek to build an alliance with the parents to advance the cause of education, not to alienate them through mindless militancy which punishes only the children. To achieve these objectives, teachers need to speak with one voice. The half dozen unions which currently vie for members were founded for an education system which has disappeared: the AMMA, for example, used to represent grammar school teachers; the NASUWT was the union for teachers in secondary moderns. Uniquely in the British trade union movement, there have been no significant moves towards mergers of teaching unions. Yet a powerful and authoritative organisation to represent Britain's teachers is sorely needed. Now is an ideal time to create such a professional organisation, with a new education secretary taking up office. Mr John Patten looks willing to open the dialogue with teachers which has been missing during the recent spate of necessary reforms. Sadly, the creation of a single voice scarcely features on the unions' agendas. Teachers - and Britain's children - deserve better.</p>

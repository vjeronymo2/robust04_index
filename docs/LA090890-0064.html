			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVESTORS UPSET OVER LEGAL FEES IN LINCOLN CASE  </P> <P> Small investors who lost their life savings in the collapse of American  Continental Corp. and its Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan unit are grumbling about  the fees their lawyers will be paid to recover some of the approximately $275  million they lost.  </P> <P> A federal judge in Phoenix has approved a formula that would give the  investors' lawyers $37.5 million if they recover $150 million of the money lost  by American Continental debt holders.  </P> <P> The formula gives lawyers 25% of the first $150 million recovered and 29% of  any amount over that. It also provides for million-dollar incentives to recover  certain amounts by specified dates and allows for out-of-pocket costs,  according to a recent notice seeking investor approval of settlements reached  with two defendants so far.  </P> <P> If the lawyers recovered $250 million -- and few insiders expect that to happen  -- they would receive $81 million in fees plus millions more in costs and  incentive payments.  </P> <P> "This is the biggest windfall that has hit the legal market," said Harold  Rosenberg, a bondholder from Van Nuys who also is a lawyer. "Of course, the  lawyers should be rewarded -- but how much?"  </P> <P> Rosenberg said more than a dozen bondholders have expressed disapproval of the  fee formula, especially since they generally believed that fees wouldn't exceed  15% of the amount recovered. One plaintiffs' lawyer, Richard Greenfield of  Philadelphia, said last year that legal fees have been as low as 7% in major  class actions.  </P> <P> But Frank Barbaro of Santa Ana, one of the bondholders' attorneys, defended the  formula, saying the case is "incredibly" complex and about 50 lawyers have been  working more than a year on the case without any compensation.  </P> <P> The lawyers also have spent $5 million of their own money to pay such expenses  as travel, filing fees and photocopying some of the 14 million pages of  documents generated during the case.  </P> <P> In class actions, plaintiffs' lawyers are typically paid from the pool of money  they recover. The fee is usually set by the court once the case in completed.  </P></p>

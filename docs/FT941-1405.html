			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ulster committee debate allowed The government has allowed time for another Commons debate on the proposed Northern Ireland select committee, signalling its determination to get the new body up and running soon after Easter. Next Tuesday's debate is needed because the planned composition of the committee - widely seen as a reinforcement of the government's commitment to Ulster's unionist majority - remains a bone of party political contention. Labour objects to Tory proposals forced through the Commons selection committee earlier this week which will limit its membership of the new body to two MPs. This compares with six Conservatives, four unionists and one member of the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. Opposition MPs are expected to force several votes on Tuesday in a move to secure a more favourable alignment of forces. Meanwhile, Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, yesterday urged republicans to summon 'enormous courage' to abandon support for violence and engage in the democratic effort to bring peace to the province. He called on the IRA to lay down its guns and for Sinn Fein to enter the talks process. He said Ireland was at a crucial point in its history and that a search for peace which included Dublin, Sinn Fein, nationalists and the Irish overseas  -particularly those in the US - offered no threat to unionists. If proposals are allowed to stand, select committee members will include Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down and front runner for chairman, and Mr Andrew Hunter, the pro-unionist chairman of the Conservative backbench Northern Ireland committee. Other committee members would be Conservatives Mr James Cran, Mr Charles Hendry, Mr Richard Spring, Mr David Wilshire and Mr Mark Wolfson; Labour's Mr Jim Marshall and Mr Clive Soley Mr Eddie McGrady (SDLP), Mr Ken Maginnis and Mr John Taylor (UUP), and Mr Peter Robinson (DUP). Today's planned visit to Northern Ireland by Mrs Mary Robinson, the Irish president, drew attacks yesterday from unionist politicians, who described the decision as provocative and an insult to the Queen.</p>

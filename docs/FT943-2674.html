			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Travel: A moss bed under a blue night sky - Nicholas Woodsworth enjoys the simple beauty of Finland Four or five hour's drive out of Helsinki, in one of those modern Finnish towns that pop out of the endless forest with no warning, I stopped and bought a few cassettes for the car. Back on the road, I turned up the volume and let Sibelius's dark, brooding spirit crash and swell and roll out of the windows into the wilderness. When travelling in Nordic countries, one should always be well stocked with melancholia. The odd thing on this trip, though, was that through all the great outdoors there was no corresponding echo to the composer's cry of angst. I had taken other trips when the whole Nordic world - dull, leaden, gloomy - had seemed to me to want nothing more than to slit its collective wrist. But this was a perfect early summer's day, as light, carefree and guiltless as the breeze dancing through the pines. Savo, the vast Finnish lakeland that stretches along the Russian border, sparkled in the sunshine. So complete is the meeting of earth and water here that I was happily confused, not knowing whether I was driving through forest sprinkled with 1,000 lakes or across an inland sea sown with 1,000 islands. It was a perfect time of year, too late for spring snowstorms, too early for mosquitoes or tourists. Along the roadside, stands of silver birch fluttered in tender green leaf. New rye sprouted in fields where, here and there, the thick walls of the forest had been hacked back. Wooden barns, freshly painted, glinted bright, brazen red. The world seemed young and hopeful. Most extraordinary of all, contrary to everything we have ever learned about the fleeting nature of sunny summer days, this was a sunny summer day that was not going to end, at least not for many weeks. Savo lies just below the Arctic Circle. In high summer locals forget the soul-chilling winter that devours months whole and stuffs them into its long black maw - around the mid-summer solstice, when the sun barely dips below the horizon, the darkness of night is unknown. For gloomy Finns, shut up in obscurity for most of the year, this is a short, zany time, a period of incandescent exuberance. Following small roads that wound about between lakeshore and forest, I drove to Savonlinna, a town built on a little chain of islands set in a channel between two great lakes, Haapavesi and Pihlajavesi - as Finnish names go, they are among the more pronounceable. In the 1920s, Savonlinna was a busy centre for the steamship companies that provided transportation - when the water was not frozen solid - through the lakeland area. Today, small lake freighters, barges and passenger boats still chug through the narrows past the town. But the big lure of the place now is an event shorter even than summer itself - in July, Savonlinna is transformed from a sleepy little northern town into a tourist attraction as, night after sunny night for a month, Olavinlinna Castle plays host to one of the world's northern-most opera festivals. Who, for heaven's sake, would build a medieval castle lost in the forests of the far north, I wondered? But Olavinlinna, an island-fortress of brick towers and stone walls rising from the waters of the channel, is as substantial and imposing as any castle in Britain or Spain. It was built more than 500 years ago by the powerful Swedish empire as an outpost on their Russian frontier, I read as I settled down by the water with my guidebook. I was so used to the idea of Swedes as gentle makers of diet crackers and givers of peace prizes that I had never considered the possibility of a vast and aggressive Swedish empire. I read on. The Great Wrath, the Lesser Wrath, endless invasions and famines, cedings and border changes, 200 years of domination by Russia - Finland, it seems, has spent most of its existence being batted about between one northern power and another. I read late into the night under a bright sky. By the time I looked up, hours had gone by, and I decided to wander along and see how small-town Finland coped with the midnight sun. As in small towns everywhere, there is not a great deal for young people in Savonlinna to do, so they have devised their own solution. They drink. Perhaps it was because it was a Friday night, or because school holidays had started. Perhaps it was the pressures of Finnish history, or the manic phase the short summer season brings on. Whatever the reason, the young men and women of Savonlinna, as most Finns seem to be, are heroic tipplers. At midnight they were out on the streets in force and weaving about like bingeing sailors. Many Finns drink outside because the bars are impossibly expensive, and that is fine by me. But somehow, armies of drunks throwing up in bushes and peeing off bridges are a little hard to take in the full light of day. On the other hand, if I spent nine months a year in a deep-freeze with the lights out, I am not sure I might not celebrate summer with a drink or two as well. The whole town was still sleeping it off when, early next morning, I placed a heavy rock in the bow of my rented canoe and paddled away from Savonlinna and out into an endless world of lakes and islands. Attractive when seen from the shore, Savo is spectacularly beautiful from the water. The Finns are a curious lot, moody and inward-looking. If they have a wild aspect to their character, they are also profoundly attached to the subtle and secret world of nature that surrounds them. There is nothing more important for urban Finns than to quit the city occasionally and find their roots again in the great outdoors. Most have a cabin somewhere on a lake, a river or deep in the bush and, in summer especially, a return to such peaceful places is a ritual. Bright mauve lilac bushes, neatly-trimmed lawns running down to the water, white-painted flag-poles flying long pennants of the Finnish colours, boats rubbing against wooden docks, busy elderly ladies in gardening hats - at first the shoreline that I paddled past was a version of suburbia. But as I began to lose myself in an archipelago of rocky pine-covered islands, the properties became less frequent and cruder. A small cabin set back in the trees, a boat pulled up on the rocks, a weathered sauna beside the water - Finns like to be close to nature. There is a northern beauty that is like no other beauty: nothing but wood, water and stone covers the face of the earth. It is a simplification that brings great peacefulness. At the same time the extreme harshness of the climate can produce intricate designs: twisted and writhing branches, sculpted cones, the finest covering of needles. I travelled for hours, the canoe gliding between islands over clear dark water laced with a skein of yellow pollen from the pine forests. Once I was startled when a vast, naked Finn charged out of his sauna and with a great yaaaaagh] hurled himself down a long wooden dock and into the lake. Otherwise, calm reigned. There was the regular lift and fall of my paddle, the call of birds from banks of sedge, the occasional faint thok of wood being split beside a distant cabin. When evening came, I stopped at an uninhabited island. Tired, I lay down in moss as thick and soft as any mattress, and under a bright blue sky that refused to go away, fell asleep. As well as Savonlinna there are towns nearby offering hotel, farm and simple cabin accommodation. A good way to experience Savo is through a canoe/camping expedition. Niskanen Harri of Savonlinna (tel: 949-673 055; fax 957-273 101) rents canoes, houseboats and sailing boats.</p>

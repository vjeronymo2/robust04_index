			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Court move on Nigerian poll results NIGERIA'S National Electoral Commission yesterday announced it would appeal against this week's court ruling restraining it from publishing election results. It said it was taking the case to the appeal court in an effort to put the country's presidential elections back on course. A high court ban on the outcome of Saturday's presidential elections threatened to undermine the democratic process which is due to restore civilian rule on August 27 and cast fresh doubts on the readiness of President Ibrahim Babangida to hand over power. Mr Ahmed Kusamotu, the chairman of the electoral commission, said yesterday that the suspension of the result was not in the best interests of democracy in the country. 'The NEC is being manipulated by the authorities,' said Mr Amos Idakula, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party, which had a commanding polls lead after half the 30 states' results had been announced earlier this week. The Campaign for Democracy echoed the injustice felt by many at the legal wrangle which has disrupted the polls. 'What upsets us about this court order is that it comes from a justice minister who gave the NEC complete discretion to carry out the polls,' said Dr Beko Ransome Kuti.</p>

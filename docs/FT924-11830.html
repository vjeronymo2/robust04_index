			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bush tries to fuel maize price recovery - Laurie Morse reports on a controversial election year boost for ethanol production CROP DUST and politics have formed a heady mix in the midwest in these final weeks of autumn, as US farmers harvest a record maize crop and grumble about Washington's failure to halt the slide in grain prices. Maize prices traded for future delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade dropped this week to their lowest level in four years and are now very close to Dollars 2 a bushel. Out in the country prices are just as weak. A farmer in central Illinois received an average price of Dollars 1.97 a bushel for his maize harvest in September, a drop of 40 cents from last year. With the US Department of Agriculture forecasting a maize crop of 9bn bushels (56 lb each) and storage bins already bursting with 1.8bn bushels carried over from last year's harvest, Washington has sweetened an array of programmes, mostly credit guarantees, designed to push the excess overseas and on to the plates of foreign customers. At the same time the Agriculture Department has told farmers they must idle 10 per cent of their productive land - double the amount required in 1992 - to qualify for next year's farm support programmes. To offset the unpopular set-aside requirements, President George Bush has produced another plan designed to boost domestic maize demand. In a last-ditch effort to retrieve the farm vote Mr Bush this month relaxed environmental regulations to allow maize-derived alcohol to be used as an additive to a cleaner gasoline mix. The regulations are part of the new US Clean Air Act, and the revision has angered environmentalists, who believe the ethanol-gas mix will create more, rather than less, smog. The regulatory re-write is expected to double the market for ethanol. However, despite election year rhetoric, analysts say the ethanol programme will do nothing to boost maize prices this year, and will pay limited dividends to farmers in the longer term. Last year processors, led by Archer Daniels Midland, based in Decatur, Illinois, turned 378m bushels of maize into about 800m gallons of ethanol and Mr David Miller, head of research at the American Farm Bureau, projects that in ten years ethanol production could expand to consume about 1.2bn bushels of maize a year. But that rise in consumption does not necessarily translate into higher maize prices. Mr Miller estimates that US maize production will continue to rise by 1 or 2 per cent a year over the next decade, increasing the overall annual crop size by almost 2bn bushels. 'Given these assumptions about supply, and estimates of growth in the ethanol market,' Mr. Miller says, 'ethanol demand may just keep pace with production growth.' Since most US maize farmers are compensated for the difference between the market price for maize and the government's Dollars 2.75-a-bushel 'target' price, ethanol production would have to rise far more than the most optimistic projections to boost maize growers' bank accounts. Better positioned to enjoy the ethanol windfall are the Midwestern maize processing companies that generate alcohol from bargain-priced grain. First among these is Archer Daniels Midland, which with its four ethanol plants boasts more than two-thirds of the nation's production capacity. Other agricultural interests have small production facilities, and some, like Cargill, the Minnesota giant, are just entering the business. Archer Daniels Midland is likely to retain its dominant market share, however. Its primary business is processing maize into high fructose syrup, and several of its plants have the capacity to swing production between the two products. The company, and its chairman, Mr Dwayne Andreas, are reported to have given more than Dollars 1m to Republican campaign funds since 1988 in an effort to support Mr Bush's presidency. Observers say the investment will pay off handsomely in profits from the ethanol market expansion that comes from Mr. Bush's regulatory revision. A rarely mentioned aside in the domestic ethanol discussion is that profitable ethanol production depends on a strong export market corn gluten feed, a processing by-product. Each bushel of maize wet milled into ethanol produces 13.5 lb of corn gluten feed. Nearly all is exported into the European Community, where trade barriers bar the import of US maize in any other form. Last year, nearly 2bn lb of US corn gluten feed were shipped to the EC, and that figure is expected to rise as ethanol production expands.</p>

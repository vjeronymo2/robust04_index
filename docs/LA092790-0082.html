			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> RADIO EQUIPMENT OKD  </P> <P> By a 3-1 vote Tuesday, the City Council agreed to spend $342,888 to buy radio  equipment that will permit communication among all city departments.  </P> <P> "I think this is one case where more is better than less," Mayor Nicholas L.  Presecan said, backing a staff proposal to accept bids from Motorola,  Dictaphone and Instant Replay.  </P> <P> The city communications system needs to be refurbished for use in a disaster  such as the Feb. 28 Upland earthquake, city officials said. The current police  radios operate on VHF frequencies incompatible with the UHF frequencies of  community services radios, and most of the equipment is more than 15 years old  and unreliable, they said.  </P> <P> Council member Algird Leiga voted against the project, favoring a proposal to  buy less equipment and save $7,184.  </P></p>

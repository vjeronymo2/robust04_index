			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals volatile in thin trade  -Market report Base metals prices swung in both directions at the London Metal Exchange yesterday, with moderate orders having an exaggerated effect in fairly thin markets. Falls in LME stocks gave the markets a steady start but there was no follow through buying. Three months delivery COPPER reached Dollars 2,965 a tonne after news of a 4,475 tonnes stocks fall but later fell back to Monday's low of Dollars 2,930 before finding support. ALUMINIUM found good support on dips but failed to break resistance above Dollars 1,900 a tonne. London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures bounced from early lows to end higher in healthy volume. The most-active March futures contract was up Pounds 13 on the day at Pounds 989 a tonne and December closed up Pounds 12 at Pounds 1,035. COFFEE prices ended down but off the day's lows in sluggish trade. 'There has been some price-fixed buying that helped lift the market a bit in the afternoon. New York also performed better than some people had expected,' said one trader.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tsang Yok-Sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for </F> the Betterment of Hong Kong; from the "Comment" page: "One-Man  Show Dodges the Truth"]    [Text] During the 2 and 1/2-hour "inquiry" of the Foreign  Affairs Committee (FAC) meeting last week, Mr Michael Sze spoke  only twice, each time with an opening apology that he had only  one point to add to his superior's enunciation. When he opened  his mouth the second time, the "only point" he had to add was:  "The fact that we are here answering your questions speaks  volumes." He said it twice in his succinct little speech of no  more than a few sentences.    The session spoke volumes, indeed, about the way the Hong  Kong Governor is accountable to the British Parliament. In  answering questions he must have been asked dozens of times  before, the Governor made his case uncontested, ridiculing at  will all those who had disagreed with him but were not present  to defend themselves. Governor Patten quoted Sir David  Akers-Jones as saying that the Chinese style was not to rig  elections, but to know the results before they were held. The  room erupted in laughter. No one bothered to question the  accuracy of the quote.    The Governor described statements from Chinese officials as  "irrational", "largely rhetorical" and "devoid of argument".  The FAC took him at his word.    Mr Patten stressed that there were "obviously some limits"  to  what he could say at the moment about the Sino-British election  talks, then safely went on to blame the intransigence and  perfidy of the Chinese side for the breakdown of the talks.    In some questions Mr Patten even managed to display his  magnanimity. He was asked to comment on the speculation that  China was "pouring money into a political party called DAB  [Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]", to which  he answered: "I do not know where (the DAB's) funds come from."  He was invited to give an opinion on China's "so-called  advisers", and he generously said it would help Hong Kong if  those advisers gave good advice to China, hastily adding: "I am  not sure that the advice is always as good and sound as one  might like."    The main thrust of Mr Patten's argument was that the  Sino-British dispute could not be resolved because China did not  want to see fair elections in Hong Kong. "What is at issue is  whether (the 1994/95 electoral) arrangements are fair or  unfair," he said. "That is the nub of the argument."    He told the committee that the Chinese wanted "rotten"  electoral arrangements. As an example he pointed to the  geographical constituencies: "If it is the case that Chinese  officials are arguing in geographical constituencies, for  example, for double- member constituencies with everybody having  one vote, thus ensuring that you would get a very different  result in geographical constituencies from the one that was  obtained last time; if that is what Chinese officials are  arguing for, and if Chinese officials will not give up on that,  does one just surrender the point? Does one put in place  electoral arrangements which secure halving the number of  pro-democracy politicians that can be elected through  geographical constituencies?"    A very interesting piece of logic. Let us put aside the  obvious question of how a double-seat single-vote system, and  for that matter any electoral system based on universal  franchise, could selectively penalise a particular category of  politicians. Why would "a very different result...from the one  that was obtained last time" be unacceptable to Mr Patten? Does  he already have a preconception about how many of those whom he  calls "pro-democracy politicians" should be elected? So who is  talking about knowing the result before the elections now? In  his eagerness to expose the rottenness of the Chinese side. Mr  Patten ran into yet another self contradiction. If, as he  claimed, the British and the Chinese sides were each insisting  on a different electoral system for the Legco [Legislative  Council] geographical constituencies in 1995. How could the  British call it a "non-contentious" issue, and blame the Chinese  for refusing to include it in a first-stage agreement? These  inconsistencies, and many others, stood out blatantly in Mr  Patten's allegations. The FAC overlooked them all, deliberately  or otherwise. The local English press called it a "grilling".  It was more like Chris Patten's one-man show. As such it was  painstakingly planned and superbly performed, one must admit,  realising there was never any intention to seek truth from facts.</p>

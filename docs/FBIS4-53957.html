			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagoya, May 23 KYODO -- A trade union formed by  workers of Toyota Motor Corp. and affiliates proposed Monday [23  May] that the consumption tax be raised to 5.0 percent from the  present 3.0 percent in fiscal 1996 in exchange for efforts to  bring down prices through deregulation.    The 276,000-member Federation of All Toyota Workers' Unions  said it will distribute the proposal to legislators of ruling  coalition parties and others, starting in early June.    The federation said the present tax system forces workers to  carry a heavy tax burden because of high income tax rates. It  said the unfair tax system should be corrected through  continuous income tax cuts and a raise in the consumption tax to  5.0 percent from fiscal 1996. The federation said an additional  consumption tax hike would be necessary from the year 2000 in  view of the fast growing population of the aged. It said  consumer prices can be brought down by about 9.2 percent through  abolition and relaxation of excessive regulations and price  controls. The federation also called for an easing of  regulations on regular safety inspections of vehicles.</p>

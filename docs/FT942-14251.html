			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Freezers of the frozen north - Norfrost / James Buxton examines five companies which are leading Scotland's export drive Norfrost is unusual not only for succeeding in an industry in which the UK is not a substantial player, but for doing so from one of the most remote locations in Britain - Caithness. It makes chest freezers and coolers, which are used predominantly in shops and businesses, as well as in private homes. Last year its turnover was Pounds 24m, of which two-thirds was exported. Seven years ago exports accounted for only eight per cent of much lower sales. Norfrost, a private company, says it exports to 80 countries, but entered 24 of them for the first time last year. Norfrost is the creation of Mrs Pat Grant and her husband Alex who established it in 1972. She supplies the entrepreneurial drive and he the technical expertise which enables Norfrost to produce successful designs at economic prices. The company, which employs about 300 people, concentrates on only one basic product which is assembled on a large production line. Its freezers and coolers are basically the same: the only difference between them is in the type of thermostatic controller. Norfrost has major customers on its books. It supplies Coca-Cola with coolers which the drinks company provides to retailers. It also sells to manufacturers such as Zanussi and Hitachi which sell the machines under their own labels. Its largest markets are the US and France, as well as Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and eastern Europe. After completing a three year Pounds 8m factory extension last year, Mrs Grant announced further expansion plans which would create a minimum of 120 new jobs within the next two-and-a-half years. She hopes to employ 1,000 people by the end of the decade. Mrs Grant's achievements have already been honoured by the Businesswoman of the Year award 1988 and the Women Mean Business Award. Part of Norfrost's achievement is in brushing off the disadvantages of its remote location. It does this through vertical integration: it makes its own production tools, carries out its own maintenance and has its injection moulding company. To ensure that its trucks return fully laden, it provides a haulage service for other businesses in Caithness.</p>

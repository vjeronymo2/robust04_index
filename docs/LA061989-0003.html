State radio did not say how many were involved or how they planned to  overthrow the elected government of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi. Meanwhile,  2,000 people calling for a return to military rule demonstrated in central  Khartoum, the capital. Sudanese authorities said last December that they had  foiled a coup attempt by ex-army officers and civilians who had served under  Numeiri, who has lived in Egypt since being ousted in a 1985 coup.  </P></p>

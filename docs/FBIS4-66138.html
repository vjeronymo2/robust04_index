			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Craxi Will Return, Attorney Says"] </F>   [Text] (ANSA) Milan, May 18 -- Former Italian Socialist  Party leader Bettino Craxi, who has been ordered to surrender  his passport and other travel papers, will turn in these  documents to the justice department here as soon as he is  physically capable of doing so, his attorney, Salvatore Lo  Giudice, said here on Wednesday [18 May].    Yesterday, Craxi sent a medical certificate from a Tunisian  doctor, by fax, to the justice department which stated that the  former premier was undergoing treatment for diabetes and thus  could not leave his holiday home on the Tunisian coast, in  Hammamet.    Lo Giudici went to the justice department today to  illustrate  his client's position and later told the press "the justice  department has put no ultimatum for Craxi to turn in his  passport given that this is an executive measure."    Craxi's attorney then added how "the health of my client is  my concern at the moment. Besides, Mr. Craxi has always  demonstrated the utmost readiness to collaborate and as soon as  he has resolved his health problems he will be at the  disposition of the justice department here."    The magistrates handling the preliminary investigation into  Craxi's alleged wrong-doings also confirmed how no further  measures would, at present, be adopted against Craxi. "There's  no rush" said Maurizio Grigo who also made it clear they were  waiting for some signal of intent from Craxi's retreat in  Hammamet.    In the meantime, the magistrates were said to be examining  the various bilateral agreements between Italy and Tunisia  should it become necessary to seek Craxi's extradition in the  event he stay abroad to avoid arrest.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zong Shu (1350 2885): "Various Chinese-Produced </F> Air Defense and Anti-Ship Missiles"]    [Text] Air Defense Master    The HQ-2B ground-to-air missile is a Chinese-developed high  speed, high efficiency, all-weather, omni-bearing combat,  mobile, intermediate altitude and high altitude air defense  weapon. This missile makes wide use of modern technology. It  possesses not only the head-on attack capability common to  ground-to-air missiles, but flank attack, and stern-chase attack  capabilities as well.    Modern offensive air weapons frequently emit all kinds of  jamming, and they maneuver in flight as a defense against  ground-to-air missiles. Thus, ground-to-air missiles must  possess strong ability to resist jamming, a large battle sky,  and flexible ground mobility in order to attack various types of  mobile targets, and they must have fairly high survivability.  The HQ-2B missile is highly resistant to jamming; it is able to  attack targets moving at a wide range of speeds, has a large  battle sky, and a high kill probability; it is very able to  attack moving targets; and all of its weapons systems and parts  make wide use of digital circuits. Its command and control  systems are computer-controlled. Therefore, this missile meets  the requirements of modern air-defense.    The HQ-2B missile is used mostly to defend important areas.  It may be used alone or as part of a weapons system group, one  group linked to another for large area echelon defense.  Alternatively, several weapons systems may form a circular  defense against a single target.    This missile is used primarily to attack bombers, fighter  bombers, fighters, reconnaissance aircraft, and helicopters. It  may also be used to attack air-to-ground missiles. It may attack  either single targets or groups of targets. It may attack high  speed targets or low speed targets. The HQ-2B missile attacks  aerial targets flying at high speeds and at a range of  altitudes. Missiles such as this one can be counted on the  fingers. The maximum combat altitude of this air defense missile  is 27 kilometers, and its minimum combat altitude is 1  kilometer. Its maximum combat slant distance is 40 km, and its  minimum slant distance is seven kilometers. The missile's  maximum flight velocity is 1,250 meters per second. This means  that the velocity of the target being attacked may not exceed  750 meters per second. The single missile kill rate probability  for this missile is no less than 0.92. Against targets whose  velocity is not greater than 750 meters per second, the single  missile kill rate probability is no less than 0.73.    Inasmuch as the HQ-2B is an omni-directional, ground-to-air  missile that can make flank attacks or stern-chase attacks, it  can attack anti-missile moving targets and turning attack  targets. This is where this missile is superior. The HQ-2B  missile's combat altitude is the maximum flight altitude of  modern aircraft; its combat slant range can be maintained within  the combat altitude range; and its kill area is sufficiently  deep. Thus, it can effectively kill intruding aerial targets.  This range of speeds at which this missile can attack targets  covers all the range of speeds of modern aircraft. A certain  kill probability against high speed targets is another special  feature of this missile.    The HQ-2B missile weapons system is made up of missiles, a  guidance station, and launch equipment. The layout of a basic  firepower unit is as follows: 12 missiles, one guidance station,  and launch equipment (made up of 12 mobile launch vehicles and  one launch control vehicle). Guidance is provided by connecting  the main flight level with the booster level, using a  fuze-warhead having strong killing power. Its anti-jamming phase  comparison fuse can adjust the time of detonation of the warhead  by comparing the relative speed of the target and the missile,  so that the warhead explodes when the target is in the best  location to be killed. Large shrapnel type warheads have a high  dispersion speed and high armor penetration capabilities that  insure that any target that is attacked is killed. The guidance  station employs an anti-jamming digital code command  transmission for signal transmission. The missile carries a  corresponding anti-jamming digitally coded radio-control device.  Consequently, signal transmission is accurate and reliable, and  anti-jamming capability is strong.    Since the weapons system has guided missiles that use employ  various guidance patterns, in each salvo (1 to 3 missiles) of a  running launch (or cluster launch), a different guidance pattern  may be used to guide the missiles. This makes it possible to  attack high speed targets, mobile targets, targets with on-board  jammers, and low altitude targets. The HQ-2B mobile launch truck  is self-propelled tracked vehicle that can both launch and  transport missiles.    Patriotic "Smart Kid"    The HN-5C is a Chinese-developed short-range mobile air  defense missile system that is used mostly to deal with the  threat from sub-sonic, low flying, fighter aircraft and armed  helicopters. It is a spot defense system all of whose combat  equipment is loaded on one light cross-country vehicle. It is  very mobile; thus, it can be rapidly deployed as needed to any  combat zone.    This missile system is composed of guided missiles, complete  optical target detection and tracking sensors, a turret, a fire  control computer and launch control electronic equipment, a  missile launch rack, a power supply system, and radio data  transmission, position finding, and direction detection  equipment. All combat equipment in the firepower unit (including  two operators and several missiles) are loaded on a single light  cross-country truck that can travel at 60 kilometers per hour on  a highway, and 30 kilometers per hour on a dirt road.    The complete optical target detection and tracking sensor  units consists of an infra-red ray angle tracker, a television  controller, and a laser range finder. The function of the  infra-red angle tacker is to track the direction of the target  indicator to find and lock on to the target, and then switch to  automatic tracking to guide the missile's target-seeker to lock  on and track the target. The television controller employs a  double field of vision working mode. When it seeks and finds a  target, it uses a wide field of vision, then it brings the  target into the field of vision of the infra-red ray goniometer  until the infra-red ray goniometer locks on to the target. The  laser range finder is used to measure the distance between the  target and the firepower unit in order to calculate accurately  the aiming lead required for the missile launch and to judge  launch conditions.    The turret is what carries the missile launch box and the  target detection and tracking sensor unit. It has three working  modes, namely initial switching, lock following, and lead  switching, depending on the signals from the fire control  computer and the target detection and tracking sensor. It  operates in 360 degrees, its elevation angle is from 2 to 85  degrees, its angular velocity is 0.25-50 degrees per second, and  its tracking precision is as little as 4 meters.    The fire control computer is the key piece of equipment in  the missile weapons system's automated combat control. It has  multiple functions such as producing target detection, tracking,  and laser range finder launch synchronous pulse control  commands. It also issues commands to power up the missile, to  lock and unlock the missile's target-seeking device, and to  launch the missile.    The HN-5C missile employs a passive working mode, which  greatly reduces the probability of enemy aircraft detection. It  has good concealment characteristics. Its target detection range  is 7 kilometers, system response time is short, and combat  efficiency is high. It may be used on various kinds of trucks,  and it can be rapidly deployed. It can be used in night combat.    Plans call for the use of a wheeled armored vehicle to  transport the HN-5C, and the use of an infra-red ray detector.  This will permit the missile to not only do stern-chase  attacking, but it will also have a forward attack capability.    Aerial Harpoon    The Chinese-developed C601 is an air-to-ship tactical  missile  weapons system. It is slung beneath the wings of the Hong 6D  medium range bomber for use against large and medium size  surface ships that enter coastal waters.    This weapons system is made up of C601 guided missiles,  on-board aiming and launching equipment, and ground technical  support equipment. C601 missiles may be launched from an  altitude of 1,000 - 9,000 meters, and the combat radius of the  Hong 6Ds that carry them is between 1,800 and 2,000 kilometers.  Thus, a C601 missile weapons system can control a very large  ocean area. The maximum effective range of a C601 missile is  between 100 and 110 kilometers; the maximum powered flight  distance is 150 kilometers; and the launch sector angle is plus  or minus 12 degrees. Once the missile is launched, no control is  needed. This means that once launched, the carrier aircraft can  leave the combat zone at once or carry out follow-up missions.  Not only does this protect the aircraft, but it also improves  its combat capabilities. When the C601 missile is cruising in  level flight, its altitude may be 50, 70, or 100 meters above  the water, and its causing speed is 0.9 times the speed of  sound. This missile's outstanding points are a long period of  independent flight, good concealment, and low altitude  penetration. Its homing target hit probability rate is greater  than 90 percent. This missile's warhead carries a large charge,  is powerful, and it has a shaped charge that can pierce armor,  explode, and fragment. Single or multiple missiles may be  launched. A single missile is enough to seriously damage or  sink a 3,000 ton class or above destroyer or a 10,000 ton class  transport. Since a monopulse active radar is used in missile's  terminal guidance, it is able to resist the waves and all kinds  of jamming.    The C-601 is a cruise missile composed of a body, a control  and guidance system, a power system, an electrical system, and a  warhead. The missile is 7.36 meters long, and its launch weight  is 2,440 kilograms. The missile is a symmetrical, normal type,  aerodynamic, high subsonic speed flight vehicle that employs a  post-launch independently controlled and terminal stage  automatic homing guidance system. The onboard terminal homing  radar provides target information about flight direction and  pitch to guide the missile to the target following preset homing  instructions. The power system consists of a liquid fuel rocket  engine and an oxidizing agent blow-off system. The warhead  contains a high energy mixed charge. Its front end is a  hemispherical, metal, shaped-charge cover. Following ignition, a  high temperature metallic jet flow occurs that can penetrate up  to one meter thick armor plate.    This missile's weapons system works in combat in the  following way: After the on-board aiming and launching equipment  sets the firing data parameters for the C-601 missile, the  missile is fired from the aircraft. During this period, the  missile goes into an unpowered glide. When the missile reaches  850 meters above the sea, the engine ignites causing the missile  to pick up speed. When the missile glides to 500 meters above  the sea, it shifts to ultra-low altitude, constant velocity,  cruising flight. When the missile comes within the set firing  range, the on-board Doppler homing radar shuts off, and the  active terminal homing radar switches on to seek, lock on, and  track the target. At this time, the missile's homing system  automatically switches to the self-guidance mode to guide the  missile in a dive toward the target. When the missile crashes  into the target, the fuze detonates the warhead to destroy the  target.    The C-601 missile formed the basis for research and  development of the C-611 air-to-ship missile whose range has  increased to 200 kilometers.    Anti-Ship Star    The C-101 is a supersonic, super low level tactical  anti-ship  missile developed in China. This missile may be carried on both  aircraft and ships for use mostly against large and medium size  surface targets in the destroyer class or above. The C-101  missile weapons system consists of missiles, a carrier fire  control system, launch equipment, and a ground system. It is at  the advanced level of the 1990s. Its ability to cruise at  supersonic speed just above the waves is one of its important  features.    The C-101 missile cruises above the waves at an altitude of  50 meters. When it is about 3,000 meters away from a target, the  missile dives to an altitude of five meters to hit the target.  This gives the missile concealability and enables it to hit the  target near its water line. This missile maintains a supersonic  flying speed that is two times the speed of sound when in flight  against a target. Its concealability and speed means that the  C-101 missile has very high penetration ability. In a diving  attack 3,000 meters away from a target, the sudden maneuvering  of the missile just at the point where an enemy anti-missile  weapon might attack it greatly reduces the probability that the  enemy will be able to stop it. Since the missile's homing  system uses a monopulse terminal homing radar, and since it is  able to skim the waves at supersonic speed, its anti-jamming  capability is strong.    This missile weapons system has a fairly high hit  probability  rate and destruction rate. The C-101 missile uses a supersonic  high energy, semi-armor piercing, explosive warhead, and a time  delay contact fuse. The warhead weighs 300 kilograms, making it  larger that the warhead on similar foreign anti-ship missiles.  Once launched, the missile flies entirely independently, that  is, it flies unattended after launch. During its independent  control stage, it relies on the on-board control system for  flight control. During the self-homing stage, it relies on the  on-board terminal homing radar and the automatic tracking radar.  This permits the aircraft that carried the missile to return to  base at once following launch, or to carry out other missions.    The C-101 missile's aerodynamic shape is a canard layout in  which two liquid fuel ram engines are symmetrically connected  front and back to both sides of the missile. The missile body  consists of a radar compartment and a warhead compartment. The  missile employs an automatic pilot system that ensures that the  missile flies at a pre-set altitude during the self-control  stage. During the homing stage, the missile automatically tracks  the target on the basis of control signals that the receiving  radar emits. The terminal homing radar is located in the radar  compartment. It is used to detect, lock on, and track ocean  surface targets, and it sends corresponding control signals to  the automatic pilot to effect automatic homing. Since the  missile employs a supersonic, high energy, semi-armor piercing  explosive warhead, it relies on the enormous kinetic energy that  the missile's high velocity generates to penetrate the armor and  explode inside the ship to produce huge casualties. The on-board  time delay contact fuze effectively controls the explosion of  the warhead inside the enemy ship.    The C-101 weapons's system works in combat as follows: Once  the on-board missile attack radar discovers a target, it  conducts a target identification to select the target to be  attacked. After tracking the target, the targets movement  parameters are calculated and sent in real time to the missile's  director. The director plots the firing data. Next, combat  parameters and instructions are set in the missile, after which  a pre-launch test of the missile is made and the missile launch  controlled (either a single or multiple missiles may be  launched). After launch, the missile climbs to a pre-set  altitude, glides, and enters level flight according to a pre-set  procedures. During this process, the missile is accelerated to  1.8 times the speed of sound by a solid rocket booster. After  the booster falls away, a liquid fuel ram engine takes over to  make the missile cruise steadily at two times the speed of  sound. When the missile reaches a pre-set automatically  controlled flight time, its on-board automatic pilot system  switches to pre-programmed level flight, bringing to an end the  automatically controlled flight stage. At this time, the  on-board radar switches on to seek and track the target. After  locking on the target, it goes into lateral and planar tracking  of the target. A radio altimeter controls the missile's descent  to an altitude of five meters to attack the target. When the  missile contacts the target, the fuze begins to work. The  warhead explodes after entering the ship near its water line to  destroy the target.    Flight tests show the C-101 missile to be at the level of  the  fourth generation anti-ship missiles of the 1990s.    The foregoing is only a taste of China's several air defense  and anti-ship missiles. The materials used in them are good and  expensive, and they ave attracted the interest of all countries  in international defense exhibitions.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Relief on payments I TOOK voluntary early retirement from teaching four years ago and get a pension. Since then, I have worked for employers and also as a self-employed tutor. If I take out a personal pension plan and pay 30 per cent of my earnings into it, am I entitled to income tax relief on these payments even though I am already receiving the teacher's pension? Before taking early retirement, I was paying an extra 1 per cent into the teachers' superannuation fund to 'buy in' extra years of service for a widow's pension. I would have paid this extra 1 per cent until age-65 if I had continued teaching. On retirement, I paid a lump sum of Pounds 3,000-plus to cover the years which I am not now paying. Am I entitled to income tax relief on this payment? The amount of contributions you can pay to a personal pension policy depend on your age and taxable earnings in the year in which you pay such contributions, and are not affected by pensions in payment or pension rights from earlier schemes. With regard to the lump sum of Pounds 3,000 that you paid to the teachers' scheme at retirement in order to complete the purchase of added years, our understanding is that such lump sum payments (as opposed to annual contributions that - together with your normal scheme contributions - did not exceed 15 per cent of taxable earnings) would not be eligible for tax relief. To check the category into which your payment fell, and the amount of any contributions that may be tax-deductible, you should write to the Teachers' Pensions Agency, Mowden Hall, Darlington DL9 9EE, quoting any reference numbers that you have in respect of the pension you are now receiving. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these colummns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

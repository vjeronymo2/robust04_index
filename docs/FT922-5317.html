			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: SEC to ease rules for asset-backed offerings US companies may soon find it easier to issue asset-backed securities under a rule change proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US securities industry watchdog. The SEC plans to ease regulations for asset-backed securities offerings by exempting issuers of the debt from provisions of the Investment Company Act, which regulates mutual funds in the US. The SEC's latest proposal is part of its more general review of the 1940 act, which covers investment management regulation in the US. The SEC has been considering overhauling the rules governing the mutual fund industry for about two years. Although the number of asset-backed offerings has risen sharply recently, the SEC believes the development of some types of asset-backed deals has been constrained by a requirement that the offerings be registered as mutual funds. The latest proposal, which has been put out for public comment for 60 days, would free asset-backed offerings that meet some criteria from the SEC's mutual-fund rules. One of the requirements is that the securities receive above investment-grade ratings by at least two rating agencies. At present, the three largest types of asset-backed offerings - auto loan-backed, mortgage-backed and some credit card receivables - are already exempt from the mutual fund rules.</p>

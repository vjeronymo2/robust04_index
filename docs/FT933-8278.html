			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Peugeot ends production of 405 in Britain PEUGEOT-TALBOT, the UK subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, is ending production of the Peugeot 405 large family car at its assembly plant at Ryton, Coventry because of falling new car sales in continental Europe. Production at Ryton is to be limited to one model, the Peugeot 306 small family car. Total output at the plant is being reduced to about 1,600 a week from the level earlier in the year of 1,900 a week. About 300 jobs are being cut from the workforce of 5,280 (excluding the group's Robins and Day retail dealerships). The ending of 405 production in the UK is a big setback for the Ryton plant, which only resumed production of two car ranges in January with the launch of the Peugeot 306. The Peugeot group is cutting production at Ryton as part of its overall reduction in output across its European plants in response to the sharp decline in west European new car sales this year. New-car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 17.7 per cent in the first seven months of the year, while sales in France, where Peugeot's market share is being seriously eroded, have fallen by 17.1 per cent. Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is also cutting output at its two UK assembly plants in response to the fall in European sales. Production of the Vauxhall Cavalier/Opel Vectra at its plant at Luton, Bedfordshire is being stopped this week with the loss of nine shifts while night-shift production of the Vauxhall/Opel Astra at its plant at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, is also being eliminated this week with the loss of four shifts. A further three shifts will be eliminated at the Luton plant later this month. In the first eight months of the year Vauxhall will have cut 60 production shifts at the Luton plant and 10 at Ellesmere Port. Vauxhall vehicle output rose by 15.3 per cent last year to a record 301,857. In the first seven months of this year it has fallen 11.1 per cent to 161,792 from 181,919 in the same period the year before. Output of the Cavalier/Vectra fell by 22 per cent in the first six months to 70,681. Ford, the biggest UK vehicle maker, which had already cut capacity across its European assembly plants late last year, has also been forced to implement a limited amount of short-time working. Production at its Southampton Transit van plant was halted yesterday with the loss of two shifts, although normal output will be resumed today. In the first eight months of the year Ford has cut 22 shifts at the Southampton van plant, 24 shifts at the Halewood, Merseyside assembly plant which produces the Escort/Orion range and five at the Fiesta small-car assembly plant in Dagenham, east London.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Wace incurs losses of Pounds 24m after provisions SUBSTANTIAL property write-downs and restructuring provisions caused Wace, the UK-based pre-press and specialist printing group, to report a pre-tax loss of Pounds 28.4m for the 1992 year and pass its final dividend. However, Wace surprised the market by deciding to retain its US subsidiary, after stating last December that it would be offered for sale at about Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m). The group also decided against writing down the value of its industrial properties, reducing the Pounds 37m provision it identified in December by Pounds 12m. The results were presented by Mr Trevor Grice, who took over as chief executive in November - nine months after the sudden departure of his predecessor, Mr John Clegg. The DTI has still not published its investigation into share dealings conducted in the name of some of Mr Clegg's relatives, but Wace again emphasised that the inquiry had no connection with the group. Mr Grice said that when he arrived, it was planned that Wace should sell both its US operation - which accounted for nearly half the group's operating profit last year - and the UK labels business to reduce the group's gearing level, which currently stands at nearly 200 per cent. The new chief executive quickly decided not to sell the labels business and also won the agreement of the group's lenders not to sell the US business, both of which disposals would have diluted earnings. He said: 'The US operation is a very good business - it would have broken my heart to sell it.' Mr Grice said that the Pounds 37m property write-down flagged in December was a 'worst-case' position, following a revaluation of the group's properties in November. The group had proceeded with the write-down of its investment property from Pounds 28m to Pounds 8.7m, and made Pounds 5m provision to cover the disposal of vacant leaseholds. However, after discussing the issue with his property advisers and auditors, Mr Grice said the group had decided not to write down the value of the property owned and occupied by the group by Pounds 11.3m, as it considered no permanent diminution in value had occurred. Sales grew from Pounds 308.6m to Pounds 321m in the year to December 31, and the pre-tax loss of Pounds 28.4m compared with profits of Pounds 9.8m. The group also made a provision of Pounds 4.1m to cover redundancy and reorganisation costs. A total of 211 jobs have been shed since November, reducing the workforce to 4,840. Losses per share of 44p compared with earnings of 1.4p. Mr Frans ten Bos, chairman, said it would be imprudent to forecast increased activity in the group's main markets, but added: 'We are cautiously optimistic that we will record a marked improvement in our trading performance in 1993.' COMMENT Reversing the decision to sell the group's US subsidiary was unexpected, but looks positive. Wace insists it could have achieved its target price of Dollars 100m, but was able to persuade the group's lenders that it makes more sense to keep a profits earner which should benefit quickly from recovery. Analysts forecast full-year profits of Pounds 15m, which puts the shares, down 2p to 90p yesterday, on a very modest prospective multiple of about 10. The new chief executive has cut costs and insists the underlying business is sound. Assuming no more nasty surprises lie in store, the shares could bounce back rapidly as advertising markets recover.</p>

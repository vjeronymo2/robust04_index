			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORKERS READY TO TACKLE TASK OF COUNTING HOMELESS  </P> <P> Brian, Doris, Gwen and J. C. go to work for the federal government today,  taking part in the nation's most ambitious effort to count people like  themselves: the homeless.  </P> <P> Beginning at dusk today and working through dawn Wednesday, U.S. Census Bureau  officials and homeless people hired especially for the effort will canvas the  nation's skid rows and remote corners, seeking to count that legion of citizens  who spend their nights in shelters and subway tunnels, flophouses and movie  theaters, beaches, canyons and cardboard boxes.  </P> <P> The homeless count also marks the start of the 1990 national census for most of  the country. Americans will begin receiving census forms in the mail late this  week. The process of counting an estimated 250 million people will last through  the summer as the Census Bureau attempts to visit every household that does not  return a census form.  </P> <P> For the enumeration of the homeless, the Census Bureau has been recruiting an  army of street people, offering them $7.50 an hour and the hope of longer  employment if they do a good job.  </P> <P> If the Census Bureau meets its hiring goal, there will be 15,000 people --  3,000 of them in California -- knocking on shelter doors, peering down alleys,  looking under bridges and waiting outside abandoned buildings for occupants to  emerge at dawn Wednesday. The census takers will interview people who are in a  mood to answer questions about themselves and merely note the presence of those  who don't want to talk or who are asleep.  </P> <P> In Orange County, about 300 "enumerators" will fan out across the county to  tally the homeless. Outfitted in white vests that say "Census Taker" on the  back, they will check scores of shelters as well as all the usual gathering  spots, poking their flashlights under freeway overpasses, trolling along  railroad tracks and hiking into the rural outback where migrant fieldworkers  sometimes camp.  </P> <P> "We're going to put everything we can into making the count as accurate as  possible," said Susan Oakson, coordinator for the Orange County Homeless Issues  Task Force, which is helping the U.S. Census Bureau in the effort. "But it's  clear there will be thousands of people missed. The homeless are the targets of  harassment and violent crimes, so they try to be as invisible as possible. That  will affect the results."  </P> <P> While fewer than a dozen homeless people have been tapped to help with the  count in Orange County, census officials in Los Angeles have been more  successful in finding people down on their luck to help with the tally. Census  Bureau officials decided to hire the homeless in an effort to build an  effective bridge to the population they will attempt to count.  </P> <P> Brian, Doris, Gwen and J. C. -- they didn't want to reveal their last names --  will be among about 300 census takers in Los Angeles working their way through  Skid Row, the neighborhood that has been their home. The four are, by turns,  optimistic and apprehensive about the prospect of interviewing their neighbors.  </P> <P> "People are going to talk to us because we are already down there and they know  us," said Gwen, a slim, middle-aged woman who said she lives on county relief  payments and currently resides in a welfare hotel.  </P> <P> Gwen and the others will be taking part in the post-midnight phase of the  homeless census. Between 6 and 10 p.m., other census takers will be visiting  shelters and hotels. After midnight, teams of enumerators will seek out people  who live outdoors.  </P> <P> As for the potential for danger, Gwen said: "I don't know how it could be more  dangerous than day-to-day living."  </P> <P> But there are places where the three women in the group -- Gwen, Doris and J.  C. -- said they would not go to count people.  </P> <P> "Crocker is a major dope street. So you don't want to be there," Gwen said.  </P> <P> "I won't go on Crocker and I won't go to MacArthur Park," said Doris.  </P> <P> Most experts agree that there probably never has been anything approaching a  definitive count of homeless people in America. Estimates have ranged from a  few hundred thousand to 3 million or more.  </P> <P> Orange County has an estimated 10,000 homeless, Oakson said. In Los Angeles,  Bob Vilmur, the city's homeless projects coordinator, estimates that there are  35,000 people living in shelters, cheap hotels, other temporary quarters or on  the street. The most recent study of the city's Skid Row population, completed  in 1987 by the Community Redevelopment Agency, reported that barely 1,000  people slept on the streets.  </P> <P> Moreover, there are disagreements over the definition of homeless -- whether it  should include people who are living temporarily with friends or relatives, or  whether it should be limited to people who abide in shelters or on the streets.  </P> <P> Many of Orange County's homeless, for example, are believed to camp in their  cars or spend periods in inexpensive motels, Oakson said. When the money runs  out, they return to a life without a roof over their heads.  </P> <P> "They might spend two days with a family friend, two days on the street, then  two days in a car," Oakson said. "It cyclical."  </P> <P> In its tally of the homeless, the Census Bureau will not include people in  jails or halfway houses or those who are doubled up with friends and family.  Such people will be counted but as part of the general populace.  </P> <P> "What we're going to get is a head count of street people and of people in  shelters," said Peter Bounpane, assistant director of the Census Bureau.  </P> <P> "The count will be as good as the assistance we get," Bounpane said.  </P> <P> Doubts about the accuracy of the homeless census have led some homeless  advocates, most notably Mitch Snyder of the Washington-based Community for  Creative Non-Violence, to urge homeless people to boycott the census. Snyder  argues that an undercount of homeless people will serve the needs of  politicians who oppose spending more money on housing for the poor.  </P> <P> Members of Snyder's organization have burned census forms, and Snyder has said  his group plans to block census takers from entering some shelters.  </P> <P> Orange County homeless advocates have generally cooperated in the survey but  understand the limitations.  </P> <P> "It's a concern that these numbers will be used as the ultimate figure for the  homeless," Oakson said. "These numbers need to be balanced with a lot of other  factors."  </P> <P> At a census training session Monday in Los Angeles, where Gwen and her friends  received their marching orders, most of the 12 trainees said they did not think  the census would yield a complete count of homeless people.  </P> <P> "I doubt they will find everyone," Brian said. "There are more homeless people  than anyone ever imagined."  </P> <P> "I know what I'd say if some stranger came up to me and started to ask me a  bunch of questions," Gwen said. "I'd tell 'em to go to hell."  </P> <P> Yet they vowed to do their best.  </P> <P> "How else are we going to get enough money for housing if we don't know how  many people there are that need it?" asked Doris. "If the count is not right,  we're going to lose on all levels -- jobs, medical, everything."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Eric Bailey and Jill Stewart and Times researcher Tracy  Thomas contributed to this story.  </P></p>

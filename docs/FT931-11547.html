			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Accounting change leads to Dollars 20.8bn charge for GM GENERAL Motors, the struggling US carmaker, announced last night that it would take a Dollars 20.8bn after-tax charge to comply with a new standard of accounting for the post-retirement health benefits of employees. The company also announced it would be taking a much larger-than-expected fourth-quarter charge relating to its plan to sell a significant proportion of its stake in National Car Rental Systems. This is now expected to work through at Dollars 744m after tax. The company previously suggested a Dollars 300m charge might be necessary. It said the increase related primarily to the write-off of goodwill on NCRS' books. All US companies have to adopt the new accounting standard, but GM's charge is expected to be by far the biggest of any corporation, because of both the company's size and the age profile of its workforce. GM stressed that the charge - which works through at Dollars 33.38 a share, and will be applied retroactively to January last year - is a non-cash item which will not affect the company's cash flow or ability to pay dividends. However, it will cause a major dent in the equity on the company's balance sheet. The accounting standard, FASB 106, involves changing from a system of recognising the cost of retiree health benefits when the money is paid out, to a system of recognising the expense when the obligation is incurred. Companies could choose either take a charge for catching up on past obligations in one go, as GM has done, or amortise the cost over 20 years. Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer, said GM had decided on a one-time charge. Companies also have an additional ongoing annual charge, which GM said would amount to Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 2.05 a share, in 1992. The size of the charge was no surprise to Wall Street, since GM had signalled that it faced an obligation of roughly this size. The only question was whether it would take it in one go, or over 20 years. Mr Wagoner said GM continued to be encouraged by recent trends in its loss-making North American operations and continued to aim for break-even there in 1993 before interest, tax and FASB 106 expenses. GM yesterday also elected two new non-executive board members: Dr Louis Sullivan, president of the Morehouse college school of medicine who was health secretary under President Bush; and Mr John Bryan, chairman of foods group Sara Lee.</p>

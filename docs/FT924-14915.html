			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices performed strongly on the LME's afternoon kerb, ending firm and pulling other depressed metals off their lows, dealers said. The upturn in copper was technically motivated, following several sessions of plunging prices. However dealers say the fundamental weakness of the base metal sector, namely sluggish global economic prospects, will restrict the extent of rallies. NICKEL closed steady, partly aided by Inco's moves to reduce 1993 production by some 18,000 tonnes. But for the market to sustain a rally other producers need to follow suit, dealers said. New York's arabica COFFEE futures were broadly higher at midday on technical factors and uncertainty over future shipments from Brazil. 'The situation in Brazil is worsening. Their internal market remains strong, and every indication points to exports in September being lower than in August,' said a dealer. London robusta coffee rallied in late trade and closed at the day's highs in most positions. GOLD held steady on the London bullion market, with US funds apparently holding their positions against the background of recent volatility in currency and equity markets. Compiled from Reuters</p>

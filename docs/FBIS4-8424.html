			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Kulin, parliamentary group leader of </F> the Hungarian Democratic Forum, Laszlo Kover, parliamentary  group leader of the Federation of Young Democrats, and Zoltan  Gal, parliamentary group leader of the Hungarian Socialist  Party, by Gabriel Oszy-Toth in Budapest; date not given: "There  Is No Alternative to Western Orientation -- Ferenc Kulin, Laszlo  Kover, and Zoltan Gal at the MAGYAR NEMZET Roundtable"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Oszy-Toth] When you talk  about joining Europe, do you also mean NATO membership?    [Kulin] Economic integration and adjustment to the European  Union's [EU] legal system are the primary tasks, and NATO  membership and the establishment of a joint defense system may  be a consequence of these.    [Gal] For us, the question is how to join Europe because it  is clear that we have to join. It is impossible not to join.  [passage omitted] Joining Europe is concomitant with the  acceptance of a certain value system, our Hungarianness has to  be adjusted to certain forms of behavior. Fortunately, a  process of decentralization has started in Europe, the regions  and links within the regions are playing an increasingly  important role. This kind of integration ensures that national  characteristics will not disappear. The most important question  of European membership is how we can integrate ourselves with  the least amount of sacrifices and making the most of the  advantages. [passage omitted]    [Kover] I also believe that there is no alternative to  Western integration and orientation. Neither isolation -- which  is advocated by some extremist parties -- nor Eastern  orientation are feasible ways. In my view, NATO membership is  not primarily justified by security policy arguments in the  narrow sense of the word. It is not because we have anything to  fear either from the Romanians or the Serbs that we should join  as soon as possible, rather, because NATO membership is a  guarantee for investors of the developed Western world.    [Gal] I agree that NATO membership would be a kind of  guarantee, at the same time, Hungary's security also depends on  the size of foreign interest in our economy. Gaining membership  in the EU will be a long process, therefore, it would be  worthwhile to consider whether political and economic membership  could be separated from the point of view of scheduling. The  political institutions have a greater willingness to accept us.  [passage omitted]    [Oszy-Toth] The leading politicians of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] are talking about the danger of left-wing  restoration while the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] is  advocating democratic socialism. Can Zoltan Gal tell us the  difference between the so-called democratic socialism and the  already known versions (existing, flourishing, and so on) of  socialism. Is restoration really possible?    [Gal] At the most, threatening with the danger of  restoration can only achieve momentary successes at our  opponents' campaign meetings, but no serious political force can  believe that this could happen in Hungary. We are part of and  we endure world economic processes that we cannot much  influence. People who want restoration here are simply fools.  [passage omitted]    Democratic socialism is not an emphatic part of our written  program, however, it has turned into a campaign issue because  our political opponents have mentioned it so many times. The  chairman of the Socialist International spoke about this during  his recent visit to Hungary. The MSZP is part of this world  movement, its politics are in accordance with this. We  naturally represent the ideas of democratic socialism. In our  view, democratic socialism means some kind of critical attitude  to all that we call capitalism or social market economy. We  start from the premise that this social system is not the best  one. A world that carries an extreme amount of contradictions  within society produces rich people and millions who are pushed  to the periphery of society. We aim to continuously criticize  and reform this system. [passage omitted]    [Kulin] I agree with Zoltan Gal in that it can only appear  in campaign speeches that the MSZP's coming to government would  mean restoration in the sense that the central planning system  would be brought back and the political structure concomitant  with this would be reborn. We are afraid of something  completely different and we think that the MSZP's governing is  dangerous and should be avoided. The transformation in Hungary  and the changeover to the market economy indeed started in the  socialist framework, before the change of the regime in 1990.  The social basis of the changes was limited to a  political-economic elite. If the elite of this period came to  power, they would halt the process of bourgeois transformation  in Hungary. The MSZP's basis today is an elite who were the  recipients and beneficiaries of the last decade of socialism on  one hand, the rest of them being Hungarian citizens living on  wages and salaries who would vote for the MSZP purely on the  basis of their sentiment for the socialist ideology. In other  words, out of nostalgia rather than conscious choice. The  political background supporting the MSZP is of a much worse  quality than what is represented by the party's political elite.  [passage omitted]    [Oszy-Toth] Various coalition speculations have been  revealed before the elections. What are your views on the  election chances of your parties and with whom would you form an  alliance?    [Kover] I would not like to start guessing the chances  because many things can happen under the current circumstances  with still a month before the elections. A good prediction now  may prove completely wrong tomorrow. Naturally, I trust the  effectiveness of the liberal agreement that was made by four  parties, including the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz].  I also trust that this bloc, and the Fidesz within it, will be  a determining force in the next coalition. As a matter of fact,  the Fidesz's national committee or congress will decide on  coalition matters. This does not mean that different views  cannot exist within the Fidesz's board or party leadership as  regards the coalition. [passage omitted]    [Gal] In my view, we would need a certain "grand coalition"  in the social sense of the term. This means that the political  forces should come to an agreement on certain basic issues. We  spent the past four years questioning even each other's  existence. I believe that these elections will make it clear  that, in addition to the conservative-national and liberal  views, the value system represented by the left-wing parties  cannot be questioned in this country, either. I agree with  Kover in that it would be too early to make guesses because we  do not even know the results. We are preparing for governing in  coalition and we accept the responsibility of governing. Our  strategic goal is to replace the current coalition and to make  it impossible to govern by ignoring us, as has been done in the  past four years. I mainly see a possibility for cooperation  with the liberal side. For me, a Christian democratic party or  movement that approaches the problems in the way the pope does  would be attractive. In my view, a coalition with a socialist,  liberal, Christian democratic, and Christian social attitude  would be feasible.    [Kulin] I find it important to emphasize two principles when  assessing the coalition chances. We will not under any  circumstances ally ourselves with extreme forces. However, we  consider all parties that are sincere about the political  struggle against the socialist alternative as potential  coalition partners. I am very sorry that one month before the  elections, groups that cannot clearly decide whether cooperation  with the Socialists is a possibility for them still exist among  the liberal political forces. In my view, the postponement of  this decision spoils the historical chances of liberalism in  Hungary.</p>

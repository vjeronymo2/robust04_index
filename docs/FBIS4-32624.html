			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 27 (TANJUG) -- Moslem-Croat forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are seriously violating the June 10  ceasefire, the Yugoslav Government said in a statement on Monday.    The government invited the U.N. Security Council to take  urgent measures to avert consequences which the continued  negative development might have for the peace process. Quoting  instances of ceasefire violation, the Government of Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) said in an annexe to its statement that  Moslem forces were constantly provoking incidents by opening  artillery fire on positions of the Bosnian Serb Army and  civilian targets.    A number of civilian facilities have been destroyed and  there  have been casualties among the civilians, which have been  particularly heavy in the area in Brcko, East and West of  Vozuca, the suburbs of Teslic and in Doboj (all in the north)  and in Srbobran and the adjacent territories (in central  Bosnia). Moslem forces have occupied a number of Serb villages,  the government said in the annexe.    Bosnian Croat and Moslem forces are relocating substantial  formations north and south of the Posavina corridor in the Sava  River valley in the north, which links the east and west of the  Bosnian Serb republic. Neighbouring Croatia is concentrating  troops in the area of Zupanja and Slavonski Brod on the border  with Bosnia, the annexe said.    South of the corridor, in the direction of Brcko, the  Moslems  have concentrated five brigades and six battalions brought in  from the U.N.-designated 'save haven' of Tuzla in the northeast,  totalling 18,000 troops, 25 tanks and between 50 and 60  artillery weapons of calibres larger than 100 mm, the annexe  said.    Against Doboj and Modrica, the Moslems have lined up five  brigades and two battalions, totalling 11,000 troops, 20 tanks  and between 30 and 40 big-bore artillery weapons, while strong  Moslem forces are concentrated against Teslic in the north.    Furthermore, the Moslems are unlawfully using markings of  the  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Yugoslav Government said,  specifying that the Moslems have painted white two helicopters  in Sarajevo and three in Zenica in central Bosnia, and have used  them to ferry arms and military equipment as well as troops to  their forces confronting Bosnian Serb positions.    Bosnian Croats, too, have relocated troops from the south to  Kupres and Zepce in central Bosnia, and have concentrated 10,000  troops, reinforced with several battalions of new recruits from  neighbouring Croatia, on the bridgehead at Orasje, north of the  Posavina corridor, the statement said.    UNPROFOR has been officially informed about the incidents,  and could witness on the ground the unjustifiable behaviour of  the Moslem forces, which runs contrary to the ceasefire  agreement. UNPROFOR officials have assured Bosnian Serb Army  representatives that they would inform their commands about the  matter, the Yugoslav Government said in the annexe to its  statement.</p>

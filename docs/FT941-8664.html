			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Volvo/Renault The haste with which Volvo and Renault have gone their separate ways is quite revealing. Renault and the French government were doubtless keen to unravel the cross holdings quickly to simplify the privatisation process. Volvo had been left in little doubt by its shareholders that rapid action was required. Even so, such a quickie divorce implies that the operational relationship was hardly close. The two companies now face complementary problems. Neither truck business is large enough to stand alone, but Renault's perennially loss-making business is the harder challenge. In cars, Renault is better placed with new models and the volume to fund development. Yet it is essentially a European company and does not have the brand recognition elsewhere which Volvo could have provided. Volvo may be a world brand, but its lower volumes must limit its longer term independence. Still, it is difficult to see a potential partner in Europe. Finding one with Honda or Mitsubishi in Japan may also be hard now it has wrapped itself in the Swedish flag and Rover has proved how perfidious Europe can be.</p>

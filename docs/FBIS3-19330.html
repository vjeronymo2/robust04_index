This is stated in a study by the  Economics Research Institute (IWH), Halle/Saale. During these  two months the climate index went down by 1 percentage point as  a whole -- 0.7 percent of that in January. Only 70.3 percent of  all east Germans able and willing to work were employed on the  first labor market at the beginning of 1994.    In contrast, 29.7 percent were either completely without a  job, were working as a result of measures to ease the burden on  the labor market, or commuted to a job outside the new laender.  According to the IWH, the cooling of the employment climate is  most strongly expressed in the way the number of registered  unemployed has soared to 1.293 million (plus 118,000). The last  time the unemployment figure was that high was in early 1992.  The renewed increase is mainly an indication of the persistent  imbalance between the creation of new jobs and the continuing  job cuts.    However, the increase in unemployment is not just a  reflection of the effects of the structural crisis in the east.  It also expresses the withdrawal of labor market policy.  Whereas in January 1993, 100 jobless were offset by 142 cases  of promotion measures, in the same month of 1994 there were only  about 100 such cases. The effect of the abating labor market  policy thus corresponded to almost one-third of registered  unemployed. Nevertheless, job-creation measures saved about  223,000 from complete unemployment in January 1994. In December  there were almost 7,000 fewer east Germans on short-time than  during the same month the previous year, and in January there  were about 10,000 fewer.    In January 1994 the number of people on short-time fell to  the lowest level so far -- 116,000. The number who took the  opportunity of further training and retraining was 279,000 and  was thus also lower. In total, in January 1994 almost 1.3  million east Germans -- including recipients of old-age  transition allowance and those in early retirement -- were saved  from complete unemployment by labor market policy. A year ago  there were 1.7 million.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES;  </P> <P> JUBILANT REAL ESTATE MAGNATE WILL RENAME, PAINT EASTERN'S LINE;  </P> <P> TRUMP READY TO TAKE OVER SHUTTLE  </P> <P> Donald J. Trump is not known for his modesty. He names a lot of things after  himself.  </P> <P> There are the Trump Plaza &amp; Casino and the Trump Castle &amp; Casino in  Atlantic City, N.J.; the 68-story Trump Tower office and apartment building,  the Trump Plaza cooperative and Trump Parc condominiums in Manhattan; the Trump  Plaza condominiums in Palm Beach, Fla., and his 282-foot Trump Princess, the  world's largest private yacht.  </P> <P> Now he's got an airline bearing his name.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Paint Airliners  </P> <P> "I put my name on something when I really feel that it is going to be right,"  he said at a news conference at New York's swank Plaza Hotel -- which he  acquired a year ago but has not named for himself, presumably because there are  already too many Trump Plazas.  </P> <P> Trump did not try to hide his jubilation as he talked to reporters Thursday  hours after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland signed the order allowing  Eastern Airlines to sell its Northeast shuttle to Trump.  </P> <P> The New York hotel owner and real estate developer said the Trump Shuttle's 21  airliners will be painted white with black, red and gold stripes. Trump's name  will be painted on each side of the planes; on the tail there will be a giant  T. He said he will take over the shuttle from Eastern in about two weeks.  </P> <P> "This gives me as much pleasure as buying the Plaza Hotel," he said. "This is  something that from day one I have said I want to have my name on."  </P> <P> Trump even boasted that his name is what finally won him the shuttle in the  contest he had been having over it in bankruptcy court with America West  Airlines. Phoenix-based America West offered more for the shuttle than Trump's  $365 million but could not come up with the financing to support the bid.  </P> <P> "I saw one report that said that the biggest disadvantage America West had was  that it did not have the Trump name," he said.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy court, which has been in charge of Eastern's affairs since it  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy March 9, must approve the sale of any of the  carrier's assets.  </P> <P> Trump and Bruce Nobles, a man who began his airline career with American  Airlines 23 years ago as a reservations clerk and is now president of the Trump  Shuttle, declined to say what specific changes would be made in the shuttle  service, which links New York with Boston and Washington.  </P> <P> They would not say if fares will be cut in an effort to win back some of the  passengers lost to the Pan Am Shuttle in the last three months. The two  shuttles each had about half of the traffic before Eastern's machinists went on  strike March 4. Since then, Eastern's share has slipped to 23%.  </P> <P> The Trump Shuttle will employ about 1,000 people, of whom 800 will be former  Eastern workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Planes Are Safe  </P> <P> Trump and Nobles did say that the planes -- all aging Boeing 727s -- will be  refurbished during the next year and that some new planes will ultimately be  acquired.  </P> <P> But the shuttle's present planes are safe, Trump said. Because of Eastern's  recent troubles, he added, the airliners have been more closely inspected than  those of any other carrier.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, he said, "We are going to go over them totally, impeccably  carefully. We will X-ray every part, every inch. They are not only going to be  the safest planes in the air, they are going to be magnificent to look at."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 5 April carries in its  regular 10-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in  the republic. Reception is poor.    Reporting from Gorazde, Fahrudin Becic says that "this has  ben the worst night that the town has ever had. There have been  24 people wounded, most of them seriously, while the number of  those killed is still unknown. Howitzer shells are continuing  to destroy the southwestern part of the town. The situation on  the front could not be worse and the noose around Gorazde is  tightening." He says that "the chetniks have committed new  crimes against civilians in the villages on the right bank of  the river. Several villages have been burnt to the ground. The  town is full of new refugees." "Fierce infantry clashes  continued this morning at about 0500. Fateful battles are under  way at the gates of Gorazde."    In his report from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic says that "the Serb  aggressor continued to attack the region overnight. Throughout  the night and this morning Karadzic's terrorists have kept up  the attacks with heavy machine guns and antiaircraft weapons on  the (Gradiska) part of the front, and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski  plateau and Hasin Vrh. The situation has been the same in the  Croatian Defense Council's theater of operations, particularly  in the area of (Veliki Postoj). As for the paramilitary  formations of the so- called Kladusa autonomy, they kept up  antiaircraft arms fire throughout the night."    Viktor Boban reports from the theater of operations of the  Operative Group Bosna that "after trying in vain all day  yesterday to recapture lost territories, last night the chetniks  shelled civilian targets in the Hajdarevici area. Despite the  heavy losses that the aggressor suffered overnight, he has again  launched an attack this morning."    Reporting from Olovo, Amira Salihodzic says that "throughout  the night the aggressor fired at our defense lines using a Praga  [armored vehicle], a Bofors, antiaircraft guns and machine guns,  and mortars, but without result."</p>

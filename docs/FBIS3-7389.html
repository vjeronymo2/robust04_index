			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 28 March, Japanese SANKEI SHIMBUN published a  report from Washington that (Neil Livingston,) an American  expert in studies of terrorism, warned that there is a  possibility that North Korea, when it invades the ROK again,  will wage a harassing operation in the rear area of the ROK with  chemical weapons which it has already hidden in the ROK.    According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, (Livingston) alleged this in an  article entitled, "The Dangerous Area," contributed to a recent  issue of the publication "Sea Power," published by the Navy  League, an organization supported by the U.S. Navy.    Stressing that the North Korean leadership which triggered a  war on the Korean peninsula on 25 June 40 years ago is the Kim  Il-song system, (Livingston) said that "the ROK is very  vulnerable to North Korean attack, and therefore, it is very  clear that Seoul, the fourth largest city in the world  approximately 60 km away from the Military Demarcation Line  [MDL], will undergo enormous damages at the initial stage,  whatever type of war may break out there in the future."    He estimated that if the ROK Army fails to check the North  Korean Army midway, the North Korean fighters will reach Seoul  within five minutes and tanks will pressure Seoul in its  outskirts within an hour.    In particular, he assumed that North Korea has stored an  enormous quantity of chemical weapons in the areas near MDL in  the North Korean side of the Armistice Line, and will likely  blow off the poison gas to South Korea in an emergency by taking  advantage of weather conditions, including wind, and that some  of these chemical weapons might have already been hidden in  secret places in Seoul or other areas of the ROK.    SANKEI SHIMBUN wrote that this suggests the possibility that  armed spies, who will commit a terrorist act with chemical  weapons at the directive from Pyongyang, might have already  infiltrated into Seoul, or the forces that blindly follow North  Korea might already possess these weapons.</p>

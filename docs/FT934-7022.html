			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / A prince captured: The heir to the British throne believes he could be used more effectively in promoting UK plc Her Majesty's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mr David Gore-Booth, paced the marbled floor of Jeddah Hamra palace in shock: 'That was incredible, astonishing, unprecedented.' It was well after 2am and King Fahd, Custodian of the two Holy Mosques and head of the House of Saud, had just left in one of his favourite, old Mercedes limousines after lengthy talks with Prince Charles, heir to the British throne. The king had already turned convention and protocol on its head with his last-minute decision to meet the prince on his arrival from Riyadh. The conversation, lubricated with glasses of carrot and kiwi fruit juice, began with the inevitable pleasantries about families and ambassadors but quickly moved up a gear. Shortly before his recent, week-long trip to the Middle East, Prince Charles had publicly attacked the regime of Saddam Hussein and called for closer understanding between the world of Islam and the west. He was highly tickled by reports that his words had triggered a fall in the Iraqi dinar. King Fahd, the first of his many Middle East hosts, was appreciative of the speech, expressing unqualified admiration and respect for his visitor. Mr Gore-Booth is not a man to wear his emotions on his sleeve. But the ambassador, casting diplomatic restraint into the hot, night air, was gob-smacked. King Fahd's message of gratitude was to be repeated ad infinitum as the prince - no longer part of the world's most famous royal double-act - progressed across a region where royalty still counts. Here, royal families not only dispense patronage but award commercial contracts carrying billion-dollar tags; here a British prince can pack the sort of punch which often eludes him at home. His arrival in Saudi Arabia set the tone for a hectic tour of duty run at a ridiculous pace. But despite the flag-waving and flummery which enveloped the royal visit, there was a serious sub-plot. Prince Charles had come to bat for Britain. Increasingly, his trips abroad are being carefully constructed to maximise commercial spin-off for British companies. According to one of the prince's team: 'Their function has changed; he is not wheeled out as a zoo exhibit.' The prince himself is not worried that his unique position is being used to help trade, hoping instead that it 'filters down to benefit our own companies'. Indeed, he believes he is under-exploited and is desperately keen for Whitehall to do something about it. He was bemused because there had been a row over the availability of the VC10 for the Middle East trip. A minor, inter-departmental skirmish maybe, but he believes it demonstrated the low priority given by Whitehall to such visits. The prince has already made one behind-the-scenes attempt to enlist the help of government in devising a co-ordinated strategy for using him and his foreign excursions to best effect in selling Britain. An invitation eight years ago from Kensington Palace to representatives of ministries and trade bodies to consider the issue came to nothing. It floundered, he believes, in an atmosphere of national short-termism which he thinks still persists, and on the inability of government to orchestrate initiatives across departments. 'Things can be properly co-ordinated in Wales and Scotland because each has only one secretary of state. Why can't it be done for the nation as a whole?' he inquires. Now that ministers, particularly in the Department of Trade and Industry, have given exports a high political priority, the prince's office wants to try again to build more effective links with government departments to maximise the value of royal missions. One aide says: 'Parts of Whitehall still see royal visits in an anachronistic way. A certain amount of re-education is required and is under way.' It is impossible to evaluate the commercial contribution of a 45-year-old trainee head of state who cannot return home with signed contracts in a crested briefcase. But, merely by virtue of who he is, he can forge personal relationships which can lead to commercial alliances. As another member of his inner-circle puts it: 'He can cut ribbons and unveil any number of plaques. But much more importantly, he can open doors.' The prince is the first to acknowledge the difficulty in assessing his value in this respect. On his visits abroad, he says he wants to develop his role as 'a cultural and commercial emissary', acting on behalf of a country for which he cares deeply but which he believes often undersells itself. He regularly alludes to the way some of Britain's European competitors beat their own drums more effectively than UK plc. His influence is now felt overseas through organisations such as the business leaders' forum, the newest of his business-led charities which is aimed at getting British companies to help the development of emerging economies. In spite of the endless suggestions that the heir to the throne is emerging from his own annus horribilis to search for a newly-defined role, he insists it has never changed. Whether his value is perceived to be as great elsewhere, given his recent personal traumas, remains open to question. 'The idea I am searching to redefine my job is rot. It is just that, since the day I got married, people have chosen to ignore the things I continue to do day in and day out.' The Prince of Wales has been starring in what he concedes has been a 'soap opera', from which, so far, it has been impossible to escape. His eyebrows rise in exasperation at the alternative, tabloid agenda which usually chooses to neglect his best endeavours in favour of what he sees as irrelevant, sometimes malicious trivia. None of this may cut much ice with those who believe the royal family is an expensive irrelevance whose time has passed. The critics' convictions will only have been reinforced by the distractions of the past few years. In Kuwait, the prince's men were again forced on to the defensive, trying to keep newspaper reporters away from excited, expatriate schoolchildren in case journalists fed them loaded questions to embarrass their special visitor. Later, there was despair at newspaper stories claiming the prince had made a 'gaffe' by talking to a French Mirage pilot at the Dubai air show. British princes, it seems, are only supposed to talk to British companies. Prince Charles now hopes, perhaps in vain, that he can begin to refocus public attention on his serious role and on a broad range of issues  -such as inner cities and architecture. The growing personal support team which operates from roomy offices overlooking Ambassador's Court at St James's share his objectives. Those closest to him say he is 'a driven man', determined to fulfil a role which has never been written down and which he has largely created for himself. His determined sense of purpose sometimes provokes an ill-tempered outburst against those who might see things differently. In spite of the pressures, he is healthy, despite a nagging, polo-induced back injury which has left him with an uneasy gait. He needs little sleep, though the contemplative calm of a church service in Kuwait brought on obstinately heavy eyelids which threatened to hand the tabloids another headline. Before returning to London, he stole a few, private hours in the sunshine at King Hussein's seaside palace in Aqaba, most of them spent ploughing through the pile of official papers at his side. Such commitment, he pleads, would not be shared by the sort of international playboy he could have been. There was no time for play as the prince criss-crossed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, taking coffee and sweetmeats with kings, crown princes and prime ministers. Whatever the cynics might say, the British companies he called on last week were in no doubt that the visit was worth the prince's weight in riyals. Mr Peter Marshall, managing director of John Brown Engineering, was among the royal visitor's hosts when he called in on the Pounds 120m Ibn Zahr plastics plant project at Jubail, in Saudi Arabia's eastern province. Did it help? 'Are you kidding? You can't put a value on his visit. It brought together some very influential people and helped reinforce the idea of British commitment to the region.' Mr Marshall will shortly return to Jubail, where he is told the visit has helped to create the right climate to carry forward negotiations on another Pounds 110m project. On the other side of the kingdom, in Jeddah, Mr Patrick Arnold, chairman of the local British businessmen's group, gave the same message: 'Competition here is tough. But there is a lot of pro-British sentiment and this visit is a tremendous confidence booster for UK companies.' British ambassadors, who once might have measured the success of such a royal visit by the size of their cocktail parties, believe the prince's commercial value is exceptional. Mr William Fullerton, the Foreign Office's man in Kuwait, says there have been three recent trade missions from the UK and that the prince's visit will mean continuing goodwill towards visiting groups. The prince's Arab hosts think likewise. Dr Jasim Mohhamed Alansani, commercial director for the development of the industrial city of Jubail, says: 'The prince's visit will directly help British companies in their fight for work.' Despite such endorsements, the team at St James's believes that much more can be done. The prince's latest visit, for example, proved immensely more effective because of his earlier speech. He cannot always have on hand a weighty address relevant to the interests of his hosts, but the idea of more thoroughly preparing the ground, perhaps through linked ministerial visits, is one to be more fully explored. Another way of heightening the impact of his trips could be to orchestrate immediate follow-up business missions able to exploit the warm glow left in the wake of royalty. There is in place a system to help devise and plan missions for members of the royal family, overseen by the royal visits committee, chaired by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary. The Foreign Office, which picks up the bills for overseas royal visits but which gives such expenditure low priority, plays a pivotal role in drawing up an annual programme and advising on who goes where. The DTI, which has tiny resources, also plays a part. Its UK-based market intelligence operation provides pre-trip briefings and, for the prince's Gulf trip, helped organise a seminar in Saudi Arabia on energy and the environment. But Gen Sir Peter de la Billiere, commander of British forces during the Gulf war, who accompanied the prince around the region, believes - like others in the Royal circle - that a more all-encompassing, strategic approach designed to make the best of a very British asset is needed. Sir Peter, a director of Flemings, the London-based merchant bank which has built a permanent presence in the region, is clear about the prince's special value: 'There are some very heavy-hitters in the business world out here, particularly the Americans. Royalty can provide a very effective counterweight to that sort of approach.' There was no doubt that Prince Charles had a magnetic effect on his royal hosts during his visit. But that reaction is highly unlikely to be repeated so easily when he meets a more cynical public in republican-leaning Australia in January. The commercial benefits there may be a lot more elusive. In Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, cavalcades of limousines conveyed guests to the gangway of Her Majesty's yacht Britannia, where they were entertained to a modest dinner devised as a simple antidote to the excesses of the banquets on shore. As the Royal Marines played selections from Smetana and Strauss, British businessmen chatted with royalty, politicians and their own counterparts from the world of commerce. Britannia is five years younger than the prince and, with nearly 1m miles on the clock, its future is at the mercy of a Whitehall machine which doubts its value and needs to cut costs. Now, perhaps too late, the vessel is increasingly being made available for commercial use - last week it was at the centre of Indo-British week in Bombay. Back in Abu Dhabi, as dinner on board ended and guests prepared to watch the marines 'beating the retreat', an astonished Arab guest learnt of the yacht's uncertain future. Sheikh Khalifa Muhairy, chairman of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, was incredulous. 'You are mad. It is a unique advertisement for your country. How can its future be in doubt?' If the Prince of Wales had overheard the question being asked of the 400ft yacht, he might have been forgiven for thinking it had been directed at the House of Windsor itself.</p>

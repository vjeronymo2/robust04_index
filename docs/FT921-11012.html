			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Observer: Double agent UK readers may have wondered at the author's by-line behind yesterday's circulation-ramping Sunday Times extravaganza on 'Kinnock's Kremlin connection'. Reporter Tim Sebastian is still widely thought of as a BBC man. In fact Sebastian left the BBC a few years ago to concentrate on writing political thrillers, although he has since undertaken a series of reporting assignments in Moscow for BBC TV news on a freelance basis. How come, then, that Sebastian did not take his world exclusive to the Beeb? The answer is that he did, but the BBC current affairs editors decided the story wasn't worth the cost of a film crew. Anyone who bothered to read the predictable out-pourings of the Soviet embassy in London will be inclined to agree with the BBC's judgment. Conservative Central Office, however, will no doubt consider it yet another act of Broadcasting House treachery.</p>

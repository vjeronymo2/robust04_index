Hence,  issuance of a resolution condemning Israel, too, has been  postponed another time.    The negligence on the part of the Security Council, in its  capacity as an international legislative body, in issuing a  condemnation on the tragedy, involving the massacre of scores of  innocent human beings, undoubtedly points to a bitter event.  This shows the influence and intervention of the United States  in this international forum, which is supposed to redress the  wrongdoings against world masses.    Over the past fortnight, the United States has embarked on a  widespread effort to pressure the PLO leaders in a bid to  restart the stalemated talks between the PLO and Tel Aviv.  Also, by pressuring the Security Council, America has prevented  the issuance of even a ceremonial resolution in condemnation of  the Zionist regime. Following the massacre in the mosque of  prophet Abraham, the PLO, by withdrawing from the talks with  Israel, has made resumption of the negotiations subject to  fulfilment of a number of conditions. The PLO conditions for  returning to the talks call for the presence of armed  international observers in the occupied regions, disarmament of  the Jews resident in settlements, and guarantee of the  Palestinians' security.    In the opinion of political observers, these conditions have  been set forth for securing the concession from Israel rather  than blocking the already stalemated talks process on Gaza and  Jerico. However these conditions have come to face an ultimatum  from the Washington-Tel Aviv axis. This is why the United  States has said that issuance of any resolution in condemnation  of Israel will be subject to withdrawal of the conditions set by  the PLO leaders. In fact, one has doubts about the U.S. warning  given to the PLO leaders that in the event of nonwithdrawal of  their conditions, Washington will veto the Security Council  resolution.    In the opinion of political analysts, efforts are being made  so that no concession may be taken from Israel and no mention  made in the Security Council resolution of Israeli crimes and  breach of human rights in the occupied lands; the subject of  Beyt ol-Moqqadas will also be ignored. These are the matters  which can well be observed in the Israeli lobby and in its  influence in the White House.    Irrespective of the type of U.S.-Israel ties, what is  regretted by the world public opinion is the UN role in its  capacity as the highest authority and as a shelter for the world  nations. Regrettably this role, on account of U.S.  interventions, aimed at giving a specific direction to it, has  been turned into an ineffective one, making the UN a tool of the  United States.</p>

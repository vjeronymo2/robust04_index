The Duma is now situated in the former Comecon building and  lawmakers complain that it is incovenient for work.    The government offered parliamentarians five new places,  including the building of the Russian Management Academy in the  south west of the capital and two buildings in downtown Moscow.    No reports whether the prime minister and the Duma speaker  had reached any agreement were available.    However, several lawmakers said that the Duma continues to  insist that the former parliament building which was pounded by  tanks during the October revolt and then transferred to the  government, be returned to the legislature.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beidaihe, June 5 (XINHUA) -- China signed a lease  agreement for five Tu-154 airliners from Russia here today.    The agreement was signed between China Gongan Industrial  Development Company and Nordex Group Ltd. -- a multinational  corporation exploring business primarily in the former Soviet  Union republics.    Rent totalling 29 million U.S. dollars will be paid in  installments over five years. Afterwards China may take  ownership of the jumbos.    Last year China rented passenger aircraft from Uzbekistan on  wet lease, sharing profits with the lender. This time China can  pocket all profits during the lease period.</p>

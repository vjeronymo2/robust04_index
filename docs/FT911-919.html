			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Gorbachev decree puts strikers at risk of jail STRIKERS IN essential industries in the Soviet Union face the prospect of fines and possible imprisonment under the terms of a decree to be issued next week by President Mikhail Gorbachev. The annnouncement came as the last big group of striking coal miners - in the Kuzbas area of Siberia - agreed to return to work tomorrow, though they reserved the right to resume protests in two months if their demands for better pay were not met. Mr Valentin Pavlov, the Soviet prime minister, concerned to stifle any new wave of strikes in essential sectors such as those which have plagued the coalfields for the past two months, said yesterday that the decree would give the authorities the right to prosecute strikers and those who incite industrial action. The decree, part of the government's anti-crisis programme, was agreed with the leaders of nine republics in their landmark joint statement last month. Mr Pavlov also urged the west to abandon its 'wait and see' approach to events in the Soviet Union and provide substantial economic aid to ensure the success of market reforms. He said the country above all needed western assistance for making the rouble convertible, a move which he described as 'the second stage' of economic reform. 'If you want to intervene, you should do so resolutely in order to obtain concrete results instead of giving advice from the side,' he said. Having already introduced price reform, the country would need substantial imports to flood the market with goods, together with stand-by credits to support the rouble once convertibility was introduced. Mr Pavlov did not say when he wanted to switch to a convertible currency. But he suggested that if invited, President Gorbachev would present these requests for assistance to the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries at their London summit in July. He was confident that all 15 Soviet republics, including those which want independence, would soon subscribe to a common economic reform programme. Representatives of all the republics were expected to to complete final work on the anti-crisis programme on Sunday. This would be followed next Wednesday by a meeting, to be chaired by Mr Gorbachev, of the Soviet cabinet and republican envoys. Soviet and western critics of the Pavlov plan, which combines institutional reforms with anti-crisis measures, have said it is unlikely either to achieve financial stabilisation or to break the state's stranglehold over industry. G7 countries have so far been cool about unleashing aid. Economic light, Page 2 Observer, Page 18</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (2): Marxist warhorse puts out a welcome mat - Jyoti Basu, the state's octogenarian chief minister, talks to Kunal Bose Mr Jyoti Basu, West Bengal's octogenarian chief minister, acknowledges the need for foreign investment in India. 'But such investment should be in the priority sectors like power, heavy engineering, food processing and electronics. 'Foreign investment must in the first place satisfy the condition of mutuality of interest,' says Mr Basu who, during 16 years of uninterrupted rule, has brought West Bengal back to the serious reckoning of investors. Since the power sector was opened up to private investment, Mr Basu's government has been talking to the British, German and Japanese 'to find out to what extent we can work together.' However, the chief minister is opposed to foreign investment in consumer goods industries. 'I don't think we need Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola in India. We must not get our priorities wrong.' A veteran Marxist warhorse, Mr Basu nevertheless admits that for 'some selfish reasons, I have welcomed the gradual delicensing of industries. When there was licensing, the federal authorities used to discourage entrepreneurs from setting up industries in West Bengal. 'I thought delicensing would put an end to all that. But even now, the financial institutions, controlled by the federal government which provide lines of credit to industries, do not look kindly at investment proposals for West Bengal. We are trying to fight this.' For several reasons industrial investment in the state should now pick up, says Mr Basu. West Bengal's power situation is among the best in the country and investments to create more power capacity should ensure that supply remains adequate in future years. An Indian government report has confirmed that the state's infrastructure is generally satisfactory. Mr Basu mentions the Birlas, who are planning a significant investment in steel in West Bengal. Also, the Tatas will in the near future commission a pig iron plant. Among the multinationals, Philips and Siemens are fast expanding their production base in West Bengal. The chief minister's efforts to attract investment to West Bengal from Indian businessmen living abroad have started to produce results. At his invitation, Mr Swraj Paul, chairman of the UK based Caparo Group, is examining the possibility of rehabilitating two engineering companies. According to Mr Paul, 'though a Marxist, Mr Basu appears to be ready to go a long way with the federal government so that West Bengal does not miss out on new investments. The political stability, for which the credit almost totally goes to Mr Basu, is a big plus point for the state.' Mr Rama Prasad Goenka, chairman of CESC, which is setting up two coal-fired power complexes in the state, says: 'The leadership of Mr Basu inspires confidence among the business community. He alone can bring about West Bengal's economic renaissance.' The chief minister thinks that it works to the advantage of West Bengal that the political parties (constituents of the Left Front) running the government 'have some influence over the major trade unions. The political parties use the link to educate the unions about the importance of production and productivity. I think the workers in West Bengal in general are a responsible lot. At the same time, I am aware of the complaints relating to the lack of work culture. Maybe it is true in some cases. We are trying to correct it.' Mr Basu tells managers of private and public enterprises that they should have 'a regular dialogue with the trade unions and workers on all relevant company and industry related issues. They will certainly find the workers responsive. It is only through a process of continuous education that the workers can be made aware of their responsibility along with their rights. I always tell the workers that they must study the state of their industries before they put forward their demands.' As for the privatisation of the 75-year-old sick steel company IISCO, Mr Basu will not say more than that the Steel Authority of India, a central government undertaking, 'can rehabilitate IISCO, if funds are made available to it.' He does not believe that the solution to the widespread sickness in the public sector lies in 'wholesale privatisation'. But he is not against selective privatisation. 'We must keep it in view that, as there are very good private sector managements, there are also very bad ones. It will be wrong to believe that in the private sector alone, we will find the panacea to the country's industrial ills. After all, India has more than 250,000 sick private sector units.' Mr Basu explains: 'The Marxists are running a Left Front government in West Bengal. But we do not have a socialist programme. After all, we have to function within the Continued on next page Marxist's welcome Continued from previous page limits of the constitution. It is nothing like a separate republic of West Bengal. We have a minimum programme for the people which we are trying to implement effectively.' He admits that 'the Left Front is in almost total disagreement with the basic policies of the Narasimha Rao government. We are not at all satisfied with the performance of the federal government. It does not have a meaningful programme to increase the purchasing power of the people in the countryside. Unemployment has assumed menacing proportions. India has ended up as one of the biggest borrowers in the world.' A relentless campaigner against communal forces, Mr Basu describes the outcome of the recent elections in the four states - Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan - where the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party governments were sacked by the centre following the demolition of the Babri Masjid at Ayodhya in December 1992 as a 'setback for the forces of the right. But Congress (I) will be mistaken if it thinks that the election results are an endorsement of its policies. People voted against Congress (I) where there was a credible alternative to it. But when the choice was between the Congress (I) and the BJP, they voted for the Congress (I).' What will happen to West Bengal after Mr Basu? He is in his 80s. Though in good health, he is not expected to carry on running the state much longer. Businessmen planning to invest in West Bengal want to be assured that there will be stability beyond Mr Basu. Describing West Bengal as the 'most stable state in the country,' the chief minister says that 'one significant proof of stability is the regularity with which the Left Front wins elections to parliament, state assembly and local bodies.' Mr Basu certainly does not think that there will be a deluge after him in West Bengal.</p>

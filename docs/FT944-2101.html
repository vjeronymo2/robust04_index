			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Church with its future in the balance - Andrew Adonis reports on the financial crisis threatening to engulf Anglicans Money may be the root of all evil but, for the Church of England, the absence of money is a more pressing concern. England's state Church faces a financial crisis which, fittingly, reflects in microcosm the predicament of the nation's welfare state. The C of E's pensions bill is rising far faster than its income, and its central funding agency is seeking desperately to relieve itself of the burden while wrestling with a host of other demands from dioceses and parishes which have long treated it as a sugar daddy. The temporal parallel does not end there for, in seeking to put its finances on a sustainable footing, the Church is confronting the stark reality that money is power. Beneath the clerical decorum, a struggle over the C of E's power structure is gathering pace in which issues of authority and doctrine are revolving increasingly around control of the purse strings. A passionate Anglican debate about subsidiarity - how far down the church hierarchy power should reside - is under way. Some fear this could lead to the break-up of the Church founded by Saint Augustine in 597. As with the welfare state, the roots of today's crisis lie in the years following the second world war when commitments to pensions and other benefits were made. These have grown so much that, by last year, pensions consumed nearly half the Pounds 146m of support provided for the C of E by its central funding agency, the Church Commissioners. The agency was established by parliament in 1948 with assets intended to be used to help pay the clergy and fund poorer parishes. In 1954, it was given the added responsibility of clergy pensions. Popular wisdom has it that the Church's finances jogged along well enough until the mid-1980s when the commissioners ventured into property speculation. This proved disastrous and led to a situation where the clergy faced being turned on to the streets. No one denies the commissioners' ineptitude but the context is significant - not just the 1980s' property boom, but unprecedented pressure on the agency to produce ever-greater income to keep the Church afloat. Yet, even at its peak, the agency funded less than a third of the C of E's annual budget of Pounds 600m; parishes and dioceses were responsible for most of the rest. Given market trends, the commissioners would have required the wisdom of Solomon to be yielding more than an extra Pounds 35m each year to support the church. So, with budgetary pressures growing over the long term, a financial crisis always was likely. What to do? State aid would be an obvious solution. Apart from tax relief on covenants, the government provides only trifling sums to sustain the Church, mainly for restoring cathedrals and listed buildings. Germany, by contrast, has a state tax which yields its churches a lavish income. But such an option is not remotely on the agenda in England; barely 3 per cent of the population attends an Anglican church regularly, while the other 97 per cent has no desire to pay more tax for anything. State aid aside, there are only two other options: massive retrenchment, or a significant increase in income raised from church-goers in the 13,000 parishes. The first would be likely to end the C of E as we know it. But the second - greater efforts to raise money from collection plates and individual covenants - could have equally far-reaching consequences. The commissioners are leading the way. Under a plan announced last month, parishes would take responsibility for their clergy's pensions from 1998. A new pension fund, endowed with between a third and a half of the Pounds 2.4bn assets held by the commissioners, would cover liabilities up to the transfer date. The Church Times pointed to the positive side of the proposal when it referred to 'less reliance on 'dead men's money' and . . . a greater sense of local lay responsibility for the Church's paid servants'. If they have to pay more, however, parishes will want a greater say over how their money is spent. Some are intent on using their financial muscle effectively to take control of the Church. This is apparent from the activities of a movement called Reform, which is sponsored by leading evangelicals and has more than 1,000 members, half of them clergy. Reform's leaders include the Rev Philip Hacking, vicar of Christ Church at Fulwood, Sheffield, which has a total Sunday congregation of 1,500. Christ Church has 'capped' its quota at Pounds 52,000 instead of the Pounds 70,000 requested by the diocese. Since the diocesan levy is 'voluntary', there is little bishops can do if affluent parishes refuse to pay. Hacking is concerned about diocesan bureaucracy but sees a basic principle at stake. He points out: 'There is no such thing as a diocese in the Bible - the local church is the focal point.' He wants more of them in the image of his own. Hacking adds: 'We are unhappy with clergy who preach a non-biblical gospel - for instance, on homosexuality - and we do not want to give a blank cheque to dioceses to support a ministry of which we do not approve.' Instead, Christ Church is using its money and initiative to revive a parish in nearby Rotherham. But Robin Stevens, the C of E's central stewardship officer, warns: 'We have to be careful not to become congregational, with no regard for the national Church.' The debate now focuses on a commission examining the central structure of the Church and chaired by the newly-installed bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Michael Turnbull. It is expected to report by next summer. Some regard it as significant that, during the controversy earlier this year over his conviction 26 years earlier for indecency, Turnbull called his clergy together to ask if he should continue in office. 'That would have been unthinkable in times past,' says one observer. Yet, if the parish clergy become the C of E's paymaster, it might soon become standard practice for decision-making in the Church.

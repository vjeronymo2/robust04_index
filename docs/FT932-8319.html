			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: JVC dives to Y43.1bn loss and passes dividend JVC, the Japanese manufacturer of audio-visual products which brought the world the VHS video tape, yesterday reported a sharp deterioration in its business results and passed its dividend for the first time since it became a public company. JVC reported a consolidated net loss of Y43.1bn (Dollars 388m) as sales in its most important product areas fell sharply amid the world-wide slump in the consumer electronics industry and as the yen's appreciation adversely affected overseas revenues. The result was a significant setback from the previous year, when JVC reported a consolidated net profit of Y1.99bn. The loss came on consolidated sales, down 8 per cent to Y768.89bn, as consumers refrained from buying in key markets, which have become saturated. For the parent company alone, JVC reported a 15 per cent decline in sales, to Y513.16bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y26.13bn compared with a loss of Y2.13bn previously. The company's businesses suffered a setback in both the domestic and overseas markets. In the domestic market, sales were down 1 per cent to Y260.2bn. Sales overseas, nearly half of turnover, declined sharply by 26 per cent, to Y252.96bn, as the company moved to reduce stocks and as a result of the strong appreciation of the yen. JVC has cut costs throughreductions in staff levels and restructuring of businesses, including factories. The company aims to reduce staff levels by 3,000 through natural wastage, curtailment of new recruitment and transfers of personnel to subsidiaries. It forecasts a slight improvement in sales to Y540m in the year to March 1994 and a return to profitability during the year. Olympus, the camera and precision instruments maker, reported a 72 per cent rise in consolidated pre-tax profits in the year to March 1993 but a 25 per cent decline in net profits to Y3.8bn due to extraordinary costs related to a patent infringement settlement. The increase came as consolidated sales rose 3 per cent to Y267.7bn. Olympus was hit by a payment to settle a patent infringement dispute brought by Honeywell, the US company. For the parent company, Olympus reported a 10 per cent decline in pre-tax profits, to Y9.36bn, on sales down 1 per cent to Y187.75bn. Although the company does not expect a substantial improvement in the business environment this year, it is forecasting a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y11.5bn, and a 209 per cent increase in net profits to Y6bn on a non-consolidated basis as a result of restructuring. Clarion, the car audio manufacturer, reported a pre-tax loss of Y6.7bn on sales down 7 per cent to Y142.65bn. It passed its dividend. The specialist audio maker was particularly hit by the downturn in the vehicle market.</p>

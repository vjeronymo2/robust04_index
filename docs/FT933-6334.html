			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Spain to open up airport services SPAIN has countered accusations by leading airlines of monopoly practices at its national airports by telling the European Commission it will deregulate the ground-handling services that lie at the centre of the controversy. Aena, the Madrid-based airport authority, said yesterday it had told the EC Directorate-General for Competition of a programme, to start next year, that will loosen the current control that the state-owned airline Iberia exercises over passenger, ramp and cargo handling at domestic airports. In a parallel letter to the EC, Iberia rejected allegations of 'abusive behaviour' in its provision of ground services. A group of European airlines, including British Airways, KLM and SAS, had earlier complained to the Commission that Spain's national carrier levied excessively high tariffs, discriminated in favour of domestic airlines, discouraged other airlines from self-handling and provided inadequate services. The complaints of high handling costs, also levelled against Milan and Frankfurt airports, come against a background of unprecedented losses among European carriers in the wake of the EC's 'open skies' policies. Aena has informed the EC that it will appoint second ground handling agents at the airports of Las Palmas and Tenerife in the Canary Islands next year, and at Madrid's international airport as soon as new cargo facilities there are completed. The national airport authority added that additional agents would be appointed by 1997 at all domestic airports handling more than 1m passengers a year. Rejecting the complaints made by fellow European carriers, Iberia said the existing tariff structure for ground services at domestic airports was laid down by Aena and it was the airport authority, not Iberia, which authorised other airlines to provide their own handling services. The Spanish airline claimed the tariffs were cost-justified and did not imply excessive profits. Iberia said the complaints of a deficient service were based on events in 1991 when the airline suffered a series of big industrial disputes and an overhaul of Spain's air traffic control network.</p>

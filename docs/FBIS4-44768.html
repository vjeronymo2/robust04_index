			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Markus Schnurpfeil: "Avalanche Triggered in </F> Digital Communications: Europe's ISDN Standard Throws the  Communications Market in Full Swing"]    [Text] Horst Gellert, normally a low-key manager, permitted  himself to voice some uncharacteristic emotional words. "A new  milestone in the long history of communications has now been  reached." And the business director of Telekom, the German Post  Office Department's commercial affiliate, exlaimed that "a new  age for reckoning time has begun, namely, `before ISDN' and  after ISDN.'"    The reason for Gellert's glowing words was clear. Network  users in 20 European countries celebrated the official  introduction of the European Standard for ISDN (Integrated  Services Digital Network) with a communications party. While up  to this point the digital networks in Europe had operated on the  basis of interim national standards, the bits and bytes now race  through the copper wires and light waveguides on the basis of  the European Unified Norm (abbreviated E-DSS1).    Network operators and the communications industry hope to  receive the same effect from the Euro-ISDN that was received  from the GSM-Standard--the technical regulatory structure for  digital radiotelephony. The simple formula for success lies in  the fact that a unified Euro-Standard creates a large sales  market for end products, while the high volume of items pushes  the prices down, which in turn attracts additional users. As  Gellert effusively puts it: "With this development, the old  world takes its place at the top of an advanced technology par  excellence and can now harvest the economic uses from it."    But the Telekom-man will have to be a bit patient. In the  short term, Euro-ISDN is highly unlikely to find the same  dynamically growing demand for its products as was realized in  the mobile radio business. Volker Fink, Telekom's technical  director responsible, among other things, for ISDN marketing,  states soberly: "It will take a year before the effects of the  common Standard will be noticed in the market."    Fink's evaluation is totally realistic for the simple reason  that all the essential elements in the ISDN picture blend  together very slowly. Only the beginnings of a large end product  market now exist. To date, digital communications connections  have only been properly marketed in Germany, where Telekom has  expanded the ISDN network, at least in the former FRG, and has  sold more than 300,000 so-called ISDN bases and about 20,000  primary multiplex connections for linking up large  communications facilities. The trend is for further strong  increases. Fink notes: "The other net operators have yet to  trigger a similar development."    At any rate, the communications companies are working toward  that end. "The European network operators are determined to move  the Euro ISDN forward," Eckhard Oberfrank, ISDN specialist in  the Dortmund office of the ExperTeam Telecom consulting firm,  observes. Still, not all the obstacles have as yet been removed.  "One of the bottlenecks," Oberfrank laments, "is the fact that  the producers in each European country still need their own  country's approval to have their products, like Fax machines and  modems, connected to computers."    This is not only time-consuming, but it is expensive as well  because of the necessary approval fees. The tedious approval  procedures have had a definite effect on product price,  especially in the case of simple Euro ISDN telephones. As one  specialist in the industry notes: "In the case of the  telephones, every additional cost added affects the price the  consumer must pay."    Such adversities do not dampen the enthusiasm of the Euro  ISDN champions however. "The Standard has triggered an avalanche  that continues to gain momentum," Martin Storp, marketing  director at Philips Communications Industry AG in Nuremberg, is  pleased to report. He believes that the producers of equipment  for digital communications are "finally on the way to profitable  mass production with the concomitant favorable effect on end  product prices." Industry specialists estimate that in four to  five years, an adapter card for the PC will cost only 80 German  marks [DM]. Storp observes further that "each PC will then be  able to participate in telecommunications." At least DM500 would  have to be invested today in order to be able to use this  additional capability.    Despite the Euro Norm, however, no further large price  reductions can be expected for medium and large communications  facilities. The sharp competition, which companies like Siemens,  Philips, Alcatel SEL, and Telenorma have brought to this market  segment in recent years, has already pushed the prices for large  systems well below the profitable level. "There is no more room  for maneuver in that regard," Storp laments.    But the situation vis a vis small Euro ISDN systems is quite  different. Telekom's Volker Fink recognizes that "there is a  considerable need for action in the matter of small businesses  and the self-employed." Although not connected to large  production figures, the price spiral downwards continues  markedly for smaller systems. With the Eumex minisystem, which  manages up to eight extensions, Telekom brings to the market a  Euro ISDN switching system at the competitive price of less than  DM1000. Pleased by this Telekom development, consultant  Oberfrank notes that "previously a terminal adapter, which could  only connect a single analog telephone to the digital network,  had cost that much."    And developments in other companies are also brightening the  scene. Software giant Microsoft, for example, has now designed  its successful 'windows for workgroups' program with a software  module for access to the ISDN network. Oberfrank is convinced  that this would never had happened if purely national ISDN  standards still prevailed.    Despite these promising business prospects, the high spirits  prevailing among the suppliers of ISDN circuit boards for  personal computers, like AVM GmbH of Berlin, mbp Software &amp;  Systems GmbH of Dortmund, and ITK GmbH of Dortmund, are clouded.  Regardless of the unified regulatory system, industrial policy  'trench warfare' threatens this lucrative market segment. It is  being fought out at the technical level. With the so-called CAPI  (Common Application Programmable Interface), almost all the  producers of ISDN PC cards and communications software are now  able to combine the hardware and the application programs of the  various suppliers. A Euro ISDN version of this industry standard  is already available.    However, mainly because of massive French influence and  insistence, another, clearly technically inferior solution is  being pushed along at the European standardization institute  ETSI in Nizza. "Now that we finally have the European ISDN  Standard, the French have nothing better to do than block the  open market and try to protect its own industry.    The ISDN boom in Germany is clearly indicated by the number  of base connections sold yearly. In 1991, 59,071 such  connections were sold, in 1992, it was 138,831, in 1993,  281,254, in 1994, the number is expected to be 480,000, and in  1995, 800,000.</p>

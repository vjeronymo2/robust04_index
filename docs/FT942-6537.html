			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Interactive marriage, Italian style - Andrew Hill assesses the chances of a new venture between Stet and Bell Atlantic of the US In a country already conducting a passionate love affair with the television and telephone, any venture which tries to put the two together should have a fair chance of success. That at least seems to be the view of Stet, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications utility, and Bell Atlantic, the US telecoms group, which last month agreed to develop an interactive multimedia television service for the Italian market. By early 1996, the two companies hope to be able to offer Italian consumers feature films, on demand, via the telephone network operated by Stet's subsidiary Sip. In due course, the companies will add video shopping, banking, do-it-yourself, and even emergency first aid, not to mention exploiting commercial applications such as video conferences and training. 'Italy will probably be the first into the (European) market with this capability,' says Edgar Brown, president and chief executive of Bell Atlantic International. Certainly, Italy looks like a prime target for multimedia services. Not only are late 20th century Italians, like their ancestors, hooked on communication, they also seem to take to gadgets very quickly. 'Within Europe it's probably one of the better markets and one of the more receptive to new ideas and new services,' says Evan Miller, European telecoms analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. The classic success story in Italy has been the mobile telephone, or 'telefonino' in the Italian diminutive. Whereas in many other European countries, ordinary people would hesitate to produce a mobile telephone in public for fear of being either mugged or sneered at, the Italians positively flaunt their 'telefonini', and use them not just as tools but as toys. In big cities, it is quite common to see groups in piazza cafes passing round the cellular phone to talk to friends out of town. Linked to this casual technological ease is a sophisticated television culture, which in some parts of the country feeds viewers as many as 20 national and local channels. One important point for advocates of multimedia is that the diet already includes several cheap, but unavoidable, home shopping channels, peopled by enthusiastic presenters with bizarre sales pitches ('Buy a Persian carpet, win a scooter]'). For Stet, which is likely to be privatised later this year, and Bell Atlantic, the first step towards realising this potential is technical. Sip will work with the US group to adapt its traditional copper-wire telephone network to the transmission of video signals, investing an estimated L4,000bn (Dollars 2.5bn). If Italy eventually wants a fully-fledged multimedia service, certain analysts believe substantially more will need to be invested, but Sip's modest first ambition is for technical tests to take place by the end of this year, and commercial trials - on a group of 2,000 users - during 1995. It is the strange and volatile Italian market, however, which offers the biggest challenge - and carries the biggest risk - for the two companies which will develop and market the services through Stream, a Stet subsidiary in which Bell Atlantic will take a 49 per cent stake. As Miro Allione, Stream's managing director, put it after last month's launch: 'The technology, although it's demanding and sophisticated, is really the smaller problem. The real unknowns are in the marketing, which is linked to demand and to the capability of operators wanting to back the new medium.' To help conquer the unknown, Stream - which is likely to seek an initial capital injection of L100bn by the end of next month - is already talking to potential partners who could provide 'information and programming' ahead of the 1996 commercial launch. According to Bell Atlantic's Edgar Brown, the two main shareholders are prepared to accept dilution of their own stakes in Stream, but will retain joint control. Stream's first challenge will be to lure subscribers into the system with movie services, which are described as the 'trigger' for the rest of the system. Although simple to understand, movies may also prove the most difficult of the proposed services to get right in Italy. Broadly speaking, consumers will be able to choose what to watch from a library of films or programmes, divided into categories and targeted at particular audiences. More importantly, they will also be able to choose exactly when to watch. The question is whether this will be tempting enough to defeat rival attractions in the sector. Not only is big-screen cinema already quite a draw for urban Italians, anyone in the country can also watch 8,000 films a year, for free, on the state-owned Rai television channels and their private competitors. As a measure of the difficulties facing Stream, Telepiu, which launched pay-TV movie and sports channels three years ago, has yet to make money and has attracted 600,000 subscribers, whereas Stet and Bell Atlantic hope for well over a million users. At the same time, Rai and Fininvest (the media empire built by Silvio Berlusconi, the new Italian prime minister) have amassed substantial film archives and rights, which Stream would be hard-pressed to match unless it could link up with one of the existing conventional channels. Stream could argue that a new medium requires new rules, and pay royalties on the basis of the number of viewers selecting individual films. If that tactic fails, however, and Stream's film catalogue is not sufficiently broad by the time it launches, film-lovers could easily switch back to the conventional channels. The second service to be introduced is likely to be video shopping, and here the US-Italian joint venture is on surer ground. Already, home shopping via television is said to be worth between L600bn and L800bn a year in Italy, and interactive television would allow customers to complete the whole transaction, from order to payment, on screen. Industry sources, however, are still convinced that both consumers and companies will have to be eased into the new technology. 'I'm not sure that the Italians are prepared to move suddenly to a new (buying) system, instead of touching products or smelling perfumes,' says one. Evan Miller of Lehman Brothers points out that Europe has been generally more cautious than the US in moving towards multimedia services. Analysts are in general sceptical about the possibility of a full-scale national system being in place within the next few years, but they believe there is a chance of a limited service in the most important cities. The limited previous experience of Stet and Sip in a similar field means they are likely to be cautious about pushing their customers too hard to accept new technology. Over the last few years, Sip has watched its ambitious Videotel venture - an interactive telephone system similar to France's Minitel - quietly wither away. Stet's judgment is that Videotel was too complicated and the range of services too narrow. That is likely to be the first lesson that Stream learns in setting up a multimedia service.</p>

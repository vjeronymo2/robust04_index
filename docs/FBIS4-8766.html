			<p>BFN     [Text] As a result of the extremely difficult and dramatic  situation in Gorazde, the residents of this town were addressed  by Rijad Rastic, president of the Gorazde District, and Esad  Ohranovic, president of the Executive Council.    [Begin Rastic recording] I, Rijad Rasic, president of the  Gorazde District, appeal to all those who live in Gorazde not to  cause panic through their behavior, that all those capable of  fighting to report to their nearest unit, to put old people,  women and children in safe places to avoid shells, and to avoid  unnecessary walking around.    Check all the information that your receive in several  places. Do not listen to panic and those who do not think well  of our people. You finally know [words indistinct] let down.  The courageous defenders are successfully doing everything to  save the people from the chetniks. Help our defenders as much  as you can. God is protecting Gorazde. [end recording]    [Begin Ohranovic recording] There is only death in Gorazde.  There is no one to stop this death and horror. Fighting is  taking place around the hospital itself. In the past hour,  hundreds of shells have landed on the town. The hospital, the  International Red Cross, and collective accommodation are all  being targeted. We demand once again that a stop be put to  this. I do not know whether I will have the opportunity to  repeat this appeal.    I appeal to the defenders of Gorazde and the residents of  Gorazde to devote everything to the service of defense. Do not  fall for rumors and disinformation. The town must be defended.  Do not forget the dead and wounded. Do not forget your  co-fighters without arms and legs. It is better to die than be  taken into the hands of the enemy alive. Do everything possible  to prevent the enemy from entering the town and carrying out an  unprecedented slaughter. I know that we can and want do it.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 45 ILLEGAL ALIENS DISCOVERED IN HOUSE  </P> <P> Forty-five illegal aliens, including a 2-month-old baby, were discovered inside  a filthy, sparsely furnished house in Valinda on Tuesday, shortly after an East  Los Angeles woman told authorities that her sister was being held for ransom  inside the home.  </P> <P> The tip led officers to a one-story frame home in the 18400 block of Hurley  Street about 12:30 a.m., sheriff's deputy Van Mosley said. Inside, deputies  discovered the immigrants from Central and South America who had, for an  unknown number of days, shared a five-room house that has a single bathroom and  is furnished with mattresses, chairs and a television set.  </P> <P> "It is believed that all of them arrived in the U.S. within the last week,"  said Mosley.  </P> <P> Deputies were alerted to the home after a woman called the station saying that  her sister, a Salvadoran immigrant, was being held captive inside the house,  Mosley said. Officials discovered the woman, Maria Zuniga, 40, along with other  illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador, said  Mosley.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies said Tuesday's raid led to the second such discovery in  Valinda, a Los Angeles County community 28 miles east of Los Angeles, in less  than two months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aggressive Patrol of Border  </P> <P> Harold Ezell, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Western regional  commissioner, said the California border will be "very aggressively" patrolled  to stop any increase in illegal immigration by Central Americans fleeing a  clampdown in Texas. California and Florida are the primary destinations for the  flood of immigrants coming into the United States through Texas.  </P> <P> Hundreds of Central Americans seeking asylum face arrest and deportation in  Texas if their applications are denied under a new get-tough policy that seeks  to send economic refugees home instead of giving them work permits while their  requests are processed.  </P> <P> Asserting an absolute "right to control our borders," Ezell said at a news  conference that "economic refugees" will not fare any better at the California  border. He also said he does not expect any increase of asylum applicants in  either Los Angeles or at the California border.  </P> <P> "We're not going to stand back and let our borders be overrun," Ezell said.  "The message has to get down to Central America that you can't use this  (asylum) to get into America."  </P> <P> On Dec. 8, the immigration service started interviewing asylum applicants on  the day they applied, before granting work permits. Until then, employment  authorization was granted for up to a year without an assessment of the  applicant's request.  </P> <P> The number of applications surged last summer to 500 a day, Ezell said, but  have dropped to about 100 since the new policy began.  </P> <P> Most of the immigrants detained Tuesday were held for Border Patrol officers,  and Zuniga was taken into protective custody. She told deputies that she had  been held for $1,400 ransom. Although sheriff's deputies were uncertain whether  others in the house had also been held captive, immigration officials said such  ransom demands are common.  </P> <P> Frequently, smugglers will increase the price after escorting aliens across the  border; and their families, who are expected to pay, sometimes contact police.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Way Station"  </P> <P> Charlie Geer, head agent in charge of the San Clemente Border Patrol station,  said the residence was probably a "drop house, a way station where aliens are  placed until (their smugglers) can farm them out to wherever they're going."  </P> <P> The house's front door, the lock of which was broken, led into a front room  littered with beer cans, a few blankets and a baby food jar tossed next to two  dirty mattresses. A baby's shirt lay near a television set, the only furniture  in the room besides a wooden chair, lamp and water cooler.  </P> <P> No suspected smugglers are in custody.  </P> <P> Staff writer Michael J.

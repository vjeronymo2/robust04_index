During the meeting, they reviewed the friendly  bilateral ties and the means of promoting them. They also  discussed the efforts currently under way to establish a  cease-fire.    The ambassador reiterated the U.S. position that what is  taking place in the Republic of Yemen must be handled in  accordance with the provisions enshrined in UN Security Council  Resolution 924, within the framework of the Republic of Yemen,  and with the inalienable rights guaranteed to all members of the  world body by the UN Charter, chief among which are the member  states' rights to sovereignty, independence, and territorial  integrity, as well as the inadmissibility of interference in  their domestic affairs. He added that any handling of the  situation in the Republic of Yemen outside this framework would  prolong the conflict and hamper the urgent solutions required to  achieve security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the  region at large.    For his part, Deputy Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi  reiterated the Republic of Yemen's appreciation of U.S. efforts,  noting their importance.

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> DESIGN BLENDS STYLE, AFFORDABILITY  </P> <P> Wrapped in an attractive exterior of wood siding accented by brick veneer and  paned windows, this home is designed for today's housing needs -- in terms of  both style and affordability.  </P> <P> The approach to the covered entry is graced by a brick planter. The  side-lighted entry door opens to a spectacular living room, featuring vaulted  ceilings, an open staircase, a hallway overlook upstairs and a fantastic  fireplace arrangement. The fireplace unit includes a wood bin with overhead  shelves to house TV and stereo components. Set off by quarry tile, the  fireplace serves as a focal point and as a room divider between the living room  and kitchen/dining area.  </P> <P> The family-sized dining room has French doors opening to the back-yard patio.  The adjacent kitchen also looks out to the back yard, with three windows placed  over the sink. The well-appointed kitchen has plenty of built-in storage space  and is laid out in the popular U shape.  </P> <P> A half-bath and a 7-by-6-foot laundry room are easily reached from the kitchen  and from the garage entrance. One cost-saving feature is that this area is  located directly under the two baths on the second floor, reducing plumbing  costs.  </P> <P> Upstairs, the two smaller bedrooms are separated from the master bedroom suite  by a full bath with a large linen closet. The large master bedroom includes a  walk-in closet, a bath with shower and a linen closet.  </P> <P> A balance of style and affordability is achieved with this design, which has a  total living area of 1,753 square feet, not counting the optional basement of  853 square feet. In addition to its modest size, the home is designed to reduce  heating and cooling costs. All exterior walls are insulated to R-23, with R-38  ceiling insulation and R-30 insulation in the floors. Attention also has been  given to sizing and positioning the windows to make them as efficient as  possible.  </P> <P> Homestyles Plan Service offers a variety of specialized plan books, available  at newsstands nationwide, as well as full-sized, complete construction  blueprints.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp - surplus in dispute Sir, As a member of the Japanese Diet from Hiroshima, I am particularly concerned about the wisdom of proceeding with reprocessing at Thorp. I thank my counterparts in the British parliament for answering my and my colleagues' open letter to them by submitting a motion in the House of Commons stating that it is a matter of urgency that our two governments 'negotiate an acceptable outcome to prevent the production of surplus plutonium' at Thorp. I would like to clarify that our open letter (the number of Diet members signing has now increased to 18) does not dispute the Japanese and British governments' policies. Rather, we ask them to explain logically why there are so many contradictions on this issue if their figures and assessments are indeed reliable. Japanese plutonium is already in surplus even without Thorp. The Science and Technology Agency, responding to my request, released on October 1 the most comprehensive information to date on current stocks, showing it at 4,530 kgs. Nearly three tonnes of this belongs to the electric utilities with no concrete plans to implement its use. Japan's policy of having fuel reprocessed abroad is very much a waste disposal policy. Because of Japan's experience with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, people rightly fear the effects of radiation. Siting of new nuclear power plants takes an average of 24 years. Nuclear waste disposal sites are wanted even less. To have been able to ship in excess of 5,000 tonnes of nuclear spent fuel to the UK and France for reprocessing has been a blessing to the Japanese nuclear industry. Japanese utilities remain silent about the fact that all waste produced after reprocessing at Thorp is due to return to Japan. Ethical Japanese will be obliged to inform you that there are no plans whatsoever for re-accommodating the low and intermediate level waste generated by reprocessing at Thorp. BNFL argues that this waste will be 'substituted' for high level waste, but this scheme is not in place. Also, our government has never admitted such proposals are being discussed. Both the Japanese and British governments are ignoring important realities. Good politics as well as good science must start from looking at realities as they are. Members of the Japanese Diet as well as the British parliament, therefore, have a duty to awaken our two governments to objective facts so that they would negotiate on Thorp.

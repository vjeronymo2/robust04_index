			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: NatWest Bancorp continues to recover NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bancorp, the US subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, continued to show a strong improvement in the second quarter of the year and is on course for profits of Dollars 120m (Pounds 63m) for the year. Mr John Tugwell, chairman, said yesterday that he expected NatWest Bancorp to have even better results in the third quarter and to make profits of about Dollars 120m this year. The bank's net profit of Dollars 35.8m in the second quarter to end- June compares with a Dollars 85.1m loss in the same period a year ago. The second-quarter result was also up on the first-quarter profit of Dollars 30.3m. NatWest Bancorp believes it has overcome its problems with bad loans to the New Jersey property market. These left it with cumulative losses of Dollars 860m since 1989. 'We have turned the corner and the worst is over,' said Mr Tugwell, adding that he was pleased the bank had kept its costs steady and maintained good margins on its lending. 'The core deposit side is really excellent with a 10 per cent increase in demand deposits.' There was a charge of Dollars 30.5m for loan losses during the quarter, down from Dollars 134.7m in the same quarter a year ago. The charge for the six-month period was Dollars 61m, down from Dollars 356.6m a year ago. The bank's total allowance for loan losses is now Dollars 657.5m, 60 per cent of its non-performing loans, or 4.63 per cent of its total loan book at June 30. At the end of June, its total assets were Dollars 22.17bn, up from Dollars 21.97bn a year earlier. Mr Tugwell said plans to build up the bank's retail deposit base were going well and the bank was making steady progress in finding new customers in ethnic areas. Although the bank has shed some unprofitable branches it has also opened new ones and wants to buy branches to expand its network of 270. It is also interested in buying any credit card businesses which come on the market.</p>

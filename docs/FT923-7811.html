			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Arts: Bowled over - Radio ONLY Radio 3 matches its drama to a Summer Season, and now we have survived the Test Match Specials, it is reviving three of last year's cricket plays. Sunday's Taking us up to Lunch was by Peter Gibbs, who once opened for Derbyshire, but (like Jonathan Agnew) is equally at home in the field or in the commentary box. His tale is modest - commentator Frank, angry when fellow-commentator Leslie laughs at his difficulty over a Welsh name, hits him, and Leslie uses some rough language, which Jimmy, covering the play, fails to keep off the air by switching off the mike. The play concerns the prospect of the producer's retaliatory action; but for dramatic symmetry, a six brings the ball into the box, hitting Frank, and he uses rough language of his own. Jane Morgan's direction, rich with background sounds, was convincing. Watch out for I Always Take Long Walks on September 6. Earlier on Sunday, on Radio 4, was Colin Douglas's Smart Boy Wanted, also about men at work. Action shifts between five candidates for a Senior Registrar's job in an Edinburgh hospital, and their superiors upstairs who will make the choice (rightly depending a little on Rugby ability). It is rather like a quiz, with the result as elusive as an Agatha Christie. Medical chat is not as entertaining as cricket chat, but insiders may have been amused. The director was Patrick Rayner. More important drama (I am enjoying my own Summer Season) came on Radio 4's Monday play, Martyn Wade's The New Party. This is a survey of the eponymous New Party of the Thirties, as it affected its leaders, Sir Oswald Mosley ('Tom' to his friends) and Harold Nicolson, then running the Londoner's Diary in the Evening Standard. Nicolson (whose voice older listeners will recall too well to accept any other, though Christopher Cazenove is convincing) is more fully drawn than Mosley, for we have Vita Sackville-West in the margin. Neither is as fully drawn as they both have been since, for they must be seen as the potential electors of the time would have known them. Mosley's Youth Movement, his newspaper Action, (which Nicolson kindly, but unsuitably, edited, complete with Vita's Gardening Page), boxer Kid Lewis vetting callers at the office, reveal him as a potential Hitler, though Mussolini was the top Fascist of the day, and that was where Mosley got his ideas. 'Solidarita]' was what he picked up from his visit to Rome. The New Party won no seats, and the author hardly puts enough emphasis on the public disturbance its political activities caused. In the end, Nicolson had to break with Mosley and resign himself to a literary life; while in due time Mosley went to jail, then into exile. This account of their activities was full of interesting detail, especially, no doubt, to those strange to the period; but it had not enough human concern to make it even a Shavian play. Cherry Cookson directed. Before I quit my Summer Season, a word for Nigel Baldwin's Cordoba, a six-part serial thriller that began late on Thursday. Alison Steadman (I always wait up for her) plays DT Mitchell, an undisciplined woman reporter on a Welsh newspaper. We have two good deaths already. Jane Dauncey directs. Besides drama, I listened to two science programmes. On Radio 3, Lewis Wolpert talked with Professor Jared Diamond, who is both a molecular physiologist and an ornithologist. He had good things to say about the difference between the field sciences and lab sciences. Clearly field sciences were favourite; he rhapsodised over the bower birds of New Guinea, and he called Rutherford 'despicable, destructive'. On Radio 5's Rock Solid, Anna Grayson's geological tour of Edinburgh was for tourists, but a bit short in describing the unusual items she told of.</p>

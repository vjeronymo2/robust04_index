			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Headline in talks and requests share suspension MR TIM Hely Hutchinson, founder of Headline, the publishing group, is on the takeover trail. Headline's shares were suspended at 290p at the company's request. A statement said it had reached an advanced stage in talks which were expected to lead to a substantial acquisition. Dealing in the shares of Headline, which is capitalised at more than Pounds 34m, will recommence after details of the planned acquisition have been sent to shareholders. Mr Hely Hutchinson was not available for comment but rumours in the publishing industry suggested that Hodder and Stoughton was the likely target. Mr Philip Attenborough, Hodder's chief executive, was not available yesterday.</p>

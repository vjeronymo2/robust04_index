			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 26 (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin  said on Thursday [26 May] that the initiatives taken toward  Europe's security and stability were very appropriate.    Speaking during European Stability Conference, Cetin  revealed  Turkey's views.    Cetin said the violence and ethnic cleaning in Bosnia has  not  been responded to adding that the bloodshed in  Bosnia-Herzegovina has not ended yet.    Cetin said Europe is passing through a hard transition  period.    `The problems created after the collapse of iron curtain  need  attention,' Cetin said.    He said the incidents happening in Bosnia today create  dangerous examples for future `extreme nationalism, religious  and cultural intolerance and racism which could arise again in  various places in Europe.'    During his speech Cetin stressed good-neighborly relations  and the importance of regional cooperation.    He said Turkey is ready to contribute to regional  cooperation  programs within the framework of European Stability Agreement.    Turkey is an associate member of European Union and aims at  full membership.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yu Changhong (0060 7022 3163) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun (XINHUA) -- What were China's  environmental conditions like last year? The "Communique on  China's Environmental Conditions" issued by the State  Environmental Protection Bureau today says: Under the  circumstances of a fairly rapid economic development in 1993,  environmental conditions were relatively more stable.  Environmental pollution and damage to the eco-environment were  still continuing. A small number of areas were seriously  polluted, whereas pollution in some areas was brought under  control. The eco-environment was turning for the better.    According to the regulations of the "Environmental  Protection  Law of the People's Republic of China," the State Environmental  Protection Bureau will issue a "communique on China's  environmental conditions" for the previous year on the eve of 5  June -- World Environment Day -- every year after 1990. Since  the United Nations convened the Congress on Environment and  Development, the Chinese Government has paid much more attention  to coordinated development of the environment and the economy,  adopted the strategies for sustained development, and put  forward a series of countermeasures and measures on environment  and development. Environmental conditions around the country  are stable as a whole.    The communique issued today notes: Air pollution caused by  smoke from burning coal is still very serious in cities -- it is  more serious in winter and spring than in summer and fall, in  north China than in south China, and in medium and big cities  than in small towns. The discharge of sulfur dioxide and  industrial dust has increased to some extent, and acid rain has  been found in more cities than in the previous year.    In 1993, water pollution found in rivers around the country  was a kind of organic pollution. Water quality in mainstreams  was better than in tributaries, and rivers passing through  cities were more seriously polluted. Over exploitation of  underground water was rampant in cities, and the deterioration  of the eco-environment of the fishing industry had not been  brought under effective control yet. The degradation,  desertification, and salinization of grasslands continued, and  the volume of mature forest trees which could be logged was  shrinking.    Concerning the work of environmental protection in 1993,  local people's governments at all levels and various departments  under the State Council have intensified their work and  extensively launched inspections of the enforcement of the  environmental protection law under the guidance of the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council and have made  achievements in preventing and controlling industrial pollution.  The amount of smoke and dust released into the air in cities  remained the same as in 1992. The water quality in mainstreams  of big rivers, inland rivers, large-sized reservoirs,  underground water in cities, and most offshore waters remained  fine. Municipal and public facilities were further improved;  progress was made in declaring and registering discharged  pollutants; control over dumping at sea was further strengthened.    In 1993, people around the country have further enhanced  their environmental concepts, and environmental campaigns with  the participation of the public were larger and more diversified  than in the past. Environmental education was more popularized.    The 1993 "Communique on China's Environmental Conditions" is  jointly compiled and completed by the Ministry of Agriculture,  Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Water Resources, Ministry of  Geology and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Construction,  Ministry of Public Health, State Statistical Bureau, State  Meteorological Administration, State Oceanography Bureau, State  Land Administration Bureau, and State Environmental Protection  Bureau.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Protest vote may decide NZ election result: Nikki Tait reports on the likely fortunes of the main parties and their alternatives WITH three days until the election and the opinion polls still in his favour, Jim Bolger, New Zealand's prime minister, is campaigning the safe way. A typical day in Wellington includes lunch with a local chamber of commerce, a visit to a leather goods company which has already won commendations for export performance, and a tour around a sparkling new supermarket. Schedules like this produce few challenges. 'I'm not asking for any lollies, but perhaps in your second term, you could look at the state of the hospitals,' is the extent of the 'critical' questioning at the lunch. The style of Mr Mike Moore, the one-time builder's labourer who heads the opposition Labour party, is different. He stands on a wind-swept industrial park in Christchurch and tries to sell a community jobs scheme to a group of unemployed youngsters. Shouting over the rumble of a dual carriageway, he talks almost exclusively about social issues, and the rising tide of petty crime which he links to the 9.9 per cent jobless rate. 'Everywhere you go, the most pressing problem is unemployment. One in four teenagers is unemployed and that is unacceptable. Productivity, growth can lift, but jobs go down. Unless we break this, there will be generation of New Zealanders who will never have a job, never have a home. This country can do better . . . . I'm ashamed of some the things which have happened here. Maybe, they've got some excuse in Los Angeles or London, but it (urban violence) shouldn't happen here.' Most New Zealanders find Mr Moore's style far more engaging and the opposition leader wins hands down in the personal popularity stakes. But this has yet to translate into backing for Labour itself, which is tainted with creating some of the problems Mr Moore deplores, and whose policies are viewed as barely distinguishable from Mr Bolger's National party. Throughout the campaign, National has kept a slim edge on its main opponent and there are some signs that the gap is increasing in the final days. The National party has been drawing 37-39 per cent support among 'decided' voters, Labour 32-34 per cent. The latest poll, released this week, put the figures at 39 and 32 per cent respectively. This leaves a large number of undecided voters - about 14 per cent in the latest poll - and two fairly credible 'alternative' parties. They are the Alliance, a coalition of five left-leaning, green and Maori parties, and New Zealand First, headed by Mr Winston Peters, a former National party MP. Under the present first-past-the-post system, neither is expected to pick up more than two or three seats in the enlarged 99-seat, single-chamber parliament. But they may yet hold the key to the next New Zealand government. If floating voters decide that they are so fed up with both National and Labour that they would prefer to register a protest vote, Mr Moore will have difficulty securing the 6 per cent swing he needs to oust Mr Bolger. If support for the two alternative parties fades at the last minute, Labour may be in with a chance. Over the past few days, the former has looked the more likely, with the Alliance, in particular, gaining ground. The coalition is led by Mr Jim Anderton, who broke away from the traditional Labour party in 1989 and formed the New Labour party, one of the five Alliance coalition partners. The Alliance talks of progressive income taxation and a top marginal rate of 49 per cent, compared with 33 per cent at present. It would raise taxes on fossil fuels and companies, and phase out goods and services tax in favour of a new 'financial transactions tax.' On the other side of the ledger, the Alliance promises to pump about NZDollars 1bn (Pounds 375m) in infrastructure works, creating 40,000 jobs; restore welfare benefits cut by National; abolish the new regional health authorities, and insist on free health care for everyone; repeal National's labour market reform legislation; and more. The problem for Mr Moore is that Mr Anderton's message seems to be selling well in marginal electorates, especially around Auckland, which Labour badly needs to win. New Zealanders are not just voting for a new government on Saturday. They are also voting on whether to alter the electoral system in 1996 to a proportional representation one, under which only about half the 120 MPs, in an enlarged parliament, would represent specific electorates. The remainder would be drawn from a national 'party list.' If the system were up and running today and the opinion polls correct, Mr Anderton would be looking at 15-20 seats.</p>

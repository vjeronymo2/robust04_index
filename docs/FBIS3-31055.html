			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov today stated his view  that the reports in certain newspapers to the effect that Stoyan  Denchev had active contacts with private business circles  correspond to the truth, adding that this is incompatible with  Denchev's position as chief secretary of the Council of  Ministers. Denchev has reportedly been offered a diplomatic  post in London or Helsinki, but apparently no official decision  on the affair has yet been adopted.</p>

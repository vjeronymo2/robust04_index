			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industry urges CIS aluminium quota THE EUROPEAN aluminium industry is appealing to national governments for stringent quotas to be imposed on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States. The industry says it operates at a loss and its viability is 'seriously endangered'. Producers in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK want their governments to press the European Commission to restrict CIS aluminium imports to the European Community to 82,000 tonnes a year, compared with the estimated 600,000 tonnes that flooded the EC in 1992 and 450,000 tonnes the previous year. 'If this problem is not dealt with very quickly it will solve itself - all the European smelters will have closed down,' said one industry official yesterday. The producers say 82,000 tonnes was the average annual tonnage imported to all western markets during the last three 'normal' years before the 'dramatic and unexpected increase in aluminium exports from the former Soviet Union since 1990'. They want quotas to cover new and secondary (scrap) aluminium to close a loophole being used by some traders who export new metal from the CIS but call it 'scrap'. Producers say this competes directly with new metal. In documents presented to governments, they say that, because the EC is the closest large consuming area to the CIS, it is bearing the brunt of aluminium exports from that region. Those exports were recently estimated by the CIS industry to have reached more than 1.2m tonnes last year. The European producers suggest CIS imports have depressed aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange - the most widely-used guide to world prices - and forced the European industry to make costly production cuts. Europe accounts for about 25 per cent of world aluminium supply but 80 per cent of the 1.1m tonnes of capacity has been shut down, either temporarily or permanently, because of low prices in the region. Earlier this week Alusuisse-Lonza announced the permanent closure of its smelter in the Valais canton of Switzerland, while Inespal said it was discussing with its unions substantial permanent output cuts at two smelters in Spain. The European producers complain of 'the total lack of official statistics or reliable information regarding the activities of the former Soviet aluminium industry' and say 'the disorganisation of the CIS exporting structures is further aggravating the situation'. They suggest quotas should stay in place until the CIS stimulates a revival of its domestic market and/or adjusts its sales and pricing policies 'to market economy rules and mechanisms'.</p>

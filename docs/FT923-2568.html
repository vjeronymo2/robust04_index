			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Germany may offer rate cut deal: Economists call for broader realignment of European currencies SPECULATION grew last night that the Bundesbank was prepared to cut its key interest rates further as part of a far broader realignment of European currencies than last weekend's devaluation of the lira. After a chaotic day on foreign exchange markets, culminating in the suspension of the pound, economists and traders looked ahead to today's fortnightly meeting of the German central bank's policymaking council. 'We need a more comprehensive realignment,' said Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. 'For years, the illusion has been built up that exchange rates in the European Monetary System could remain fixed.' That illusion has been rudely shattered by the events of the last few days. As sterling came under immense selling pressure yesterday, the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts announced on Monday -  1/2 point off the discount rate to 8 1/4 per cent and  1/4 point off the Lombard to 9 1/2 per cent - looked too modest to have any lasting effect, economists said. 'I think the Bundesbank will consider cutting rates further as part of a broader realignment,' said Mr Richard Reid, economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in Frankfurt. 'The Bundesbank is obviously sticking to its principle that realignments are still a policy option, since we do not have permanently fixed rates.' The Bundesbank, still shaken by the effect of reported comments made by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, its president, that a wider realignment last weekend would have properly eased EMS tension, made no comment on rumours of further rate cuts. Today's meeting would take place as normal and there would be no press conference, it said. Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, rejected speculation of any imminent further realignment, saying he was not aware of any other European Community government considering such a solution. Mr Ernst Moritz Lipp, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, said a further EMS realignment could be expected this week, with a further German rate cut. Mr Remsperger of BHF-Bank said it might be best if European currencies simply floated against each other. 'The Maastricht programme has come too early.' Speculation continued to rage about the contents of an interview given by Mr Schlesinger to Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper. A summary published yesterday, suggesting that he thought a more comprehensive realignment would have reduced pressures in the market more successfully, and that further currencies would come under pressure, was denounced by the bank as 'unauthorised'. A spokesman said that Mr Schlesinger had neither said it, nor intended to say it. 'The words were put to him, and he did not answer them.' In spite of the denial, the substance of the article was assumed to be accurate by most people in the German markets. An authorised version will be published today, but any direct quotes substantiating the contentious extracts will have been edited out.</p>

The ruling parties basically agreed to accept  the LDP's proposal that an upper limit for official subsides to  political parties be included in the Law on Subsidies for  Political Parties. However, the ruling parties opposed another  LDP proposal that "corporate status be given to political  parties" to clarify responsibilities of political parties which  will receive subsidies. They failed to reach an agreement. They  will discuss again this issue and also the issue on the upper  limit of subsides on 24 February.    Regarding the issue of setting a limit on public funding for  political parties, both sides basically agreed on the LDP's  proposal that the amount of subsidies for political parties  should be limited to less than two-thirds the amount of income  in the previous year, excluding subsidies received. Concerning  the issue of giving corporate status to political parties, they  failed to reach an accord because a number of participants from  the ruling parties said: "Giving corporate status to political  parties would invite intervention by the administration and  restrain their activities. There is a possibility that 'the  freedom of association' will be violated by restricting  political parties' activities. This issue should be discussed  cautiously."</p>

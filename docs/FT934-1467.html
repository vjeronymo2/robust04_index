			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark up With the Bundesbank council meeting out of the way and only a handful of economic releases in the next two weeks, most currencies drifted sideways as traders wound down their positions ahead of the year-end, writes Conner Middelmann. Following the Bundesbank's decision to leave its interest rates unchanged, the US dollar continued slipping against the D-Mark, breaking technical support at DM1.7050 and dropping as low as DM1.7025. The dollar was also depressed by talk that central banks were selling dollars as part of their reserve management operations. It ended in London at DM1.7045, down from DM1.7085 on Thursday. The dollar continued to firm against the Japanese yen, however, hitting a high of Y110.20. It finished at Y110.10, up from Y109.75 at Thursday's close. 'Having breached technical resistance at Y110, the dollar could push towards Y112 towards year-end,' said Mr Michael Burke, an economist with Citibank. Unlike many economists who expect the dollar to rally against the D-Mark in 1994, Mr Burke said he expected it to end the year around DM1.55. That compares with a market average 12-month forecast of around DM1.80, although some economists are calling for a rate as high as DM1.90 by the end of 1994. 'It's astonishing - if everyone is so bullish on the dollar, why isn't it going up?' Mr Burke mused. He expects the dollar to slip when the first quarter of 1994 shows that the US economy is not as buoyant as many believe. 'US incomes don't support an increase in the pace of private-sector consumption, and that will be further slowed by next year's tax hikes,' he said. Meanwhile, 'it would be perverse for the Fed to tighten while growth remains slow and inflation is falling', he added. Next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve open market committee will be closely watched after an article in yesterday's Washington Post argued that Fed officials do not favour a near-term increase in interest rates as a pre-emptive strike against the possibility of stronger inflation. The rate for D-Mark call money firmed as monthly tax outflows and seasonal pressures sucked liquidity out of the banking system. This prompted a liquidity injection by the Bundesbank via its Paragraph 17 facility, under which it lends out government funds on deposit with the Bundesbank at market rates. An estimated DM4-6bn were lent out at 6.15 per cent. The call rate traded at 6.15 per cent, up from around 6.05 per cent the previous day. The D-Mark strengthened slightly against some of its ERM counterparts. It firmed against the French franc to FFr3.419, from FFr3.415 on Thursday. The Danish krone slipped to DKr3.918, from DKr3.912 the previous day. The sterling money market had a quiet day, leaving the March short sterling futures contract unchanged at 94.80. The pound barely changed, finishing at DM2.5425, after DM2.5450 on Thursday. The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.75bn shortage but revised that later to Pounds 1.4bn. In early operations it purchased bills totalling Pounds 1bn, of which Pounds 741m were for resale to the market on January 10 at 5 13/32 per cent. In the afternoon it bought Pounds 8m of bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 420m. The Bank kept the market tight early in the week to counteract market pressure for a rate cut, but 'having successfully made its point, the Bank will now begin to be more accommodating', predicted Mr Philip Shaw, group economist at Union Discount.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Laurence Alary-Grall: "First Starting Block for </F> the `Information Highways'"; first paragraph is MESSAGES  introduction]    [Text] The new electronic roads will transmit voice,  animated images, and data interactively, thereby opening up a  whole new world of services and knowledge. "Information  highways" are a huge public works project, kicked off recently  in France by the prime minister. The following surveys the  current situation and outlook.    France is setting out on the "information highways." The  United States, where Vice President Al Gore is an ardent  advocate, has made superhighways a top development priority. Now  France is getting involved in the huge project, which was kicked  off by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur during an  interministerial meeting last 22 February. The goal is to  install communication infrastructures that can transmit data,  images, and sound interactively, throughout France. In other  words, to set up the network of the third millenium, which will  ultimately provide multimedia access to everyone.    Two major technological breakthroughs--fiber optics and the  digital revolution--provide the background for the sweeping  project. Together they obliterate the lines between  telecommunications, audiovisual broadcasting, and  data-processing, and will make it possible in the future to  combine telephone, television, and computer in a single  multimedia terminal. As Gerard Longuet, the minister in charge  of the program, stressed during a council of ministers meeting  23 February, information highways are going to "profoundly  modify the way many economic and social activities are carried  out: [they will result in] more telecommuting, new forms of  educational and training support, broad access to professional  or leisure data banks, and the introduction of services tailored  by the television viewer or consumer."    The government estimates the growth outlook for new  communication technologies at 8 percent a year, or about 10  percent of Europe's GNP around 2000. This makes future  multimedia networks of crucial economic and strategic  importance, and explains the prime minister's plan to bring  together all the players--France Telecom, cable companies,  television stations, multimedia publishers, audiovisual  producers, and computer service operators--in a "growth pact."  The pact aims to raise several billion French francs' [Fr] worth  of investments, notably in cable, over the next three years.  "But the economic objective must not take precedence over the  essential public service mission of these infrastructures,"  stressed Edouard Balladur. The prime minister believes the  government should play a dual role: "To ensure that electronic  highways are developed in a way that meets the country's  economic, social, educational, and cultural needs on the one  hand. And to make them quickly available to the greatest number  of households, schools, and businesses on the other."  <H5>  The Minitel Precedent </H5>   The French initiative falls within the European perspective  advanced by proposals of the "White Paper on Growth,  Competitiveness, and Employment," which was prepared by the  European Commission and adopted by the Twelve's heads of state  and government in late 1993. In it, the Commission estimates the  total investment needed in the telecommunications sector alone  at ECU150 billion (about Fr975 billion) between now and 2000.  European information highways would absorb ECU67 billion, 35  billion to install a high-speed communication network and  consolidate European ISDNs [Integrated Services Digital  Networks], 12 billion for electronic services (electronic  images, data bases, electronic mail), and 20 billion for  information systems and services (telecommuting, on-line medical  assistance, remote administration).    The Twelve set up a brainstorming group, headed by European  industrial affairs commissioner Martin Bangemann, on 8 February  to prepare the development of this "information society" and  related new technologies on a continental scale. The group of  experts will submit its conclusions next 24 and 25 June at the  European Corfou summit, which will deal with the question of  electronic highways and their funding.    In France, the national information highways project will  benefit from a famous precedent: the success of the minitel,  which now offers 23,000 services to 6.5 million  terminal-equipped users and roughly 500,000 videotex desktops.  As for Numeris, France's version of the ISDN, it spans the  entire territory and can already carry voice, data, and still or  slightly animated pictures. But its transmission speed is  grossly inadequate for true multimedia and interactive use.    Hence the need to launch a new generation of "wide-band,  very-high-speed" networks, which combine fiber optic equipment  and new transmission and switching techniques, particularly ATM  (asynchronous transfer mode). France Telecom has already  invested heavily to equip its network with fiber optics. The  public carrier is preparing to restructure its transmission  network (the "national roads"), to convert it from a branching  architecture to one that is "petal-like." It is also getting  ready to launch the first commercial high-speed-tranmission  services via ATM in 1995. Moreover, France has undeniable  strengths in industrial telecommunication products, notably  Alcatel's mastery of broadband networks.  <H5>  A Study Mission </H5>   But the performance level of a network is not the only thing  to be considered. Much is at stake in the notion of information  highways, including technologies, industries, regulations, and  effects on civilization. What should be sent out on these  highways, to meet which needs, and to provide what kind of new  services? What should be the public service role of the  information highways? Who will have what kind of access to  knowledge? What sort of legal framework should "regulate" the  roads--in other words, allow the flourishing of new markets and  the jobs they will create while meeting general and regional  development needs? How will the information highways complement  cable?    The government has assigned the job of exploring all these  critical questions to Gerard Thery, a former telecommunications  general director whose name is linked to France's effort to  "catchup" in telephones in the seventies and to the launch of  the minitel. Gerard Thery will submit an analysis and proposals  to the government this summer. His assignment is preparation for  a bill that may be presented to parliament in the fall, before  initial experiments get underway at the end of the year.</p>

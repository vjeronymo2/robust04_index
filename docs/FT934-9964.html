			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Osman Abdullah hits back at Starmin A FORMER chief executive of Starmin claimed yesterday that the quarry products company which is chaired by Lord Parkinson, the erstwhile Cabinet Minister, had made 'iniquitous' accusations against him in the legal row over the termination of his service contract. Mr Osman Abdullah, who controlled the company from 1989 with his brother Raschid, has now received a response from the company's lawyers to his legal claim for more than Pounds 500,000 in compensation for loss of office. 'If you did not know any different you would think that I was the biggest dictator since Genghis Khan, the Mogul dictator,' said Mr Abdullah. He said the company's case included accusations that he had not properly consulted the board: 'I will be refuting these claims strongly and I will expose what ever is necessary to fight my case.' The action follows the announcement of his resignation from the Pounds 160,000-a-year executive post in July - a month before the company said pre-tax losses were millions of pounds deeper than previously published. Mr Raschid Abdullah also resigned as an executive in July but recently won shareholders' backing to stay on the board as a non-executive director. He speaks for about 30 per cent of the equity including his family interests and allied shareholders. Mr Osman Abdullah said he had seen 'no evidence' of any 'new deals' by the four-month old new board and was therefore 'currently considering a package with a view to realising maximum value for shareholders'. The resignations by the brothers, who built up the Evered aggregates company, coincided with Starmin's announcement of a review of accounting policies which led to the company rescinding its dividend and announcing 1992 pre-tax losses had been understated by Pounds 3.8m, deepening them to Pounds 11.9m. The review of accounting policies focused on profits booked on asset swaps. Starmin, who refused to comment yesterday, said at the time that there was no suggestion of fraud.</p>

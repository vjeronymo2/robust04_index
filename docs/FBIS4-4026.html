			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun </F> (0215 1322 6511)]    [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Upon concluding his tour  of four Central Asian countries, State Council Premier Li Peng  held a news conference this afternoon at the state guesthouse  where he was staying. He answered reporters' questions on the  results achieved during the trip, Sino-Russian relations,  China's stand on nuclear testing, China's nationalities policy,  and other issues.    First of all, Premier Li Peng said: The current Central  Asian visit is the first by a Chinese head of government since  China established diplomatic relations with the four countries.  "During the visit, I held fruitful [fu you cheng guo di 1381  2589 2052 2654 4104] talks with the leaders of the countries in  question, and enhanced mutual understanding. In my opinion, the  visit has been successful."    At the request of a China Central Television Station  reporter, Li Peng made a further assessment of the concrete  results of the tour. He said: "I had a comprehensive and  in-depth exchange of views with the leaders of the four  countries on international issues, the regional situation, and  bilateral relations." "I found that we had many common points.  For example, when I discussed China's continuous economic  development as a result of its implementation of the policies of  reform and opening up while maintaining social and political  stability, the leaders of the four countries expressed similar  views, saying that maintaining domestic stability is of  paramount importance to carrying out economic reform and to  developing the national economy. Also, we all want to be on  friendly terms, and hope to become good neighbors and friends.  This is also a common point."    Li Peng said: "In my speech in Tashkent, I expounded China's  four basic policies for developing relations with Central Asian  nations. In Almaty, I also made a six-point proposition on  developing economic cooperation and trade with various Central  Asian countries. As far as I know, my speeches won broad  support and good response from leaders, as well as business and  media people, in the four countries."    He stressed: The signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement  is of great significance. The border issue between China and  Kazakhstan is left over from history and has remained unsolved  for a long time. That it is being resolved now is the result of  joint efforts by the two sides. The document defines the  boundary between the two countries in legal form. "We hope and  believe that the lengthy Sino-Kazakh border extending more than  1,700 km will be one of lasting peace and friendship."    Li Peng pointed out: The current visit also has achieved  substantial results in promoting economic cooperation.  Accompanying me on my tour are senior officials in charge of  economics and trade, as well as a number of entrepreneurs. They  came into wide contact and concluded a set of agreements,  contracts, and letters of intent with economic, trade, and  business circles in the four countries, scoring even greater  successes than had been anticipated. An important achievement  in this respect is the understanding reached between Chinese and  Kazakh railways and communications departments on improving and  strengthening international railway through transportation to  better solve current problems in railway transit transportation.  During the latter half of this year, we will invite the  railways and communications ministers of Russia and various  Central Asian countries to a meeting in Beijing to further  discuss this issue so as to make full use of the new "Silk Road."    In response to a question about China's so-called  "intention to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet Union's  disintegration," Li Peng said: "First of all, I would like to  state my views on the issue. The newly independent countries  born of the Soviet Union's disintegration are all sovereign  states; there is no question of so-called `vacuum.' However, I  would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that China  seeks no sphere of influence, politically or economically.  China has many matters to attend to at home and has no interest  in filling or intention to fill the so-called `vacuum.' My  present visit is meant to develop the friendship between China  and various Central Asian countries, and is not directed against  any other country."    On the Sino-Kazakh border trade issue, Li Peng said: It is  true that a considerable number of Chinese merchants do business  in Kazakhstan, with self-employed traders constituting the  largest number. Generally speaking, they have played a certain  role in promoting border trade between the two countries. A  small number of them, however, have colluded with some local  people in carrying out profiteering activities by selling fake  and shoddy products. The Chinese Government opposes such  actions.    Li Peng emphasized: We are ready to work with the Kazakh  Government to draw up relevant laws, regulations, and measures  to stem this unhealthy tendency and to reduce the negative  effect on bilateral trade. He noted that trade companies in the  two countries, especially those with good reputations and vast  resources, should form the main channel of trade between the two  countries.    In response to a question by a Russian reporter about  Sino-Russian relations, Li Peng said: "The development of  Sino-Russian relations following the Soviet Union's  disintegration has been normal. Rather than being weakened,  bilateral economic relations and trade have surpassed the level  during the era of the former Soviet Union. President Yeltsin  visited China in 1992, and the leaders of the two countries will  exchange high-level visits this year." He added: "Russia is a  great nation endowed with abundant resources, vast territory,  and diligent and intelligent people. I believe that the Russian  people can surely overcome the temporary difficulties they are  now encountering so long as they rely on themselves."    Asked about China's attitude toward a complete nuclear test  ban, Li Peng pointed out: Although China is a nuclear country,  the quantity of its nuclear weapons is insignificant compared to  those of other nuclear countries. Among the nuclear countries,  China was the first to propose not to use nuclear weapons first  and not to threaten nonnuclear countries with nuclear weapons.  The Chinese Government has always stood for complete  prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and for  realizing a complete nuclear test ban within this context. For  this reason, the Chinese Government holds that reaching a treaty  on a complete nuclear test ban through negotiations is of  positive significance. China has stated clearly that it will  work toward concluding such a treaty in 1996. He said: At the  moment, China is actively participating in the negotiations  being held in Geneva regarding such a treaty.    Asked by a Kazakh reporter on how China, a multinational  country, handles nationalities issues and maintains national  stability, Li Peng said: China's Constitution provides for  equality for all nationalities. We also have a law on autonomy  for minority regions. Minority nationalities enjoy political  rights equal to those of the Han nationality. Areas where  several minority nationalities live in compact communities are  experiencing economic development with each passing day, and the  living standards and cultural levels of their people are  improving continuously. It can be said that the relations among  our nationalities are marked by great concord and harmony [shi  fen he mu he rong qia di 0577 0433 0735 4207 0735 5816 3174  4104].    Premier Li Peng asked Ismail Amat, state councilor and  concurrently minister in charge of the State Nationalities  Affairs Commission who was accompanying him on his trip, to give  a detailed account of China's nationalities policy.    Asked about his talks with President Nazarbayev by a  reporter, Li Peng said: "Despite my short stay here, we held  several rounds of talks during which we reached many common  understandings on bilateral relations and international issues.  We both agreed that all countries should independently choose  their own development courses and set their own foreign  policies, and should not allow other countries to interfere.  Both sides attach great importance to creating a good  environment for their national economic construction and oppose  national splittism. During the talks, Nazarbayev said that he  upholds the One-China stand and regards Taiwan and Tibet as  inalienable parts of Chinese territory. Nazarbayev also  explicitly stated that the Kazakh Government will not allow  elements of so-called "East Turkstan" to carry out activities  against China in Kazakhstan, and that it opposes pan-Turkism.  Nazarbayev briefed me on some of his propositions on Asian  security. I told him that the Chinese side understands and  appreciates his efforts to safeguard peace and security in Asia."</p>

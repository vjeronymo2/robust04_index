			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $2.85-BILLION BID;  </P> <P> AVON SNUBS JACOBS' TAKEOVER PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Avon Products Inc.'s directors on Thursday spurned investor Irwin L. Jacobs'  $2.85-billion takeover proposal and reiterated their belief that the cosmetics  giant should remain independent.  </P> <P> The move, the latest in a string of rejections the direct sales company has  doled out to unwanted suitors, had been expected.  </P> <P> But speaking from his headquarters in Minneapolis, Jacobs said he would take  Avon Chairman and Chief Executive James E. Preston up on an offer to meet and  discuss Avon's "business plans."  </P> <P> Preston said in a letter to Jacobs that he would be willing to meet with the  investor -- as he would with any major shareholder -- but "not to negotiate a  sale of the company." An Avon spokesman also noted that Jacobs would not be  allowed to meet with the entire board.  </P> <P> "We are going to take the high road in this thing," Jacobs said in a telephone  interview. "I will very happily meet with him, which is more than others have  gotten to do."  </P> <P> Jacobs said he thought a meeting could be held within the week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Solo Approach  </P> <P> Preston officially responded to Jacobs' offer by letter but phoned the investor  before the letter was released. Jacobs described the call as "very friendly and  amicable and one that I was pleased to get, and yet I wished the results were a  little better."  </P> <P> On Wall Street, Avon stock slid 62.5 cents a share to $35.875 in consolidated  New York Stock Exchange trading, indicating dealers were skeptical of Jacobs'  $41-a-share offer.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Jacobs tried the solo approach with Avon directors, who three  months ago rejected a bid engineered by Jacobs' partner and Avon's rival direct  sales company, Amway Corp.  </P> <P> In his brief letter to Jacobs, Preston said the board "thoroughly" reviewed the  proposal with its investment banker, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., at a regularly  scheduled board meeting.  </P> <P> "The board unanimously rejected your proposal," Preston said. "The board  believes that the best interests of the shareholders would be served by Avon  remaining an independent company and being allowed to execute its business  plan."  </P> <P> Jacobs' plan calls for selling Avon's retail unit, which includes the Giorgio  Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern fragrance lines.  </P> <P> Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway controls about 10.3% of Avon's common  stock; Jacobs controls about 55% of the Avon stock owned by the alliance, known  as A-J Partnership.  </P> <P> In May, the Avon board rejected Amway's hostile $39-a-share takeover bid and  indicated that it would resist future acquisition attempts. Days later, Avon  also rebuffed overtures from Mary Kay Corp., parent of the door-to-door  cosmetics seller Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc.  </P> <P> In addition to paying $2.25 billion for Avon's 54.91 million common outstanding  shares, Jacobs also said he might redeem Avon's preferred shares at $33.50  each, or a total of about $603 million, raising the price tag on Avon to  roughly $2.85 billion.  </P></p>

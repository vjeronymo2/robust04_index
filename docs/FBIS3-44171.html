A member of the SACP Central  Committee, Mr. Jeremy Cronin, has called on the NP to confirm or  deny that the SACP's facsimile and telephone lines have been  tapped. He also called on the NP to explain its connection to  the National Intelligence Service and to name all the  Broederbond [Secret Afrikaner Brotherhood] members on its  election list.</p>

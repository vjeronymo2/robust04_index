They  can only bring civil war. To avoid that, we must adopt a course  to preserve socialism and eliminate its deformities.    We are sure that the people of Belarus will support us in  our  effort to preserve and improve socialism, as well as develop  people's democracy at all levels through the soviet system and  revise the Belarusian Constitution in this direction."

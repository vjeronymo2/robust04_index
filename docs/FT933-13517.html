			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (12): Venture that went adrift / Profile of 3i Wanted. New owner for Europe's largest venture capital company. Slightly shopsoiled from standing in the display window for the past two years but still a basically sound business. WHAT is to happen to 3i, the grandfather of the British venture capital industry, after its clumsy attempts at a public flotation? Continuing uncertainty about the future of the largest provider in Europe - let alone in Britain - of equity and long-term loan finance to small businesses is a cause of some concern. The repeated postponement of the planned flotation has dented the company's image and done little for staff morale. More important, small and medium-sized companies desperate to raise extra funds to finance growth may find that a key player is distracted from its primary business. 3i's problems came to a head in April when the banks which are its present shareholders announced an indefinite postponement of the flotation. Apparently prompted by a change of heart by Barclays and National Westminster Bank, which together own 41 per cent of 3i, shareholders said they would wait until the economy improved. Mr Alan Wheatley, a former senior partner of accountants Price Waterhouse brought in as chairman to spearhead the flotation, stepped down. There are now three main options open to 3i and its shareholders. They could: Maintain the status quo. Pressure is off the banks, particularly Midland which is now part of HBSC Holdings, to raise funds by disposing of their stakes. But while the banks might not be so desperate to raise money by the sale of 3i, the company itself is keen to top up its finances. It had planned to raise new money at the time of the flotation and is currently testing the market to see if it could raise a Dollars 300m-Dollars 400m fund. This would, however, leave a fundamental problem unresolved: the big banks all have their own competing venture capital activities. In recent years 3i, like the rest of the venture capital industry, has shifted its emphasis to larger deals, bringing it into direct competition with the bank-owned venture funds. If 3i re-emphasised its focus on smaller deals, its shareholders would not complain. Allow one of the banks, or another financial institution, to buy 3i. National Westminster is believed to have expressed an interest at one stage while 3i recently considered the possibility of a link-up with Charterhouse Development Capital. But the banks would be unwilling to see the fruits of 3i's long-term investment activities fall into the hands of a rival. Allow a large pension fund investor or group of investors to acquire 3i. For most, this would represent no conflict of interest with existing activities and it should not provoke the jealousy a bank sale would. However, the poor returns from some of their investments have made pension funds cautious about venture capital investments over the past two years and there might not be many takers. 3i is in an unhappy position for a company which depends on making long-term investments. While uncertainty about the flotation persists, attention will focus on its own short-term prospects.</p>

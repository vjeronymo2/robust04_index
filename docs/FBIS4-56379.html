			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 29 Apr (NA) -- A 23-year-old man  had the lower third of his right arm and the forefinger of his  left hand amputated today, after an explosive device, which he  found tied to a sign of the People's Revolutionary Organization  (ORP) at the intersection of General Paz Avenue and Francisco  Beiro Street, went off.    Edgardo Dario Ruiz was strolling with a group of friends at  0300 this morning when he saw a strange package hanging from the  sign. He took the package to a private residence at the  intersection of Ejercito de los Andes and San Roque Streets in  Jose Ingenieros district, and tried to open it, at which point  the device went off.    The young man was immediately taken to Santojanni Hospital  where the lower third of his right arm and the forefinger of his  left hand had to be amputated.    Leonardo Vicente, 18, Ariel Leroiani, 18, and a female aged  14 were accompanying Ruiz, who also sustained first-degree burns  to his right eye.    Vicente's face was also bruised by the explosion He was  taken  to Santojanni Hospital as well, but his injuries are not serious.    According to the Buenos Aires police the homemade bomb  exploded as it was being manipulated. They also reported that  four other explosive devices were found attached to the sign,  three of them 2.54 cm wide by 15 cm long, and the last one 1.27  cm wide by 20 cm long. The bomb squad buried and detonated them.    The sign to which the bombs were attached said "Let's fight  the labor reform," was signed by the ORP, and bore the red  communist star.    Shortly after the bomb exploded, Interior Minister Carlos  Ruckauf said that it was a "serious matter" although he added  that "these kinds of booby traps are nothing new."    Speaking to Radio Continental, the interior minister said:  "During these 10 years of democracy we have had this very same  organization (meaning the ORP) cropping up every so often and  setting these booby traps."

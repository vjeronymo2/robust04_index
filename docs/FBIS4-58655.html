			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Great concern over the PLO  request to delay the transfer of powers was voiced yesterday by  members of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] top echelons.  Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff, has recently  stated in a cabinet meeting that a delay in the IDF withdrawal  from the Strip is liable to provoke radical elements, who  realize they have nothing to lose, to carry out terrorist  attacks against IDF targets. A senior officer said yesterday:  "On the one hand, we must start cooperating with the  Palestinian police, and on the other, to pursue antiterror  activities."    The chief of staff and the Central Command commander have  instructed IDF commanders to pursue their ordinary operational  activities. And indeed, a long series of operational activities  was carried out during the past week, including the capture of  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad fugitives,  searches of Palestinian homes, patrols, and ambushes.

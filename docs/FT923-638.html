			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Brooke is surprise successor to Mellor THE POLITICAL career of Mr Peter Brooke, the former Northern Ireland secretary, was unexpectedly resurrected last night when he was appointed successor to Mr David Mellor as national heritage secretary. The announcement avoided a government reshuffle at the end of a traumatic week for Mr John Major and promotes a senior politician who, on past form, is unlikely to fuel cabinet rows over European and economic policy. Mr Brooke left the cabinet after the general election to launch an unsuccessful attempt to win the Commons' Speakership. His immediate task includes the future of the BBC's Royal Charter, the introduction of the new national lottery and policy on privacy and press regulation. Mr Brooke acknowledged the work of Mr Mellor in setting up the National Heritage department and said: 'It is a very large gap to fill.' The freedom of the press was 'an important part of our national heritage'. Earlier, Mr Mellor - a victim of relentless pressure from tabloid newspapers during the summer over his affair with an actress and a free holiday he received - said he had been the author of his own misfortune. He told the Commons: 'There was no question of any impropriety and I hope that I can leave office with that fact very clearly established.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yefim Lyuboshits under rubric "Opinions": </F> "Government Bureaucrats Hinder Improvement in Efficiency of  Defense Expenditures"]    [Text] My article entitled "How To Remove the Fat from the  Defense Budget" was published in SEGODNYA of 16 October 1993.    The impetus to write it was a statement by Ye. T. Gaydar  published earlier here that it was possible to save our economy  from disintegration only by reducing budget expenditures, in  which fat makes up a fourth of them as a minimum. And I wrote  that there is much fat in the defense budget, with the principal  reasons for its formation being the imperfect practice of  developing the defense budget, the absence of open  substantiation of expenditures by budget items, and the absence  of independent expert examination of the defense budget.    All this is the result of a tradition of many years of  striving for USSR military superiority at any cost without  regard for expenditures.    Those shortcomings can be eliminated by developing and  implementing a rational system for forming the defense budget.    My statement was supported by Professor V. I. Tsymbal, who  published the article "Just What Is Happening With the Defense  Budget?" on 18 November 1993.    The need for developing a system for forming the defense  budget also is supported by the content of an article by Yu. A.  Ivanov published in SEGODNYA on 19 January 1994. No practical  actions to improve development of the defense budget followed  after the above articles were published.    Realizing that Gaydar and his immediate assistants might not  have noticed my article in the fever of the election campaign, I  sent a personal letter to Yegor Timurovich through the reception  administration of the Russian Federation president and  government (Incoming 201967/A13-1 of 4 Nov 93), in which I  proposed a number of specific measures for developing and  implementing a system for forming the defense budget.    Unfortunately, this letter did not reach the addressee,  inasmuch as Ye. P. Arefyev, deputy head of the Russian  Federation government apparat, limited himself to sending off  copies of the letter and article to the ministries of Finance,  Economy, and Defense with the request to examine them and give  the author an answer. (A. S. Mishin was the executor). There was  no request in Arefyev's letter to inform Gaydar of results of  the examination.    The ministries of Economy and of Defense did not react in  any  way to this letter, but the Ministry of Finance sent an  invitation for an interview on this matter to Tsymbal, B. M.  Bashuk, a representative of the International Conversion Fund,  and myself. S. S. Kondrashov, who received us, explained that  there was no fat of any kind in the defense budget. To the  contrary, the Ministry of Defense has a catastrophic shortage of  funds. The existing practice of forming the defense budget  according to established norms fully suits the Ministry of  Finance, and so it categorically objects to the monitoring of  draft defense budgets by independent experts and to removing the  security classification from materials substantiating the  defense budget.    All our proposals for developing a rational defense budget  were declined.    An official Ministry of Finance response has not been  received to the aforementioned letter from the Russian  Federation government apparat up to the present time. But after  repeated reminders and almost two months after the meeting with  him, Kondrashov announced that a response had been prepared  which stated that the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  will not be able to perform the functions of client of the topic  of developing a system for forming the defense budget. That  response can attest only to the fact that the Russian Federation  Ministry of Defense is not interested in efficient expenditure  of funds being allocated for defense, which make up over 18  percent of Russia's budget.    Major General (Reserve) S. S. Kondrashov was in charge of  financial matters in the Ministry of Defense for many long  years, and in our discussion essentially defended the interests  not of the Ministry of Finance, but of conservative circles of  the military department.    The reaction to my letter by associates of the Russian  Federation government apparat and of the Ministry of Finance  indicates that some of them did not hold the same views as  Gaydar and B. G. Fedorov or were not interested in lowering  budget expenditures.    This example shows what an important role Russian Federation  government bureaucrats continue to play in making and  implementing important decisions. The CPSU was stripped of power  in 1991 and the Soviets basically were dismissed from power in  1993, but the power of the bureaucrats has not weakened--it has  strengthened. In the given instance they do not wish to allow  monitoring of formation of the defense budget by independent  experts and consequently the taxpayers.    Under the existing conditions I deem it necessary to publish  my version of the plan of action for removing fat from the  defense budget.    I deem the following steps advisable for a substantial  improvement in efficiency of expending funds from the defense  budget:    1. State Duma committees for Defense and also for Budget and  Taxes should make an offer to the Russian Federation government  to develop a package of documents on regulating the process of  developing the defense budget. Democratic factions of the Duma  could act as initiators of this proposal.    Based on the proposal of State Duma committees, the Russian  Federation government should charge the Russian Federation  Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economy with carrying out  the functions of client for the scientific topic of developing a  system for forming the defense budget, and also finance the  topic.    2. The topic client is to choose a head executor, which must  be a nongovernment organization.    3. Within a month's time, the head executor of the topic is  to develop, submit to the client and coordinate with him the  following:     -  draft list of documents necessary for normal functioning  of the system of forming the defense budget;    -  plan and estimate  of development of documents for the system of forming the  defense budget and other work on the topic;    -  list of  organizations and establishments which are advisable to involve  in developing the system of forming the defense budget.       4. Draft documents of the system of forming the defense  budget, developed within time periods prescribed by the plan,  should be sent through the head executor to all departments and  organizations participating in developing the defense budget and  developing documents on the system of forming the defense budget.    5. Within the time established by the plan, hold a  scientific  conference with involvement of all interested organizations, at  which discuss draft documents on the system of forming the  defense budget.    6. Based on results of discussion at the scientific  conference, appropriate developers are to modify documents on  the system of forming the defense budget and submit them through  the head developer for approval to the client and to the State  Duma.    7. To evaluate the efficiency of the system of forming the  defense budget in the course of fulfilling the topic, perform  calculations for a number of items to substantiate expenditures  for them for fiscal year 1994 and compare them with expenditures  envisaged for the defense budget for this year.    8. In the State Duma consider the question of establishing a  defense budget subcommittee made up of the Committee for Defense  or Committee for Budget and Taxes.    9. The Ministry of Defense [and] Russian Federation Federal  Counterintelligence Service, with involvement of the head  executor of the aforementioned topic, are to prepare proposals  to correct the Russian Federation Law on State Secrets of 17  June 1993 (No 5485-1), providing an opportunity for publishing  defense budget documents in the mass media, for familiarization  of independent experts with them, and for submission of  information on Russia's annual military expenditures to the  United Nations.    The United States of America is rich and well armed also  because it learned to spend funds for defense very efficiently.  Russia will not become rich until we learn to do this.</p>

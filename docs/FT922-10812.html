			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading TURNOVER in stock index futures improved on the recent meagre levels, although there was little in the way of strong features to help traders deal, writes Joel Kibazo. A quiet trading start in the June FT-SE contract soon gave way to large selling, reported to have been led by BZW, which sent the contract falling from its opening level of 2,682 to 2,666 by mid-morning. A good bout of two-way business followed, until the opening of Wall Street, when June followed the US market lower. However, it recovered shortly after, with a small squeeze seen just before the market closed. June ended at 2,680, down 10 on Monday's close and a point below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. Turnover was favourable at 7,276 lots. On the London traded options market, the brisk trade in Midland Bank, which may soon be the subject of a bid from Lloyds Bank, contributed substantially to the day's total turnover of 35,961. The FT-SE 100 option had a total of 14,190 contracts transacted. Among stock options, Midland recorded a day's total of 7,158 lots. This was followed by Marks and Spencer at 1,748, and British Steel at 1,430.</p>

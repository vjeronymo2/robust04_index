			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The recent congress of the New Democracy  (ND) party was the subject of commentary in the Greek press.  <H5>  Party Officials' Attitudes </H5>   In anticipation of the congress, the 19 April Athens daily  TA  NEA published a commentary by Yiannis Politis characterizing the  attitudes of various ND officials. ND Vice President Yiannis  Varvitsiotis, Politis wrote, will be ND leader Miltiadhis  Evert's "most faithful Supporter" and will advocate party unity.  Another ND official, Yiannis Kefaloyiannis, is accusing Evert  of engineering the Varvitsiotis vice presidency without previous  consultation and of ignoring the party's statutes. For his  part, Stefanos Manos states that "he will never undermine Evert  or participate in plots against him," despite the fact that  relations between the two have never been good, according to  Politis. Manos, Politis commented, makes no secret of his  ambition to become party leader but has confided to friends that  "he can wait as long as necessary, given that leaders are no  longer permanent." Evert's ideological opponent in the party is  Andreas Andrianopoulos, Politis continued. While Andrianopoulos  knows that his "neoliberal" positions have little resonance  within the party, he nevertheless wishes to "preserve them for  the future" after it becomes clear that "Statism has been  overtaken."  <H5>  Poll on ND </H5>   The 21 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI published the  results  of a 15-16 April poll conducted by the MARTEL organization in  the Greater Athens area among 800 individuals. Poll results  showed that when queried on what the ND should be as a party  after the congress, 27.2 percent stated that it should be "from  somewhat to completely similar" to the 1990-93 period, while a  majority of 66.2 percent said that it should be "totally  different." Some 6.6 percent did not know or did not answer.  <H5>  Profile of Party "Elite" </H5>   Yiannis Mavris comments on the results of a January-April  1993 poll on the ND's profile commissioned by the "Flash" radio  station and conducted among high government and party officials  of the 1981-1993 period. Of the 125 respondents, 54 (43.2  percent) were members of the ND. Their answers were published in  the 23 April I KATHIMERINI. Poll data revealed that the average  age of the ND leadership "elite" is 48. Some 59 percent of  these officials have a public school education, and the rest  come from private institutions. According to Mavris, this  differentiates Greece from other West Europe countries, where  political "elites" are shaped by "compartmented and very  specific school mechanisms." Some 84 percent either lived or  studied abroad. A total of 32 percent have a doctoral degree  and 30 percent hold a graduate degree. Some 38 percent studied  in Great Britain, 17 percent in the United States, and 14  percent in France. In general, Mavris continues, the ND "elites"  have not entered politics due to family tradition, since 72  percent stated they have no relatives in politics. Many  officials entered politics through youth party organizations (31  percent), with 26 percent reporting they entered politics before  the age of 25. However, 33 percent said they entered politics  after they were 40. It should be noted that 39  percent--compared to 16 percent for the Panhellenic Socialist  Movement (PASOK)--held a position in the private sector before  entering politics.    The poll asked officials to positions themselves on the  ideological-- political spectrum. The great majority (63.6  percent) declared themselves "liberals," 18.2 percent said they  are "neoliberals," 2.3 percent described themselves as  "conservatives," 11.4 percent said they believe in "other  ideologies," and 4.5 percent said they are "social democrats."  Respondents were given three choices when asked to state their  preference for other parties worldwide. Some 60 percent said  they feel closest to the U.S. Democratic Party, 52.5 percent to  the British Conservative Party, 50 percent to the German  Christian Democrats, 35 percent to the U.S. Republican Party, 20  percent to the German Social Democrats, and 12.5 percent to  France's Gaullists.  <H5>  Andrianopoulos Dissents </H5>   According to Yiannis Politis writing in the 26 April TA NEA,  Andreas Andrianopoulos strongly dissented from the congress'  decisions to reject neoliberalism as a party tendency. While  Evert is cited as saying that party officials are henceforth  duty bound to respect the decisions of the congress and that  ideological dissenters essentially put themselves "outside the  party," Andriansopoulos stated on 25 April that he "never made a  secret of his opinions" and charged that developments in the  congress "risk opening the way for dangerous new party  formations." Politis noted, however, that according to his  information Andrianopoulos will make no move before the European  Parliament elections, which will test the popularity of the ND's  ideology.    An interview with Andriansopoulos by Takis Mikhas appeared  in  the 21 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Andrianopoulos said  he did not agree with the ND's insistence on "consensus," noting  that the "consensus" the ND accepts means that "we are all  traveling in the same train, whose route, however, is determined  by the government." "Consensus" on the economy, Ansdrianopoulos  continued, means agreeing with the government that funds must be  collected to plug the deficit while ignoring ballooning  governmenst expenditures. In foreign policy, Andrianopoulos  said that he disagrees with the ND's approval of the  government's policy on "national Issues," despite Evert's  statement that dissent is almost equal to "treason." Never  before in recent Greek history, Andrianopoulos charged, has  Greece been so isolated in the Balkans, Europe, and the world,  first because of Athens' pro-Serbian stance and secondly because  of what is interpreted as an inimical Greek attitude on the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Speaking on the  government--imposed, ND--approved embargo on the FYROM,  Andrianopoulos termed the measure "catastrophic" and predicted  it will lead to an "impasse."  <H5>  Evert Statement Stirs Party Tensions </H5>   In the 28 April TA NEA, Politis reports that new tensions  arose within the ND following Evert's 27 April statement on SKY  radio that the ND is not yet ready to assume the reins of  government by demanding new elections, even if the party makes a  strong showing in the Euroelections. Evert's rationale, Politis  notes, is that the ND must first prepare itself to deal  efficiently with the problems the country faces. In a harsh  reaction to the statement, ND officials who support former Prime  Minister Mitsotakis charged that it "fails to provide a vision  and a goal" for Euroelection voters.  <H5>  Congress Assessed </H5>   Katerina Koletsi drew conclusions from the ND congress in a  28 April ELEVTHEROTIPIA commentary. Evert's goal for the  congress, she wrote, was to change "Mitsotakis' ND" into his own  party, which harkens back to its "Karamanlist" past. While  Evert achieved his goal at the congress, Koletsi continued, he  had not foreseen that Mitsotakis and his large bloc of  supporters, encouraged by ND official Dora Bakoyanniis strong  showing, would criticize him, that Andrianopoulos would react so  negatively to the rule forbidding neoliberalism as party  ideology, that while stating he is not a neoliberal, Manos would  disagree with Evert's decisions, and that Yiorgos Souflias would  express his concern about the party's course in the coming  months.    While at the three-day congress "forces were registered,  fronts determined, foes revealed, alliances concluded, and the  ND assumed the Evert identity," the "absence of political  contact between party officials" also became evident, Koletsi  said. The party, she concluded, is "walking on a tightrope,  united only in appearance, a unity that will endure only until  the final confrontation."</p>

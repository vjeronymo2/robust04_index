			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Costain omits interim after decline to Pounds 2.5m COSTAIN, the construction group which is seeking to sell all or part of its profitable Australian coal mining business, saw pre-tax profits more than halve, from Pounds 5.7 to Pounds 2.5m, in the first half of 1992. The group is passing its interim dividend (4.75p) after reporting losses per share of 1.3p (earnings of 1p). Turnover fell from Pounds 651.2m to Pounds 586.9m. Costain's share price slipped a further 2p to 27p. The figures underlined the need for the group to raise cash to reduce its borrowings which remain large despite the sale for Pounds 101m of its commercial property portfolio at the end of last year. The group revealed yesterday that it had been approached by several parties interested in acquiring all of its Australian mining subsidiary. Previously it had announced it would be selling a stake in the business which it intended to float this year. Group net debt at the end of June was Pounds 240m, including convertible preference shares but excluding Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet borrowings relating to the proposed Spitalfields office development in London. If that debt is included, gearing at the end of June would have been more than 100 per cent of shareholders funds of Pounds 276m at the year end. The Australian coal mining business is estimated to be worth about Pounds 130m but this would assume a purchaser taking on the subsidiary's local borrowings of about Pounds 40m. A sale would substantially reduce gearing even if, as seems likely, the group has to make further provisions on its UK housebuilding operations and on its share of the troublesome Spitalfields development. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said yesterday that the group would be considering what level of provisions, if any, it would need to make at the year end. He said that UK housing and construction markets remained deeply depressed. Housing incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 2.6m against a Pounds 4.2m loss last time. Construction and engineering profits fell from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 4.5m during the first half. Mining profits were down from Pounds 17.2m to Pounds 14.3m. Lower profits from Australia offset improved productivity in the US, the group said. COMMENT Without Australia to sell, Costain would be in even deeper trouble. As it is, a sale of the mining business could leave the group with gearing of anywhere between 50 per cent and 70 per cent, depending upon how the cards fall. The question then is what will the remaining businesses be worth. The group, although it will retain a small housing operation selling about 400 homes a year, is not an obvious housing recovery play. Margins in UK contracting are low at the best of times and at the moment are paper thin to non-existent. US mining has promised much but still has deliver. On the plus side the group is proving successful in overseas contracting where margins traditionally are better. Meanwhile, property provisions this year could be as high as Pounds 50m. There appears little reason to support the shares at least until Australia is sold.</p>

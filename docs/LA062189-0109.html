			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SQUABBLING IN THE AUTO WORKERS UNION;  </P> <P> UAW THWARTS DRIVE TO CRUSH COOPERATION;  </P> <P> DISSIDENTS LOSE BID TO CURB LABOR-MANAGEMENT PACTS SUCH AS 'TEAM CONCEPT'  </P> <P> After a raucous debate that went to the heart of the bitter controversy between  union leaders and dissidents, the United Auto Workers on Tuesday rejected a  dissident proposal to curtail the union's new spirit of cooperation with auto  industry management.  </P> <P> The proposal from the "New Directions" dissident group within the union called  on the UAW's top officers to "stop using competitiveness as an excuse for  caving in to management demands."  </P> <P> Introduced as a resolution during the third day of the union's national  convention at the Anaheim Convention Center, the proposal also called on the  union to oppose Japanese-style "team concept" labor agreements and other joint  labor-management programs spreading throughout the industry.  </P> <P> The resolution embraced much of the agenda of the grass-roots dissident  movement within the UAW, which has gathered strength over the last few months  as more and more American auto workers have become frustrated with the new  labor-management programs.  </P> <P> Critics argue that such programs have been manipulated by industry management  to subvert the power of the union and to force union members to work harder on  the shop floor. They also charge that such programs have failed to provide  workers the job security promised by management, and instead have given  companies an opportunity to lay off more workers.  </P> <P> "The team concept is a system they in management have used to pit one worker  against another," said Don Douglas, president of UAW Local 594 in Pontiac,  Mich., and a leader of the New Directions movement.  </P> <P> But the majority of the convention agreed with the UAW's leadership that the  union must not return to an old-style, adversarial relationship with  management. To compete with imports in an international economy, the leadership  insists that increasing cooperation with management is the only way to keep  auto jobs in the United States.  </P> <P> At the same time, the leaders say they have not forced team concept labor  agreements on any local unions that oppose them, and that they remain committed  to fighting management attempts to manipulate employee involvement programs.  </P> <P> "If some of these programs are bad, then we should fix them," said UAW Vice  President Don Ephlin.  </P> <P> The 2,000-delegate convention, dominated by supporters of UAW President Owen  Bieber, voted overwhelmingly against the resolution.  </P> <P> But not before the dissidents, given ample time during the debate by Bieber,  who is chairing the six-day convention ending Friday, closed out Tuesday's  session by getting the last word in on the issue.  </P> <P> "The team concept is a ploy to disarm our union," complained Lew Moye, a  dissident who presented the resolution. "What does the Japanese team concept  mean? It means smaller work forces . . . and a smaller membership for our  union."  </P></p>

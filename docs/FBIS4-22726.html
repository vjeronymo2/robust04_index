			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Yelagin: "Russia-Germany: Problems </F> and Prospects of Cooperation"]    [Text] After the collapse of the former USSR many political  scientists in both West and East Europe assessed the outlook for  the development of Russo-German relations rather gloomily. Of  course, there was a reason for this skepticism. After all,  relations between Russia, which started on the path to  democracy, and a united Germany were supposed to be built on a  principally new basis. But it is not that easy to establish such  a basis in a short time. Especially since both countries are  experiencing great difficulties in the economy, the social  sphere, and domestic political life.    However, daily difficulties have not overshadowed the  long-term promising objectives of bilateral cooperation. In the  opinion of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Germany  remains, as before, a key country for Russia, and an important  trade-economic and political partner. Seventeen percent of our  foreign trade turnover falls to it. The regular meetings of the  top leaders of Russia and the FRG indicate the scale of current  Russo-German relations. It is known in Western capitals that no  other state leader in Europe will maintain such close contacts  with Moscow as Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    But, of course, by far not everything is smooth in relations  between Russia and Germany. First of all, the Germans are  disturbed by the fact that until now Moscow has not been in a  position to pay its total debt in the amount of DM87 billion,  which piled up as far back as Soviet times. To regulate the  situation, in 1993 the Russian Federation and the FRG signed an  Intergovernment Agreement on Consolidation of the Debt of Russia  and the Former USSR, in accordance with which we were granted a  deferment for 10 years. Germany is making considerable efforts  to include Russia in the system of world economic relations, to  a considerable degree assisting the development of Russia's  relations with the European Union. There is talk in particular  about the formulation of a treaty on cooperation and partnership  on conditions that are acceptable to Russia. The Germans are  also supporting Russia's officially becoming the eighth member  of the G-7, first and foremost in the political sphere.    Moscow and Bonn support multilateral contacts on military  policy. Joint military-naval exercises of large units of the  Russian and FRG navies will be held this year. Troop exercises  on the tactical subunit level are also being planned for the  future. A center for training and retraining our servicemen who  are returning from Germany for civilian specialties was opened  recently in the Russian capital with the financial assistance of  the FRG.    Russia and Germany are activating cooperation in  international affairs that has attained significant maturity,  first and foremost in UN and CSCE policy. The FRG has declared  its readiness to support Russia's application to join the  Council of Europe. Bonn, which has many times shown itself a  supporter of creating strategic partnership relations between  Russia and NATO, supports the inclusion of Russia in the new  structures of collective security of Europe.    Bonn has welcomed the efforts of Russian diplomacy to lift  the crisis situation around Sarajevo, and it supported Boris  Yeltsin's proposal on convening a meeting of the leaders of  Russia and the leading European states and the United States to  consider questions of a Bosnian settlement.    Leading circles in the FRG pay appropriate attention to the  appeals of representatives of the Russian leadership to use the  FRG's influence on the question of observing the rights of the  Russian-speaking population in Estonia and Latvia in the spirit  of the decisions of international human rights organizations.  They believe that the problem of ethnic Russians in these  countries should not become a "bone of contention" in interstate  relations, and they appraise pertinent anti-Russian statements  of individual Baltic leaders as unacceptable and out of place.</p>

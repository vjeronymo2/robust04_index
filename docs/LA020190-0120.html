			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRILLING NEW WATER WELLS PROHIBITED  </P> <P> With new evidence that seawater has breached the county's largest underground  source of fresh water, officials have enacted an emergency ban to prohibit new  wells on the Oxnard Plain and proposed a permanent ordinance to reduce water  consumption there by 25%.  </P> <P> Tests in November warned growers and the four cities that depend on the ground  water that the county's deepest underground pools might have been contaminated  with seawater. Results from the U.S. Geological Survey announced Friday  confirmed those suspicions.  </P> <P> "There is almost no doubt that this is lateral seawater intrusion," county  hydrologist John Turner told the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency on  Friday. The public agency regulates ground water usage on the Oxnard Plain.  </P> <P> The emergency measure, which expires in six months, permits water users to  replace wells as they go dry or break down, but prohibits new wells.  </P> <P> "This is not a moratorium," said grower Lynn Maulhardt, chairman of the  Groundwater Agency board. But, he added, it does prohibit growers from  irrigating new farmland that has not previously used county water.  </P> <P> Seawater contamination can make water unsuitable for crops or municipal use,  water experts say.  </P> <P> Growers who packed the board hearing room last week sat quietly as the  emergency ban was discussed. Rex Laird, executive director of the Ventura  County Farm Bureau, said the growers understand the need for the restrictions.  </P> <P> "There is a finite water capacity," Laird said. "The issue is going to have to  be addressed whether we like it or not."  </P> <P> Only one person, representing an industry association of well drillers, pump  contractors and engineers, spoke in opposition to the emergency ban. Larry  Rottman of the California Groundwater Assn. threatened to sue the board if it  passed the ordinance.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the agency passed the measure 5 to 0 and instructed its staff to  prepare a permanent ordinance to replace the temporary measure when it expires.  </P> <P> The county's deep ground water system, which includes the large Fox Canyon  Aquifer, was previously believed to have remained pure despite six decades of  pumping more water than rainfall could replenish.  </P> <P> Officials have known since the 1920s that overdrafting allowed the gradual  encroachment of seawater into the more shallow aquifers. But over the past  several years the 800 water users on the Oxnard Plain, including the cities of  Ventura, Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Camarillo, dug their wells deeper to find  fresh water.  </P> <P> Deeper wells and the past three years of drought have strained the lower ground  water system, a series of deep freshwater pools, and allowed the seawater to  move in, Turner explained.  </P> <P> Those wells pump about 150,000 acre-feet of water per year out of the Oxnard  Plain, Turner said. The ban would prohibit pumping to irrigate the 3,700 acres  of agricultural land in the area that currently is not irrigated. Turner  estimates it would take a maximum of 10,000 acre feet of water annually to  irrigate that land.  </P> <P> An ordinance to reduce pumping 25% by 2010 will affect far more growers and  water users than the emergency ban, officials said. That ordinance calls for  the first 5% cut in consumption by 1992, with 5% decreases every five years  until 2010.  </P> <P> By that time, according to officials, the lower ground water system should  reach the point at which water draining into the underground pools is equal to  or more than the quantity being pumped out. That point is called safe yield.  </P> <P> The ordinance uses historical records on water use to determine individual  water allocations. If growers already are using water efficiently, and can  prove that they use less water than other growers with similar crops, their  allocations can be adjusted, according to the ordinance. Fines would be  assessed ranging from $50 to $200 per acre foot above allocations.  </P> <P> The next public hearing on the ordinance is planned for Feb. 23 in the county  Board of Supervisors Hearing Room. Officials hope to have the ordinance adopted  and in place by late spring.  </P></p>

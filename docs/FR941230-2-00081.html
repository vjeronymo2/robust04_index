(Hereinafter, the United States Virgin Islands will be referred to as ``the Virgin Islands.'') <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Topa Equities (V.I.), Ltd., is a holding company that wholly owns the Virgin Islands wholesale distilled spirits companies West Indies Corporation and Bellows International, Ltd. (Hereinafter, Topa Equities (V.I.), Ltd. and its subsidiaries will be collectively referred to as ``Topa.'') Topa has the distribution rights in the Virgin Islands for almost every popular brand of distilled spirits available in the world market. Distilled spirits means liquor products of all types intended for human consumption, including, but not limited to, whiskey, gin, vodka, rum, tequila, brandy, liqueurs and cordials, but excluding wine and malt beverages and non-alcoholic beverages. Topa obtained these distribution rights mainly through the acquisition of its competitors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The complaint alleges that the effect of the contracts in restraint of trade by which Topa obtained and has retained its monopoly position has been to lessen competition substantially, in violation of Section 3 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;3, by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Decreasing actual and potential competition in the wholesale distribution of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Depriving retailers in the Virgin Islands of the benefits of free and open competition because Topa is the only source for almost all distilled spirits products and there are no alternative sources for competing distilled spirits products; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Depriving suppliers of distilled spirits products to the Virgin Islands of the benefits of free and open competition, in part because Topa has inherent conflicts of interest in the representation of their distilled spirits products, such that the representation of one product necessarily results in diminished representation for competing products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 7, 1994, the United States and Topa filed a Stipulation by which they consented to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment designed to increase competition in the wholesale distilled spirits market in the Virgin Islands. The proposed Final Judgment, as explained more fully below, would order Topa to take no action to prevent its distilled spirits suppliers from canceling their distribution arrangements and appointing another wholesaler. The Final Judgment also contains a number of provisions ordering Topa not to interfere with the business operations of a competitor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States and Topa have stipulated that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered after compliance with the APPA. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate this action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction to construe, modify and enforce the Final Judgment and to punish violations of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

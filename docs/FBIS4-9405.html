			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Kocarnik, finance minister and deputy </F> prime minister, by Jan T. Vavra; place and date not given:  "EBRD Must Help in High Risk Regions"]    [Text] The annual meeting of the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was to outline the role of  the bank in the future. Most states are not satisfied with its  operation so far. The Czech Republic was represented at the  meeting by Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, whom we asked for an  interview.    [Vavra] How did the Czech Republic and the other countries  assess the operation of the EBRD?    [Kocarnik] Of course, the assessment of the operation of the  EBRD was marked by the election of Jacques de Larosiere as new  president. All central bank governors and other representatives  of individual countries expressed full support for him in his  efforts to transform the bank and introduce a cutback program  (salaries and expenditures freeze). We expect J. de Larosiere  to give the EBRD a new face.    Personally, I was very critical in assessing the operation  of  the bank, particularly in the sphere of small and medium-scale  business. Last year, for instance, we agreed on certain measures  in this sphere, which, unfortunately, have not been implemented.  This theme remains topical.    [Vavra] What basic goals have been set for the future?    [Kocarnik] We were asked to table the main ideas regarding  the future orientation of the bank. The main change should be  that the EBRD will approach the solution of the problem of  support for business much more intensively and in cooperation  with the domestic banks.    [Vavra] Have you made any demands on the EBRD?    [Kocarnik] First, I expressed the wish that the EBRD  participate much more in the actual industrial sphere than in  banking. We do not need it to enter our banks. The EBRD was  founded to take on a certain part of the risk in the  transforming countries rather than to enter problem-free  institutions.    It also came up in the discussion that the EBRD selected  approximately 25 of our medium or larger enterprises on which it  intends to work. I believe that these enterprises are the  optimum ones for the first entry of a bank, and they correspond  to our ideas.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Gilts: Attention turns to Pounds 2.5bn auction ALL eyes in the gilt-edged securities market will be fixed on Wednesday's auction by the Bank of England of Pounds 2.5bn worth of long-dated gilts - the biggest gilt auction so far. There is some nervousness in the market both due to the large volume of bonds and also because no one knows to what degree the class of securities on offer will appeal to overseas investors. Any problems encountered by the Bank in selling the bonds - 8.75 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2017 - would set poor auguries for the other auctions being planned for later this year. It appears the Bank will need to organise at least one auction every two months during 1992-1993. This will be part of the programme of selling Pounds 30bn or so worth of gilts - with the money raised funding Britain's public sector borrowing. In theory, such a large amount of gilt issues could depress prices and push up yields because of a surfeit of supply over demand. According to Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, securities maturing in 2017 are in a part of the yield curve where overseas interest is difficult to gauge. Many of the bonds on offer this week and in later auctions will probably need to find homes in non-UK institutions if Britain is to find enough buyers for the bonanza of securities which will be issued over the year. However, the events of the past few weeks have probably cheered the Bank as German and Japanese investors in particular have emerged among the strong buyers of gilts since the election. Inflows of cash from such investors have also been a factor boosting sterling, which has gained from DM2.85 before the election to just under DM2.93 at the end of last week. Strong overseas support for gilts has led to a broad rise in prices since early April, although last week this went slightly into reverse. The short-dated Treasury 10 per cent bond maturing in 1994 lost  3/4 of a point to close on Friday at 100 13/16 for a yield of 9.55 per cent - as against 9.4 per cent the week before. There was a  1/4 point fall for the longer-dated 9 per cent Treasury security due in 2008, which closed at 99 7/16 . Its yield correspondingly rose somewhat, from 9.03 per cent to 9.06 per cent. The price drop for gilts partly took its cue from a corresponding fall for German government bonds - which act as the benchmark for much of the European bond market. German bonds fell back as a result of a large increase in the German money supply. That indicated that inflationary pressures remain strong, and thus diminished the prospects of an early cut in borrowing rates by the Bundesbank. In Britain, hopes early last week that the Treasury might soon sanction a cut in UK base rates, held at 10.5 per cent since September, fell back later. That was largely on calculations that the UK's room for manoeuvre on changing borrowing costs would be limited by the probability that the Bundesbank would keep its own rates high for the foreseeable future. Economic data published last week in the UK had little influence on the gilt market. The statistics were mainly shrugged off on the basis that they applied to March, prior to the election result which many in the City argue may set the scene for a weak economic recovery later this year. However gilt yields could be pushed up if any evidence over the next two months points to a stronger recovery than has so far appeared to be likely. Indications of a revival were pointed to mainly by the latest trade statistics which showed the underlying volume of imports grew by 3 per cent in the first quarter compared with the final three months of 1991. Underlying export growth over the period was flat, underlining the slowdown in the world economy which might damp the pace of any UK upturn - a development which would restrain inflationary pressures and so act as a spur to gilt prices.</p>

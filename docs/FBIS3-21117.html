			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Semiconductor Technology Center of Matsushita  Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. developed the world's first  surface-emission laser optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC)  which can operate 10 times as fast as a conventional matrix-type  surface-emission laser. The center designed a unique system in  which transistors are mounted on lasers (transistor-on-laser)  and lined up 64 lasers in an array-formation in a cell that is a  480 micron square. Each laser has a built-in transistor as its  driver. As a result, this accomplishment makes 10 gigahertz  high-speed operations functionally possible and it will open up  the way to the attainment of optical computers and optical  switchboards.    Innovations in the CPU [Central Processing Unit] and such  have advanced the speed of computers. However, transmission  delays become a problem when there is an interchange among them  on networks. It has been pointed out that there are limits to  the present method used to amplify the signal by converting  optical communications into electricity.    Therefore, there is a strong need for optical switches and  such which will make ultra high speed circuitry possible for the  switching of optical signals, without conversion, between  optical fibers. The surface-emission laser is expected to be one  of the basic technologies to make this possible.    Although a chip has been developed which has integrated over  a thousand elements in the surface-emission laser, the  conventional product uses a matrix form of circuitry which needs  a large electric current to change the frequency of the laser.  Moreover, the circuit distance from the driver transistor is so  great that it makes high-speed operations difficult.    In this instance, the device developed by Matsushita  Electric  has 64 0.98 nanometer wavelength surface-emission lasers each  integrated with a driver transistor. This structure uses a  unique method of putting the transistor on top of the laser. By  doing this, Matsushita made it possible to increase the  high-speed operations to more than 10 times that of the  matrix-type and also made it possible to increase the density  and reduce the area to one third of the latter type. A special  quality is that it is feasible to increase the speed up of 10  gigahertz and it is expected that this development will  drastically promote the utilization of optical computers and  optical switches.</p>

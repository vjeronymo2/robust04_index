			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Birmingham introduces first Tec trainee charter BIRMINGHAM Training and Enterprise Council will be the first of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales to introduce a trainee charter. This will set out the rights and obligations of those in training. Agreement to observe the charter will be a contractual requirement, a Tec official explained yesterday. The charter is part of a general effort to raise training standards in the city. It is also a response to specific complaints from trainees about standards. This, last year, led Birmingham Tec to cancel contracts with Acafess and Cobalt UK, two local training companies. The text of the charter explains that it has been drawn up after talks with trainees. It specifies that each trainee should have a personal training plan agreed with the training organisation, the right to continuous assessment and written details of hours of work, holidays and pay-ments. Training should be undertaken 'by experienced and qualified staff' in 'a safe and properly equipped training and working environment'. Training on Trial, Page 13</p>

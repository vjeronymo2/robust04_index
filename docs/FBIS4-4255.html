			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (CNS) -- According to an annual  report on rural economic development (1993-1994) prepared by the  Rural Development Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences and the Rural Department of the State Statistical  Bureau, despite the increase in the labour-receiving capacity of  rural industries including construction, transportation,  industrial and commercial industries in 1993, the surplus labour  in rural areas in the country was still large in number.    The report shows that the employment structure in rural  areas  further improved last year with the scale of township  enterprises further enlarged and eight million farmers being  transferred into non-agricultural industries. The newly  increased working force in the rural areas for the year was,  however, still put at over seven million resulting in the  agricultural sector still being overcrowded with 340 million  labourers involved in it.    On how to solve the problem of transferring the surplus  labour in rural areas to non-agricultural industries, experts in  this field held that in the coming ten years, China must speed  up the development of fine-quality and high-efficiency  agriculture, tertiary industry and the agricultural product  processing industry as well as the process of urbanization in  rural areas, realizing the goal of large-scale and consistent  reduction of surplus labour in rural areas starting from 2010.</p>

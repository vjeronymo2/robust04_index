			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Belgrade can reopen airport Belgrade will reopen its airport to international flights today after a 28-month closure following a United Nations report confirming that Serbia's President Slobodan Milosovic has cut off all military aid and supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. The report, prepared by a UN monitoring team on the Bosnian border with what remains of Yugoslavia, clears the way for international flights and ferry services from Serbia and Montenegro and also sporting and cultural exchanges. The sanctions will be suspended under a 100-day moratorium and come as a reward to Mr Milosovic for cutting links with his former proteges, the Bosnian Serbs, in an attempt to force them into accepting the so-called contact group's pleace plan. Jubilant airport officials in Belgrade said the Russian carrier Aeroflot would make the first international landing when it brings Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, from Moscow today - Russia has traditionally been Serbia's closest ally. The Yugoslav national carrier, JAT, will resume flights tomorrow, and a ferry service will re-start from Bar in Montenegro to Bari in Italy. Other international carriers are expected to follow soon. Other sanctions, such as the ban on nearly all foreign trade and the freezing of foreign bank accounts, will remain in force, and diplomats in Belgrade say they are unlikely to be lifted until Mr Milosovic accepts international recognition of Croatia and Bosnia. EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg yesterday reaffirmed the commitment to tightening the exclusion zones, and their willingness to use air strikes. They also discussed how to increase the presence of the monitoring force along the border with the Bosnian Serbs. British intelligence has reported its satisfaction that the border has been sealed for six weeks. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said it was still important to improve the fragile situation around Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Alexandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- Six defectors from  Zhirinovskiy's faction in the Russian State Duma have announced  the creation of their own parliamentary group called "Derzhava"  (Great Power).    The ex-Zhirinovtsi, who earlier voiced their intentions to  join far liberal "Union of December 12" faction, this time  declared that they would contribute to the realisation of the  idea to set up the nation-wide patriotic "Derzhava" movement  proclaimed recently by former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy.    Rutskoy's camp seems to be not happy with such allies.  Chairman of Rutskoy's Russian Social-Democratic People's Party  [RSDPP] Vasiliy Lipitskiy told TASS today that the statement of  Zhirinovskiy's defectors "is in no way in line with the  interests and objectives of the RSDPP". He said that they have  made "a false step" by using the name "Derzhava" for their own  purposes.    "I really doubt whether the deputies who have not yet  displayed any solid principles would be able to represent  interests of any public movement", Lipitskiy said.    According to the State Duma's regulations, a new  parliamentary group needs to enlist at least 35 MPs to be  officially registered.</p>

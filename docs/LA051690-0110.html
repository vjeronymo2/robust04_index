			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGE TOPS BALLOT TODAY FOR DOMINICAN VOTERS;  </P> <P> CARIBBEAN: BOTH LEADING CANDIDATES FOR THE PRESIDENCY ARE IN THEIR 80S, VYING  FOR THE FIFTH TIME.  </P> <P> As Dominicans prepare to elect a president today, the paradox, like the  candidates, is an old one -- age.  </P> <P> Almost half of the population of 7.2 million is too young to vote, and more  than half of the rest are under 40. Yet both leading candidates are over 80 --  and it shows.  </P> <P> President Joaquin Balaguer, 83, seems as mentally sharp as he was as a young  lawyer, but he is physically frail, blind and vulnerable to a widely asked  question: "When they hand him an official paper, how does he know what he's  signing?"  </P> <P> His lifelong opponent, Juan Bosch, has enjoyed an edge in pre-election polls,  but he will be 81 next month, and already his occasional attention gaps and  memory lapses have begun to embarrass supporters.  </P> <P> Although the two octogenarians reportedly share warm personal feelings toward  one another, Balaguer has not hesitated to take unsubtle digs at Bosch's  apparent autumnal failings.  </P> <P> Last week, the Balaguer campaign broadcast a television commercial that showed  an apparently befuddled Bosch take a 19-second pause to collect his thoughts  while replying to a question at a meeting with the local American Chamber of  Commerce. The awkward pause ended with a Balaguer announcement that "a man who  thinks like that can't govern the country."  </P> <P> The incumbent's campaign has also stressed its slogan "Balaguer, a Road Without  Danger" to remind voters of Bosch's Marxist past and his reputation for  unpredictability.  </P> <P> Bosch may unwittingly have bolstered that image near the end of the election  campaign when, while speaking to a group of Protestant leaders, he implied that  he would loosen ties between the government and the dominant Roman Catholic  Church by naming Protestant chaplains to prisons and hospitals.  </P> <P> The pledge reminded some voters of Bosch's brief term as president in 1963,  when he angered Catholics by proposing a constitutional ban on religious  education in the schools.  </P> <P> Balaguer jumped immediately on Bosch's remark and led off his final campaign  speech Sunday with the cry: "We have no such disposition! The Dominican people  believe in God!"  </P> <P> Political analysts said that by opening the religious issue, Bosch may have  thrown away the 10-point lead that most polls have given him during the past  year. After confidently predicting a Bosch victory over a Balaguer  administration that has presided over 50% inflation and deteriorating public  services, they now view the race as too close to call.  </P> <P> Today's voting marks the fifth time the old warhorses have faced each other at  the polls, with Balaguer winning the previous four contests.  </P> <P> Both of the candidates have had a lifetime preoccupation with governing the  Dominican Republic.  </P> <P> Bosch, a self-educated high school dropout, poet, novelist and historian who is  called "the Professor" because of his wide-ranging knowledge, opposed the  31-year dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and spent three decades in  exile, much of it in Communist Cuba. After Trujillo's assassination 29 years  ago, Bosch won the country's first democratic election in December, 1962, and  served as president for seven months until ousted in a military coup.  </P> <P> When dissident officers triggered a civil war in 1965 to restore the  constitution and put Bosch back in office, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in  27,000 U.S. troops to protect the country from "becoming another Cuba."  </P> <P> At that point, Balaguer was in exile, widely reviled for having served as the  unelected figurehead president under the hated Trujillo. But when new elections  ended the U.S. presence in 1966, Balaguer won and has missed only two  presidential terms since.  </P> <P> As president he has patched together a failing economy by spending sums,  estimated at more than $2 billion, on public building projects, including a  towering lighthouse monument to Christopher Columbus just outside Santo  Domingo. Balaguer makes no secret of his ambition to remain president long  enough to dedicate the monument in 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus'  voyage to America, when Pope John Paul II and King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia  of Spain will visit.  </P> <P> Criticized for running government money-printing presses overtime to erect  monuments to himself, Balaguer is said to have replied, "The Pharaoh isn't  remembered for what he did to the price of flour."  </P> <P> But his greatest weakness at the polls, analysts say, remains his inability to  curb inflation and restore public services. Inflation has left the peso with  361% less purchasing power than when he was last sworn in four years ago, and  about half of the work force is unemployed or underemployed.  </P> <P> Despite their frailties, neither man appeared the least burned out by the  three-month election campaign, which ended Monday.  </P> <P> Although there are six other candidates, only two are expected to receive as  much as 10% of the vote.  </P> <P> At a political rally for Pena Gomez in Santiago on Sunday, an onlooker was  asked if he stood a chance of winning. "None," was the reply. Then who will  win? he was asked.  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, the old man."  </P></p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Beijing group abandons BCCHK rescue role BEIJING-controlled China Resources has dropped plans to participate in a consortium which is taking over Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong (BCCHK), acting general manager Li Liangxi said, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Li confirmed the decision and said: 'We will continue to study our future strategies for developing banking business.' The takeover of the local subsidiary of Bank of Credit and Commerce International, led by The Hongkong Chinese Bank, has been persistently delayed by snags centring on an expected Abu Dhabi guarantee for unrecorded liabilities. China Resources, which has diverse Hong Kong holdings, had shown interest in taking a 30 per cent stake in the consortium which agreed to buy BCCHK's assets and recorded liabilities from the government last November. No-one would comment at Hongkong Chinese Bank, part of Indonesia's Lippo Group.</p>

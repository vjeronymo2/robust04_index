			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Smith unsure of backing in tense battle on reform AFTER a day of union delegation meetings and the publication of the final motions on party reform it was still not clear last night whether Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, would win Wednesday's vital vote on reforming the union-party link. One Labour MP compared the tightness of the vote to the battle between Lord Healey and Mr Tony Benn for the deputy leadership in 1981. 'The atmosphere in the party is not as divisive as it was then but the outcome of the vote is just as important in terms of the perception of the party and its electability,' said Mr Giles Radice, a strong supporter of the Smith reforms. The Smith-backed National Executive Committee rule change, which excludes the unions from voting in the selection of parliamentary candidates, looks much more likely to scrape through after the delegation of Nupe, the public services union, decided to back it last night. Mr Tom Sawyer, deputy general secretary of Nupe, said after a tense delegation meeting: 'I say to everyone at this conference, do we want to win the next election? If we want to win it, we want to do it with John Smith as leader, and that means supporting him now.' Assuming that two-thirds of constituency parties have also backed the rule change then it should have just over 50 per cent support. If fewer than two-thirds of the constituency parties have backed the reform then the Smith/NEC reform may require the backing of the MSF white-collar union, or one of the other smaller unions. The MSF last night said it would decide later in the week. There are now four main composite motions on offer. Two of them, moved by the TGWU and GMB general unions, are strongly hostile to the one-member-one-vote reform. Although they both propose slightly different alternatives the two unions made clear yesterday they would be supporting each other. Nonetheless, neither is expected to win a majority. A third motion, moved by the loyalist AEEU craft union, is a strong statement of support for one member one vote and will certainly fail. A fourth composite, released only yesterday, moved by the RMT rail union and Nupe, and backed by the NEC, is a complex mixture of positions. It is likely to be passed - although it will be rejected by the TGWU and GMB. Speaking at a fringe meeting, Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, appealed to Mr Edmonds not to oppose the switch to one-member-one-vote in the vital debate on Wednesday. Mr Kinnock said he was certain the change would be approved and dismissed the whole idea that the campaign for one-member-one-vote was a plot to exclude trade unionists from the Labour party as a 'fantasy'.  -------------------------------------------- HOW THE SIDES LINE UP: (% of conference vote)  -------------------------------------------- Pro-Smith  -------------------------------------------- Constituency parties - 20%           (estimate) Nupe public service workers - 7.9 AEEU craft union - 7 Usdaw shopworkers - 4.6 Cohse health union - 2.8 UCW postal union - 2.5 RMT rail union - 1.7 ISTC steel union - 0.8 KFTAT knitwear union - 0.7 TSSA rail staff - 0.5 NCU clerical section - 0.4 CATU ceramic union - 0.3 Musicians union - 0.1 Nacods - 0.05 Socialist Societies - 0.7  -------------------------------------------- Total  ......50.05 per cent  -------------------------------------------- Possible pro-Smith or abstention  -------------------------------------------- MSF white collar union - 4.5  -------------------------------------------- Total  ....4.5 per cent  -------------------------------------------- Anti-Smith  -------------------------------------------- Constituency parties - 10%         (estimate) TGWU general union - 16 GMB general union - 12.4 GPMU print union - 1.7 Ucatt building union - 1.7 NCU engineering section - 1.4 NUM mineworkers - 0.7 FTAT furniture workers - 0.3 FBU fire brigades union - 0.3 Aslef train drivers - 0.3  -------------------------------------------- Total  ...........44.8 per cent  --------------------------------------------</p>

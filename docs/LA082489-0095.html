			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR VIEW ADOLESCENT CENTER TO HOLD DEDICATION CEREMONIES  </P> <P> Dedication ceremonies for the Harbor View Adolescent Center will be held 2 p.m.  Friday and will include a tour of the facility.  </P> <P> The facility will be operated by Regency Health Services under contract with  the county. The center will offer a 20-bed facility with skilled nursing staff,  a 30-bed community-care facility and an on-site school funded by the Long Beach  Unified School District, Supervisor Deane Dana said.  </P> <P> The unusual combination of services will enable adolescents to be treated in a  single setting without disruption. Court-ward youths ages 12 to 17 will receive  specialized psychiatric treatment. Often these youngsters have been physically,  sexually or emotionally abused by one or both parents, or their parents may be  ill, dead, incarcerated or have been placed in a state hospital themselves.  </P> <P> The new center began three years ago when the Board of Supervisors allocated $5  million for a center that could serve severely emotionally disturbed youths as  a means of improving their care and to lessen safety concerns at the  overcrowded MacLaren Children's Center.  </P> <P> The Harbor View Adolescent Center is at 490 W. 14th St., Long Beach. Ginger  Sumner is the center's administrator and Peter Zucker is the clinical director.  </P></p>

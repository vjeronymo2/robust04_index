			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Canadian dealers propose reforms to 'bought deals' CANADIAN securities dealers have proposed reforms to the system of 'bought deals' aimed at lessening their own risk in this type of underwriting and providing a greater incentive to canvass small investors. Bought deal financing has revolutionised the Canadian capital market in the past five years by giving local companies even faster access to capital than US issuers. The bought deal involves finalising an underwriting agreement either simultaneously with, or often in advance of, publication of a prospectus. Its other hallmark is the absence of a 'market-out' clause in the underwriting agreement, thereby barring underwriters from withdrawing once the price is set. Although bought deals now make up almost two thirds of all common equity offerings in Canada, they have drawn considerable criticism. Stockbrokers tend to concentrate their selling efforts on large institutional clients so that they can eliminate their underwriting risk as quickly as possible. Several high-profile bought deals in recent years have not been able to satisfy retail demand. According to the Investment Dealers Association, 'this perception of inequitable treatment among investors is not positive for Canada's capital markets to the extent it may lead to reduced retail participation in equity underwritings and secondary market transactions'. After a heated debate within its own ranks, the IDA has proposed two reforms. First, underwriters would be barred from soliciting advance commitments from institutions, known as 'pre-marketing'. This ban would apply to issues by the 180 or so companies which are allowed to offer shares on the basis of abridged prospectuses. The proposal aims at preventing the dissemination of information not available to the market as a whole. The restriction would not apply to private placements. Second, a gap of at least six hours (in practice, overnight) would be required between filing a preliminary prospectus and completion of an underwriting agreement. The IDA hopes this delay will encourage securities firms to solicit interest from smaller investors before committing themselves to a price. The IDA's proposals must still be considered by provincial securities commissions. The regulators are likely to call for comments from other interested groups before any new rules are put in place.</p>

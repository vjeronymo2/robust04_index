			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> VOYAGER CO-PILOT SAFE IN CRASH  </P> <P> Jeana Yeager, who made history in the non-stop round-the-world flight of the  Voyager in 1986, escaped injury Sunday when an experimental plane she was  co-piloting lost power and crashed on landing.  </P> <P> Elko County Sheriff's Deputy James Neff said the 38-year-old Yeager of Nipomo,  Calif., and the plane's pilot, Shirland K. Dickey, 48, of Chandler, Ariz.,  walked away from the craft.  </P> <P> The deputy said the pair were flying an experimental propeller-driven plane in  the Eighth Annual International E-Z Air Show and were on the final approach of  a 120-mile race between Jackpot and Wells, Nev., when their engine caught fire  about four miles from the runway.  </P> <P> "Basically, it was a dead-stick landing," the deputy said. On touching down,  the plane left the runway and its landing gear collapsed, he said.  </P> <P> Yeager and pilot Dick Rutan set aviation history in December, 1986, when they  flew the Voyager in a nine-day unrefueled circumnavigation of the globe.  </P></p>

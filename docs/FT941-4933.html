			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Balance of economic power begins to shift - David Marsh sees opportunities in Europe's lagging performance Europeans are no strangers to periods of lagging economic performance. The fortunes of ancient Egypt waxed and waned over 2,000 years, while most of Europe was a barbaric wilderness populated by goatherds. The cycles of world history have since accelerated and become interconnected, to a degree barely conceivable even a generation ago. As it tackles the problem of fading dynamism, Europe must weather a phase of unsettling political and economic transition. 'Europe can be under no illusion that it faces very strong competition from the US and Asia,' says Mr Ernst-Antoine Selliere, vice-president in charge of economic affairs at the French Patronat employers' organisation. 'But, provided we loosen constraints on our competitiveness, this can be an opportunity.' The European nations that launched the manufacturing revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries ceded industrial leadership to the US after the first world war. Now, as a result of global upheavals in technology and communications, another shift in the balance of economic power may be imminent - this time, towards the rapidly expanding economies of the Pacific Rim. Using World Bank data and its own assumptions about future growth, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) projects that, in the first decade of next century, purchasing power income per head in Singapore and Korea will exceed that of the US. Incomes in Singapore are already close to the west European average. According to similarly derived projections by UK accountants Coopers and Lybrand, the share of world GDP taken by Asian developing countries (including both China and India) could rise to 28 per cent in 2010 from 18 per cent in 1990. Western Europe's share would fall to 17 per cent from 22 per cent, while the US's would fall to 18 per cent from 23 per cent. This projection assumes annual growth in both western Europe and the US of 2.5 per cent, against 6 per cent in Asia. Even if the growth differential is less, Europe will drop down the economic rankings. But Europe's likely decline needs to be put into perspective. First, it is natural that less well-off countries move closer to wealthy ones. Over the past 20 years, the gulf between many rich and poor countries has widened. Where gaps have narrowed, they normally remain large. According to World Bank figures (based on constant dollar exchange rates rather than purchasing power parities), by 2000 the ratio between average GDP per capita in western Europe and east Asia will be an 18 to 1, compared with 48 to 1 in 1970. Second, as living standards rise in less developed countries, wealth should flow back to Europe through increased trade and investment. Provided European companies match international advances in management and technology, Europe can maintain a strong competitive advantage in goods and services the rest of the world wants. This requires that borders remain open and protectionist pressure is resisted. Professor Richard Portes, director of the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research, believes a narrowing of the wealth gap between Europe and the rest of the world need not be disastrous. 'I'm very sceptical about the views of the doomsayers.' Differences in real wages between western Europe and other manufacturing regions will narrow, he says, in the same way that US wages, relative to those in Europe, have fallen since the 1950s. This need not stop European living standards rising. According to UBS's projections, western Europe's growth rate will pick up early in the 21st century, as the continent benefits from the 'catch up' phenomenon, under which countries that lag adopt innovations from the leaders. A striking example of 'catch up' has been US success in the 1980s in reacting to the competitive threat from Japan by importing 'just-in-time' Japanese production technology, says Mr Bill Gasser, UBS's senior international economist. But, as it tries to adapt, Europe has one big disadvantage. The fast-increasing share of GDP taken by government spending in the past decade  -a rise well under way before the onset of the European recession in 1992-93 - has imposed a growing burden on business. Social spending is the biggest single portion of these outlays. The OECD says social security transfers in the EU will account for 21.5 per cent of GDP in 1994, up from 16.4 per cent in 1989 - double the percentage rise in the last downturn in 1979-1982. In relation to GDP, EU social transfers exceed US and Japanese levels by 50 per cent and 78 per cent. As a community of nation states, western Europe faces greater difficulties than the US did a decade ago in adopting common policies to recover dynamism. But Europe's diversity is also a trump card. Different parts of the continent can draw upon varying strengths and specialisations. There is little disagreement on the diagnosis of Europe's core problems. The task is to implement corrective measures: Growth of public spending on welfare is placing intolerable strains on budget deficits - one reason for high taxes and interest rates. Beyond simply cutting benefits, governments need a new balance between public and private sector social security provision. The number of old people in Europe could outstrip resources to care for them. Imaginative solutions will be required, returning the elderly to family environments and using technological advances to moderate medical costs. More flexible labour markets are needed, including improved possibilities for part-time work and less rigid wage-bargaining mechanisms. The collapse in demand for unskilled labour creates the potential for an integrated tax and welfare system allowing low-paid workers to be paid partly by employers and partly by tax credits. Europe must overcome its technological lag. Companies at the forefront of scientific advance must improve links both to the markets they serve and the education establishments on which they draw. Europe needs a better balance between the costs and benefits of environmental regulation. Environmental rules have not yet been a significant spur to innovation or competitive advantage. Plans for further integration, including widening (early next century) to central and eastern Europe, need to be based on liberal, open-market principles. Governments know Europe can prosper only if companies think globally. This can lead to some sharp modifications. Pointing to the large number of German companies shifting production abroad to escape high domestic costs, Mr Ludolf von Wartenberg, general manager of the Federation of German Industry, says companies are moving away from a 'Made in Germany' towards a 'Designed in Germany' concept. German industry will regain competitiveness, he says. But he admits doubts on how German society will cope with the strain. This type of corporate reaction can be painful, but the absence of adjustment would have still more disturbing consequences. If European enterprises and employees can muster the flexibility to manage change and the flair to master it, salvation is assured.</p>

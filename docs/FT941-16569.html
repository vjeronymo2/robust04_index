			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Video game makers in US to set up age rating system Video game manufacturers in the US, under political pressure to limit the violence and sexual content of their products, have agreed to set up a system to rate games according to their suitability for children. In an initial proposal outlined this weekend at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the Software Publishers Association, representing 1,100 companies, suggested a four-level system ranging from E for everyone to AO for adults only. Game makers would rate their own products, but they could be fined by an industry-appointed council if they violated agreed guidelines. Some video game companies, including Sega, which has overtaken Nintendo as US market leader, already publish ratings with their games, but the industry is still some way from final agreement on how to make the system general. In the UK, makers, including 3DO, Atari, Electronic Arts and software publishing houses, said they are developing a governing board to set standards. At the moment there is no separate UK ratings system for games. But as games get bloodier and more realistic with advanced graphics, the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn)-a-year industry is under mounting pressure from US Congress and from customers to crack down on some of the more explicit games. Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin have proposed a bill that would impose ratings on the video game industry if it fails to develop a satisfactory system of its own within a year. Although the Software Publishers Association proposal is now expected to form the basis for an industry-wide rating system, there is still disagreement among game makers over how such a system should operate. Some big companies favour an independent rating authority as the only way of ensuring uniform and credible standards, while others argue that the cost and delay involved in such an authority would be devastating to their profitability.

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Reinsurance losses spark legal action A LEADING European reinsurer is taking legal action in an effort to recover losses of more than Pounds 200m sustained in the London reinsurance market. Amsterdam-based Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep has started the action after running up heavy losses at its Victory subsidiary. The group says that its advisers failed to inform it about the extent of Victory's exposure to lossmaking spiral reinsurance business - in which Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsure each other's exposure to high-level catastrophe loss - when it bought Victory from Legal &amp; General in 1990. Solicitors Allison &amp; Humphreys last week served writs against Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, accountants Ernst &amp; Young and Swiss Bank Corporation. NRG alleges breach of contract and negligence against all three advisers. Mr Willem Dikland, NRG chairman, said the group had decided to take action after carefully reviewing the situation. He said the shortfall in reserves on Victory's marine and aviation reinsurance accounts amounted to Dollars 480m. The claim does not, however, specify any particular amount of damages. Bacon &amp; Woodrow said it would vigorously resist the action when NRG first announced the possible action in June. Swiss Bank Corporation said it had not been asked to advise on the extent of Victory's reserves.</p>

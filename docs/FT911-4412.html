			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Polaroid hit by slump in sales of instant film A SLUMP in sales of instant film contributed to a near-halving in Polaroid's first-quarter earnings. Net income slid to Dollars 16.4m, or 13 cents a share, from Dollars 31.8m, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose fractionally to Dollars 441.2m, with a 10 per cent rise in international shipments being largely offset by weak demand in the US. Operating profits, which fell by 24 per cent, were also hit by higher marketing expenses. The recession, as well as the slump in tourism earlier this year, contributed to the fall-off in film sales. Polaroid said retailers were keeping low inventories. On the other hand, there was a substantial - though unspecified - rise in shipments of cameras, conventional film and videotape. The popularity of cameras was helped by an aggressive campaign to promote the company's One-Stop Flash cameras, which sell for under Dollars 30 apiece. The company expects higher camera sales will be followed by stronger orders for instant film. Polaroid cut its long-term debt by 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 504.2m, and interest expense fell to Dollars 15.8m from Dollars 21.5m.</p>

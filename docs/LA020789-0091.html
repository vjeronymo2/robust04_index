			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS INSTRUMENTS WINS NAVY CONTRACT  </P> <P> The Navy awarded a $459.4-million contract to Texas Instruments Inc., combining  in one fixed-price contract its fiscal 1989 order for HARM missiles along with  that of the Air Force and West Germany.  </P> <P> The service, in a brief announcement, said it was buying 2,449 High-Speed  Anti-Radiation Missiles, or HARMs, from Texas Instruments. That combines an  order for 1,319 for itself, an additional 950 for the Air Force and 180 for  West Germany, the Navy said.  </P> <P> The sale to West Germany, worth $35.2 million, is the first foreign sale of the  weapon.  </P> <P> The HARM missile is an air-to-ground missile used to attack enemy radars of the  sort that guide anti-aircraft guns and surface-to-air missiles. The HARM  guidance system is designed to automatically lock on enemy radar emissions.  </P> <P> The Navy said the contract was awarded to Texas Instruments' Defense Systems  and Electronics Group in Dallas and would be administered by its Naval Air  Systems Command.  </P> <P> "Delivery of these missiles will begin in December 1990 and will continue  through November, 1991," the Navy said.  </P></p>

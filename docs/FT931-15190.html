			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Resurgence of quangos defies Thatcher's new broom: Lack of accountability identified - Bodies control more than a fifth of public spending QUANGOS are on the march again. Fourteen years ago Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, launched a cull of the quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations that carry out a wide range of administrative and regulatory functions on behalf of the government. Yet while the number of such unelected bodies has been reduced, their spending has not. Research by the Financial Times shows that the amount of taxpayers' money spent by quangos has risen in real terms since the Conservatives came to power in 1979. Quangos now account for more than a fifth of public spending, running the health service, distributing funds to higher and further education and dispensing legal aid. They reach deep into the business world through organisations such as the Health and Safety Executive, the inner-city development corporations and the Training and Enterprise Councils which deliver government-funded training in England and Wales. They are also extending their activities - taking over many schools, colleges, public-housing projects, hospitals and local health services. A report published at the end of last year by the European Policy Forum, the market-oriented think tank, showed that the UK's public services are increasingly run by a new elite that cannot be held to account. The growth has occurred in spite of Lady Thatcher's determination to attack the power and influence of quangos. In 1978-79, the last year of the Labour government, their number had risen to about 2,410. They employed almost 1.2m people and spent Pounds 14bn of public money. The newly elected Conservative government saw their growth as a symbol of how Whitehall had grown too big. Quangos were a way for the public sector to spread its tentacles throughout national life, spending money on functions that were often unnecessary or even damaging to a free-market economy. A study in 1979 by Sir Leo Pliatzky, a top mandarin, confirmed that view. He identified more than 240 executive and advisory bodies to be wound up, and by the end of the first Thatcher term, the number of quangos had been cut by almost 500. Early casualties included the Committee on the Artificial Insemination of Cattle and the Hadrian's Wall Advisory Committee. After the first Thatcher term, the pressure eased. In some years new quangos were added to the list as fast as old ones were scrapped. The Apple and Pear Development Council disappeared, for example, but the Apple and Pear Research Council made its debut. All 17 English new town development corporations in 1979 were wound up as their projects reached completion. But 10 urban development corporations were set up to manage inner-city regeneration. The Manpower Services Commission - the quango with second-largest budget in 1978-79 - was abolished. But its training functions have since been passed on to more than 80 new Tecs and to local enterprise companies in Scotland. Guidelines issued by the Cabinet Office in 1985 formalised the change of heart: new quangos were acceptable when they were 'the most appropriate and cost-effective solution'. Like previous governments, the Tories began to find the quango an appropriate and cost-effective solution to a growing range of issues. Quangos such as Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, and the National Rivers Authority were set up to regulate the privatised utilities. They provide a mechanism for intervening in private-sector companies in the public interest without re-imposing the ministerial interference that dogged the nationalised industries. When large metropolitan counties such as the Greater London Council were abolished in 1986, residuary bodies were appointed to run down their assets  -the only remaining one, for London, spent more than Pounds 360m in 1990-91, making it the 26th-largest quango. Housing Action Trusts have been set up to renovate large, run-down public housing estates in places such as Liverpool and Waltham Forest in London. They, too, are managed by boards appointed by the environment secretary, rather than by local authorities - which the government blames for the condition of the housing estates concerned. By 1990-91, the most recent year for which statistics have been published, the number of quangos had fallen to 1,846 - down 564 from 1978-79. But that smaller number was spending more in real terms than before Lady Thatcher started her cull. In 1990-91, quangos spent Pounds 41.7bn, three times that in 1978-79 and 20 per cent above the rate of inflation. Far from curbing the quangos, the Tory government had increased their spending power. Other reforms in the public services can be expected to increase the number and spending of quangos still further. New bodies are being created to manage public services as independent, competing organisations, with no direct accountability. Reforms to the National Health Service, for example, have created independent NHS trusts since April 1991 to provide health services. Almost all NHS hospitals and community health services will soon be controlled by 450 of these new quangos. The government expects more than 1,000 schools in England and Wales to have become grant-maintained by the end of this year, quangos run by their governing bodies outside local authority control. While a minority of governors will be elected by parents, most will be a self-perpetuating group who co-opt their successors, subject only to the right of the education secretary to appoint his own nominees. A new quango, the Funding Agency, will allocate resources to the grant-maintained schools and supervise their operations. Further-education colleges have also been taken out of local-authority control and are run by similarly self-perpetuating boards. Yet another quango has been established to fund them. As the European Policy Forum report says, that leaves public services increasingly under the control of unelected boards whose members are answerable only to the minister who appoints them and provides their funds. There is certainly no formal accountability to those who use the services and pay for them through their taxes. The members of the boards that run quangos are often little known, meeting in secret and not subject to external public scrutiny. According to the European Policy Forum there is also no body of administrative law to regulate their activities. Similar bodies in the US are required to publicise proposed policy changes and give opportunities for informed comment. Professor John Stewart of Birmingham University, one of the authors of the policy forum report, sees the spread of quangos taking Britain back to the 1880s, when local services were controlled by appointed lay magistrates rather than by elected councils. He says the move away from elected local government of public services is creating a 'new magistracy'. It is certainly not the outcome expected from a government that came to power pledged to sweep away these unelected and secretive bodies. There may be a valuable role for autonomous boards to play in public administration. But the growing power of quangos in the provision of public services means that there is no significant way in which they are directly accountable to those who use them and pay for them through their taxes.

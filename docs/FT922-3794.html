			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Capital adequacy The vexed issue of monetary union aside, today's meeting of European Community Finance Ministers will be even more fraught than usual. For the UK in particular, the debate on capital adequacy standards for securities houses represents a challenge of the sort relished by a certain baroness when prime minister. If a German-led proposal is adopted, securities houses will be subjected to the same rigorous capital standards as banks, despite the gulf separating their activities. The result for much of London's broking and underwriting houses would be nasty. Many brokers could no longer afford to do business. The Euromarket would face constraints on underwriting severe enough to drive public sector borrowers away. The precise effect on the UK's invisible earnings is impossible to calculate, but the direction is all too clear. The question is whether the UK government should seek merely to water down the proposals or to sidetrack them entirely. The latter would be preferable. There are plenty of existing rules designed to protect investors against brokers going bust. Moreover, the Basle committee on banking supervision and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions have been working jointly in this very area for months. Arguably they are better placed than the Commission to produce guidelines which are sympathetic to different securities markets' practices, if only because they are openly consulting the various participants. In practice, it looks as if the UK government will endorse a compromise which pays lip service to national differences but leaves the principle of tougher capital adequacy standards intact. That looks an unnecessarily risky trade.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) (A) The written notice must contain the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The name of each individual who may have been the subject of the alleged violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The date on which each alleged violation occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) An invitation to meet, either by telephone or in person, to discuss the case with the PRO, and to submit additional information to the PRO within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice, and a statement that these rights will be waived if the invitation is not accepted. The PRO must receive the information and hold the meeting within the 30-day period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) A copy of the regulations at 42 CFR 489.24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) For purposes of paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the date of receipt is presumed to be 5 days after the certified mail date on the notice, unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The physician or hospital (or both where applicable) may request a meeting with the PRO. This meeting is not designed to be a formal adversarial hearing or a mechanism for discovery by the physician or hospital. The meeting is intended to afford the physician and/or the hospital a full and fair opportunity to present the views of the physician and/or hospital regarding the case. The following provisions apply to that meeting: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The physician and/or hospital has the right to have legal counsel present during that meeting. However, the PRO may control the scope, extent, and manner of any questioning or any other presentation by the attorney. The PRO may also have legal counsel present. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The PRO makes arrangements so that, if requested by HCFA or the OIG, a verbatim transcript of the meeting may be generated. If HCFA or OIG requests a transcript, the affected physician and/or the affected hospital may request that HCFA provide a copy of the transcript. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The PRO affords the physician and/or the hospital an opportunity to present, with the assistance of counsel, expert testimony in either oral or written form on the medical issues presented. However, the PRO may reasonably limit the number of witnesses and length of such testimony if such testimony is irrelevant or repetitive. The physician and/or hospital, directly or through counsel, may disclose patient records to potential expert witnesses without violating any non-disclosure requirements set forth in part 476 of this chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) The PRO is not obligated to consider any additional information provided by the physician and/or the hospital after the meeting, unless, before the end of the meeting, the PRO requests that the physician and/or hospital submit additional information to support the claims. The PRO then allows the physician and/or the hospital an additional period of time, not to exceed 5 calendar days from the meeting, to submit the relevant information to the PRO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Within 60 calendar days of receiving the case, the PRO must submit to HCFA a report on the PRO's findings. HCFA provides copies to the OIG and to the affected physician and/or the affected hospital. The report must contain the name of the physician and/or the hospital, the name of the individual, and the dates and times the individual arrived at and was transferred (or discharged) from the hospital. The report provides expert medical opinion regarding whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition, whether the individual's emergency medical condition was stabilized, whether the individual was transferred appropriately, and whether there were any medical utilization or quality of care issues involved in the case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The report required under paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section should not state an opinion or conclusion as to whether section 1867 of the Act or &sect;489.24 has been violated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals or when there was no screening examination, the PRO review described in this section is not required before the OIG may impose civil monetary penalties or an exclusion in accordance with section 1867(d)(1) of the Act and 42 CFR part 1003 of this title. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If the PRO determines after a preliminary review that there was an appropriate medical screening examination and the individual did not have an emergency medical condition, as defined by paragraph (b) of this section, then the PRO may, at its discretion, return the case to HCFA and not meet the requirements of paragraph (g) except for those in paragraph (g)(2)(v).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

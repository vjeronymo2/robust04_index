Colombia is no exception, and  currently the presence of U.S. military forces in this country  has generated a strong dispute between the State Council and  President Cesar Gaviria. What do Latin American countries think  of the U.S. military presence in our nations? Let us recall  that not long ago in Paraguay and Uruguay, senators reacted  against the presence of U.S. technicians in their countries.  Let us immediately begin to learn the viewpoint of each nation.  Let us begin with La Paz, Bolivia. Welcome Juan Jose Hidalgo.    [Hidalgo] Thanks, Eduardo. Good morning, Latin America. The  presence of U.S. troops in Latin America has raised concern and  has prompted various responses. In Bolivia, they use the word  technicians, even the word doctors, to avoid direct reference to  the U.S. military regarding the presence of U.S. military units.  To deal with this issue, we have invited Senator Andres Solis  Rada, who is among those who have strongly criticized the U.S.  military presence in Bolivia. Senator Solis will give us his  opinion regarding the current situation in Bolivia. Senator,  130 million Latin Americans are listening to you. Good morning.    [Solis] Good morning, and a Bolivarian greeting to my Latin  American brothers. We believe that the systematic presence of  the U.S. Armed Forces in our countries is the result of the  existence of a new U.S. strategic doctrine regarding Latin  American countries. That doctrine is called the new world order,  and it was outlined by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan [as  heard] immediately after the U.S. invasion of Panama on 20  December 1989.    According to the new world order, concepts such as  sovereignty, nation, armed forces, dignity, patriotism, or  borders are obsolete terms. This doctrine comprises both a  pretext and a practical reality. The pretext is the fight  against drug trafficking. We believe that if the United States  truly wants to eliminate drug trafficking, it can achieve this  goal very in a short time -- I would say two or three weeks.  How? It can simply control the laundering of $3 or $4 billion  by international banks. Instead of controlling the banks,  however, the United States has opted to send military forces  with the illusory goal of catching mosquitoes with boxing  gloves. The biggest drug traffickers are not in the jungles,  but in New York's skyscrapers or in the modern buildings of  Latin American capitals. Therefore, this is all a great pretext.    We believe their primary objective is the occupation of the  Amazonian region. According to the developed countries, the  Amazonian region is one of the world's lungs, but from the  Eurocentric viewpoint, humanity only includes Europeans and  white North Americans. According to this outlook, the Amazonian  region does not belong to Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Venezuela,  Ecuador, or Colombia, but to them. They are seeking to rule the  world with ideas that date back to 200 years ago -- the ideas of  Adam Smith or Thomas Robert Malthus.    To illustrate my point, I will recall that in May 1992, 400  U.S. engineers, who were specialists in troop landings, arrived  in Bolivia. The odd part was that to justify their presence, it  was argued that they were coming to repair schools and dig  latrines. These schools and latrines cost $20,000, while  providing transportation for these 400 U.S. engineers rang in at  $8 million. Therefore, they are clearly not coming to build  latrines or schools; they are getting ready to occupy the  Amazonian area, especially the Brazilian part, where there is  the greatest opposition to this policy.    Their second goal is to get people used to the presence of  foreign troops. Before I conclude, I cannot overlook the  occupation of our countries by police forces. We have denounced  the fact that Bolivia's major cities -- La Paz, Cochabamba, and  Santa Cruz -- are patrolled 24 hours a day by agents under the  command of Bolivian officials and who also work for the U.S.  Government. Their vehicles have license plates that belong to  international cooperation or intelligence services. In the end,  if we remain passive regarding this situation, we will soon  become colonies with a parliament and a flag, but the parliament  and the flag will merely be a facade to cover this intervetion.  Nevertheless, a slave who realizes his slavery begins to be  free. Let us realize this situation of dependence to be loyal  to Simon Bolivar's legacy and resist the very tense situation we  are currently living. This is our viewpoint from La Paz,  Bolivia.    [Hidalgo] Thank you Senator Andres Solis Rada. You have  heard the senator's position, which strongly questions the U.S.  military presence in Bolivian territory. Back to you, Eduardo  Lozano.    [Lozano] Juan Jose, I really appreciate your report from La  Paz, Bolivia. What are the thoughts in Venezuela? What are the  Venezuelan people's ideas on whether or not they agree with the  U.S. military presence? Caracas, welcome Elsy Verrueta:    [Verrueta] Many thanks, Eduardo Lozano, and good morning to  all our Latin American listeners. The topic has been a matter of  controversy in our country in the past. The possibility that  U.S. military forces could come to Venezuela arose emerged and  it became the task of Division General Fernando Ochoa Antich to  take charge of the problem. First, he was defense minister and  then foreign minister until 2 February. He is our guest and he  is going to give us his opinion and how he handled the  situation. Of course, we also want to hear his opinion about the  possibility that U.S. troops could remain in some Latin American  country. Go ahead Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich, we want to hear  your opinion.    [Ochoa] Many thanks. First, I want to take advantage of this  extraordinary opportunity to send my cordial greetings to the  Latin American people listening to us. When I was defense  minister, I had the great responsibility of negotiating, with  the United States, agreements for the antinarcotic radars.  Venezuela was very firm in the position we presented to the U.S.  negotiators, and we managed to convince them this was not  possible in Venezuela because of a basic feeling or principle  among Venezuelans of not accepting foreign troops under any  circumstance, even though they were unarmed.    Venezuelans would not accept, under any circumstance, that  the radars be handled by U.S. troops. If this point was not  amendable, then these radars could simply not be located in  Venezuela, with all the consequences this would have had for the  struggle against drug trafficking. We managed to convince the  United States; they understood the Venezuelan position and  fortunately an agreement was reached whereby the radars are  operated entirely by the Venezuelan Armed Forces.    This is a very strong feeling, both among Venezuelans as  well  as Latin Americans. I really cannot understand how Latin  American Governments can accept foreign troops in their country  -- mainly U.S. troops -- behind the back of the people, even  though these troops need not be involved in any military  activity. This is a problem of nationalism, which is deeply  entrenched among Latin Americans because of our sad history of  colonialism. That is why we and the people have always rejected  this. This, despite the fact that current relations with the  United States are much more constructive than relations based on  Marine invasions. None of our people can accept the presence of  foreign troops in our country due to our concept of liberty,  which is so very much a part of our feeling.    Another very basic point, which was discussed very  intelligently by the Bolivian senator, is the interest in the  drug-trafficking problem. The U.S. interest toward our countries  right now, aside from the permanent interest in raw materials,  is simply to do with drug trafficking. There are two very  complex problems. One, their interest that our Armed Forces  direct the work to fight drug trafficking. I have maintained a  doctrinal position on this. The Latin American countries' Armed  Forces cannot be used against drug trafficking because the  corruption capacity of drug trafficking would force the Armed  Forces to lose their main capacity as institutions intended to  defend our countries and sovereignty. Therefore, this is a  position that Venezuela has also maintained very firmly by  rejecting the idea that our Armed Forces be used to fight drug  trafficking.    We accept that the National Guard, which is part of the  Armed  Forces but tasked mainly as an administrative police, can be  used for this. In no way, however, will we accept the  involvement of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force in fighting  drug trafficking because this would change the main purpose of  our Armed Forces. The third point, which I believe is very  important and which I will stress, is that the struggle against  drug trafficking cannot be successful until consumption in  developed countries is controlled, as it should be. This is a  fight which these countries must face because while the drug  trafficking business remains so productive, this struggle is  simply a loss of time, even though we are fighting. In this  respect, I admire the people of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, who  are waging an all-out war against drug trafficking, with a lot  of sacrifice.    The fact of the matter is that until consumption is not  checked and until money laundering is not controlled, we simply  cannot be successful in our struggle against drug trafficking.    [Verrueta] Thank you Gen. Fernando Ochoa Antich for your  valuable opinion. We return once more to Eduardo Lozano.    [Lozano] Thank you Gen. Ochoa for your participation in  this special program. Now we are with Jorge Ivan Melo, in Quito.    [Melo] Thank you, Eduardo. Greetings to our 130 million  listeners throughout Latin America.    In 1987 in Ecuador, the Ecuadoran and U.S. Armies signed an  understanding memorandum to allow military maneuvers and works  in support of the civilian population. This resulted in the  construction of a road that according to budget figures should  have been 57 km long. Only 2,200 meters were built.    We invited retired General Richelieu Levoyer to discuss  this.  He has been government minister, general commander of the Army,  and a deputy. Currently, he is the president of Omidelac,  Organization of Military Men for Democracy and the Integration  of Latin America and the Caribbean.    General, what has been the result of the U.S. military  presence in Ecuador?    [Levoyer] Thank you. First I want to cordially greet the  Latin American community, which is very concerned about this  very important issue. I can say the Ecuadoran people have always  been opposed to the presence of U.S. troops in our territory.  These troops sometimes come to build roads but the fact is we  have excellent military and civilian engineers who can do this  work.    We also find it strange that U.S. troops have to come here  to  build one, two, or three small schools in the countryside. This  is something our civil engineers, who can rely on the  cooperation of the teachers, can do perfectly well. Why then  must troops, and not civil engineers and technicians, come here  to build roads or schools?    In any event, the clearest evidence of the Ecuadoran  people's  position on the presence of U.S. troops in our country took  place in 1987. I was a congressional deputy at the time. In  March of 1987, there was a tremor that destroyed an interior  road in our country's Amazon region, the Baeza-La Guagrio road,  leaving approximately 100,000 people isolated.    The U.S. Army and our government reached an agreement called  Opening Routes. Based on this agreement, the U.S. Army would  open an alternate 57 km long road going through the towns of  Ollin, Loreto, and Coca. A total of 6,000 soldiers, arriving in  groups of 600, came to the country to do the work in six months.  The performance of this task force, the U.S. 1169 Task Force,  was, to say the least, lacking. As a member of the congressional  commission charged with overseeing the work of the U.S. troops,  I personally confirmed that they built only 2,200 km  [measurement as heard] of road.    [Melo] General, the Bolivian senator and some Ecuadoran  analysts have said the U.S. military wants to learn about Latin  America's geography to put pressure on the jungle areas and to  familiarize the people with U.S. troops so a future invasion is  not seen as odd. How true could this be?    [Levoyer] I agree with what Bolivian Senator Andres Solis  Rada said. The 1987 event confirms his statement. That year I  personally spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Powell, the commander  of the U.S. group that came to build the alternate road in the  Amazon region, and he emphatically and carelessly told me the  U.S. objective had been accomplished: the training of U.S.  soldiers in a jungle area like ours. He told me the U.S. troops  had become accustomed to performing in this type of environment.    Regarding the objectives of cooperation with and the  transferal of technology to our military engineers, these  objectives failed because equipment was lost, the soldiers did  not know the river flow variances, their equipment sank in humid  regions, and they could not work well.    [Melo] We thank retired General Levoyer for his  participation  in this Solar program. Now we go back to Santa Fe de Bogota.    [Lozano] Thank you. We will now contact Dennis Vargas, in  Lima. What do Peruvians think about the involvement of U.S.  military forces in aid programs? Go ahead Dennis.    [Vargas] Latin America's tradition has been that of  defending  the principles of nonintervention and sovereignty. This should  be clearly established in international law. American or North  American doctrine on international law better outlines these  principles. In the specific case of drug trafficking, we would  have to analyze the situation. Legislative Branches are always  concerned about respect for the legal framework of fighting drug  trafficking in the various countries, especially in Bolivia,  Peru, and Colombia. Some concepts put international law in  danger when there is meddling.    Our guest today is General Sinecio Jarama. We are asking  him, as part of the Solar network, about the U.S. military  presence in Peru or how much of a presence there was before and  what can he tell us about the topic. What is the role of U.S.  soldiers or military engineers in our countries? Over 100  million Latin Americans are listening to you.    [Jarama] I would first like to thank you for this  invitation. I also wish to send greetings to those 100 million  Latin Americans listening to the Solar System. Getting into the  topic of whether U.S. troops should be in our countries, it is  worth noting first that this has been and remains a permanent  concern for all Latin Americans, both civilians and military  personnel. Second, it is also worth noting that in Peru there  has been adamant opposition to the authorization of the presence  of foreign troops in our territory. Whenever this has happened,  or whenever there have been complaints about it, the people or  various political or social sectors have reacted by demanding an  explanation, and the appropriate authorities have explained the  matter. Third, I also want to point out that the presence of  foreign troops is addressed in the constitutions of all our  countries. This is not a decision or whim on the part of the  Pentagon or the U.S. Administration. Our constitutions give  specific details of the measures to be followed, the steps to be  taken, or the institutions to be consulted when a foreign  country wants to bring its troops into our territories. This is  also a problem that involves the exercise of our sovereignty.  The president and his military advisers normally handle such  matters. In addition, the respective legislatures must be asked  for their authorization; that is, the countries' respective  legislatures. That is where the exercise of our sovereignty  comes in. I must also say, however, that over the past four  decades, from the 1950's until now, the United States, through  its military offices or military attache offices, has maintained  relations with our military forces. These relations have  allowed the development of cooperation programs, which are  basically military training programs that have entailed joint  actions by combined U.S.-Peruvian forces. There are also  programs like Operation Unitas. There are other programs that  are part of the training of U.S. reserve troops, which is the  case with the troops in Panama. They come with engineer  battalions, conduct training exercises, and leave behind some  benefit for the community.    [Vargas] Thank you, Gen. Jarama, for being with us on the  Solar network. We are returning to Santa Fe de Bogota. Eduardo.    [Lozano] Thanks, Denis, you are very kind. General Gabriel  Puyana, our guest today, is a very well-known military man in  Colombia, and although he has retired already, he is a true  Colombian. We only have a minute, General. We would like to  hear your opinion as a military member and a Colombian regarding  the presence of foreign troops -- in this case, U.S. soldiers --  in Colombia.    [Puyana] Thanks to Radio Cadena Nacional and the Solar  Network. Since I only have a minute, I will be clear and  concise. I was able to hear part of what the other guests have  said on this program, and basically I agree with them.    A distinction must be made, especially with the current  controversy in Colombia, between troops being in a country on a  temporary or permanent basis. The Inter-American Reciprocal  Assistance Treaty signed in 1947 has been mentioned here. We  must recall that Colombia participated in Korea. However, we  must differentiate between technical advisers, who teach and  help facilitate learning about new and sophisticated equipment,  and regular troops, because the latter causes wariness and  rejection.    But there are different viewpoints about this issue. People  in those isolated areas, who have been systematically and long  forgotten by various governments, are satisfied because their  urgent needs are somewhat relieved. But let's not confuse the  issue. We cannot think that a military attache in another  country implies a foreign military presence in that territory.  The Peruvian General has discussed this already. These are two  different situations.    In addition, our histories give us certain obligations. If  there are two countries that must assume dignified attitudes,  setting aside the pragmatism of convenience, they are Mexico and  Colombia. We must only recall Theodore Roosevelt and how Panama  was taken away from Colombia. We were definitely better off,  because it is as if one's arm is cut off [words indistinct], it  is better to cut off the arm as it happened to Colombia. We  were better off that another country, Panama, had to bear all  that it has had to tolerate and will tolerate in this unending  century. That is why I believe the presence of armed forces --  to be specific, logistics and operational units -- should not  be accepted.    There is some background to this issue. For example, there  was an operation here called America 1962. We must clarify that  there is a difference between technicians who teach and help and  troops who are here on a permanent basis.    Regarding the recent controversy, the problem arose  basically  due to a mishandling of information. It was very sad for  Colombia -- and I say this as a Colombian -- that we had to  learn about the entire episode through a statement by the  ambassador as if this were a unilateral decision by the  Pentagon. It was disgraceful. There has been a lack of  information and misinformation. I want to reiterate that this  is my personal opinion: I am not quoting anyone. As a  Colombian, I do not approve of U.S. soldiers being here and  doing things that we can do ourselves.    [Lozano] Many thanks, Gen. Puyana, you have been very kind.</p>

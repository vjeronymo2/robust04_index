			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang on-sang: "My </F> Plea to Clinton: No Trade Sanctions"]    [Text] My visit to Washington and New York three weeks ago  was an excellent opportunity to reinforce cordial relations with  the United States. I was impressed in my meetings by the  interest and goodwill felt towards Hong Kong and China by  leading figures in government, the U.S. Congress and business  community. I came away encouraged by a belief there was a good  deal of common ground on which to forge a closer understanding  between the Chinese and American people.    An item high on my agenda was the United States' annual  renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status.  It is a debate we in Hong Kong have watched with anxiety for  five consecutive years. Some have become dismissive of the  threat but it is probably more threatening now than previously.    There are deep concerns in the United States about human  rights. The choice President Bill Clinton now faces is a  difficult one: how to avoid a destructive confrontation with  China without appearing to compromise the human rights issue on  which he has placed so much emphasis. Whatever he decides,  concern in the U.S. and elsewhere about human rights in China is  not going to disappear. It will be a recurring theme that  requires a means of expression. But it would be in all our  interests to find a means of doing so without a direct  confrontation over economics and trade.    If something good has come of this painful annual process,  it  is the way that it has encouraged discussion of human rights, a  matter of great importance to us all as Hong Kong prepares for a  change in sovereignty. It is not something we can sweep under  the carpet. There may be different ways to approach it but  constant effort to improve human rights is fundamental to the  development of civilised society. The question is not whether  to seek to promote respect for human rights but how best to do  it. Those of us in the Hong Kong Government have consistently  maintained threatening trade sanctions is not the best way. I  made the point forcefully on many occasions during my U.S. trip  and many agreed with me.    Trade is one of the oldest and purest forms of international  cooperation. It brings people together, creates wealth and  progress and encourages changes. Its effects on southern China  are a good example. Lifestyles for millions of people have  improved for the better, with not only the comforts and  convenience of consumer goods such as refrigerators and  motorbikes, but also televisions and fax machines that bring the  outside world closer. Freedom of movement, choice of  occupation, readiness to speak out are all far greater than  could have been imagined a decade ago.    The economic growth which trade brought to southern China  has  not been without its drawbacks. The transition from an agrarian  to an industrial economy has been a difficult one. Worker  rights, worker safety and environmental protection, for example,  require the discipline of regulatory standards that are only  patchy at first and take education and resources to develop.  Trade produces both, particularly trade with a country such as  the U.S. which is concerned about these issues. Reduce that  trade and the good influence diminishes. Expand the trade and  the free flow of ideas will become a flood. Many people in the  U.S. are persuaded by these arguments. They want to keep doing  business with China, both because they believe it is in the  economic interests of the U.S. but also because they see a trade  conflict with China would actually undermine human rights there.  They believe developing trading links would increase  opportunities for dialogue and change.    The "Hong Kong argument" also carries weight in Washington.  Of course there are public misconceptions about Hong Kong in  the U.S. and we are doing our best to correct them. But among  political leaders and opinion formers there is a remarkably good  understanding of Hong Kong's significance in this region as a  gateway to China. It is also a model of free trade, business  enterprise and good administration, a platform for U.S. business  in Asia and an economic dynamo for the region. There is great  reluctance to do anything which would penalise Hong Kong or make  life more difficult for us at such a challenging time in our  history.    Some I met knew something of the importance of Hong Kong to  China and the region but had not appreciated just how damaging  withdrawal of China's MFN trading status would be to Hong Kong's  economy. The fact two-thirds of foreign investment in China  originated from Hong Kong surprised them as did the two-thirds  of China's exports to the U.S. and one-third of American goods  going to China which passed through Hong Kong. I took the  opportunity to provide our latest analysis of the economic  impact of MFN withdrawal on Hong Kong -- up to 75,000 jobs lost  and GDP growth cut by between 2.2 and 3.1 per cent. There is no  doubt the immediate impact of MFN withdrawal would be severe. I  went on to point out Hong Kong managed to sustain impressive  confidence about its future, thanks largely to its healthy  economy. The success of closer economic co-operation between  Hong Kong and China helped win acceptance in Hong Kong that its  future was inextricably linked with China's. Diminish that  economic success and it would be a great deal more difficult to  sustain confidence in Hong Kong as we approach 1997. It is a  depressing argument to use but it carried weight with those in  the U.S. concerned about this region and American interests here.    Of course it is possible, or even likely, MFN will not be  withdrawn totally this year and instead some form of selective  sanction imposed. I made it clear I thought quite apart from  the practical difficulties of, for example, attempting to  distinguish between goods produced by state and non-state  enterprises, there were considerable risks. In addition, the  introduction of any form of trade sanctions created uncertainty  for Hong Kong because it was impossible to insulate the  territory from the effect of sanctions against China and the  almost inevitable retaliation.    Each of these arguments is a case for renewing MFN without  conditions. Taken together, they make a strong case for  pursuing concerns about human rights in a way that does not  threaten trade and economic ties.    This was the first time a chief secretary of Hong Kong has  been received at the White House by an American vice-president.  It was a public recognition of how important Hong Kong has  become to the U.S. and an important demonstration of goodwill  and support. It was also, I believe, a recognition the Hong  Kong Government's position on the MFN issue is being taken  seriously. It is certainly a position we intend to stick to.</p>

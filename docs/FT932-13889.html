			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Marubeni sees loss on reshape MARUBENI, the Japanese trading house, yesterday said it would record extraordinary losses of Y40bn (Dollars 350.87m) for the year to the end of March 1993 because of the restructuring of three affiliates and losses incurred on securities investment funds. The company said the losses would be covered by profits on the sale of fixed assets and stocks, and would not affect its net profits for the year, expected to be about Y12.5bn, down from Y17.4bn. Like many other Japanese companies, Marubeni put funds into tokkin, or specified money trusts, which were an important source of income during the late 1980s but which have become a serious burden over the past three years. Marubeni said the cost of restructuring its ailing textile, leasing, and petrochemical affiliates would total Y20bn, while the tokkin losses would also amount to Y20bn. It did not say which fixed assets will be sold to cover the losses.</p>

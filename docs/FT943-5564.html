			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Child Support Agency chief quits post early Mrs Ros Hepplewhite resigned yesterday as chief executive of the bitterly criticised Child Support Agency, more than 18 months before her contract was due to expire. Speculation had been growing through the summer over whether Mrs Hepplewhite would survive until April 1996 to complete her contract in charge of the agency, set up last year to ensure that absent parents took financial responsibility for their children. In July she was forced to admit, both in her first annual report and in an appearance before the Commons social security committee, that in its first year the agency had failed by a wide margin to meet government-set targets. In her resignation letter to Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, she said: 'I am hopeful that the new arrangements will in time benefit many families and be more widely recognised as an important and necessary innovation.' The agency was set up with considerable all-party support, but few MPs can have been prepared for the avalanche of complaints they have received from constituents since it began operating in April, 1993. Many have concerned the agency's decisions, with criticisms that it was interfering with 'clean break' settlements and undermining the stability of second families by making excessive financial demands. Another large group of complaints, however, has been about the agency's poor efficiency. In her first annual report, Mrs Hepplewhite was forced to apologise to those with whom the agency came in contact for difficulties they had experienced. She admitted that the agency's performance had 'not always measured up to the high standards we set out to achieve'. Financially it fell Pounds 112m short of its government target of raising Pounds 530m in benefit savings last year, while MPs on the social security committee claim it managed to collect only Pounds 15m in new money. Mrs Hepplewhite was recruited to run the agency from the mental health charity Mind, where she was director. Her resignation coincides with political anger over Thursday's transfer of Republican prisoners to Northern Ireland by the Prison Service, headed by Mr Derek Lewis, a former television executive. The two events may revive concern among some MPs about the appropriateness of recruiting people without Whitehall experience to run public agencies. Mrs Hepplewhite's successor, Miss Ann Chant, is a career civil servant with 31 years' experience who has been chief executive of the Contributions Agency since it was formed in 1991. Mr Lilley, replying to Mrs Hepplewhite's resignation letter, paid tribute to her 'courage and dedication' in introducing reforms under pressure. Ministers hope that an improvement in the agency's efficiency may defuse criticism of the wider child support policy. Critics say only a considerably more flexible approach to pursuing maintenance payments will achieve that.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: IT TOOK TIME, BUT U.S. STEEL LEARNED LESSON  </P> <P> In Pittsburg, Calif., last Thursday, the U.S. Steel division of USX Corp. and  its partner, Pohang Steel Co. of South Korea, dedicated a parable for our  times.  </P> <P> With speeches hailing the globalization of industry from USX Chairman David M.  Roderick and Pohang managing director Young-soo Han, the joint venture known as  USS-Posco Industries launched a refitted steel mill equipped with the very  latest in industrial technology.  </P> <P> And there was evident pride among the 1,100 U.S. employees who would work the  new machines. "There is nothing like this anywhere in the world," said Harold  Dominguez, who helps oversee a complex of five giant roller machines that press  steel into thin sheets.  </P> <P> Dominguez had been sent to Quangdong, South Korea, to train on the equipment.  His co-worker Bill Medeiros had been sent to Japan and South Korea. All told,  150 Pittsburg employees were sent to West Germany, France, Japan and South  Korea to train on up-to-date equipment -- which told them something about the  good old U.S.A. "We saw how far behind was the American machinery we were  working on," says Medeiros.  </P> <P> How, you may ask, did we get to the point where American employees of U.S.  Steel -- the firm organized by J. P. Morgan himself in 1901 -- had to be sent  abroad for training so they could work a mill half-owned by a steel company set  up only 20 years ago by the Korean government?  </P> <P> The Pittsburg plant's history can tell you the answer, as well as much else  about industrial competitiveness -- how things were done in the past and how,  happily, they'll be done differently in the future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hurt by Imports  </P> <P> Pittsburg was an old U.S. Steel facility that supplied the fruit and vegetable  canners, office equipment makers and construction industries of growing  California -- some of its steel built the Oakland Bay Bridge.  </P> <P> But in the 1970s, it began to lose out to Japanese steel imports. Soon  Pittsburg could only make the bottoms and backs of Steelcase desk drawers,  explains E. A. Roskovensky, who runs the plant today. The mill couldn't supply  visible parts of a desk because its equipment couldn't produce  consistent-quality steel, and Steelcase didn't want customers thinking their  desks were warped. By 1984, when imports had taken 52% of the market, the  choice of close down or fight back had to be made. Roderick, to his credit,  opted for battle, signing up Pohang as a partner.  </P> <P> The two companies have invested $430 million to outfit the mill with the latest  in steel-making equipment from Mannesmann of West Germany, Hitachi of Japan and  others. The plant's computer-controllers are American, from General Electric  and Honeywell, but the steel equipment is from overseas.  </P> <P> Why? Because such equipment is no longer made in the United States, the result  of two decades when other countries kept building or modernizing steel plants,  but nothing was built here. "In steel, the state of the art is advanced by  building a new plant and we didn't have the money to build a new plant," says  U.S. Steel President Thomas Graham.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fell Further Behind  </P> <P> Other countries built steel mills to industrialize their economies, as in South  Korea, or to provide employment for their citizens, as in Europe. And all  nations counted on the U.S. market to absorb the resulting surplus, Graham  explains. U.S. industry didn't make such uneconomic investments, he says, and  therefore spared American taxpayers the burden of subsidized steel plants that  foreign taxpayers are now complaining about.  </P> <P> But a price was paid, nonetheless. The U.S. industry refrained from unwise  expansion, to be sure. But it also neglected modernization of its old plants,  relying instead on wringing production from outdated equipment and arguing for  cutbacks in labor costs to become competitive. But such efforts were no match  for the cost savings and quality improvements achieved by new equipment -- so  the Americans fell further behind their foreign rivals.  </P> <P> It was a curiously selective investment policy: In years when investment  bankers and "junk bond" geniuses made millions of dollars from deal-making,  there was no money to improve productive equipment.  </P> <P> Sins of omission have consequences. The pride and education levels of America's  work force suffered. If industry keeps working with outdated equipment, there  is less need for the math and verbal skills that modern computerized machinery  demands. And grunt labor turning out poor quality steel doesn't command the  higher pay that goes with productive equipment, either.  </P> <P> Something else has been lost, as well. An industrial base has disappeared, as  equipment suppliers to heavy industry have gone out of business because there  were no orders.  </P> <P> Which is untimely because U.S. demand for steel equipment is now rising.  Capacity has been cut to the point where American steel is profitable and  imports -- affected by currency shifts -- are losing out. The Pittsburg plant,  now the low-cost steel supplier in California, will demonstrate that there's a  payoff to investments in making better steel more efficiently.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Improvements  </P> <P> And other steelmakers will follow up in years to come, says Chairman Roderick  of USX. "The American steel industry will pour its profits into plant  improvements," he says.  </P> <P> Great news, but the curious prospect today is that progress will mean more  orders for Mannesmann and Hitachi, and more study abroad for U.S. workers --  with the whole process, predictably, being hailed as a wondrous example of the  globalization of industry.  </P> <P> To be sure, the glass is half full, not half empty: Steel mills and jobs are  being upgraded, and the pride of the American work force is being restored. But  somehow there's a nagging question of whether quite so many Americans had to  suffer before U.S. industry learned some simple lessons.  </P></p>

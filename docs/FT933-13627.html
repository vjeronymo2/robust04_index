			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Flanders comes to Cambridge - Patricia Morison enjoys an illuminating collection of late medieval art at the Fitzwilliam museum IT IS not tremendously likely, but imagine a day when conservators exercise complete control over the shape of art exhibitions world wide. Imagine, too, that the conservators then decreed that historic artifacts should lead virtually risk-free lives at home. No more grandiose government-sponsored shows of the like of last year's Hispania-Austria, which procured hundreds of exceptionally precious 15th-century artifacts from museums in Europe and America, and freighted them first to Toledo and then to Innsbruck. What kind of art exhibitions might we then see? An exhibition of 15th-century Flemish art which has just opened at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge suggests what might be achieved if ever the age of the jet-setting art-treasure ends. Splendours of Flanders; Late Medieval Art in Cambridge Collections brings together some 70 exhibits - panel-paintings, drawings, one well-preserved tapestry, sculpture, coins, an iron-bound safe on wheels, printed books and illuminated manuscripts. Unsurprisingly, the largest share of objects belongs to the Fitzwilliam's own collection, where they can be seen (so long as you arrive on the right day; the downstairs, with its medieval treasures in the Rothschild Gallery, is closed in the afternoons.) A significant number of exhibits belong to colleges and the University Library, and are not readily on view. Not many Cantabrigians normally manage to inspect Sidney Sussex College's iron-bound chest. It was brought back in 1607 from a synod in Flanders by a Master who, like his 20th-century successors, seems to have been concerned to step up college security. The massive chest had a complex locking mechanism of three keys which required to be operated in sequence by the junior bursar, the senior bursar, and the Master himself. Queen's College has lent the exhibit which is the 'discovery' of the exhibition; three panels showing scenes from the life of Christ, which would have been the wings for a large altarpiece. Remarkably, it seems that the panels may have been in England since before the Reformation. The show's curators give this rare survival to the Master of the View of Saint Gudule, a Brussels artist with a fondness for lively scenes and male figures with features like pug-dogs. In Queen's chapel, the panels can be viewed only from the front, whereas in the exhibition the saints on the reverse are also visible. Among the Fitzwilliam's own Flemish paintings, the most famous is Joos Van Cleve's Virgin and Child, a lovely image of a baby who seems just that instant to have fallen asleep on his mother's breast, to her huge satisfaction. Another more modest Virgin and Child is thought to be by the Joos's son, Cornelis Van Cleve. 'Daft Cleve' was one of the Flemish artists who in the far less favourable conditions of the mid-16th century, decided instead to try his luck in England where (for reasons unknown) he went mad. Manuscripts and books are unquestionably the strength of the 'Splendours of Flanders'. Among single leaves detached from illuminated manuscripts are several by the famous master, Simon Bening. One of his full-page illuminations of The Annunciation shows in the margin a charming scene of the Virgin apparently going for a stroll in the countryside, followed by an angel, presumably carrying her workbox, not her lunchbox. The Lord of Enghien we see in a full-page illumination in his personal Book of Hours, kneeling before St Hubert, the patron of hunters. Someone else paid handsomely for a Bruges manuscript with a fine set of the traditional Labours of the Month, enlivening the calendar of feastdays and saints' days. We can only see the book open at September, harvesting grapes, but photographs of the other months also show scenes of sophisticated urban life  -driving about in carriages and in May, courting one's mistress with a band of minstrels. What I particularly liked about this exhibition is its clear explanation of the role of medieval religious books, particularly Books of Hours. These were virtually mass-produced in towns like Bruges, Tournai, or Valenciennes. Many were exported to England with the addition of English saints, such as St Thomas Becket. In the Low Countries, ruled for a century by Burgundian dukes with the keenest appreciation of fine books, it was an essential mark of social status to own an attractive book of prayers. The richer the client, the more miniatures and illuminated capitals he or she could afford, not to mention 'personalised' books in which they and their name-saints appeared. The skills of even a thoroughly dull painter did not come cheap. In a fascinating and highly readable book published earlier this year, Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work, (Yale; Pounds 35; 210pp.) Jonathan Alexander points out that in 1463, the celebrated artist, Simon Marmion, earned enough from illustrating just one manuscript to have the thatch on his house replaced with tiles. By no means all the books are religious. The humanist outlook of the Renaissance is represented by a group of manuscripts which do not come from Cambridge. They are four superb illuminated manuscripts of classical texts borrowed from the library established in the 18th century by Thomas Coke of Holkham Hall in Norfolk. No doubt the famous agriculturalist particularly enjoyed the page in the Virgil Collected Works which illustrates farmers' tasks, everything from coppicing to luring a swarm of bees. The fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition is well worth having, not least for an excellent historical introduction narrating how the Dukes of Burgundy pieced together their great inheritance in the Low Countries, broke with France, and created a Burgundian 'nation'. (A comparison between the sexual appetites of Philip the Good and President Kennedy is thought-provoking.) Catalogue and exhibition are sponsored by the bank Gemeentekrediet (Credit Communal) and the Flemish government, which has named the show Cultural Ambassador for Flanders. Is this the first time that a foreign sponsor has been willing to pay up for a show which will only be seen in a foreign country? The Fitzwilliam made clear that the works of art were not going to go to the Flemings. So the sponsor agreed that is the Flemings who must go to Cambridge - after all, it is only a short hop to Stanstead. Is this, then, to be the nature of arts sponsorship in the 21st century?</p>

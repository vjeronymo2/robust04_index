			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- An emergency meeting  for peace in Korea took place in Washington on June 14.    The meeting was attended by representatives of some 30  organizations and figures, including Yim Chang-yong, former  South Korean ambassador to the United Nations, the Rev. Syngman  Rhee, former president of the National Council of the Churches  of Christ in the United States of America, the executive  director of the American Committee on Korea and a representative  of the One Korea Movement.    Speaking at the meeting, Yim Chang-yong called for the U.S.  Government to hold negotiations for a fundamental solution of  the Korean question, and the Rev. Syngman Rhee said the U.S.  Government should explore possibilities of normalizing  diplomatic and trade relations with North Korea.    An appeal adopted at the meeting contended that the nuclear  crisis should be solved peacefully through continued dialogue  and negotiation. The United States and North Korea should  continue high-level talks for a solution of the nuclear crisis  and normalization of relations, it said.    It stressed that in order to ease the military tension in  Korea the U.S. Government should sign a peace agreement with  North Korea and terminate the state of ceasefire in Korea and  that the nuclear issue must be solved along with all other  issues between the United States and North Korea through a  package agreement, not by fragmentary proposals.    The U.S. Government should continue to explore possibilities  of normalizing diplomatic and trade relations with North Korea,  the appeal said, adding that the way of dialogue should be used  in every way to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>

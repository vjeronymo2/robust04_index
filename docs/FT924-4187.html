			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: BBL chief executive steps down amid bid backlash THE CHIEF executive of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's big three banks, resigned yesterday following the failure of Internationale Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch financial services group, to bid for BBL. Mr Theo Peeters, together with most of the BBL management, was a strong supporter of the ING proposals, but the Dutch group abandoned its plans last month after disagreeing with the Belgian bank over the price to be offered. ING, which had conducted a full audit of BBL's books, wanted to pursue a co-ordinated 'bancassurance' policy with the bank. 'Let's just say that Mr Peeters personified a certain policy,' said a bank spokesman yesterday. 'As this policy seems to have failed, he preferred to withdraw.' The group's chairman, Mr Jacques Thierry - another supporter of the ING link-up - confirmed that he would step down in April, having reached the statutory retirement age. The announcements are an indication that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company and largest shareholder in BBL, is reasserting its hold over the bank. GBL, which is headed by Mr Albert Frere, had lobbied hard against an ING bid, suggesting that it could come up with an alternative solution. One possibility which Mr Frere was thought to favour was a link-up with Credit Communal, the banking network owned by Belgian municipalities. But BBL said yesterday that there were no further negotiations in progress, and stressed that the reshuffled board of directors would concentrate during 1993 on improving the bank's profitability. The announcement is unlikely to end speculation about the bank's future as ING continues to hold a 10 per cent stake in BBL. A BBL statement welcomed the promise by GBL and other shareholders to 'guarantee the stability of the shareholder structure'. 'Numerous studies of the bank made recently by external consultants have not revealed any new problems and have highlighted the existence of several areas of excellence,' the statement added. The group is to re-examine its foreign operations, although BBL said it would not be withdrawing altogether from overseas activities. Mr Peeters has been replaced as chief executive by Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, a board member, while Mr Thierry will be succeeded by Mr Jacques Moulaert, who is also a managing director of GBL.</p>

It has already contracted to buy the output of the Johnston field, which is expected to be in production later this year and has a life expectancy of about 11 years. The field is operated by Hamilton Oil. Mr John Devaney, Eastern's chief executive, said the purchase was part of the plan for developing an integrated gas business.

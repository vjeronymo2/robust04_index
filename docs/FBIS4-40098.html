			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 14 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy withdrew his lawsuit against the head of  the "Democratic Russia's Choice" Party, Yegor Gaydar, who he  accused of comparing him to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The  decision came after Gaydar had announced that he would  personally appear in court to defend his statement that  Zhirinovskiy resembles him the "Hitler of 1929".    Zhirinovskiy's lawyer Sergey Belyak told TASS that the  lawsuit was withdrawn on June 7, but Gaydar, who came to the  court on Tuesday, said he knew nothing about that and showed a  summon, according to which he had to be present in court as a  defendant.    Gaydar believes Zhirinovskiy should have appeared in court  to  explain his decision which, according to him, is "another  evident proof that aggressive people are often very cautious".    However, Zhirinovskiy plans to file a new lawsuit against  Gaydar and the "IZVESTIYA" newspaper which published his article  in which Gaydar insists that Zhirinovskiy is a fascist and  analyses his rhetorics. The lawsuit is to be filed on June 17,  Belyak told TASS. He added that another lawsuit will be filed  on June 27 against Nikolay Svanidze, an anchorman of the Russian  TV, who claimed that Zhirinovskiy had paid members of his Duma  faction 500 US dollars for voting in favour of the 1994 budget.    According to the lawyer, some 20 lawsuits against various  media and politicians had been already filed by his client.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Japanese Economic Measures: Tokyo polishes trade defence AS senior US officials arrived in Tokyo yesterday, the Japanese government was preparing its defence on trade and proudly displayed yesterday's fiscal stimulus package. The massive US trade deficit with Japan has kept American politicians, industrialists and academics busy debating a variety of measures to deal with the problem. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday said Japan needed to commit itself to solving individual trade issues. His comment reflects the favoured approach in Washington lately, which has been for the US and Japan to set quantifiable import targets for specific market sectors. However, Japan has been arguing for a macro-economic approach to reducing its trade surplus. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, in Tokyo for the G7 meeting, acknowledged Japan's efforts to stimulate domestic demand for foreign products, but added that the country was in a good position to be able to do a great deal in spurring economic growth because of its sound fiscal position and huge external surplus. In reply, Japan's trade ministry claimed that the package would boost faltering domestic demand and reduce the trade surplus. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) said: 'If the US is concerned about the trade imbalance, I think the economic package of this size will be enough.' Aside from trying to support demand through public investment projects, the package includes measures to promote imports by cutting interest rates on loans by public financial institutions for sales of imported goods. Limits on loans to foreign companies by the Export Import Bank of Japan are to be raised and the government also pledged procurement of foreign products for facility investments. The government said the measures could boost the country's imports by more than Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.9bn). It has also tried to assure the US that foreign manufacturers would get a fair share of the new public procurement. However, Japan has been careful not to set a fixed goal for public purchases of foreign goods, and Mr Hatakeyama said the government's purchases would be determined by open bidding. 'Although many import-friendly items are included in the government procurement plan, there is absolutely no room for us to agree to the 'goal' approach because it leads to misunderstanding and managed trade,' he said. Japan's frictions over the semiconductor arrangement with the US prompted its cautious stance towards quantifiable targets. In the semiconductor arrangement the two countries agreed that the US expected to see the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market rise to 20 per cent by the end of 1992. While Japan insisted that the market share figure was no more than an expectation, the US side interpreted it as a commitment by Japan. Meanwhile, the Japanese government claimed that a factor which would offset its efforts to boost the economy was the further strengthening of the yen. The US is seen to favour a higher yen to reduce Japan's exports, but Mr Hatakeyama warned that an excessively rapid rise would reduce the impact of the economic measures. Although Japan was in a position to accept the long-term appreciation of the yen, 'too drastic an appreciation of the yen is not good for our economy,' he said.</p>

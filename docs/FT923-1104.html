			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Sterling devaluation raised imported wool costs overnight but in Australian cents the market remained steady last week and into this week. The AWC market indicator was only very slightly lower at 532 cents a kg. on September 23, compared with 542 a week before. Business in the UK did not improve significantly ahead of last week's enforced departure from the ERM constraints, and buyers now remain very wary. The accompanying sterling depreciation against the US and Australian dollar is keeping prices rising but there are stocks which some are willing to use to keep price rises in check.</p>

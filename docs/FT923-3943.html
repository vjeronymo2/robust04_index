			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: NY Times Dollars 35m item to reflect closure cost THE New York Times will record an after-tax charge of about Dollars 35m, or 45 cents a share, in its third quarter results, reflecting the cost of shutting down The Gwinnett Daily News, a daily newspaper operating in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. Cox Enterprises, the regional media group, has agreed to buy some of the paper's fixed assets. The New York Times bought the Gwinnett newspaper in 1987 for an estimated Dollars 88m. The paper had a circulation of 50,000 and was popular with its readership, but annual losses have continued at about Dollars 4m. Mr Bill Adler, a spokesman for the New York Times group, said the newspaper was a victim of recession and stiff advertising competition among Atlanta dailies: 'The key is that things were not getting any better. The situation was getting worse,' he said. Mr Adler said the New York Times hired a broker last summer to try to sell the paper, but none of the 40 prospective buyers was interested. Although cash flow will be increased by the money to be paid to the Times by Cox for offices, equipment, subscription lists and a new printing press, the New York Times is still likely to suffer a net loss. Analysts had been expecting a third quarter net profit of about Dollars 8m before the news of the special Gwinnett charge. For the first six months of 1992, the New York Times group's net income was Dollars 29.2m, against Dollars 10.5m in the first half of last year. Revenues were Dollars 888.5m, compared with Dollars 857.3m in the first half of 1991.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Man cleared of conspiracy charge A BUSINESSMAN alleged to have rifled the bank account of a firm of London solicitors was yesterday cleared at Southwark Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud. It had been alleged that, with the help of an unknown accomplice, Mr Sean O'Reilly, of Purley, Surrey, almost got away with more than Pounds 322,000 belonging to the solicitors, Asshetons, before the alleged fraud was discovered. The prosecution alleged that someone posing as a partner in Asshetons instructed its bank to transfer money from its client account to one of Mr O'Reilly's personal accounts. The jury returned a unanimous not guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC ordered formal not guilty verdicts to be recorded on charges of handling stolen goods and using a false instrument, both of which Mr O'Reilly denied.</p>

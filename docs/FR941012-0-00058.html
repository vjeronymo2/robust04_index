			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The record indicates that training materials and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courses for logging safety are widely available and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many logging establishments have implemented training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;181, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;33, 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;2, 9&hyph;5, 9&hyph;6, 36; Tr. W1 163&hyph;64, W2 113, 115, 125, 199&hyph;201, OR 87,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 259&hyph;60, 393, 546&hyph;47, 566). Trade associations such as AOL,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APA and the Montana Logging Association have been providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training materials on an on-going basis (Ex. 5&hyph;27). APA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to have completed a comprehensive training package  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for its members companies by 1989. In addition, state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agricultural extension services are a source of training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information (Ex. 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;123). Several hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants submitted descriptions of their training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs and the actual training materials (Ex. 21, 22, 23,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24, 26, 28, 29).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is aware that many of the existing training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are based on the training requirements of OSHA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulpwood logging standard. Because the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements have been revised in this final rule, current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training programs will have to be reviewed and upgraded,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when necessary, to meet the revised requirements. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the training provisions of the final rule vary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some degree from the proposed rule. As such, employers who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made changes in their programs in response to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule will have to review their training materials to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is aware that employers, trade associations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other organizations that provide training will need time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare and/or update training programs to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the final rule and will need time to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training to employees. However, the record also shows that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many companies and organizations already have developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training programs that meet most of the requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule (Ex. 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;52, 5&hyph;69, 9&hyph;2; Tr. OR 343).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many establishments, especially those in States that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging standards, already are providing training (Ex. 21,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). Therefore, OSHA does not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a lengthy delay is necessary to meet the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the final rule. The Agency believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extending the effective date of the standard for 120 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after publication of the final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be sufficient to allow employers and others to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarize themselves with the final rule, to update  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training programs to meet the provisions of the final rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to conduct initial training. This phase-in period also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will give employers time to determine whether current and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new employees have received the training in all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements specified in this section or whether they will need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Sufficiency of training.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second issue raised in the hearing notice concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what training OSHA would consider sufficient to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training requirements in the final rule. Some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported OSHA's preference for performance based training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ex. 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;15). Other commenters argued for detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications to be included in the training requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including a minimum number of hours of training (Ex. 9&hyph;13,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9&hyph;19).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the final rule contains training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in performance language to allow employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility in tailoring training programs to the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances under which they operate. The final rule sets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth the basic elements that must be covered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer's training program, such as safe performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned work tasks; safe use of tools; recognition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control of workplace hazards; prevention and control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general logging hazards; and the requirements of the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. The training provisions also require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees initially work under supervision and that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate the ability to perform their work tasks safely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before being released from supervision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, each logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment has unique conditions or hazards associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with its logging operations, that result in unique methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of operation. OSHA believes that the general elements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the training provisions allow employers to take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those differences while still requiring the employer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assure through training that each employee is able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform the job safely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

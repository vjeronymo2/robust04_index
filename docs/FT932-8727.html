			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Lloyd's deputy to quit syndicate MR Stephen Merrett, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, is to stand down as the active underwriter of syndicate 418, one of the insurance market's largest syndicates, at the start of next year. Mr Merrett, 53, will spend more time on the development of activities of Merrett Holdings and will be especially concerned with attracting incorporated capital to the group. As deputy chairman of Lloyd's he will also form a reinsurance company to isolate liabilities from old US asbestosis and pollution claims. Mr Merrett will be replaced at syndicate 418 by his current deputy, Mr Barnabas Hurst-Bannister. A statement by Merrett Holdings said: 'The matter of Mr Stephen Merrett's succession and role within the group has been under consideration for some time.' Meanwhile, an out-of-court settlement of some of the legal actions troubling the Lloyd's of London insurance market appeared to be still a possibility yesterday following a meeting between Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, and leaders of four groups of loss-making Names - the individuals whose assets back the insurance market. 'We are at the foothills of a Mount Everest of negotiations,' said Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, one of four action group leaders at the meeting. He said Mr Middleton was 'making a determined and serious effort, but a deal will be difficult to achieve'. Also at the two-hour meeting were Mr Colin Hook, Mr Alan Porter and Sir David Berriman, chairmen respectively of the representatives of Feltrim Names Association, the Devonshire Names Action Group and the Rose Thomson Young Action Group. The groups represent a majority of Names who sustained heavy losses from spiral reinsurance, in which syndicates and companies reinsured each others' exposure to high-level catastrophe loss. Insurance companies which sell policies directly to the public by telephone are poised to double their share of the Pounds 6.1bn UK motor insurance market over the next five years, according to a survey by the London-based GSR group. It estimates that 'direct writers' will sell two in every five motor insurance policies by 1998. In 1992 the three biggest direct writers - Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance Service - spent Pounds 5.6m on advertising, just under 25 per cent of the industry's total.</p>

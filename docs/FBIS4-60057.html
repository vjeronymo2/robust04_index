			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tolle Aram] </F>   [Text] Salah al-Din, Iraq, May 19 (AFP) -- Heavy fighting  has erupted between the two main Kurdish groups in northern Iraq  ending a 10-day truce, Kurdish officials said Thursday.    Clashes, which broke out on Wednesday in the town of Kou  Senjaq, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of the city of Irbil,  in the east of Iraqi Kurdistan, were reported to be spreading to  nearby areas on Thursday.    The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led by Jalal Talabani  and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mas'ud Barzani  accused each other of starting the battle. No casualty toll has  so far been issued.    Northern Iraq has been under PUK and KDP control since an  uprising against Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army at the end  of the Gulf war in February 1991.    Officials from the Iraqi National Congress, a coalition said  to represent all Kurdish and Arab groups opposed to Husayn,  accused the PUK of breaching the May 8 ceasefire agreement in a  statement to AFP.    The INC-brokered agreement ended two weeks of fighting in  which at least 100 people were killed, and which caused the  Kurdish region to split with the KDP controlling the western  part and the PUK the eastern part.    Under the ceasefire accord INC militiamen could control  check- points in the Irbil province lying between areas held by  the KDP and the PUK.    "PUK troops came down the hill and took our checkpoint by  force, and after that the KDP started to fight back," Ahmad  Muhammad Nasiriyah, a Moslem Shiite from the southern Iraqi city  of al-Nasiriyah, told AFP.    He said the clashes forced him and two fellow Moslem Shiites  to flee the checkpoint and cross the fighting area on foot  waving the INC flag.    The United Nations on Monday warned the PUK and KDP that  further armed feuding might halt international aid to the Kurds.    The renewed battles came as the PUK accused Iranian  militiamen of having fought against its forces in previous  clashes, saying one Iranian fighter was captured.    PUK spokesman Muhammad Tawfiq said an undetermined number of  Iranian Revolution Guards, or Pasdarans, had crossed the  Iraq-Iran border and fought in the nearby Iraqi Kurdish villages  of Halabjah and Qal'at Dizah.    The allegations were strongly denied by KDP spokesman Bruska  Shaways.</p>

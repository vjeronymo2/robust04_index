			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> EARLY SELLOFF HALTED; DOW OFF 3.84  </P> <P> The stock market gave ground Monday, faced with news suggesting persistent  strength in the economy. But after an early selloff, prices recovered much of  their losses.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index closed 3.84 points lower at 2,414.96. Declines  led advances 833 to 577 in thin New York Stock Exchange trading of 138 million  shares, compared to 158.4 million Friday.  </P> <P> Stocks sank from the opening bell as investors took a dim view of a survey of  purchasing managers that suggested the economy rebounded in April, reviving  fears that the Federal Reserve would further tighten credit to curb growth.  </P> <P> But a late spurt of buying helped blue chips recoup most of their losses,  leading to the modestly lower finish.  </P> <P> "Sellers felt they had sold everything they wanted to and pulled away," said  Philip Puccio, manager of institutional trading at Dillon Read.  </P> <P> "The market simply doesn't want to go down," said Tom Walsh, Nikko Securities'  chief of equity trading.  </P> <P> The Dow industrials have risen for the past five straight weeks, partly because  interest rates are not likely to rise further, which has set the stage for  profit taking, market analysts said.  </P> <P> The April purchasing managers' index rose to 53% from 50.4% in March. A reading  of over 50% in the survey by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management is  seen as showing that the economy is growing.  </P> <P> Traders said they expected little activity on Wall Street until Friday, when  the Labor Department releases U.S. employment figures for April.  </P> <P> The Wilshire index of 5,000 equities closed at 3,049.719, down 3.413.  </P> <P> Blocks of 10,000 or more shares traded on the NYSE totaled 2,784, compared to  3,574 Friday.  </P> <P> Financial markets in Great Britain were closed Monday for a bank holiday.  </P> <P> In Japan, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index finished at a new high. The  225-issue Nikkei stock index gained 79.82, closing at 33,793.17. The index had  gained 212.52 to set a 33,713.35 record close Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar wound up higher against all major currencies in a thin market Monday  as the unexpectedly strong economic assessment from U.S. purchasing managers  triggered buying.  </P> <P> Gold prices barely budged. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid  of $377.45 an ounce, 5 cents lower than Friday's late bid.  </P> <P> Late dollar rates in New York, compared to Friday's late rates, included:  134.125 Japanese yen, up from 133.05; 1.89065 West German marks, up from  1.8810; 1.6870 Swiss francs, up from 1.6755; 6.375 French francs, up from  6.3580; 1,383.25 Italian lire, up from 1,377.00, and 1.18725 Canadian dollars,  up from 1.1853.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices fell as a result of the purchases' report. The credit market's  benchmark 30-year Treasury issue tumbled 11/16 point, or $6.88 for every $1,000  face amount. Its yield rose to 8.99% from 8.92% late Friday.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  securities were down by 3/32 point to 3/16 point, intermediate governments fell  1/4 point to 15/32 point and long-term maturities slumped from 17/32 point to  21/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial data service.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 3.05 to 1,129.69.  </P> <P> Corporate issues declined. Moody's investment grade corporate bond index, which  measures the total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities  of five years or longer, was off 0.53 to 303.96.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds closed at 92-3/32, down 7/32 point. The average yield to maturity  increased to 7.59% from 7.58% late Friday.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills jumped to 8.88% as the discount rose 10  basis points to 8.59%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 9.15% as the discount  rose 10 basis points to 8.65%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.28% as the  discount gained 8 basis points to 8.59%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Prices of grain and soybean futures rose strongly Monday on the Chicago Board  of Trade in reaction to long-range forecasts of below-average rainfall in  several grain-producing states.  </P> <P> On other markets, gasoline and crude oil prices rallied, cattle and hogs were  up, and gold and silver prices gained moderately.  </P> <P> Wheat settled 4 to 6 1/4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in May at  $4.23 3/4 a bushel; corn was 4 1/4 to 5 3/4 cents higher, with May at $2.74 a  bushel; oats were 5 to 6 1/2 cents higher, with May at $1.84 1/2 a bushel, and  soybeans were 12 3/4 to 17 3/4 cents higher, with May at $7.35 1/4 a bushel.  </P> <P> Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with Carson Petroleum Co. in Chicago, said traders  who sold their gasoline contracts last week were buying the fuel and selling  heating oil, betting that gasoline prices would rise.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 to 24 cents higher, with June at  $20.66 a barrel; heating oil was 0.18 to 0.31 cent lower, with June at 49.46  cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.45 cent to 1.39 cents higher, with  June at 72.61 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Tables begin on Page 8  </P></p>

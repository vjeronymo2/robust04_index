			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiao Linsheng (0829 2651 3932): "State </F> Council and Central Military Commission Approve Dissemination of  Proposal on Job Placements for Demobilized Military Cadres"]    [Text] Jinan, 4 Apr (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Recently, the State  Council and the Central Military Commission approved and issued  the "Opinion on Job Placements for Demobilized Military Cadres  in 1994." According to the document, 50,000 military cadres  (including armed police officers) will be transferred to  civilian posts this year. They will mainly be assigned to work  in the forefront of economic construction, especially in the  judicial and law-enforcement, industrial and commercial,  administrative, taxation, and financial institutions.    In order to mitigate difficulties in arranging housing for  demobilized military cadres and their families, the State  Council's Work Group for Placement of Demobilized Army Officers  [WGPDAO], the Ministry of Personnel, and the General Political  Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have worked out  a set of rules for this year's work. The rules specify that  with the exception of municipalities, provincial capitals, and  some cities with independent budgetary status, demobilized  military cadres who lived with their spouses during active  service should, in principle, be assigned civilian jobs locally.  If job placements need to be made in other provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities, a plan should be drafted  by the local department for the placement of demobilized  military cadres and delivered to the Work Group for Placement of  Demobilized Army Officers for coordinated arrangements.  Demobilized military cadres who are willing to work in remote  and difficult areas specified by the state should be appointed  to corresponding positions in addition to being given  preferential treatment, and their housing should be guaranteed  first.    The document on this year's placement of demobilized cadres  also points out the need to adopt measures to attract  demobilized cadres to work in tertiary industry and to encourage  them to seek jobs on their own. Those who work with  foreign-funded enterprises, township and town enterprises, joint  ventures, private urban enterprises, and those going abroad to  study may maintain their cadre status and their original wage  levels in their personnel dossiers [dang an gong zi 2909 2714  1562 6327]. Priority job placements should be given to cadres  at the division and regiment level. Enterprises and other  civilian institutions should give priority to placing cadres  transferred from the military according to their own personnel  systems, as well as the political and professional merits of the  cadres, and should place them in posts which correspond to their  posts in the Armed Forces. During their period of employment,  demobilized cadres should not be laid off at will.</p>

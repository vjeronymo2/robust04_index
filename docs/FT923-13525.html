			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Arts: The Television Programme - London theatre The main point of interest about the new production at The Gate is that this is the first play I have seen that discusses the problems of long term unemployment. If the theatre in the mid-1990s is to tackle serious social questions, this surely must be one of them. Even in France, a country whose economic performance is generally praised, unemployment has remained close to 10 per cent for almost a decade. And it is appropriately from France that The Television Programme comes. Michel Vinaver's piece is not a particularly good play, or at least not in this translation by David and Hannah Bradby. It attempts to combine too many themes and dots about too much. In just over two hours, we go through the corruption of the French system of justice, the corrupting effects of television programme-making and an unresolved murder, as well as the effects of redundancy on the middle-aged. Nevertheless, it has its striking moments. Three aspects stand out. The first is the method of the interrogations conducted by the magistrate Phelypeaux, played by Guy Burgess. The French approach to justice is sometimes said to be superior to the English because it tries to establish what happened before putting people in court. Here Phelypeaux asks questions, then produces a statement which the interrogated duly sign. The statements are by no means complete fabrications, but they are at best inaccurate summaries. If that is indeed how the French system of justice works, Vinaver is to be congratulated for illustrating it. The second and more familiar aspect is how television programmes can have an exaggerated idea of their own importance. Here the search is on to find a member of the long-term unemployed, persuade a company to give him a job and put the story on film as a topical human interest programme with the TV channel getting the kudos for exploiting it. The competition among the programme-makers leads to tears and possibly murder. The third aspect is simply middle-aged unemployment itself. Vinaver had nearly 30 years' experience of business with Gillette International and presumably knows all about the three 'R's: rationalisation, restructuring and redundancies. 'You're a civil servant,' says the 50-year-old victim to the magistrate. 'What happened to me will never happen to you.' And again: 'With unemployment, your memory goes.' The Television Programme, like most television programmes, does not go into the subject in any great depth, but at least it registers that here is something worth writing about and which is unlikely to go away in the near future. British playwrights could do worse than pick up the theme. The piece is directed by Kim Dambaek and is the first of a season of Six Plays for Europe under the Gate's new artistic director, Laurence Boswell. Gate Theatre, London W11, until August 1.

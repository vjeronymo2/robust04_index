			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (8): Faith renewed in New York ANY LINGERING notion that New York was mired in terminal recession, that it was a city of past glories and tarnished elegance, vanished this month when the Four Seasons chain opened its grandest creation, the Dollars 360m Four Seasons Hotel, on Manhattan's upper east side. The exterior of the limestone-clad IM Pei-designed tower captures the flavour of the Chrysler Building, perhaps Manhattan's finest Art Deco creation. But its interior is thoroughly modernist, with more limestone, back-lit onyx and Dakota Jackson chairs. The Four Seasons, the most expensive hotel ever built in Manhattan, already has achieved 'landmark' status. One city magazine went so far as to call it a 'love song for New York.' Indeed, foreigners - the Four Seasons company is based in Toronto - and New Yorkers alike seem to be renewing their faith in America's biggest metropolis. Only a year or so ago, when recession still gripped New York, the doomsayers predicted that the city would never recapture its 1980s' wealth, verve and bustle. The wealth may be somewhat depleted, but New York's confidence and energy are staging a credible come-back. The Four Seasons isn't the only testament to city's rejuvenation after several difficult years. Two hotels opened recently in Chinatown and others, such as the Mercer in SoHo, are on the way. Many business travellers, especially those with lavish expense accounts, still prefer the carriage trade's old dowagers ' the Carlyle, the Pierre, the Plaza and the Waldorf-Astoria. But all is not lost for budget-conscious travellers. The Consumer Reports Travel Letter notes bargains and comfort are not mutually exclusive. The Ameritania, the Ramada Hotel Pennsylvania (rated a 'best buy') and the Helmsley Windsor offer conveniently located, well-kept rooms for under Dollars 200 a night. Discounts often are available. Other aspects of New York life are also flourishing. Broadway has extended its winning streak, which started with a record year in 1992 with hits such as Guys and Dolls. This year, Kiss of the Spider Woman and Angels in America have both won Tony Awards. New York's once notorious nightclub scene has also come back from near-death. Until last year, the Limelight was the city's only mega-club. Owner Peter Gatien has since opened USA, a club housed in Broadway's Minsky theatre with a raunchy Times Square theme, and has relaunched the old Palladium. His rivals, the Ballinger brothers, recently opened Webster Hall, a multi-level dance hall built in 1889 that was once Al Capone's hangout. Those who prefer their amusement sweat-free can tour the Guggenheim Museum, which has undergone a massive renovation that included the construction of a new wing and a SoHo branch. Die-hard shoppers will be pleased to find that Bloomingdale's, New York's most famous department store, is thriving again after more than two years in bankruptcy, and that Barneys, the elegant downtown fashion retailer, will soon unveil an enormous outlet near Central Park. There were moments during the recession when New York seemed destined to become a 'third-rate Babylon', as the sage of Baltimore, HL Mencken, once called it. New York may not be booming but its resilient spirit remains.</p>

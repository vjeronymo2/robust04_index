			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa on Thursday [20 January] expressed readiness to talk  with Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono to  reconcile differences over LDP proposals on modifying the  government's political reform package.    Fielding questions from reporters, the premier said that  whether the meeting with Kono takes place is entirely up to the  LDP.    "If the LDP wants to hold the summit, I am ready to respond  immediately," said Hosokawa, in an upbeat mood following the  passage of the package through a House of Councillors committee  earlier in the day. The vote was 18 for and 16 against.    The package is designed to redesign the mechanism for  electing members of the House of Representatives of the  two-chamber diet, while changing the political fund-raising  system by channeling donations to politicians through their  parties' coffers.    Kono, meanwhile, ruled out holding a meeting with Hosokawa  on  possible modifications of the package.    He told reporters at the LDP headquarters, "at present,  there  remains no room for us to advance suggestions" to the coalition  side.    On Wednesday, negotiators from the coalition and LDP failed  to narrow a gap over the LDP's three demands, including the one  calling for raising from 274 to 280 the number of lower house  seats to be contested as single-seat constituencies in a  500-seat chamber.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Single bargaining agreements 'rising' ABOUT 200,000 workers are covered by single-table collective bargaining agreements, which manual and white-collar employees negotiate jointly with management, according to a study by the Manchester Institute of Science and Technology reported in today's issue of Labour Research magazine. An estimated 60 companies have such deals, twice the number of three years ago. The most prominent recent single-table deals have been reached at British Steel, the Rover and Vauxhall car companies, as many as 43 of the 65 new National Health Service trusts and nine of the 10 privatised water companies. Other companies which have moved to single-table bargaining in the past three years include BP Chemicals at Grangemouth, PowerGen and National Grid, Lever Brothers and Synpac Chemicals. The government-commissioned workplace survey carried out in 1990 found that 'there was no evidence of any widespread move towards single-table bargaining'. A number of such arrangements were introduced before 1990, however, including those at Bulmers Cider, Coca-Cola Schweppes, Ind Coope Burton Brewery, Cummins Engines and 17 of the 18 independent television companies. Mr Gregor Gall, who carried out the research, said the main reason for the sudden increase in single-table bargaining stemmed in part from the demise of national and company-wide agreements. He said the introduction of more decentralised bargaining structures, which related pay closely to the needs of the local labour market and the profitability of each particular company, were a signifi-cant reason for the increase. Mr Gall said employers want to end the traditional and complex multi-union bargaining system, where companies had to deal separately with many unions, so they were better equipped to 'respond more quickly to changes in their markets with changes in production' . Companies saw the value of single table bargaining because it enabled them to introduce working practice reforms without any danger of sparking industrial conflict between their own workers. Mr Gall said the new wave of single bargaining deals stemmed mainly from employer initiatives that were not being opposed but were being welcomed by trade unions. Many trade unions saw such developments as a way of producing much greater inter-union harmony and co-operation.</p>

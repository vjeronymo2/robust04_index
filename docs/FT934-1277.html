			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Sunny side of the Street International investors worried about the turn in US interest rates might take heart from the behaviour of Wall Street. US equities have remained remarkably calm in the face of rising bond yields. The yield on 30-year treasury bonds has risen by half a percentage point since mid-October as the economy has gathered momentum. Short-dated issues have started to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in the early part of next year. But one or two bouts of nerves aside, the equity market has held its ground. One reason is that even bears of the US bond market concede that long-dated yields are unlikely to rise much above 6.5 per cent next year, from 6.3 per cent now. While the outlook for growth is starting to improve, unit labour costs remain firmly under control. The output gap is wide enough to allow several quarters of above-trend growth before serious inflationary pressure are felt. If growth fell away in the first quarter of next year, long bond yields might even trickle back. A sharp tightening of short-term rates could still cause trouble. With shares yielding so little and the outlook for dividend growth poor, equities would surely suffer from higher returns on cash. Tomorrow's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee will doubtless stoke speculation. Respectable employment figures in the new year, combined perhaps with early signs of a resurgence of bank lending, would be reason enough to nudge rates higher. Given the uptick in bond yields this autumn, a gentle rise in interest rates should be already in the price.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Invesco shows sharp increase to Pounds 33.4m Invesco, the international fund management group, reported sharply improved profits after a year of worldwide restructuring and negative publicity in the UK. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December were Pounds 33.4m, against Pounds 12.6m last time, and were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 2m  -down from Pounds 16.6m in 1992. Income for the year rose by Pounds 36.4m to Pounds 172m. Profitability was concentrated in the US division. The North American region made a profit of Pounds 41.7m, while the Pacific region incurred a Pounds 574,000 loss. The European division, including the UK, made an initial profit of Pounds 4m, but exceptional items turned that into a loss of Pounds 10.6m. The exceptional losses resulted from an Pounds 11.5m out of court settlement of a legal dispute over the Mirror Group pension scheme and a Pounds 3m write-off of computer software costs. They were offset by several positive items, including gains from the sale of investments in Oak Industries and Second Consolidated Trust, which contributed Pounds 3.7m and Pounds 2.6m respectively. Mr Charles Brady, chairman, described 1993 as a 'confused' year, and said that while 1994 would be better, the group would not reach its full potential until 1995 or beyond. Administrative reorganisation and withdrawal from areas other than the core business of fund management will continue this year, and more job losses are likely in the UK. A consolidation of unit trusts is also planned. Funds under management at the year-end were Pounds 45bn, up from Pounds 40bn at the end of 1992. The proportion of funds from US sources grew to 80 per cent, from 78 per cent. Earnings per share emerged at 10p (2.5p), and the total dividend is raised 0.5p to 3.5p via a final of 2.5p. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Retained Management and  Coordination Agency [RMCA] Director General Koshiro Ishida is  expected to keep on tackling administrative reform centering on  economic deregulation, which the United States has urged to  reduce the huge imbalance in bilateral trade.    Ishida is the 63-year-old chairman of Komeito [Clean  Government Party], the third-largest ruling coalition party,  backed by the Buddhist group Soka Gakkai. His agency supervises  state administration and takes charge of promoting economic  deregulation.    Komeito's connection with Soka Gakkai was called into  question at the Diet when the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party quizzed Ishida over constitutional issues. The  Constitution bans the state and its organs from conducting  religious activities.    Ishida and Party Secretary General Yuichiro Ichikawa, the  coalition's major strategist, have led Komeito for nearly five  years.    Born in Hokkaido, Ishida started his Komeito career as an  employee of Soka Gakkai's official newspaper after graduating  from the Commerce Science Department of Meiji University. He  comes from a family which has close relations with Soka Gakkai,  one of the most successful religious movements in postwar Japan.    He was elected to the House of Representatives for the first  time from the No. 6 constituency in Aichi Prefecture in 1967,  the year Komeito first entered the lower house and voters have  returned him nine more times.    He assumed the post of party chairman in 1989 following the  resignation of former Chairman Junya Yano over his alleged  involvement in the Recruit "stock-for-favors" scandal and other  corruption cases involving the party's Diet members. The new  chairman, however, met with setbacks both in the House of  Councillors election in 1989 and the House of Representatives  election in 1990, and was forced to change the party's direction  and take a more centrist course.    In April 1990, Ishida made Komeito's position clear as a  leading centrist party, distancing itself from reformist forces  headed by the Social Democratic Party. By forming a union with  another centrist force, the Democratic Socialist Party, Ishida  cooperated skillfully with the then ruling Liberal Democratic  Party in handling important issues in Diet debate.    In 1992, he played a key role in pushing a bill through the  Diet that allows Japan to dispatch Self-Defense Forces personnel  overseas to join in U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p>

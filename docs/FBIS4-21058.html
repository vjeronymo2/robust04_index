			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Police Clear up Slaughters in Vigario Geral"] </F>   [Text] The first arrest of a participant in the massacre of  four military police [PM] officers in Catole do Rocha Square--a  crime that led to the slaughter of 21 persons in the Vigario  Geral shantytown in the early morning hours on 30 August  1993--occurred last Saturday. Alexandre Santana ("Caninana"),  who is a lieutenant of trafficker Flavio Pires da Silva ("Flavio  Negao"), also confessed to the execution of two PM officers last  19 February near the Iraja Cemetery, participation in the  robbing of an armored car owned by Transpev on 24 February, and  participation in the killing of 14 individuals on Mangueira Hill  during a battle between traffickers on Carnival Sunday.    "Caninana" was arrested along with Monica Nazareth Moco,  wife  of "Flavio Negao's" chief lieutenant, Ulissiano do Nascimento  ("Ulisses"), during a raid that took 32 officers from the Drug  Enforcement Division (DRE) to Vigario Geral.    According to Walter Alves de Oliveira, head of the DRE, the  arrest of "Caninana" confirms that Marcelo Carlos do Nascimento  ("Arregalado"), "Flavio Negao," and "Ulisses" took part in  killing the four PM officers in Vigario Geral on the night of 28  August 1993. "`Caninana' said that the PM officers were killed  because traffickers in the shantytown have a radio on which they  listen to Military Police transmissions. So `Flavio Negao' knew  that the police officers were headed for Catole do Rocha  Square," the police chief said.    According to Oliveira, the only motive given by "Caninana"  for slaughtering the PM officers was "an order from `Flavio  Negao.'" Monica, the wife of "Ulisses," had helped her husband  escape during the raid on Saturday. She was released after  giving a statement.  <H5>  Trafficking Bosses Form Alliance </H5>   According to Police Chief Walter Alves de Oliveira, head of  the DRE, a new alliance among traffickers in Rio de Janeiro's  shantytowns was revealed in statements by Alexandre Santana  ("Caninana"), a killer who is one of the lieutenants in the gang  headed by "Flavio Negao," head of the drug traffic in Vigario  Geral. "He said that traffickers from the shantytowns of Vigario  Geral, Varginha, and Turano took part in the `war' that claimed  14 victims (`Caninana' took part in six of those murders) during  Carnival. They were supporting trafficker `Polegar' of Mangueira  Hill," the police chief said.    Here are the other crimes in which "Caninana" confessed to  having participated:    Sergeant Ailton Benedito Ferreira, Corporal Irapuan Calixto  Caetano, and Privates Jose Carlos Santana and Luis Mendonca  Santos, all of the 9th BPM [Military Police Battalion], were  massacred with AR-15 rifle fire--by men working for trafficker  "Flavio Negao"--in Catole do Rocha Square in Vigario Geral on  the night of 28 August last year.    Two PM officers, Robson Barros da Silva and Jose Carlos  Cardoso, were murdered near the Iraja Cemetery last 19 February.  According to "Caninana," those deaths were the work of the gang  headed by trafficker "Flavio Negao." Trafficker Marcio Glacie da  Rocha ("Socrates") also died during that slaughter. According to  the head of the DRE, "Caninana" said that the body of "Socrates"  was taken to the Vigario Geral shantytown, where a death  certificate for the trafficker was arranged. He was then given a  discreet burial in the Iraja Cemetery.    On 24 February, 20 men from a "backwoods commando unit,"  armed with AR-15 and FAL rifles, shotguns, and submachineguns,  intercepted a Transpev armored car (license No. OK 1399) on the  Presidente Dutra Highway in the Jardim America neighborhood and  stole two small trunks containing 4.5 million cruzeiros and  checks. According to "Caninana," that operation was also carried  out by "Flavio Negao's" gang.</p>

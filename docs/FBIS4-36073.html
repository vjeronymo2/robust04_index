			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Colonel Ahmad Jabir 'Uthman, a senior  officer in the Political Security Apparatus [PSA], joined by a  large group of officers, NCO's, and soldiers from the PSA, who  were misled for a while by the rebellious secessionist gang led  by traitor agent 'Ali al-Bid, have declared that they are  joining the forces of unity protecting constitutional  legitimacy. They voiced their rejection and denunciation of the  declaration of secession and said they were ready to defend  unity and confront all schemes aimed at disrupting the homeland.    Brother Col. Ahmad Jabir gave serious and important  information about details of the criminal secessionist schemes  of the elements of apostasy and secession. He said he was  tasked by the secessionist gang with administering and  overseeing the destructive military and security operations in  Lahij, Abyan, and Shabwah governorates as part of the  implementation of the secessionist scheme. He explained that as  soon as he discovered the reality of the criminal scheme against  the sovereignty of the Republic of Yemen and its unity harbored  by those who are laying in wait for Yemen, he retreated from his  positions toward the secessionist gang and refused to go ahead  with their treacherous scheme. He also delivered serious and  important documents to the authorities on that secessionist  scheme against the Yemeni homeland and its unity.    Col. Ahmad Jabir 'Uthman said he had seen large amounts of  military equipment arriving from abroad for the rebellious  secessionist gang.    The joining brothers voiced their regret and repentance  regarding the period they spent with the elements of apostasy  and secession without knowing the extent of the aims and  dimensions of the conspiracy concocted against Yemen and its  unity. They announced their loyalty to constitutional  legitimacy and declared they will be at the forefront of the  ranks defending unity and legitimacy.</p>

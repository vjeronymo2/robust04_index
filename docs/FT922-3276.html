			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: The Master and Margarita This is a theatrical version of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel, which in recent years has swept literary Europe in many translations. Not long ago Andrew Clements reported here on York Holler's operatic version, and it is not the only one; the book seems to capture imaginations wholesale. Though The Master and Margarita was Bulgakov's magnum opus, it was published only in 1966-67, a good quarter-century after his death. The book is a long, wildly imaginative affair; what the Four Corners Theatre Company offer at Hammersmith is tidy and concise, but seems to encapsulate the peculiar charm and fantasy of the novel. 'Seems': having only dipped into its pages, I can't answer for the faithfulness of David Graham-Young's adaptation - but it stands beautifully on its own funny little feet. Though we can guess that a thousand fanciful details must have been trimmed away, the 17 scenes of the 'play' - more like a tale partly narrated, partly illustrated in quirky vignettes - gleam with character. While her writer-lover, 'The Master', languishes in an asylum, Margarita encounters the Devil in Moscow. He is probably a real Devil, but quaintly decadent, and he manipulates events as much toward benign ends as perverse ones. Through him the characters of The Master's unfinished novel about Pontius Pilate enter the action, and other mock-historical personages; meanwhile Margarita places her fate in his hands, and he leads it through curious byways to a metaphysical happy ending. There are a lot of people involved, and the eight Four Corners actors play them all with resourceful flair. Except with preconceptions from the original Bulgakov, one could hardly imagine them more neatly realised, even the least of them. Despite some cool murders and an accidental decapitation everybody preserves an air of composed innocence, the better to set off the magical strangeness of what goes on. As adaptor and director, Graham-Young has ensured that not one line or move fails to make an intuitive point. The prevailingly mild tone of the proceedings is broken just once to brilliant effect, by a necrophilic, Poe-flavoured ball in the Devil's apartments (gleefully choreographed by Lynn Seymour to the waltz from Khachaturian's Masquerade). The effect of the whole is pungent, delicate and elusive, engaging and oddly satisfying. Lyric Studio, Hammersmith to July 4</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK corporate bonds Among the many and varied financial instruments that the City can offer UK companies there is one glaring omission: corporate bonds. Only the biggest UK companies can issue bonds in the UK and they very rarely try. Instead many turn to the US, where they can tap the publicly-traded markets or go directly to a few institutions with a private placement. The latter is an increasingly popular option for medium-sized British companies which are looking for cheap, long-term, fixed-rate capital. In the US, small growing businesses can also use the bond markets but it is not an option for their counterparts in the UK. It is not just companies that wish it were otherwise. The lack of a corporate bond market was one of the concerns expressed by Mr Stephen Dorrell, former financial secretary to the Treasury, in his review of capital markets. This will only change if UK institutions rediscover a taste for corporate bonds. Forty years ago the average pension fund portfolio was invested 40 per cent in gilts and 10 per cent in corporate bonds. Now the comparable figures are less than 10 per cent and next to nothing. The reason is simple: the UK's awful post-war record on inflation ate away at the value of fixed-interest holdings. But with inflation down to 27-year lows, the optimists believe a UK corporate bond market might reappear. It could be helped on its way if the government further reduced the tax advantages of equities, though this would be fiercely resisted by many in the City. Proposed changes to pension fund solvency standards might provide another boost. But these are years away and institutions might still worry about the liquidity of corporate bonds. Index-linked gilts will remain a much safer alternative until it is clear that inflation is tamed. For most fund managers that point is some way off.</p>

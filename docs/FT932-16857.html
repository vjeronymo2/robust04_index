			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / BP announces Pounds 400m project in North Sea BRITISH PETROLEUM yester-day announced the go-ahead for the Pounds 400m development of its Forth oilfield in the North Sea as a row continued over the controversial changes to petroleum revenue tax. Many oil companies have said the tax changes announced in the Budget will lead to a halving of exploration activity in the North Sea. The row in the industry over the tax changes was further fuelled yesterday by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil analysts, who questioned the Treasury's forecasts for revenue from the tax measures. The analysts estimate that the changes will raise Pounds 115m in tax over the next three years rather than the Pounds 700m Treasury forecast. The Treasury has defended its tax measures by saying that the previous regime subsidised inefficient exploration. The new rules reduce the tax rate on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. They also abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. BP said yesterday that the Forth field, which contains about 180m barrels of oil, will be more profitable as a result of the abolition of petroleum revenue tax on new oilfields. Industry analysts say the Forth field could be worth an additional Pounds 100m because of the proposed changes. Wood MacKenzie believes that six companies, including BP, stand to gain from the new proposals; six companies, including British Gas, will lose in the short term, but gain in the long term; and 17 companies will be overall losers. The analysts say the number of wells drilled in the North Sea could drop below 100 from 116 last year. BP plans to bring its Forth field on stream in early 1996. The company said yesterday that, although the field will be more profitable under the new tax rules, they will force more efficiency in development because there will be no chance of writing off cost overruns against tax. The Department of Trade and Industry awarded a licence to Marathon Oil to explore for oil in Cardigan Bay off the Welsh coast.</p>

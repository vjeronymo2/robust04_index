			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: FRENCH CONNECTION  </P> <P> "I felt everybody around town looking for ideas, so I looked to some movies I  loved."  </P> <P> That's how French producer Frederic Golchan made deals on five remakes of  French films that are now in development or awaiting release at Hollywood  studios.  </P> <P> Actually, for Warner Bros.' "Quick Change," due out July 13, it was the book  Golchan loved. The new movie stars Bill Murray, Randy Quaid and Geena Davis as  three bank robbers trying against all odds to reach the airport and get out of  town. Although it's the second adaptation of Jay Cronley's 1981 novel -- first  adapted as "Hold Up," a 1987 French/Canadian production -- Golchan insists his  is the first version true to the book and its "inherent American humor."  </P> <P> Golchan's other remake projects:  </P> <P> * "The Associate" ("L'Associe," 1979), about an unassuming businessman who  "invents" a prestigious partner who becomes so popular that the businessman  sets out to "kill" him. Later, he's arrested for murder. At 20th Century Fox.  </P> <P> * "Hibernatus," originally made in 1969 by Edouard Molinaro (same title), about  a young man who reawakens after 80 years in ice. David Misch is scripting for  Disney.  </P> <P> * "Things of Life" ("Les Choses de la Vie," 1969), a drama about a man whose  life flashes before him -- in the moments before he dies in a fatal car crash.  David Rayfiel scripts or Jaffe-Lansing Prods.  </P> <P> * "The Woman Next Door" ("La Femme d'a Cote," 1981, directed by Francois  Truffaut), a tale of obsessive love was at Columbia, is now in turnaround.  </P> <P> Golchan has several original projects cooking as well, but he's making his mark  by retooling French titles for American audiences. The secret? Americans, he  says, "seem to need their own pacing and format, along with their own language.  And of course, Americans like movies to be plot-oriented, as opposed to  character-oriented." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

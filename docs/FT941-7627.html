			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Asian investors lead the way in Vietnam - FT writers on those who beat the Americans to it Long before President Bill Clinton lifted the US trade embargo against Vietnam earlier this month, Washington's Asian allies were investing and trading enthusiastically with Vietnam and profiting from the growth unleashed by economic reform after 1987. US groups are likely to use their influence in sectors such as computers, telecommunications, aerospace and oil exploration to challenge Asian and European rivals already established in the country. Taiwan and Hong Kong are the biggest foreign investors in Vietnam. Together they have proposed more than Dollars 2.7bn worth of projects. Taiwanese businessmen in particular benefit from their links to ethnic Chinese businessmen in Cholon, the Chinatown of Ho Chi Minh City. Taiwan's government is also keen to diversify offshore investment away from China. Big Taiwanese players with joint ventures in Vietnam include the Ching Foong conglomerate, the sole motorcycle assembler in the country, and food group Ve Dan, which is investing Dollars 180m to produce monosodium glutamate, instant noodles and drinks. Hong Kong's Wharf Holdings, which this month opened the doors of its 260-room Omni Saigon hotel, managed to do so within 18 months of signing the initial agreement with Japanese and Vietnamese partners. However, with the return to Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, some Hong Kong companies are cautious about dealing with Vietnam because of the long-standing hostility between Hanoi and Beijing. It is Cable and Wireless, parent of Hongkong Telecom, rather than Hongkong Telecom that is exploring the potential of the underdeveloped Vietnamese market. Also breaking into the telecommunications market is Hong Kong-listed ABC Communications, whose paging service in Ho Chi Minh City is being augmented with operations in Hanoi and Haiphong. Confronted by regulatory obstacles in China, the group has sunk HKDollars 10m (Pounds 877,000) into Vietnam. South Korean businesses, already among the biggest investors in Vietnam with about Dollars 500m promised to Vietnamese projects, could increase their investments with the end of the US embargo. Seoul and Hanoi established diplomatic relations in December 1992, but South Korean companies had begun investing in Vietnam in the late 1980s. Medium-sized Korean textile and toy producers, interested in exploiting Vietnam's low wage costs, have so far provided most of the investment. Daewoo has been the most aggressive among the Korean conglomerates trying to establish a firm foothold before the Japanese. 'We prefer to invest in countries, such as Vietnam, where the Japanese are not dominant,' said Mr Bae Soonhoon, president of Daewoo Electronics. Daewoo is building a Dollars 35m joint venture motor vehicle assembly plant in Hanoi, which will produce 10,000 cars, trucks and buses annually beginning in 1995. It will soon begin operation of a Dollars 170m joint-venture TV picture tube factory in Hanoi and has started construction of a Dollars 134m business centre complex, including a 300-room hotel, in the capital. Hyundai is planning projects to build a container plant and a ship repair yard and is considering establishing a car assembly plant. It also wants to help construct a motorway linking Hanoi to Haiphong, and may seek offshore oil exploration rights. Samsung plans to construct a large chemical plant near Hanoi and is negotiating a joint venture to produce medical equipment near Ho Chi Minh City. Lucky-Goldstar is hoping to sell telecommunications equipment, such as telephone exchanges, to Vietnam and plans to set up a consumer electronics sales network. Japanese companies, which were sensitive to US criticism and had not previously been in the vanguard of the Asian investment rush into Vietnam, have been busy catching up in the past two years. New Japanese investment, negligible in 1988, increased to a peak in 1992 of Dollars 220m, before falling back to Dollars 90m during the first 11 months last year, according to Jetro, the Japan external trade organisation. The big trading houses such as Nissho Iwai and Mitsui have been among the most active. Mitsui, which exports machinery and chemicals to Vietnam and sends out oil and prawns, expects to double its turnover in Vietnam this year, although it refuses to give figures. The end of the US embargo represented good and bad news, said Mr Yasuo Ogawa, assistant general manager at Mitsui. The positive aspect was that it allowed Japanese companies to set up joint-ventures with American groups; the company had already teamed up with Unisys, the US computer group, to tackle the Vietnamese market. The negative aspect was that competition would intensify. Mitsui has more than 20 projects in the pipeline. It already owns minority stakes in a polyester and rayon factory, and a 240,000-tonne a year steel plant costing Dollars 60m. It has put in bids to construct a container port at Than Tuan, near Ho Chi Minh City and wants to construct a 60,000 tonnes a year PVC plant. It is making a bid with British Gas and TransCanada to build an offshore oil-field pipeline.

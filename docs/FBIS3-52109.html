['Arafat] I would like to tell all Palestinian children,  women, and men that Palestine is being resurrected anew as a  beautiful homeland for each of our children, a free homeland for  each of the Palestinian men. None of these men has abandoned  sacrifice. Palestine now stands as a prosperous and fair hope  for each of the Palestinian women who are protecting our  existence, safeguarding our everlasting fire, maintaining the  glowing spirit, and carrying the secret of eternal  steadfastness. Palestine will be a homeland in which the  children of Palestine, who are our new generals, will hoist the  Palestinian flag on the land of Palestine, and on the walls,  churches, and minarets of Jerusalem. It will be a homeland for  free men who will create a free homeland and a new torch of  light, hope, and faith.    ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: In a message to a U.S. Jewish  leader, you said Israel wants to turn the Gaza Strip and Jericho  area into an Indian reservation. Does this mean that the  agreement, according to the Israeli viewpoint, cannot be  accepted by the Palestinian people? In this case, what will be  the alternative, or the path the Palestinian leadership will  take, in order to meet the Palestinian people's demands?    ['Arafat] It should be understood that we signed a peace  [agreement] between the PLO and the State of Israel. Thus,  Israel should honor its signature. I only demand an honest and  precise implementation of what we signed.    ['Amarah] What if implementation does not happen?    ['Arafat] If you please, withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho  means withdrawal, not redeployment. This should be understood  by everyone everywhere. We will not live in a ghetto or in a  bantustan. They should understand this matter. Therefore, we  will never accept these conditions, which Rabin and others try  to impose on the Palestinian people. I want to tell Rabin that  he should honor what he signed, and that implementation should  be accurate and literal.    ['Amarah] What if this does not happen?    ['Arafat] Let the world answer this question. This  agreement was also signed by the Russian and U.S. cosponsors of  the conference, under the supervision of President Clinton. The  entire world witnessed the signing of this agreement. I want to  tell Rabin: You can continue your occupation of our land for  another period of time. However, Rabin should understand that  he cannot at all impose on us injustice or humiliation. None of  the children of Palestine will accept the humiliation they are  trying to impose on us. They have been occupying our country  for 45 years. They could continue to occupy it for 47, 48, or  50 years, but they will never be able to humiliate the  Palestinian people. There is a powerful people in Palestine.  This should be understood. I believe our children, whom I call  the new generals, can confront this Israeli arrogance.    ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman: President Mubarak is seeking to  bridge the gaps separating the PLO and Israeli positions. How  successful has he been?    ['Arafat] Let me here thank my brother His Excellency the  struggler President Muhammad Husni Mubarak for the considerable  efforts he has been and is exerting in pursuit of a just and  comprehensive peace in the region and to promote a faithful and  accurate implementation of the accord. At the last round,  convened by the Liaison Committee under Peres and my brother  Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], my brother Egyptians did a fine job,  with their foreign minister taking time off for this thing, and,  instructed by President Mubarak, he did not spare himslef. I  take this opportunity to thank them for their time and effort.    ['Amarah] The delay in implementing the accord has  apparently  led to increased Palestinian opposition, even within the Fatah  ranks. How do you feel about that?    ['Arafat] Who said we mind opposition? I do not think a  single Palestinian would allow me to agree to humiliating terms,  against the wishes of the Palestinian people to set up a  national authority on the first Palestinian territory, where a  Palestinian flag will fly over the first Palestinian land to be  liberated from occupation. I have no doubt that all Palestinian  men, women, and children stand by me to defend the Palestinian  people, dignity, and sanctities, most of all Jerusalem, the  capital of the state of Palestine. Do you think I rule over  sheep?    ['Amarah] No.    ['Arafat] I am responsible for free and mujahid strugglers,  each of whom is entitled to his or her own opinion. Let me  quote 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab [the second khalif after Prophet  Muhammad]: Blessed be the person who has corrected 'Umar.    ['Amarah] Rabin said that 13 December, on which Israel's  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to have started, is not a  sacrosanct date. He now says the 13 April deadline for  completing the Israeli withdrawal is not sacred, either. What  do you think?    ['Arafat] This says something about the Israelis. Are they  men of their word? Do they honor the agreements to which they  put their signatures? Let them be judged by the world.    ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman, do you believe that the  Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva will help the implementation of  the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? Do you think this submit  will activate the peace process in the Middle East, especially  on the Syrian-Israeli track?    ['Arafat] No doubt, this summit was arranged in such a way  as  to be a basic pillar for proceeding on the Syrian-Israeli track.  Undoubtedly, this summit will facilitate movement on other  tracks. I wish this summit meeting success, so we can actually  proceed together in order to establish a just and comprehensive  peace in the region--peace that preserves the Arab nation's  dignity, existence, and rights.    ['Amarah] Israel and the Vatican yesterday signed an  agreement which was described as historic. This agreement has  ignored the Jerusalem issue. How do you evaluate this  Israeli-Vatican agreement?    ['Arafat] It does not (?mean) an agreement on Jerusalem  simply because the Vatican is aware that Jerusalem is not an  Israeli responsibility. Jerusalem is a Palestinian, Arab,  Islamic, and Christian responsibility.    ['Amarah] How do you view Israel's announcement that it is  not in a hurry to implement the agreement?    ['Arafat] Wind cannot shake a mountain. We are not shaken by  a statement here and a statement there. Our steps are firm.    ['Amarah] Mr. Chairman, can you address a message from Radio  Monte Carlo to all the listeners and the steadfast people in the  West Bank?    ['Arafat] I would like to tell all the Palestinian children  and women from the bottom of my heart and conscience that this  new year is the year of resurrection. Palestine is resurrected,  a national entity on the road to an independent state. It is  the year of the harvest. After years of struggle and  sacrifices, we are having our aims materialize on our national  soil. In this month and in this year, the month of the  nocturnal journey of the prophet to heaven, the month of the  Palestinian revolution, the emergence of Fatah, the revolution  of all the noble and free men in the Arab nation, this month and  this year will witness the beginning of the new historical era  for our people. This year will be the year of freedom for all  our heroic detainees, the knights whose heroism built our  historic achievement. To all our faithful martyrs, I say:  Peace be on your chaste souls, our brothers, comrades, beloved  ones, and leaders--Abu Jihad, Abu-Iyad, Abu-'Ali Iyad,  Abu-al-Walid, Abu-al-Hawl, Majid Abu-Sharar, Abu-Yusuf, Kamal  'Adwan, Abu-Sabri, 'Abd-al-Fattah (Nur), Kamal Nasir, Ghassan  Kanafani, Nazzal, and the many other leaders, cadres, and  martyrs fighters who have continued the fight of al-Qassam,  'Abd-al-Qadir al-Husayni, and Hakam Salamah and other heroes who  fell in defense of Palestine and Jerusalem. I tell them: The  clock has chimed: Victory for us and freedom for Palestine. In  the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, and we wished  to be gracious to those who were being depressed in the land, to  make them leaders in faith, and make them heirs and to establish  a firm place for them in the land. And those who strive in our  cause, we will certainly guide them to our paths; for verily God  is with those who do right. [Koranic verses]</p>

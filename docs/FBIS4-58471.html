			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] The fifth session of the multilateral talks on the  limitation of arms in the Middle East opened in Qatar yesterday.  The three-day talks are to be attended by 43 countries,  including the Zionist regime, most of the Arab countries, and  representatives from the United Nations and the European Union.  The topics to be discussed at the session will be the  limitation of arms in the Middle East and freeing this area of  mass destruction weapons.    The Middle East is one of the areas where a large volume of  conventional and nonconventional arms are being stored. A large  part of these arms, which are mainly nonconventional, are in the  Persian Gulf countries, while another part--consisting of both  conventional and nonconventional arms--are stored in Israel.  These arms are produced by Western countries, especially the  United States, which is creating threats in the region and is  thus flooding its arms into this area to free itself from  economic bankruptcy and create regional tensions.    What is noteworthy in this session is the Zionist regime's  participation. It is said that this regime has more than 200  nuclear warheads plus advanced non-nuclear weapons. Also, the  Zionist regime has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Pact  and the Disarmament Pact, which most countries have accepted.  The Arab countries in the Persian Gulf also carry out one-fifth  of the world's arms transactions, and one-fourth of their oil  income goes to buy these arms.    Thus, even though disarmament is a favorable issue in  principle, speaking about disarmament will be meaningless in  view of the increasing trend of arms production and arms  purchases, both by the Arab countries and by Israel, and one  cannot speak of disarmament while increasing arms purchases.    Meanwhile, the non-Middle East countries participating in  this conference are countries who enjoy large incomes from arms  sales. Thus, in drawing a logical conclusion it is impossible to  have a positive outcome from two negative points.    Thus, the convening of the Middle East peace conference [as  heard], which has caused heated arguments in the Arab and  Western mass media, can only be a mask covering the illogical  steps made by the participants in the arms conference. Israel  is benefiting from all this both by covering up the arms it  manufactures and by portraying its participation as a gesture of  goodwill toward the Arab countries to consolidate the Middle  East peace process.</p>

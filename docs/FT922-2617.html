			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / European industry agrees to back HDTV TELEVISION broadcasters, satellite operators and equipment makers have agreed to act together to promote wide-screen high-definition television (HDTV) in the European Community - provided EC member states fund the proposals. A declaration of intent was approved yesterday by nearly 40 companies and professional associations from across Europe. The declaration falls short of the legally-binding document which the European Commission originally hoped the industry would sign, but it should be followed up by bilateral contracts between the companies and the Commission, granting funding to individual projects. The success or failure of the whole programme now depends on the willingness of EC member states to approve the Commission's Ecu850m (Pounds 596.7m) HDTV 'action plan' - or at least a large enough part to satisfy the companies. The action plan itself is dependent on funding being made available for HDTV as part of the new overall EC budget proposals, which have already been attacked by a majority of finance ministers. A Commission official said last night that the declaration by the companies might encourage some of the more sceptical EC members to back the action plan. 'This is an important political signal on the part of industry that it's ready to play the game,' he said. Under the so-called memorandum of understanding approved yesterday, broadcasters have said they will prepare an operational project for the launch of an advanced wide-screen satellite or cable television service, using the D2-Mac transmission standards laid out in the directive agreed by member states last December. D2-Mac is an intermediate standard which should lead in the end to full HDTV. Manufacturers have committed themselves to producing sufficient quantities of D2-Mac wide-screen sets. The industry groups, which have been bickering about HDTV strategy for some years now, have also agreed to form a consortium to promote the principles laid out in the memorandum.</p>

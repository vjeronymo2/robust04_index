			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Victoria Carpet down 65% PRE-TAX profits at Victoria Carpet Holdings slumped 65.5 per cent in the year ended March 31 1993 and the dividend is cut by 33 per cent. Mr John Bettinson, chairman, said in the face of low level demand across the whole industry, sales were unlikely to be achieved without loss of margin. This had been the case as turnover in the UK and Australia remained static at Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 33.8m), but profit fell to Pounds 598,000 (Pounds 1.74m). Earnings per share dropped to 5.28p (18.08p) and the dividend is cut from 4.5p to 3p. The chairman said the emphasis at Kidderminster throughout the year had been on continuing development of new and imported carpet ranges, involving considerable investment. In Australia the market had not yet shown any sign of recovery and there had been even less demand than previously for better quality products. Colin Campbell &amp; Sons, of Vancouver, had returned to modest profit after restructuring.</p>

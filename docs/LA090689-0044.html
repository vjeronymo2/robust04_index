Police said a  Mercedes-Benz rigged with about 88 pounds of TNT exploded in the Mokalles  district, on the southeastern edge of East Beirut. A pedestrian and the driver  of a car parked near the Mercedes were reported killed. Elsewhere, Syrian and  Christian gunners dueled across the city's dividing Green Line, and hundreds of  Christian youths protested outside the U.S. Embassy, accusing the United States  of supporting Syria's role in Lebanon.  </P></p>

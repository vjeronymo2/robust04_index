			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Howard Smith improves 4% HOWARD Smith, the diversified Australian engineering group, yesterday announced a 4 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 26.7m (USDollars 18.8m) for the six months to the end of December, but warned that the second half would be tough. said depressed economic conditions would make it difficult for the group to equal last year's full-year net profit of ADollars 53.3m. Mr Moss said the interim result was 'pretty good' in the light of depressed trading conditions, which affected all the group's activities except engineering. The group said sales increased by 14.8 per cent to ADollars 404m, mainly due to a full half-year contribution from Dunlop Industrial Sales, which was acquired early last year. The directors declared a fully-franked interim dividend of 10 cents, compared to 10 cents unfranked last year. The board said the full-year dividend would also be fully franked. Tubemakers of Australia said equity-accounted net profit rose 52 per cent to ADollars 21m in the six months to the end of December, on sales down 1 per cent to ADollars 588m. National Foods, the Australian dairy and groceries group, said net profit increased by 480 per cent to ADollars 13m on sales up 1 per cent to ADollars 440m. The interim dividend was raised to 2.75 cents, fully franked, from 2.5 cents in the comparable period of the previous year.</p>

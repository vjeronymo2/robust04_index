			<p>BFN     [Text] Greek-Albanian relations are easing up following  yesterday's statement by Albanian President Sali Berisha and the  expected initiative of the European Union [EU] troika.    Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today reiterated that  Greece has never rejected any proposals for a dialogue, but  noted that, if necessary, it is determined to take very drastic  measures to deal with the Albanian provocations. Correspondent  Mirella Kalostipi reports:    [Begin recording] [Kalostipi] Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias harshly warned the Albanian Government that Greece has  the capability to hinder any brutal attacks against the Greek  minority and stressed that Tirana's credibility will be judged  according to its behavior on human rights. He suggested that  the Albanian authorities stay calm and criticized the ease with  which they make slanderous accusations against Greece.    [Papoulias] Tirana must be particularly calm. It is very  easy to make various slanderous accusations against Greece, but  these are unacceptable. Of course, the Greek side has made its  demarches at all the international forums, particularly the  European Union. I believe the EU will soon undertake an  initiative in the direction of protecting the Greek minority's  human rights.    [Kalostipi] Answering a question, Papoulias clarified that  the Greek Government does not intend to deport Albanians who  live in Greece. However, he called upon the Albanian president  to consider the financial benefits from the work of thousands of  illegal Albanian immigrants in Greece. The foreign minister  implied that control at the Greek-Albanian border will become  much stricter. Papoulias also stressed that the issue of EU  financial aid to Albania depends completely on its stance on  human rights.    Referring to the charges against Omonoia Chairman Sotirios  Kiriazatis and to his interrogation, Papoulias stressed that  violent charges during supposed interrogations that aim to  terrorize members of the Greek minority cannot continue.    [Papoulias] Once again I must warn Tirana that Greece has  the  capability to hinder any brutal attacks against the Greek  minority.    [Kalostipi] The foreign minister expressed concern at the  recent number of attacks against the Ecumenical Patriarchate in  Istanbul, but added that Greece is carefully and calmly  following the events. He said he intends to meet his Turkish  counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, on the sidelines of the NATO summit  that will be held in Istanbul in a few days. Papoulias will  express the Greek Government's dissatisfaction with the  slanderous campaign against our country, alleging the training  of Kurdish guerrillas on Greek territory. Papoulias described  these accusations as unfounded, adding that they hinder  Greek-Turkish relations.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEARING HELD FOR BOY FACING TRIAL AS ADULT  </P> <P> A 10-year-old Monroe County boy accused of homicide was angry the day he took  his father's rifle and fatally shot a 7-year-old girl, according to testimony  during a preliminary hearing Friday.  </P> <P> Claude Carr, the father of the dead girl, testified he saw Cameron Kocher leave  a neighbor's house in a fit of anger the day Jessica Ann Carr was shot.  </P> <P> "He appeared to be very angry, very upset," Carr said.  </P> <P> The neighbor, Richard Ratti, in whose yard Jessica was shot, testified Cameron  went home upset because Ratti would not allow the children to play video games.  Ratti said he told the children they couldn't play because they had left a room  messy.  </P> <P> Prosecutors alleged that Cameron went home and loaded his father's .35-caliber  rifle. They said Cameron pointed the gun out his parents' upstairs window and  shot Jessica as she rode on the back of a snowmobile in the Rattis' yard below.  </P> <P> Several witnesses testified Friday in Monroe County Court to determine whether  there is enough evidence to send the case to trial. The hearing, which will  resume Tuesday, is expected last several days.  </P> <P> Last month, Judge Ronald Vican ruled that Cameron, who was 9 years old at the  time of the shooting, should face trial in criminal court, rather than juvenile  court, because the adult court is better equipped to deal with the serious  charge of criminal homicide.  </P> <P> At the beginning of Friday's hearing, Cameron was also charged with two counts  of aggravated assault in connection with Jessica's death, and with recklessly  endangering the life of Shannon Ratti, 13, who was driving the snowmobile.  </P> <P> Cameron sat between his parents in the front row of the jury assembly room  being used as a courtroom. As in other hearings, Cameron showed no emotion  throughout the hearing.  </P></p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Why the case against devaluation is not clear-cut DEVALUATION has become a dirty word for most British politicians and economists. Witness the dismissal of recent calls for sterling to be realigned within the European exchange rate mechanism as unnecessary, ineffective and counter-productive. But how strong is the economic argument that lurks behind this anti-devaluation rhetoric? The case against devaluation has three parts: in the short-term, it would lead to higher interest rates and so delay the recovery; sterling is not 'over-valued' so there is no need to try to boost export competitiveness; and even if sterling were over-valued, the competitiveness gains would quickly disappear. The first argument is almost certainly true. UK interest rates are high because nervous investors demand a premium over high German rates. Devaluing would further jangle their taut nerves. But the jury is still out on whether sterling is over-valued. The UK real exchange rate, the nominal rate adjusted for differences in national price inflation in the traded sector, is broadly in line with its average level over the past two decades. Yet Britain also has a trade deficit at the bottom of a deep domestic recession. Moreover, the UK's relatively unprofitable manufacturing sector, the main source of traded goods, constitutes a smaller share of gross domestic product than in any other of the six largest industrialised countries except the US. Of course, the anti-devaluationists can concede that sterling could be over-valued. If so, a real devaluation will be needed to divert output to the traded sector. But this real devaluation cannot be achieved painlessly by changing the nominal exchange rate. Devaluing sterling would merely raise inflation, leaving the real exchange rate unchanged. It is easy to assert that the benefits of a devaluation would be wiped out by rising prices; but more difficult to demonstrate it. Historical evidence is undermined by a myriad of special factors; international experiments do not compare like with like. But neither source proves the anti-devaluationist's case. The left-hand chart shows the dollar and a real exchange rate using changes in unit labour costs as a proxy for traded goods prices. These two exchange rates moved together throughout the appreciation and subsequent depreciation of the dollar in the 1980s. Far from fuelling high wage inflation, the nominal depreciation was more than out-paced by the accompanying real depreciation. Of course, the US is a large and relatively isolated economy. For a small, open economy like Denmark, the gains would be quickly eroded by wage and price inflation. Rising import prices would push up costs, while consumers would pour in to buy cheap non-traded goods and services. The impact on medium-sized economies such as Italy or the UK should lie somewhere between these extremes, particularly as both the UK and Italy have more inflation-prone labour markets than the US. Yet the depreciation of the lira over the past two decades has been more than offset by higher domestic wage and price inflation, while the relationship between the UK nominal and real exchange rates looks more like that of the US than Italy. One reason is the very different exchange rate regimes facing sterling and the lira in the 1980s. The Italian real exchange rate started to move in an opposite direction to the nominal rate once Italy joined the ERM, and especially after 1987 when realignments became less frequent. The UK nominal and real rates only moved apart after sterling joined the ERM in 1990. Another reason is fiscal policy. Both the US and the UK had a contractionary fiscal policy while their exchange rates were depreciating; but loose Italian fiscal policy reinforced rather than offset the impact of the depreciation on domestic demand. Whether the response of the UK real exchange rate to a sterling devaluation within the ERM would resemble the Italian or the US experience would depend on whether, unlike in Italy, anti-inflationary credibility could be maintained afterwards. This would depend on whether it was accompanied by credibly tight monetary and fiscal policy, and changes in wage-bargaining practices. Of course, if sterling is not over-valued then this is all idle speculation.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CHEVRON WORKERS TERMINATED IN DRUG USE PROBE AT REFINERY  </P> <P> A company investigation of drug use at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo has  led to the termination of eight Chevron employees and 11 employees of a  contractor being barred from working at the sprawling facility, a company  spokesman said Monday.  </P> <P> Private investigators hired by the oil firm in early July uncovered the use of  small amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana, according to Chevron  spokesman Rod Spackman.  </P> <P> "As soon as we received this information, we felt it was important to act  quickly and promptly. This all developed in the space of a couple weeks," said  Spackman.  </P> <P> The Chevron employees, who had worked at the refinery from one to 13 years,  were either maintenance or security personnel, he said. None of the workers,  who were paid from $9.50 to $16 an hour, were supervisors.  </P> <P> The investigation was announced in a July 20 memorandum to all employees from  Mike Holmes, general manager of the refinery.  </P> <P> "Based on the results of this investigation, several employees are no longer  employed by the company and a number of contractor employees are no longer  permitted to work at our plant," Holmes said in the memo.  </P> <P> "Our policy prohibits the use, possession, sale, purchase or distribution of  illegal drugs or controlled substances on company property."  </P> <P> Spackman declined to identify the employees, the contracting firm or the  investigators. Chevron officials have briefed El Segundo police about the  investigation but no arrests were made, he said.  </P> <P> Chevron has agreed to pay up to $20,000 for drug treatment for each former  employee. Spackman declined to say whether the employees were fired or  resigned.  </P> <P> Chevron requires drug tests of all new hires and of employees that management  suspects of drug use. Employees with drug or alcohol problems are encouraged to  seek treatment on a confidential basis.  </P></p>

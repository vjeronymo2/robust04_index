			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> U.S. BARS SPEAKER  </P> <P> It is really pathetic that the United States is so afraid of the truth being  spoken in this country about the pending Nicaraguan elections. Norma Cuadra,  representative of the Nicaraguan Institute for Economic and Social Research,  was to have spoken last Tuesday on the Cal State Fullerton campus about the  possibility for better relations between the United States and Nicaragua and  the role of international organizations in the 1990 Nicaraguan elections. At  the last minute she was denied entrance to the United States.  </P> <P> Thus a chance for an important educational exchange is lost to the students.  But the image of the U.S. State Department as a bully is seen again with great  clarity. DOROTHY CALLISON, Fullerton  </P></p>

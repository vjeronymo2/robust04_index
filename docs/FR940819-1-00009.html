The maximum contaminant levels of U.S. EPA shall apply. Individual water systems must be tested for quantity and bacteriological quality. Where problems are anticipated with chemical quality, chemical tests may be required. Chemical tests would be limited to analysis for the defects common to the area such as iron and manganese, hardness, nitrates, pH, turbidity, color, or other undesirable elements. Polluted or contaminated water supplies are unacceptable. In all cases, assurance of a potable water supply before loan closing is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal systems with subsurface discharge provided by a soil scientist, geologist, soils engineer, or other person recognized by the local regulatory authority. This data should include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Assurance of nonpollution of ground water. The local regulatory authority having jurisdiction must be consulted to ensure that installation of individual wastewater systems will not pollute ground water sources or create other health hazards/or otherwise violate State water quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Records of percolation tests. Guidance for performing these tests is included in the EPA design manual, ``Onsite Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems.'' (This may be waived by the State Director when the State has established other acceptable means for allowing onsite disposal.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Determination of soil types and description. The assistance of the SCS or other qualified persons should be obtained for soil type determination and a copy of its recommendations included in the documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Description of ground water elevations, showing seasonal variations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Confirmation of space allowances. An accurate drawing to indicate that there is adequate space available to satisfactorily locate the individual water and/or wastewater disposal systems; likewise, documented assurance of compliance with all local requirements. Structures served by wastewater disposal systems with subsurface discharge require larger sites than those structures served by another type system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Description of exploratory pit observations, if available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Supporting information for individual wastewater disposal systems with surface discharge covering the following points:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Effluent standards issued by the appropriate regulatory agency that controls the discharge of the proposed individual systems. Assurance from this regulatory agency that the effluent standards will not be exceeded by the individual systems being proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Program of maintenance, parts and service available to the system-owner for upkeep of the system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) A plan for local inspection of the system by a responsible agency with the authority to ensure compliance with health and safety standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Electric service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The power supplier will be consulted by the applicant to assure that there is adequate service available to meet the needs of the proposed development. Underground service is preferred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gas service <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Gas distribution facilities, if provided, will be installed according to local requirements where adequate and dependable gas service is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other utilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other utilities, if available, will be installed according to local requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1924.108  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Grading and drainage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Soil and geologic conditions must be suitable for the type of construction proposed. In questionable or unsurveyed areas, the applicant or developer will provide an engineering report with supporting data sufficient to identify all pertinent subsurface conditions which could adversely affect the structure and show proposed solutions. Grading will promote drainage of surface water away from buildings and foundations, minimize earth settlement and erosion, and assure that drainage from adjacent properties onto the development or from the development to adjacent properties does not create a health hazard or other undesirable conditions. Grading and drainage will comply with Exhibit B, paragraphs III and IV, of this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cuts and fills.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Development requiring extensive earthwork, cuts and fills of 4 feet or more shall be designed by a duly licensed or registered engineer. Where topography requires fills or extensive earthwork that must support structures and building foundations, these must be controlled fills designed, supervised and tested by a qualified soils engineer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Slope protection.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All slopes must be protected from erosion by planting or other means.

Storm water systems should be compatible with the natural features of the site. In areas with inadequate natural and/or man-made drainage systems, permanent and/or temporary storm water storage shall be an integral part of the overall development plan. Design of these facilities shall consider safety, appearance and economical maintenance operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;&sect;1924.109&hyph;1924.114  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Reserved]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1924.115  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Single Family Housing site evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The site approval official will evaluate each site (developed or undeveloped) to determine acceptance for the program.

The review appraiser and/or the site approval official will review the information, complete any required information, and sign the back of the form. If the site is new construction in a subdivision, the builder will provide Form HUD&hyph;92541, ``Builder's Certification of Plans, Specifications, and Site'', available in any Agency office. The site approval official must complete the proper environmental review required by subpart G of part 1940 of this chapter for each site.

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA;  </P> <P> COMMUNIST GRIP ON SERBIA TIGHTENED  </P> <P> Serbia's ruling Communists adopted a new constitution strengthening their  control over Yugoslavia's largest republic.  </P> <P> The document gives greater power to its Marxist president and virtually ends  autonomy for ethnic Albanians. The 136-article constitution was approved by the  single-party, 250-member Serbian Assembly at a special televised session that  marked a major step in the Communists' efforts to retain power by revamping  their image and exploiting rising Serbian nationalism. The republic's first  free elections in 45 years are set for Dec. 9 for the legislature and  president. Six main opposition parties have threatened to boycott the voting.  </P></p>

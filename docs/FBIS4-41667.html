			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA carries  remarks by Police Colonel-General Mikhail Yegorov, first deputy  interior minister and head of the ministry's main department for  combatting organised crime, in connection with the presidential  decree "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population from  Banditry and Other Manifestations of Organised Crime". The  decree took effect on Monday.    Yegorov said that more than 200 well-organised and heavily  armed criminal groups operate now in Moscow alone. Criminal  groups commit 1,500 crimes in Russia every month. He said  rejection of the presidential decree by many officials and  politicians is accounted for by the fact that they are  businessmen themselves and it would be disadvantageous to them  if law enforcement agencies get access to commercial information  and, what is most important, would be able to trace the tortuous  ways their money travels through.    Corruption in close conjunction with organised crime has  penetrated all spheres of state administration, the Interior  Ministry spokesman stated. He said that in 1993 alone police  discharged more than 500 operatives who collaborated with  criminal groups, selling day-to-day information. There were  even personnel members who together with bandits were involved  in murders. Criminal proceedings were instituted against them  and they were dismissed from internal affairs agencies. Several  high officials were arrested in Vladimir region and Komi  Republic.    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA gives the opinion of Issa Kostoyev,  chairman of the federal council committee for constitutional  legislation and court and legal matters, that the decree runs  counter to the Constitution, the Criminal Procedure Code, the  Law on Enterprises and Entrepreneurial Activities, and the Law  on Banks and Banking Activities. As a result, innocent people  may be affected.    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA (NEW DAILY NEWSPAPER), referring  to statements by spokesmen of the Russian Interior Ministry,  writes that "no cardinal changes, no sweeping round-ups or  searches (in view of the entering into force of the  above-mentioned decree -- note by ITAR-TASS) are planned.  Simply, `it will be easier for police to act'.    "Do you think that we were looking forward to the decree as  a  starting pistol signal? We put gangs into prison and we shall  continue to do so. The decree is only of some help in this  process," Gennadiy Chebotarev, first deputy head of the  ministry's main department for combatting organised crime, told  the newspaper.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with Valeriy  Manilov, deputy secretary of the Russian Federation Security  Council, who believes that the following levels of security  exist: "The security of the individual, the security of society,  the security of the state. But still the safety of the  individual is most important and is the point of departure".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI interviewed Oleg Gaydanov, deputy  prosecutor- general of the Russian Federation, who told the  newspaper: "The presidential decree dated June 14, I should say,  is viewed in the prosecutor's office in varied ways, too. Some  measures provided for in the decree really run counter to the  current legislation. But one must realise that the problems of  combatting crime are now uppermost in the minds of people in  Russia and worry them more than any other one".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA runs an interview with two candidates  for  the Ukrainian presidency -- the incumbent President Leonid  Kravchuk and ex-Premier Leonid Kuchma.    "I am convinced that whoever becomes a president of Ukraine  he, and together with him the whole of Ukraine, will always be  in a hard situation if he would fail to proceed from the premise  that relations with Russia should have a special status,  considering the past and the future ..." Kravchuk told the  newspaper.    "If we learned to respect each other, then 70 per cent of  our  problems would have been resolved. Therefore relations with  Russia are the most important matter, the centerpiece in our  policy", Kravchuk said.    Kuchma stated, for his part: "I have believed and continue  to  believe that we have many common interests on the territory of  the former Soviet Union. As far as trips abroad are concerned,  one should travel and have contacts with those countries which  want that".    Touching upon the Black Sea Fleet issue, Kuchma emphasised:  "The problem, to my mind, has long been resolved by the present  government. One should come to see what the solution is. We  really need to undo this Black Sea knot. Otherwise, someone  will always play this card in relations between Ukraine and  Russia".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports that "the military collegium of  the Russian Federation Supreme Court has referred an application  from former Soviet Deputy Minister of Defence Valentin  Varennikov to the Russian prosecutor-general's office for the  institution of criminal proceedings in connection with the fact  of `the break-up of the USSR'. Varennikov's defence lawyer  Dmitriy Shteynberg, who announced this, pointed out that in  accordance with law the prosecutor's office should verify the  application and decide on or deny the institution of criminal  proceedings". Varennikov was a defendant at the coup plotters'  trial.    PRAVDA writes that "now, just as two years ago, the question  of Lithuanian investigators' possible taking of testimony from  former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has re-emerged. They  are convinced, the newspaper RESPUBLIKA reported, that Gorbachev  was well informed of a conspiracy being prepared in Lithuania  and did not stand aloof from the developments'. Referring to  well-informed sources, the newspaper maintains that `an official  charge against Gorbachev may be formulated in the coming days'".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, referring to the opinion of Vice-  Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, writes that gross production of  grain in Russia this year is expected to amount to 90-95 million  tonnes, which will make it possible not to purchase grain abroad.    TRUD carries an article by Yegor Gaydar, leader of Russia's  Democratic Choice Party, who writes: "We are for a party of  clean hands. This is what all politicians say. But it seems to  me that we have real grounds to say that. At all events, I do  not know who from among our active workers was accused of  corruption if only once.    "Those democratic politicians whose reputation was not  impeccable, quit Russia's Choice or from the very outset were  members of other parties. On the other hand, our party is  supported by those who are known as decent people, who did not  pursue big money and high positions and who were even ready to  go to prison for their convictions."    TRUD carries in interview with Ranendra Sena, the Indian  ambassador to the Russian Federation, who said "We should not  limit our relations to trade. It is essential to develop  lasting and mutually beneficial partnership, establishing  co-production, combining technological resources, creating  common managerial structures and studying the market."    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Admiral of the Fleet  Ivan Kapitanets, who points out: "We intend to uphold the  interests of the fleet through the Federal Assembly. Our task  is to convince the deputies, government and president that fleet  expenditure should be separated from the all-budget one and turn  it into a separate purpose-oriented item. A state programme  should be worked out for the development of the fleet 15-20  years ahead. Without that, the fleet would not simply survive".    PRAVDA carries a statement by the State Duma group of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation, on the 1994 budget  issue. The statement reads as follows: "The members of the  Communist Party group in the state Duma believe that the 1994  draft budget submitted by the government, even after the  introduction of some amendments to it, firstly, does not meet  the interests of the people and the country. Secondly, it does  not promote the country's getting out of the economic crisis  and, thirdly, it has no clear priorities and is not aimed at  providing the social protection of the population or  strengthening the country's defence capacity".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 10 (ATA) -- Yesterday morning an  explosion occurred in the house of Nebil Cika, editor-in-chief  of the weekly local newspaper SARANDA, as a result of which only  some material damages were caused, ATA correspondent in Sarande  reported.    This is the second explosion after the first one on March 3  which also resulted only in material damage. The SARANDA  newspaper, directed by Mr. Cika and published in Sarande,  opposes the policy of Greek chauvinistic circles in regard to  the southern part of Albania, which they call North Epirus. An  article published recently in the SARANDA dwelt on question of  the Albanian population forcibly transferred from Cameria, an  Albanian province given to Greece by the 1913 Conference of  Ambassadors. The Greek andarts [as received] have committed  massacres in Cameria after the First and Second World Wars,  which are still alive in the memories of the inhabitants of this  region.</p>

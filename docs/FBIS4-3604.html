			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Flor Wang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan's government-  consumption expenditure accounted for 17.2 percent of the  nation's gross national product in 1992, the highest level of  any major Asian country that year, according to data made public  recently by the International Monetary Fund.    IMF tallies show that government-consumption expenditure  rates in all other major Asian countries were below 10 percent  in 1992, except in South Korea, where the rate was 11.4 percent.  Singapore and Indonesia had 9.6 percent rates, and Hong Kong an  8.6 percent rate.    Government-consumption expenditures include spending on  personnel, office equipment, rent, and payouts on debts.    Government officials said the 17.2 percent was bloated by  the  10 percent of GNP spent on personnel. Personnel spending in  Japan and South Korea was 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively,  in 1992.    They said that spending on 700,000 government officials,  half  million-strong army, public schoolteachers, and on retired  government employees' pensions added greatly to the governmet's  burden.    The huge spending on personnel not only is a waste of the  nation's limited resources, but also reduces government  effectiveness, they warned.</p>

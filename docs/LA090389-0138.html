			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE PUTS ON QUITE AN EXHIBITION  </P> <P> The UCLA-USC rivalry might be one of the nation's greatest in college football,  but there is no comparison between the schools when the sport is soccer.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge proved that in resounding fashion Saturday night, whipping  the Trojans, 5-0, in an exhibition soccer match before 851 onlookers at North  Campus Stadium. The Matadors lost to UCLA, 2-1, in an exhibition opener a week  ago.  </P> <P> Northridge, runner-up in the past two NCAA Division II championships, dominated  play against USC, a club team, outshooting the Trojans, 26-0.  </P> <P> Five Matadors scored goals, including Haaratch (Danny) Daniels, a freshman from  Nicosia, Cyprus, who capped the Northridge scoring on an assist from Andy  Torres at the 85:38 mark.  </P> <P> USC goalkeeper Joe Livengood had blocked Torres' penalty shot from the left  side, but Daniels was there to convert the rebound.  </P> <P> Teammate Jim Hofferber had given the Matadors a 4-0 lead 10 minutes earlier  when he headed in Daniels' corner kick off the left goal post.  </P> <P> Despite the victory, Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad was disappointed with his  team's performance.  </P> <P> "We didn't play well," Ass'ad said. "I didn't like what I saw. We still miss  Scott Piri a lot.  </P> <P> "USC brought us down to their level tonight."  </P> <P> Piri, a sophomore from Burroughs High in Ridgecrest and the Matadors' leading  scorer last season, suited up for Saturday's match but did not play because of  a groin injury. Piri also missed the UCLA match.  </P> <P> "When Scott returns we will be much better," Ass'ad promised. "He makes  everyone else play better."  </P> <P> Piri is expected to be in the lineup for Friday night's regular-season opener  against Division I Cal State Los Angeles. But he wasn't needed against USC.  </P> <P> With the Northridge defense -- led by midfielder Ed Burns -- smothering the USC  attack, goalkeepers Mike Littman and Mike Gonzalez weren't required to make a  save.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Northridge offense spent most of the evening running a variety  of plays at USC's end of the field.  </P> <P> "Some people on our defense played very well tonight," Ass'ad said. "But some  of them are faster learners than others. We still have a lot of work."  </P> <P> The first half was a precursor of things to come as Northridge took a 3-0 lead  by outshooting the Trojans, 13-0.  </P> <P> Freshman Roberto Guerrero's unassisted goal gave Northridge a 3-0 lead at the  36:55 mark and came after scores by sophomore Roberto Reyes (29:07) and senior  Bill Durkin (12:22).  </P> <P> Durkin scored on a header off Torres' corner kick to easily beat USC goalkeeper  Mark Nevins, and Terry Davila fed Reyes with a pass that left him in a  one-on-one situation against Nevins.  </P></p>

William &amp; Company, Inc., to manufacture textile bed linens under zone procedures for export within FTZ 50. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on May 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The company plans to manufacture bed sheet sets, comforters and pillows. The primary input is woven polyester/cotton fabric (HTSUS 5513(14).41, duty rate: 17%), which is sourced from abroad (primarily from China). Additional foreign materials that may be used in the future include woven fabric of artificial/synthetic fibers, sewing thread, and nonwoven fill. The application indicates that zone procedures would be used only for export manufacturing activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The company would export all products made with foreign fabric and other foreign textile mill products admitted to the zone. Zone procedures would exempt it from U.S. quota requirements and Customs duty payments on the foreign items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been appointed examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties.

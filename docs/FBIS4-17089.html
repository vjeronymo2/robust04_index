			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 21 TASS -- The United Nations, Russia,  the United States and the European Union [EU] should propose  clear goals and a realistic framework for an all-round  settlement to the warring sides in the Bosnian conflict. Such a  plan can be hammered out in a relatively short period of time,  said international mediator, Lord Owen, here on Wednesday [20  April] evening.    He arrived in Moscow on Wednesday together with Thorvald  Stoltenberg for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev.    According to the co-chairman of the coordination committee  on  the international conference on Yugoslavia, many Serbs want  peace and would be ready to approve a concrete plan as an  alternative to war.    The Vance-Owen plan contained appropriate proposals. This  document needs some supplements, taking into account agreements  on setting up a federation of Bosnian Moslems and Croats and the  talks on Serb Krajina in Croatia.    It is necessary to set up a mechanism which would enable  representatives from the U.N., the EU, Russia and the U.S. to  meet on a confidential basis and to agree positions.  Incidentally, they do not differ much.    Owen explains the absence of Washington's immediate reply to  the invitation to participate in quadripartite consultations by  the attention given by American politicians to the request of  U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to continue military  pressure on Bosnian Serbs.    Owen said that part of his delegation will remain in Moscow  to continue consultations with the Russian Foreign Ministry. It  is necessary, the international mediator stressed, that "the  four" should meet as soon as possible.</p>

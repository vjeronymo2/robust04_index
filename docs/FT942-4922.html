			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG policy confusion sends mining shares tumbling Shares in mining companies with interests in Papua New Guinea fell on the Australian stockmarket yesterday as confusion reigned over whether there could be a six to 12 month moratorium on new mining projects there. At the weekend, Mr John Kaputin, PNG's mining and petroleum minister, said that a moratorium would be imposed after a decision on the ADollars 1.2bn (Pounds 590m) Lihir gold-mine project was taken, and that this would allow him to rethink the country's mining policies. Mr Kaputin gave no hint of the implications of such a 'rethink' - but one mining company speculated that it could result in changes to the tax regime. However, late yesterday, Mr Masket Iangalio, the finance minister and former mining minister, said it was unlikely that the government would endorse Mr Kaputin's moratorium idea. 'I wish to state categorically that the development of our resources. . . will continue in an orderly manner without interruption,' he said. Kaputin-Iangalio split brings into the open simmering differences between the two men - which, in turn, have affected the Lihir project, a joint venture involving Britain's RTZ group and Niugini Mining, controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain. For months the necessary special mining lease for Lihir has not been forthcoming, while the PNG cabinet is understood to be divided over how to structure the mine's development and what stakes to give at the outset to the state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation and to local landowners. Among the companies affected by yesterday's stockmarket sell-off were Dome Resources, which lost seven cents at 45 cents, Highlands Gold, which shed four cents to ADollars 1.40, and Niugini Mining, down 20 cents to ADollars 5.10. Few mining companies or analysts wanted to talk publicly about the latest turn of events in this resource-rich but notoriously unpredictable country. Privately, however, they noted that Mr Kaputin made his remarks at an extremely sensitive time in terms of PNG's domestic politics. A 'no confidence' motion was tabled at the end of last week against Mr Paias Wingti, the prime minister, based on allegations of bribery, corruption and wife-beating. The uncertainty over the moratorium is the latest in a series of blows to international confidence in PNG. Other upheavals have included the guerrilla war on Bougainville island; restructuring of interests in the Porgera gold mine; and a ADollars 4bn environmental law suit filed against BHP, operator of the Ok Tedi mine.</p>

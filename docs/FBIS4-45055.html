			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Teachers in the Service of </F> Terrorism"; first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] Once again, a terrorist association headed by  teachers has been rendered harmless by the security  services.    Thirty-one individuals: that is how many members there were  in the terrorist support network recently dismantled by the  security services. One of their "leaders" is none other than a  middle school teacher employed at the Ben Amlar CEM [College of  Intermediate Studies] in Mila. Five other teachers and a school  inspector were also active in the group.    Apart from its size--especially important to the security  services, since they were able to make a big haul--this case  provides additional proof of the link between Algerian schools  and terrorism. It is also proof that some teachers, who are  members or supporters of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front] and therefore completely behind fundamentalist and  obscurantist ideology, have not confined themselves solely to  joining armed groups but have also taken command of those who  kill, burn, and destroy.    Is it necessary to point out that at least 315 teachers have  been discovered in terrorist groups? That of the 7,000  individuals interned in the centers in the south in 1992, there  were 1,224 teachers, professors, and educators? That nine  teachers with weapons in their hands have been killed by the  police? Those figures, alarming to say the least, show in their  own way how widespread is the disease that is eating away at  Algerian schools and will eventually destroy them if we keep on  pretending not to see anything.    It must not be forgotten that those who have sullied the  teaching profession began by instilling radicalism and  fundamentalism in our children--the future pillars of the  nation. They took advantage of the fact that the schools were  already in a noticeably shaky state to infiltrate them and  propagate their doctrine.    What were school officials doing while that was happening?  Nothing. They had their eyes closed because they were much more  concerned with their own status. Today the school system, the  source of learning, is a disaster area. And we are only too  aware of the results of that policy: children placed in the  hands of the "teachers of terrorism." But it is also true that  other teachers who oppose the plan have long been sounding the  alarm.</p>

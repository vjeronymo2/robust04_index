			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Indian stock market reforms gather pace - The recent spate of legislation opening up the nation's 21 exchanges STRUCTURAL overhaul of India's stock and capital markets has been long overdue. Yet few observers anticipated the government would display such enthusiasm now that it has finally tackled the job. Recently new guidelines have been showering down on bemused market participants. Last month the government ended its monopoly on mutual funds by permitting private companies to start their own funds. A few days earlier, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was given statutory status as an autonomous body providing investor protection, prohibiting insider trading, promoting the development of capital markets and regulating intermediaries. Meanwhile, pressure on the Bombay Stock Exchange to stop operating like a cartel is increasing. These recent reforms are just the tip of the iceberg and more announcements are expected. The most important and controversial measure under discussion is the setting-up of a national stock market system. Although the reforms so far have been generally welcomed, not everyone supports them. One principal area of concern is Sebi's new status. On the day the Sebi directive was announced, it was welcomed in corporate and financial circles. Sebi had finally been given teeth. However, some are now wondering if these are effective. One concern is that under the guise of liberalisation, government is in fact enhancing its own supervisory role. A closer look at the fine print reveals Sebi can do little without an approving nod from the finance ministry. At the country's 21 stock exchanges, however, it is business as usual and the national index has advanced strongly. The biggest gains have been in Bombay, where more than two thirds of the country's trading takes place. Volume has doubled in six months. Trading in Bombay is poised to expand with the imminent listing of the Rs26bn worth of shares in 21 public sector undertakings (PSUs) recently sold to financial institutions and mutual funds. According to Mr Hemendra Kothari, the Bombay Stock Exchange president, the market's capitalisation is expected to shoot up from the current Rs165,000bn to Rs275,000bn after the PSUs are listed. In the meantime the Bombay authorities are trying with limited success to cool the heated market. None of the curbs on forward trading and speculation have dented stockbrokers' enthusiasm. However some of the larger traders are predicting a serious market correction by April. This is when company results start to trickle in, and there are many sectors of the economy that have performed well below par. The majority of today's aggressive brokers, however, tend to dismiss these downbeat forecasts. The opening-up of the mutual fund business to the private sector is cited as one reason why stock markets may soon fall sharply. Several big business houses are expected to promote their own funds. Many, such as the Bombay-based Essar group, have already done their homework. 'Our application is ready,' says Mr Ravi Ruia, a director. Once the new funds flood in, too much money may end up chasing too few scrips. However many observers believe the markets will remain buoyant because of an expanding investor population. Ten years ago, there were 2m investors, most of them businessmen. Though no reliable figures are available, analysts believe that there are between 14m and 15m investors in India today. Currently, the Indian capital market is like a roulette table where everyone wins. Nobody wants to predict the future.</p>

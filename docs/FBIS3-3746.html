At that time, he said that if China strengthened  legislation work from then on, she would surely become a country  with a sound legal system within 50 years. Ye Jianying nodded  knowingly.    When he was elected member of the NPC Standing Committee,  China's supreme legislative body, today, he deeply felt that he  was shouldering heavy responsibilities. Unlike some other Hong  Kong magnates, Tsang Hin-chi graduated from Zhongshan  University's Biological Department in 1961 and went abroad to  seek his fortune after working in the Biological Chemistry  Laboratory of the Guangdong Academy of Sciences for two years.  This enabled him to have a better understanding of mainland  politics and economics and China's national condition. He said:  In the past China was deeply influenced by the Soviet planned  economic model. Since the drive of reform and opening up began,  it has gradually freed itself from this influence. China, which  is establishing a socialist market economic structure, is  developing and forging ahead. This has been recognized by the  world community. Of course, China has shortcomings. For  example, the fact that there is corruption among some officials  should not be denied. The problem is how we should approach  these shortcomings. An individual or a family inevitably has  one inadequacy or another. Ours is a big country. While making  achievements, it still suffers some unsatisfactory phenomena.  This is quite normal, and, moreover, the government is working  to develop strong points and correct shortcomings.    To many people, the name of Tsang Hin-chi is synonymous with  the title of "Tie King." In fact, the social activities in  which he gets involved are so numerous that they far exceed all  expectations. In addition to national deputy to the Seventh and  Eighth NPC, he is vice chairman of the All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce, member of the Preliminary Work Committee  of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region, Hong Kong Affairs adviser, vice president  of the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, professor of  Beijing University's Business Administration College, vice  chairman of Jinan University's Board of Directors, and vice  chairman of Jianying University's Board of Directors. His  current election as a Standing Committee member of the NPC  serves as a new starting point in the journey of his career and  life.    Regarding the new role as a mission, Tsang Hin-chi told  reporters that the Standing Committee has done a great deal of  work on legislation. He noted that the legal system is being  gradually instituted and improved, and instituting a legal  system from scratch and proceeding from legal construction to  legal improvement is a relatively long process. This has also  been the case with some Western countries.    As the only NPC Standing Committee member from the Hong Kong  region, Tsang Hin-chi is faced with the complex reality of Hong  Kong being in the last three years of its transition and the  historical trend of the Chinese recovery of sovereignty over  Hong Kong. One may well say that the matter is complicated and  the burden is heavy.</p>

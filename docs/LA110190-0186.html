			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON: NO FINGER-POINTING AT 2-5  </P> <P> The team met Wednesday to regroup in the wake of its dip to 2-5 after Monday  night's dismal 41-10 loss to the Steelers in Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> "We talked fairly extensively about it," Coach John Robinson said.  </P> <P> "I don't see any withdrawal or recriminations, no finger-pointing. We talked  about it. We have to be concerned that there isn't just a numbness about  everything. It's almost as though you build a little cocoon around yourself to  kind of ward off the pain. We've got to stand up and do something about it and  not just absorb it."  </P> <P> Cornerback Jerry Gray said that since coming back from arthroscopic knee  surgery a month ago, his play has been hampered by a nagging insecurity about  the injury. Tuesday, he had an X-ray that showed no further serious damage, but  Gray said the knee still isn't close to being 100%: "Out there Monday, I felt  like I had no burst." TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

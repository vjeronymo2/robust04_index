			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong falters over airport stalemate - Unfriendly noises from China have reversed a dramatic bull run, says John Elliott HONG KONG's politically sensitive stock market has run into one of its jittery periods, caused as usual by unfriendly and destabilising noises from China, which regains sovereignty over the British colony in 1997. China's target is Hong Kong's plan to build a HKDollars 100bn (USDollars 12.7bn) international airport. The stock market lost its nerve after Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, failed to generate an agreement by visiting Peking earlier this month. This reversed a dramatic bull run which took the local Hang Seng index up from around 3,000 at the begining of the year to 3,869.7 a fortnight ago - only about 80 points below the all-time high of 3,949.73 reached just before the 1987 world markets crash. The run staggered almost all brokers and analysts because they had not expected the index to move far above 3,300-3,500 for most of this year. At its peak it caused serious concern because of the risk of gambling fever overtaking the colony's ethnic Chinese community and because of the possible destabilising impact of a heavy correction. But the correction has not been too severe and the market seems to have adjusted to the airport impasse. The index is now hovering around 3,700-3,800. It closed yesterday at 3,717.46, just 3.09 points up on the day amid confusion created by mixed signals from China about the airport. Volume fell to HKDollars 1.12bn from HKDollars 1.15bn. The bull run outdistanced other markets during and after the Gulf war because Hong Kong was underpriced against other markets in the region and was waiting for a major event to generate activity. International institutions, which were light on Hong Kong, led the buying spree and then instigated the correction after it was clear that the market had risen too far too fast. Analysts now believe that it could take some time for momentum to build up again - unless there was an unexpectedly rapid agreement on the airport, which would generate an instant mood of euphoria because it would help to smooth relations with China. On the other hand, a total failure to agree, and consequential shelving of the project, would strike a severe blow to confidence and the market. The airport is significant because the Hong Kong government estimates that it needs to raise about 25 per cent of the project cost from the private sector in the form of bonds and direct equity investment. Since the pay-back period will not start till after 1997, investors will want to be sure that the project is backed by China. That backing has not yet materialised, for a mixture of political and economic reasons, and the Hong Kong government is now considering whether to attempt a new compromise. If it were not for the airport problem the mood would be much more buoyant. The economy is picking up, fuelled especially by recovery in southern China, and forecasts for this year's growth range around 4 per cent to 5 per cent compared with 2.5 per cent last year. These forecasts might be adjusted upwards if the US economy recovers significantly later this year. The half-year season of corporate results has just ended without any unexpected bad news and there are optimistic earnings forecasts for the full year and for 1992. Relaxations, announced at the weekend, of a ban on companies buying back their own shares could also spur activity. On the negative side, hassles in the US over China's most favoured nation status might knock confidence this year because removal of the status would hit Hong Kong industry and trade. There could be some politically-inspired nervousness late in the summer ahead of the first ever direct elections to the colony's legislative council. However, there is generally more optimism than gloom about prospects later in the year, however, subject to the China and airport factors. 'After a period of consolidation, we'll be looking at an index of 4,000 by July,' says Mr Barry Yates, research director of Asia Equity Holdings.</p>

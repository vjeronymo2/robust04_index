			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> LATINOS ARE TARGETED IN DONOR HUNT  </P> <P> "Ayuden a Armando."  </P> <P> Not far from the hand-lettered sign asking for help, a thin boy watched  solemnly as workers from the Life-Savers Foundation of America recruited  potential bone marrow donors who might save his life.  </P> <P> "I am grateful to the people for coming," 12-year-old Armando Garcia said  quietly as shoppers from the busy VivaMart store put down their groceries a  moment to sit at folding tables, bare their arms and contribute a small vial of  blood for testing.  </P> <P> "If this can help him," said Jose Garcia, Armando's father, "it is something  really big. It means a lot."  </P> <P> Armando, a pale youth whose deep, dark bangs frame wide, brown eyes, has been  ill for more than a year with mylodysplastic syndrome, a form of leukemia.  Without a bone marrow transplant, he is not expected to live more than six  months, foundation officials said.  </P> <P> But hoping to help him survive, the Covina-based nonprofit foundation was  launching its first campaign targeting the Latino community.  </P> <P> Explained foundation spokeswoman Susan Rafkin: "The chances that two unrelated  people will match are one in 20,000. . . . But we're hoping it might be easier  to find a match for Armando among Hispanic people."  </P> <P> The 2-year-old organization runs a national registry of 100,000 potential  donors, but Latinos are seriously under-represented, Rafkin said. Other  foundation workers said they do not believe that the Latino community  understands the grave need for bone marrow donors.  </P> <P> In their effort to find a match for Armando, foundation officials placed ads  and news stories about the boy's plight in Latino newspapers and on  Latino-radio stations, Rafkin said. They printed new leaflets in Spanish  explaining Life-Savers and the need for a bone marrow transplant ("un  transplante de medula osea").  </P> <P> They set up a toll-free "Armando hot line" (1 (800) 950-1050) to handle  contributions for testing potential donors.  </P> <P> And they persuaded the Santa Ana Business Bureau to donate $2,000 to the  Life-Savers for the Armando campaign. The money would pay for blood tests of  potential donors, said Rafkin, who noted that analysis of each tablespoon-size  sample typically costs $75.  </P> <P> VivaMart also contributed $5,000 toward the blood tests and encouraged its  employees to assist at Life-Savers' tables Sunday.  </P> <P> Late Sunday, the work had paid off, Rifkin said, noting that 72 people were  tested. But she added that the Santa Ana campaign would continue this month --  with new test sites at community centers and churches. LANIE JONES  </P></p>

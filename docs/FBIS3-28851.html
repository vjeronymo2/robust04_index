			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukraine was once known as having an active (?share)  among the former Soviet states and becoming a prosperous  economy. Two years after gaining independence, this assessment  has yet to bear fruit. It is still wrestling with what is a  difficult process: to become a market economy. Nevertheless,  its government is committed to bring economic development to the  country as quickly as possible. As such, the recent visit of  Ukraine's deputy foreign minister of external economic relations  to Malaysia is a step in the right direction.    The move would help initiate cooperation between the two  countries as well as enhance mutually beneficial economic  activities. The minister, A.D. Makarenko, said that his country  was offering attractive investment incentives to foreign  investors. Expanding its foreign trade and deepening the  industrial base could perhaps be the right target in providing a  boost to the country's economy.    Malaysian companies, having the expertise in certain  manufacturing operations should take advantage of these  incentives through [word indistinct]. This is because, through  Ukraine, they could make inroads into the vast export markets of  the Commonwealth of Independent States.    Ukraine also has a well educated labor force, abundant  natural resources, and market accessibility into neighboring  countries. Areas of cooperation Ukraine is looking for is in  skilled production and electrical-related equipment, or the  areas of hotel construction as well as hotel management.    Joint ventures could facilitate the transfer of technology.  However, whatever cooperation is finalized, should be mutually  beneficial. There is a lot the former Soviet state could also  offer to Malaysia, including defense technology capability and  aircraft manufacture. For example, the world's largest  aircraft, the An-225 [word indistinct], space shuttle carrier,  and the world's second largest aircraft, the An-124 (Ruslan) are  made in Ukraine.    Given such credentials, the technology could be used to set  up joint ventures in Malaysia to manufacture aircraft parts. At  the same time, perhaps it could play a role in lending expertise  in Malaysia's development of the space industry.    Makarenko has indicated his country is keen to share its  expertise in space program and aircraft manufacturing especially  in the area of large cargo planes. This being the case, there  is definitely room for two-way investments. Malaysia too could  offer its expertise in the successful privatization of  government agencies. This is timely as Ukraine is in the  process of privatizing about 40,000 projects this year.    It is hoped that a trade agreement is formalized between the  two countries soon. This would pave the way for increased  commercial linkages and the setting up of joint ventures. The  move would go toward giving the Ukrainian economy a badly needed  boost. More than anything else, Ukraine needs a great infusion  of economic assistance. Malaysia could very well provide that  economic assistance.</p>

Then the contract fell back to 3,161 before rallying to close at 3,176, the final reading showing a premium of 2 1/2 against fair value. Turnover was only 9,810 contracts, however. Traded options were a little busier, recording just under 38,000 lots, against less than 30,000 on Tuesday. The FT-SE 100 option contributed 9,165. British Petroleum (9,165 contracts) headed the individual companies' list as dealers braced themselves for today's trading figures. Late reports indicated that US sources were sellers of BP. J. Sainsbury (3,906 contracts) saw a good deal of new positioning by broking houses in the wake of a profits statement which unsettled the food retailing sector. Also active was Hanson (1,431 lots) and British Steel (3,029).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas stated the people's consent  is required for the agreement reached during the negotiations to  be viable.    Noting that where the negotiator's duty ends the people's  will begins, Denktas added that for the agreement to be viable  the people should give their approval of their free will.  Stressing that he is the defense advocate of the people and not  a marketing manager, Denktas said that the only way to show the  Greek Cypriots' ploy to the world is by means of negotiations  and not by lamenting that the Turkish Cypriot is being sold.    In answer to questions regarding the recent statement by  Glavkos Kliridhis, leader of the south Cypriot administration,  Denktas said that he has long since considered a referendum  necessary should an agreement be reached on the  confidence-building measures. He added that according to the  Constitution a referendum is a prerequisite.    In answer to a question about Kliridhis' repeating the EOKA  [National Organization of Cypriot Fighters] oath at a meeting in  Europe as well as pledging on the Greek Cypriot flag that they  are in office to fulfill to the utmost their duties toward  Cyprus, Denktas recalled that Makarios, Kiprianou, and Vasiliou  also shared the same views. Further stating that the Turkish  Cypriots are aware of the Greek Cypriots' goals, Denktas added  that the Greek Cypriots in turn are aware that the Turkish  Cypriots are not going to let them have access to that goal.  Denktas indicated that the Turkish Cypriot side will continue  with negotiations so long as they do not pose a threat.    Denktas reiterated that they will not consent to an  agreement  that will not be to the advantage of the people. Noting that  there are reports as to the package containing items favorable  to the Turkish side, Denktas added that the truth of these  rumors will be revealed on the negotiating table. Stating that  they depend on the people of the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus, Denktas added that he expects the people to act with  common sense concluding that the Turkish Cypriot side should not  be the one to leave the negotiating table.</p>

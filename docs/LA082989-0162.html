			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOOSTER FOR BATTERY SALES?  </P> <P> In an attempt to get an edge in a highly competitive market, two manufacturers  are coming out with car batteries they say will make jumper cables obsolete.  </P> <P> Some industry analysts, however, are uncertain whether the general public will  be willing to invest in the costlier product.  </P> <P> First to hit the market will be GNB Inc.'s Champion Switch battery with an  initial run of 500,000 going on sale in the Southeast in October.  </P> <P> Johnson Controls Inc., the nation's top auto battery maker, will bring out its  EverStart in early spring.  </P> <P> The technology is different, but both batteries have a reserve store of energy  that cannot run down or be tapped unless a switch is thrown under the hood.  </P> <P> The suggested retail price for EverStart will be $129.95 while Champion Switch  carries the recommended price of $109.99. The usual range for car batteries is  $60 to $80.  </P></p>

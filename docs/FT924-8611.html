			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Du Pont agrees to sell connectors unit for Dollars 400m DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group that is engaged in a far-ranging restructuring programme, has agreed to sell its electronic connectors division for Dollars 400m to Hicks, Muse &amp; Company, a Dallas-based leveraged buyout specialist. Du Pont said last May it planned to dispose of the unit, which employs about 3,000 people. The division has annual revenues of about Dollars 450m. In August Du Pont said it would reorganise its electronics division, which will have annual revenues of about Dollars 800m after the sale of the connectors business is completed. Mr Chad Holliday, president of Du Pont's Asia Pacific operations, will take over responsibility for the electronics division, which includes printed circuit materials and semiconductor materials. The purchase by Hicks, Muse includes Dollars 25m of senior preferred stock in the acquired company. Investing with Hicks, Muse is Mills &amp; Partners of St. Louis, a company that also specialises in acquiring industrial businesses. The deal is expected to be closed before the year-end. The new company will be called Berg Electronics. Mr Norris Tolson, vice-president and general manager of Du Pont's connectors business, will become its president and chief operating officer and will receive an equity stake. Mr Thomas Hicks, chairman of Hicks, Muse, said the connector business had a consistent record of operating profitability and a strong niche-market position. The division's 3,000 employees are spread equally among the Americas, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Du Pont first entered the connector manufacturing sector in 1972.</p>

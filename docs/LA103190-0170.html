			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW CAN'T GET MOTIVATED -- CLOSES OFF 5.69  </P> <P> Stock prices declined slightly today, turning downward in the late stages of a  drifting session as traders kept a close watch on oil prices.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.69 points to 2,442.33.  </P> <P> Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines on the New York Stock Exchange,  with 744 up, 736 down and 472 unchanged.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 156.06 million shares, against 153.45 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index edged up .09 to 166.17.  </P> <P> Analysts said stocks drew some tentative support from a drop in oil prices as  the session began. By midafternoon, however, oil had recovered its early  losses.  </P> <P> In the economic news, the Commerce Department reported that new factory orders  rose 0.1% in September. Excluding oil, however, the total showed a 1.1%  decline.  </P> <P> On Tuesday the government reported a stronger-than-expected gain in the gross  national product, at a 1.8% annual rate after adjustment for inflation, in the  third quarter of the year.  </P> <P> But brokers said that failed to convince most market participants that the  business outlook had improved to any significant extent.  </P> <P> Bond prices rose slightly in sluggish trading early today as traders awaited  the Treasury announcement of next week's quarterly funding.  </P></p>

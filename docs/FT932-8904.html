			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Mafia suspected in car bombing Destroyed cars lie in front of a damaged building in a wealthy Rome neighbourhood, in the wake of a car bomb explosion that hurt 23 people on Friday. Police, who were continuing investigations yesterday, said members of the Mafia were the most likely instigators, even though the explosion did not bear the familiar signs of a terrorist action by the organisation.</p>

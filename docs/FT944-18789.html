			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No answer from Revenue I have been trying for some time to get a satisfactory answer from both my wife's and my tax office to the following question: 'With the introduction and expansion of the 20 per cent tax band, why does the Inland Revenue still expect employers to deduct tax at 25 per cent for ad hoc work?' Surely, someone who is not going to work regularly should be taxed at the lowest band - ie, 20 per cent? Questions of Revenue policy are outside the scope of local tax offices. Send your question to the Controller, Inland Revenue, Insurance and Specialist Division (Schedule E), 550 Streetbrook Road, Solihull, West Midlands B91 1QU. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

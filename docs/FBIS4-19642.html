			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with PDS presidential candidate Jens Reich by </F> Juergen Gottschlich and Matthias Geis; place and date not given:  "It Doesn't Look So Shabby With Me"]    [Text]Jens Reich, candidate for the federal  presidency, on the parties and the nation, the term solution as  a substitute for policy, the courage to take risks, his pacifism  and NATO, and naturally the GDR, the PDS [Party for Democratic  Socialism], and the developing nostalgia.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Reich, you have also characterized your  candidacy as a reaction to the disinterest in parties and  politics. After the election in Lower Saxony, the diagnosis of  the mood in the society is that the disinterest in politics is  waning. Do you think that this diagnosis is wrong?    [Reich] I have always thought that the forecasts for a  meager  participation in the so-called superelection year were  premature. The people also want to have some influence, even if  it is ultimately only an interest in the result, the sporting  side, as in a horse race. But I would be very careful about  interpreting this is a newly awakened enthusiasm for politics.  It is gratifying if the election turnout is being normalized but  one cannot conclude from this that the population's ill humor  with politics is already over.    [TAGESZEITUNG] The result was interpreted above all by the  two people's parties in accordance with the motto: there is  increasing acceptance for that which is well-proved and the  situation is becoming stable.    [Reich] It may be that the intensity of the indifference  with  politics and the restlessness in the population have diminshed  somewhat and it may be there has been somewhat of a decline in  attacks by radical rightists. But that is scarcely a reason for  the parties to give the all-clear signal.    [TAGESZEITUNG] But the chance for your candidacy lies  precisely in the great insecurity about the future capability of  established politics. Are the reactions to your candidacy also  changing?    [Reich] In the political class or in the populace?    [TAGESZEITUNG] How do the reactions differ?    [Reich] They differ clearly. For the population, my  candidacy  appears to be downright provocative. It fills the halls and  evokes approval and opposition. That is no different in the new  laender than it is in Munich. Two years ago, I would not have  expected that one could find a lot of interest in such themes as  the constitution and plebiscites.    [TAGESZEITUNG] That would more likely confirm the thesis of  the end of indifference with politics or at least suggest a  clear differentiation between the parties and indifference with  politics.    [Reich] I believe that, if anything, the situation has  improved for such debates. There is a willingness to sacrifice  freedom for public discourse. There is political movement. That  does not mean the end of indifference with politics but here one  can see a way out of this indifference. The people want to have  a say and to participate in decisions. For 40 years the people  in the west have shown that they can live in the democratically  constituted society and in the east they showed in October 1989  that they can end a dictatorship and build democracy in a  sensible way. The people are ready to be allowed to present  initiatives and to be involved more directly in the political  process.    [TAGESZEITUNG] How is the political class reacting to your  candidacy?    [Reich] I get neither criticism nor approval. There is no  longer a cartel of silence as there was at the beginning. There  is much civility and sobriety. Everyone has his candidate and  yet they are quite satisfied that there is also someone there  from the east so that it will not look quite so shabby. My  candidacy has at least shown that one can introduce into the  conversation someone who is not drawing from 20 years of  experience in Bonn and it has certainly contributed to the  politicizing of the candidacy for the highest public office. For  the first time, there has been a serious public discussion about  the candidates. The parties did not want to have this taken away  from them but it really has become a social policy event.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Nevertheless some people will ask: Why is  Jens  Reich still a candidate, although it is already apparent that  his prospects for being elected federal president are no longer  especially good?    [Reich] Because of the candidacy and the associated  opportunity even more than in the past to bring up themes that  are controversial in the long term. After all, there is the  widespread attitude that in an election year one should not talk  about the future and the gradually developing crises. That is so  for ecology just as it is for the future of the social welfare  state or the generation pact as it exists today. The parties are  trying to carry on the election campaign without risk. The motto  is "low profile." But it is precisely the risky themes and the  controversial proposals that must be injected into the election  campaign. Instead we are experiencing trivial discussions about  personnel; people are stirring up the past; and the question of  whether Egon Bahr, Mr. Jenninger, or Mr. Strauss once made deals  with Mr. Axen is taken more seriously than the question of the  future of our tax system.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you think that the political system of the  FRG with a legislative period of four years and the modalities  that that involves is in any sort of a position to overcome such  fundamental crises?    [Reich] I believe that our four-year cycle has now become an  obsession that prevents attempts at fundamental solutions.  Instead crisis management dominates. We live in intervals of  four years and no one dares to tackle a project of the century  in this short interval. That has to do with the remarkable  position that under no circumstances should one risk an election  defeat. The correct attitude ought to be: we now have four years  and in this time we will do what we consider essential.    [TAGESZEITUNG] But precisely the problems that you have  mentioned can hardly be tackled in such a way that decisive  success can be demonstrated after one legislative period. The  ozone hole cannot be handled in one legislative period.    [Reich] But vigorous measures are conceivable. No policy  that  undertakes something in these areas can be finished after four  years, and one can also admit this from the outset.    [TAGESZEITUNG] But the parties are hesitant, because the  actions that take effect in the long term immediately involve  considerable burdens--from the speed limit to the increase in  the mineral oil tax.    [Reich] The cowardice of not saying anything at all and of  dealing with the major critical themes only with general phrases  produces the loss of confidence that continually narrows the  latitude for political action.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you have the impression that the society  is  ready to give up anything in the interest of unity?    [Reich] I sense that opposition will come quickly when a  specific sacrifice is called for. On the other hand, Helmut Kohl  is being reproached for not having made any  blood-sweat-and-tears speeches in 1990 to prepare the citizens  for the demands on them. How is it that everyone would have been  ready to sacrifice then and why is there massive opposition  today when one takes them at their word about being willing to  sacrifice?    [TAGESZEITUNG] How can material cuts be accomplished  politically? Is that a question of political conviction or can  that ultimately be done only by decree?    [Reich] Anyone who wants to become federal chancellor must  say what unavoidable burdens are coming for society, and he must  also promise that these burdens will be spread evenly throughout  the entire population. In regard to the question of financing as  well, the large parties must enter the election campaign with  controversial proposals. Then both of them will risk losing the  election but at the same time there is a greater chance that in  the end there will be a concept with which one can govern.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Does that mean that a really good policy is  always the one that makes one unpopular? And conversely, a  policy that is oriented primarily toward immediate approval will  not be convincing in the long term?    [Reich] A good policy would be one that produces tension,  that presents truly clear alternatives, and that risks missing  the majority in the election but provides the necessary latitude  for action in the event of success, because it has clearly  presented its proposed solutions even during the election  campaign. That cannot be done with a "low profile." Take  Brandt's ostpolitik. That was a clearly formulated and highly  controversial project that was put to a vote and was confirmed  by a large majority. That is an example of how one must enter an  election with a controversial concept.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Is that equally valid for the east and west?  Is there a convergence between the two societies or, just as in  1990, are there largely different publics?    [Reich] I do not know to what extent the consciousness in  the  east has changed. Are the people, who are in a relatively  difficult material situation, nevertheless able to undertake an  ecological reorganization of the economy and industry? The fact  that we come from a considerably lower level of consumption  could facilitate a fundamental change.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you see signs of a willingness to make  material sacrifices?    [Reich] Yes, there are signs. Welcome money and bananas are  no longer the central objective in the east as well. The desire  from 1989 to enter into full consumption quickly and at the same  time to attempt a kind of settlement of the entire past culture  has failed. There is a growing awareness that the race to catch  up with what was missed in the 1950's and 1960's can no longer  be the supreme goal.    [TAGESZEITUNG] But the failure of the high expectations with  respect to consumption does not necessarily lead to a  willingness for sacrifice and reform. There is a growing  nostalgia for the GDR and rising popularity for the PDS.    [Reich] The decisive thing for the success of the PDS seems  to me to be the fact that it is the only party in the new  laender that has been able to create an atmosphere. It attends  to the club facilities and house communities--people who were  once in the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] and who now  support each other. It advises people on rent and pensions. The  other parties do not engage in this kind of support in the local  environment.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Is that the reason for the Kutzmutz effect?    [Reich] One must realize that there are 20 or 30 percent of  the people who are marked as representatives of the old regime  and also perceive themselves as such. They are often people who  were involved in the FDJ [Free German Youth] since their early  childhood, who took that as a matter of course, and who were  quite shocked by the events of 1989 and are now seeking  emotional support. That is not some ultraleftist radicalinsky  theory. It is their milieu. This is why proposals for banning  the PDS are absurd. Only someone who is very far away can call  for this.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you see the necessity of reorienting the  debate about the past?    [Reich] The past of the SED should have been dealt with in  the enthusiasm of the revolution in 1989 and should have been an  internal affair of the GDR. The historical process proceeded  differently. This treatment of the past, above all juridically,  was postponed, and unification took place before the GDR was  terminated. Here lies the dilemma that has led to the truly  absurd construct under which today political offenses from the  time of the SED are dealt with in the formal framework of  criminal procedures of the FRG, but materially in accordance  with GDR law.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Mr. Reich, for many years you have had  contacts in the East European states, and since the revolution  in 1989 you have repeatedly called for a political, economic,  and cultural opening of Germany and West Europe to the East. How  do you assess the debate about the expansion of NATO and the  rift between the former Soviet satellite states and Russia?    [Reich] I am very much a pacifist by nature. On 8 April  1945,  my mother and I were fired upon by the guns of a low-altitude  aircraft. I experienced the bombing raids and my father was held  prisoner. I belong to the generation that said "never again,"  and for this reason I would love to leave military matters far  behind. I think that the East European countries must be  integrated into a security system without thereby excluding  certain countries. That is certainly very difficult in the case  of Russia, but I consider it a task that we must face just as an  expansion of the EU [European Union] to the East even if that  delays the integration in the West.    [TAGESZEITUNG] Your friends from the former civic movement  in  Prague or Warsaw are counting on an integration into NATO that  excludes Russia.    [Reich] I think that we must slow down the very enthusiastic  supporters of NATO among those in the civic movement. I would  consider it to be a great historic mistake to exclude the former  Soviet Union and to establish a source of unrest on the other  side of the Limes. That would mean considerable polarization.  The question is this: How must the existing alliance be  restructured to make an offer to all of these countries that  will make it impossible to wage war?    [TAGESZEITUNG] The counterargument that is often made is  that  integration must proceed very quickly to do something to  counteract the virulent nationalism, above all in Russia.    [Reich] I do not have so much fear of Eastern nationalism. I  see it as a mental straw in the shock situation of the upheaval.  Yugoslavia is an extreme example that was wrongly influenced  from outside and driven to escalation through extreme  unreasonableness internally. I believe that the fear of a new  Russian hegemony is unrealistic if we are really serious about a  new security strategy and economic integration.</p>

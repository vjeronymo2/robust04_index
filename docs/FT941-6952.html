			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: The man with 4,000 tricks up his sleeve - Keith Wheatley on a magician whose customers sign a pledge of secrecy This weekend a few tricks will be pulled in Blackpool. Four thousand magicians from around the world are gathered in the northern seaside resort. Do not try to attend. The conjurers and prestidigitators are there for a trade fair, not to tell the public how the rabbit appears from the hat. Ian Adair expects to be the biggest-earning exhibitor. His company, Supreme Magic, operates with discretion from the Devon port of Bideford selling tricks to the trade. The client list consists of 20,000 customers in more than 80 countries. Each must sign a confidentiality clause, promising never to reveal secrets of the craft, before he is allowed to purchase so much as three egg cups and a dice. Reticence is endemic in this business but Adair agrees that turnover is more than Pounds 1m and growing. There are more than 4,000 products in the Supreme Magic catalogue. 'I suppose the dearest stock item is the Triple Levitating Chair at just over Pounds 4,000,' said Adair. After 35 years in Devon, he retains the accents of his native Kilmarnock. 'Our cheapest are small hand-tricks, as we call them, for just Pounds 10 or so. We aim to be the Woolworths of magic, not some exclusive little boutique.' Nevertheless, famous magicians such as Paul Daniels buy equipment for tricks from Supreme Magic. The US is the company's biggest market, but the former Iron Curtain countries have always been a strong source of business. Even in the Cold War these customers could conjure hard currency from somewhere. Supreme Magic was founded 41 years ago by Edwin Hooper, a part-time Punch-and-Judy man on nearby Woolacoombe Sands. With a Pounds 100 loan from his plumber-father he rented a single room and began to manufacture and sell tricks, but always to professionals, never through high street joke shops. 'He was fantastically inventive. He didn't make the tricks but devised them and then found first-rate craftsmen to make them,' said Adair, who became the company's first employee in 1958. There are now 13 despatch and administrative staff but the manufacture is still contracted out, much of it locally. The large warehouses behind the modest offices contain a bewildering variety of stock. Beautifully lacquered cabinets with false floors vie for space with packs of doctored playing cards. Books of the 'How to . . .' variety are a large component of the stock. Adair is a practising magician on the local summer circuit and a prolific author. The 10-volume Encyclopaedia of Dove Magic is his magnum opus. 'I love performing and I just feel that without being in front of an audience regularly you're not going to know what your customers need,' said Adair. 'It's the audience that changes, far more than the tricks.' One of the most successful innovations has been two-part instructional videos. Stars such as Daniels perform part of their act in front of audiences of children at a television studio. That is part one. In part two, the magicians reconstruct their tricks in minute detail. Production costs for a one-hour tape are about Pounds 8,000 including a flat fee rather than a royalty for the artiste. They retail for Pounds 30. The more successful have sold more than 1,000 units. Hooper died two years ago. His executors sold the business to outside investors. Adair and his small team of inventors remain the core of the company, but not the owners. 'It was a bit of a shock after so many years building up a biggish business to find you didn't own or control any of it,' said Adair, a shy man when caught without a wand or a dove in his hands. 'But I was finding the administration and paperwork of running the business an increasing worry and now I'm still doing what I love.'

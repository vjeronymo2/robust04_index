			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Uneasy calm amid a gathering storm: The implications of Tokyo's quiet stock market crash Just over a year ago, the thought of the Nikkei stock index dropping through the 20,000 level prompted panic among investors and emergency revisions to stock market rules by the Japanese authorities. But yesterday an eerie silence met the Nikkei's return to its lowest level since February 1987. Investors had been expecting the bad news for so long that there was barely a ripple of reaction when it finally arrived. Nevertheless, yesterday's event highlights a crucial change of sentiment in the Tokyo financial markets. Until the end of last year, there was considerable hope that the bear market in equities, which started in early 1990, might soon be ending. Foreign investors certainly thought so - they bought record amounts of Japanese stocks last year, hoping to steal a march on cash-strapped Japanese institutions. They were buoyed partly by a hope that all postwar Japanese bear markets, bar one, have lasted less than two years. The one exception was the 1960s stock market crisis, when the markets had to be bailed out by the government. However, since the beginning of 1992, many investors have given up hope that the current bear market will follow the normal postwar pattern. They have battened down the hatches for a long 1960s-style recession. As Mr Shiomichi Kawamoto, a fund manager at an investment management affiliate of Sumitomo Life, the life insurer, said yesterday: 'The Nikkei may rebound above 20,000, but the overall downward trend is unchanged. Who will buy stocks from securities companies which are about to collapse?' Such profound gloom has several causes. The immediate explanations include the aftermath of the financial explosion of the late 1980s, confidence-sapping political and financial scandals and the slowdown in the economy. Other causes lie just below the surface, among them the cumulative effect of financial deregulation on Japan's capital markets. The deep gloom in the market will not lift overnight, nor, probably even in a month or two. Yet, it is worth remembering that Japanese equities are shares in some of the world's most dynamic companies. Even as the country's markets labour in the darkness of recession, its laboratories and factories are busy laying the foundations for recovery from the current economic slowdown. For now, however, there is an enormous overhang of overpriced assets bought during the bull market of the 1980s. In the stock market alone, the Nikkei index's 50 per cent plunge from its peak has wiped about Y250,000bn (Pounds 1,100bn) off asset values. Much more wealth has evaporated in the property market, where prices have fallen by up to 40 per cent in Tokyo and Osaka. Some of the holders of these assets are under no pressure to sell - they and their bankers can afford to wait. But others will take advantage of even a modest rally to dump unwanted land and stocks. The effect on securities brokers has been immediate. The slump in prices has depressed turnover and sparked disputes with clients. In the most recent example, Mr Masahiro Dozen, President of Daiwa Securities, last week resigned after disclosing a forecast Y43bn net loss for the year to March 31 following the settlement of arguments with investment clients. Nomura Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities, the other big broking groups, are this week expected to announce gloomy results forecasts. The Big Four's reserves were bolstered by the bumper profits of the 1980s. But even they can withstand only a limited number of disputes of the kind suffered by Daiwa, which is writing off Y72bn in extraordinary items. Smaller companies are much worse off; some have already closed or been swallowed by larger groups. However, Japan can afford to lose some of its 250-odd broking companies without suffering serious damage to its capital markets. The impact of the financial recession on banks is more serious. Banks are suffering because they count a portion of their stock portfolios as capital for the purposes of capital adequacy ratios set by the Bank for International Settlements. With the Nikkei below 20,000, about half of the top 11 banks' ratios are below 8 per cent - the BIS's standard which comes into effect in 1993. Moreover, banks have an extra burden in the form of bad and doubtful debts, mainly related to property loans of the late 1980s. The most problematic of these were routed through finance companies. Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency, estimates that about half of Y70,000bn-Y80,000bn lent by finance companies for property investment could be bad. Banks can minimise the eventual loss by selling land held as collateral. But this could take years. In the meantime, the loans stay on the books, eroding profits. As Mr Reese Harasawa, a senior financial manager at Mitsubishi Bank, explains, banks can respond by cutting asset growth, such as new loans, and raising profitability by increasing lending margins. The big institutions will doubtless survive. The problems come with smaller lenders which can have their reserves eliminated by a single disaster. Even if a few small banks go bust - and none has failed yet  - bankers see little risk of failure in the banking system as a whole. But would-be borrowers are facing credit shortages as banks husband their resources. This squeeze on credit is the main direct effect of the financial recession on the rest of the economy. Companies, which in the 1980s could raise equity-related capital at a net cost of below 1 per cent a year, and loan funds at below 4 per cent, now find equity-linked capital impossible to obtain and must pay 7 per cent and more for borrowed money. How much this will constrain economic growth is difficult to judge. With companies now running down inventories and postponing investments it could be next year before the effects emerge. But with the latest money supply figures (for January) showing a year-on-year growth of just 1.8 per cent, the potential exists for a credit shortage hurting a nascent future recovery. The Bank of Japan is aware of the risk, not least because of the repeated demands from politicians and industrialists for interest rate cuts. A further cut of 0.5 percentage points to 4 per cent in the Official Discount Rate is widely expected. But the weakness of the yen, which is trading at about Y134 to the US dollar compared with Y125 at the end of 1991, could limit the cental bank's scope for action. With long-term interest rates firming in the US and in Germany, a reduction in Japan could further depress the yen. It would be wrong to exaggerate the weakness of the real economy. Private sector economists expect about 2-3 per cent next year, sluggish in comparison with late 1980's but respectable by standards of other industrialised economies. Nevertheless, Japan faces some difficult challenges. On the political front, bribery scandals have disrupted the ruling Liberal Democratic party's efforts to secure the parliamentary passage of the budget and could fatally delay possible supplementary measures. Meanwhile, financial scandals, such as Daiwa's latest affair, postpone the recovery of confidence in the market. Equally significantly, the partial deregulation of interest rates and of foreign exchange controls has made the current bear market quite different from the past. Before, Japanese investors could not easily switch funds from equities to other instruments. Interest-bearing deposits often paid low rates. It was difficult for investors to put funds overseas. So, particularly for institutions, there was little choice but so sit out a bear market. Today, liberalisation has removed many of the constraints. That is why Japanese investors are starting to demand higher profits and higher dividends from companies. Without an increased flow of income from their stocks they will have little reason to hold on to equities during a bear market. Responding to demands for reform would require wholesale change from Japanese companies, which are accustomed to putting investment and sales above profits in importance and employees before shareholders. But the longer the bear market lasts, the greater will be the pressure for corporate reform.</p>

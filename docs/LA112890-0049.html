			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN AND GORBACHEV CLASH AGAIN;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: ANOTHER UNEASY COMPROMISE EMERGES AS A NEW TREATY COMES BEFORE  THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION PARLIAMENT.  </P> <P> In the latest round of the rivalry at the pinnacle of Soviet power, President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's allies nearly wrecked Russian Federation leader Boris N.  Yeltsin's plans for a key parliamentary session Tuesday, but the two managed to  forge yet another uneasy compromise.  </P> <P> The Yeltsin-Gorbachev clash was played out before nearly 900 members of the  Russian Federation Parliament, and the stakes were high, potentially deciding  the fate of the union treaty Gorbachev is now pushing to the country's 15  constitutent republics with all his political might.  </P> <P> "Without Russia, there is no (Soviet) Union, this should be perfectly clear,"  Gorbachev told reporters during a break in the session which, as a guest, he  observed from the balcony of the ornate Great Kremlin Palace.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, however, insisted that the Russian Parliament, of which he is  chairman, had convened to discuss the food crisis and land reform, not the  treaty, which Gorbachev officially presented last weekend.  </P> <P> Only when deputy after deputy took to the floor to demand that the treaty be  addressed did Yeltsin finally call a break and work out a compromise with  Gorbachev: that the Russian Parliament, officially known as the Russian  Congress of People's Deputies, would hold an "exchange of opinions" on the  union treaty. He implied that it would take no final decision.  </P> <P> Russia's verdict on Gorbachev's treaty proposal, which four republics already  have flatly rejected, will decide its fate, and thus the future of the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> "If we don't accept this conception (of the federal treaty), it means the  collapse of the country," Gorbachev told reporters.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Yeltsin was pulling in the opposite direction, telling the lawmakers  that although he does not seek confrontation with the national government, he  would not allow it to usurp powers that rightfully are the domain of the  Russian Federation government.  </P> <P> "Russia delegates a whole set of functions to the center," he said, his deep  voice booming through the long hall. "But we cannot acquiesce when they  interfere in affairs that we are best able to decide ourselves, better than  anyone else."  </P> <P> Yeltsin and Gorbachev clashed earlier this year on the Russian Federation's  right to create its own independent state bank, as well as its claim to the  vast riches of gold, diamonds, oil and other valuable resources on its  territory.  </P> <P> After a long tete-a-tete Nov. 11, Yeltsin and Gorbachev agreed to create a  commission to decide how to divide power and resources between the central  government and Yeltsin's Russian Federation.  </P> <P> Less than two weeks later, however, Gorbachev griped at a news conference that  although his program and Yeltsin's were 80% identical, Yeltsin seemed intent on  criticizing and trying to torpedo his every move.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, for his part, snubbed Gorbachev by failing to announce to the  Parliament that the Soviet president was attending.  </P> <P> Gorbachev disclosed another cause for rancor Tuesday when he told reporters  that he had only just begun reading the draft of the new Russian Federation  constitution in the newspaper because no one had sent it to him personally.  </P> <P> He also objected to a cartoon he had seen likening him to the Russian czar and  other insinuations that he was out to increase his personal power.  </P> <P> "I'm amazed by these people if, after six years, they still suspect me of  dictatorship and monarchism," he said.  </P> <P> His main theme, however -- which he returned to again and again during  impromptu chats in the lobby of the Great Kremlin Palace -- was the proposed  union treaty and his fear that the Soviet Union could split up.  </P> <P> Even the food crisis, the main subject of the Russian Parliament, stemmed  largely from the Soviet Union's growing inter-republic strife, he said, with  regions refusing to send foodstuffs across republic lines.  </P> <P> Asked whether Western food contributions that have begun arriving in the Soviet  Union will reach their targets rather than rotting in train depots like many  Soviet shipments, Gorbachev assured deputies and reporters that the government  is working out a system of distribution.  </P> <P> He said, "The main thing, however, is the modernization of Soviet light  industry, the creation of our own base, and all our Western partners want to  participate in that," largely by supplying equipment for food processing  plants.  </P> <P> Yeltsin also focused on the food question that now dominates Soviet media and  public discussion. Extended rationing is expected next month in Leningrad, and  other cities have complained that they have reserves for only a few days.  </P> <P> Yeltsin called on the lawmakers to approve a land reform program that would  bring radical changes to the impoverished peasants living on the Russian lands  that occupy two-thirds of Soviet territory.  </P> <P> Unlike the central government's milder land reform, it would allow the eventual  sale and purchase of land and give substantial aid to private farmers who  decide to strike out on their own.  </P> <P> "How and with what to feed the people -- today, that's the most important  thing," Yeltsin said. "We have been convinced by our own bitter experience that  even the deepest truths and greatest values of world civilization don't take  root in a country where people are fighting for a piece of bread."  </P> <P> Along with approving the land reform and other food measures, the Parliament is  scheduled to vote on major benefits for rural residents aimed at stemming the  exodus from the Soviet countryside that has contributed to the dearth of farm  produce.  </P> <P> Its original agenda also included discussion of a new constitution for the  Russian Federation, but Yeltsin said this will be postponed to give the public  more time to discuss it.  </P> <P> Several deputies, however, said Yeltsin backed the postponement because it  appeared that the draft constitution, a decidedly Western-style document, did  not have the votes to pass in a Parliament still heavily weighted toward  Communist conservatives.  </P></p>

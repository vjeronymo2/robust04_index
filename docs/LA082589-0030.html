			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Las Vegas musicians on strike over the planned decrease of live music in casino  entertainment in favor of taped performances have picked up the support of Mike  Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.  Greene is going to Las Vegas today to meet with the musicians picketing five  major resorts on the Strip and hold a press conference in front of Caesars  Palace. "Obviously we support recorded music and technology," Greene said  Thursday. "But more important is the well-being of musicians everywhere."  CLAUDIA PUIG and DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

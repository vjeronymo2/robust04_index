			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Italy Risks </F> Missing Maastricht Deadlines"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 19 -- The new Italian minister for  European Union affairs, Domenico Comino of the Northern League,  voiced his concern Thursday [19 May] that Italy may not be able  to meet the 1996 deadlines set in the Maastricht Treaty on  European Union [EU] for economic integration.    In a meeting with the press to illustrate his ministerial  game plan, Comino, 39, recalled how his position had no  negotiation powers and thus he saw his task more of one to  coordinate the actions of the other ministries in a European  Union framework.    Comino went on to suggest adopting a "blue stamp" to be  applied to measures taken by Parliament which are in line with  European Union regulations and laws. In this way, he observed,  his office would not have to dedicate 50 percent of its time  trying to resolve conflicts between Italy and the European Union  which much of the time are born from conflicts between laws and  regulations more than Italy's failure to adopt EU laws.    The minister then went on to suggest the creation of  "trans-national socio-economic areas" which would serve as a  link in the European Union decision-making process during the  initial stage, when precise projects are drawn up.    Comino also stressed the need for Italy to play a more  leading role in the European Union, "a more qualified presence,"  with less emphasis on its presence in the bureaucratic apparatus.    Asked to comment on the reaction of Italy's European Union  partners to the presence in the Rome executive of ministers from  the National Alliance, the rightist party born from the  neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement], Comini replied  "Foreign Minister Martino has already re-assured the Europeans"  and that on this question "there has been a lot of exploitation  by many sides."</p>

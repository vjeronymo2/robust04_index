			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FISCAL PINCH MAY COST 32 JOBS  </P> <P> The city of Hawthorne may have to eliminate a fire station and lay off as many  as 32 employees to resolve a $2.5-million budget deficit for 1989-90, City  Manager R. Kenneth Jue said last week.  </P> <P> Jue said the city budget is "in serious trouble" because paramedic fees and  sales tax revenues have not met expectations. Those revenues were $1.1 million  short of projections in 1988-89 and are expected to be short $1.1 million again  in 1989-90, Jue said.  </P> <P> Layoffs could include as many as 12 firefighters, four police officers and  workers from various other departments, Jue said.  </P> <P> A committee of key department heads at City Hall has recommended an alternative  proposal to resolve the deficit by raising city fees. If adopted by the council  at a budget hearing Aug. 21, this plan would generate slightly more than the  necessary $2.5 million needed to balance the city's $44.8-million budget for  1989-90.  </P></p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Power deal will save BOC Pounds 300,000 BOC, the industrial gases company, is to save Pounds 300,000 a year on its electricity bill after becoming the first industrial company since electricity privatisation to start drawing a large power supply direct from the National Grid, Michael Smith writes. The deal for the company's Pounds 45m production and distribution complex at Brinsworth, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, means it will not need to use or pay for the distribution network of Yorkshire Electricity. The site will be supplied by Hydro-Electric, with which BOC has an agreement for large sites. The saving represents about 10 per cent of the Brinsworth plant's electricity bill.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / China jails star village official CHINA has jailed one of its best-known businessmen for 20 years for obstructing justice. Mr Yu Zuomin, former chairman of the board of an entrepreneurial village near Tianjin, had been held up as a national model of the new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs until he fell from grace, writes Tony Walker from Beijing. Mr Yu's sentence coincided with the passing of death sentences in Beijing against four officials, including one from the Bank of China, for corruption. China launched a drive this week to root out corrupt officials whose activities had been fuelled by the economic boom. The execution of several hapless individuals had been expected. Chinese describe this process as 'killing a chicken to frighten a monkey', meaning that lesser officials are being dealt with severely as an example to more senior cadres. Mr Yu of Daqiu village near Tianjin, which had become something of a national entrepreneurial shrine, was found guilty of harbouring criminals, obstructing justice, bribery, unlawful detention and unlawful control of people. Mr Yu's arrest followed the beating to death of a worker in his village, and his attempts to cover up the crime. Beijing yesterday threatened to reconsider its commitment to a key international missile control agreement in a furious protest against a US ban on the export of high-technology items to China.</p>

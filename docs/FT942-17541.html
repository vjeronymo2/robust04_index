			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: The commission-hater - Chantrey Financial Services: 10th in a series on fee-based advisers David Harris, the managing director of Chantrey Financial Services, has a dream. He would like commissions on the sale of financial products to 'disappear off the face of the earth.' Harris says: 'In general, the financial services industry has been brought up to think that any time spent will ultimately result in a product sale. I think that is at the root cause of all our problems. We have created a public relations image that is really appalling, and we have now got a very long road and a hard job to try to put it right.' Harris worked for a Canadian stockbroker before joining accountant Chantrey Vellacott to develop its fixed interest business. He also began to take over the investment portfolios of the firm's private clients. He founded Chantrey Financial Services (CFS) in 1986 as the investment and financial planning arm of the practice. The rigorous professional approach by CFS reflects Harris's own trenchant views on the manner in which independent financial advisers (IFAs) should conduct their business. From the start, it offered comprehensive financial planning, exclusively on a fee basis, and obliged its advisers to acquire qualifications as part of their employment contracts. Fees are time-based and range from Pounds 35 to Pounds 150 an hour. Any commission received is rebated to clients or re-invested on their behalf. Harris says: 'Everybody in CFS must produce an account statement daily, and this has to account for seven hours of client work. All that information goes into the main frame computer and is converted into a monthly print-out. I can analyse this and see who spent what time on a client's account.' Harris argues that the financial services arm of an accountancy practice should enjoy the best of two very different worlds. He says: 'I am fully aware that there are people in the accountancy firm with more knowledge on tax than I have, and I don't think IFAs can give proper tax advice. 'Because of my investment background, there has always been a leaning to put tax and investment planning together. It is very difficult to make an investment without a tax consequence; and, when an accountancy firm is looking at tax matters, the conclusion will often be an investment. They are entwined.' Harris concedes, however, that there can be a clash of cultures between accountants and lFAs. His accountant colleagues sometimes have a jaundiced view of financial services, and it can be difficult to find financial advisers who operate comfortably within the framework of an accountancy practice. 'You need someone who is technically competent, approachable, has the patience of Job but is also commercially aware,' Harris says. 'On a day-to-day basis I am given a completely free rein, but I am also responsible to shareholders for the performance of the company. I am sure that a lot of clients probably see us as a department of the firm, and I think it is a measure of our success that we are named in the same breath as the tax practice.' Some 90 per cent of the CFS clients come through the accountancy practice. Chantrey Vellacott is the result of a merger between two firms (one dating back to 1788), each with a rather different client mix. One practice concentrated on personal tax clients, with a particular emphasis on the legal profession, while the other dealt largely with successful family companies. These two strands are reflected in Harris's clients today; 20 per cent are lawyers. About 40 per cent of the firm's income comes from investment management; 40 per cent from work on pensions and their derivatives; and 20 per cent from personal or corporate financial services. The average investment portfolio is around Pounds 100,000 but no minimum is imposed: Harris says there is room for 'Mrs Smith with Pounds 5,000'. 'The starting point of any portfolio is always National Savings and index-linked vehicles,' he says. 'Then, we look at the equity portion. We would always suggest an international spread. For the most part, the portfolios will tend towards investment trusts and units trusts and offshore funds.' If clients want a direct exposure in equities, Harris uses stockbrokers with which CFS has connections. He says: 'As a quid pro quo, we get some advice and valuations free, so we are able to provide this added value for clients.' All client investments are managed on an advisory basis. 'As an investment manager, there are times when I would be delighted to have discretionary funds,' Harris says. 'It would make my life much easier. But we believe that clients come to an accountant for advice, and that they then make their decisions on the advice he gives.' Harris adds: 'I think our clients trust us.' He is optimistic about the future of lFAs such as Chantrey but less happy about other developments in the financial services industry. 'I am sceptical whether the (proposed new) Personal Investment Authority will work, and I think the IFA sector will be under-represented on its board. Ultimately, that must mean that the big banks and the life companies will have more and more significance. 'I believe firms such as CFS will have a niche if they do their business properly and would like to see that niche grow. But I am not terribly confident that we will not end up with a fee-paying sector only for high net worth individuals. I would be very disappointed if that happened.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE INDEPENDENTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name of financial adviser:           Chantrey Financial Services Ltd Address of head office:              Russell Square House                                      10-12 Russell Square                                      London WC1 5LF Date firm was established:           1986 Regulator:                           Fimbra Funds under management:              Pounds 26 million Number of clients:                   300 (investment) 480 (others) Number of offices:                   One Minimum investment required:         None Services offered:                    Comprehensive tax, investment and                                      financial planning service Fees:                                Pounds 35 to pounds 150 an hour  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBINS URGED TO QUIT ELKS LODGE  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley called Wednesday for state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to  send a "powerful message" against racism by resigning immediately from the Van  Nuys Elks Lodge, which voted for the second time Tuesday to reject membership  applications from two black men.  </P> <P> But Robbins, who sponsored Jules S. Bagneris III and Thomas J. Montgomery for  membership, said he will continue trying to win acceptance for the two men to  the white-dominated organization. "I'm not going to walk away and concede the  fight to those who would treat Mr. Bagneris and Mr. Montgomery unfairly,"  Robbins said.  </P> <P> The lodge does not reveal the results of membership votes, but sources involved  in Tuesday's election said the turnout of 53 members voted 34 to 19 to admit  the men, just two votes short of the two-thirds necessary for admission.  </P> <P> In a letter to Robbins, Bradley said: "It seems to me your only moral  alternative is to submit your resignation . . . the most powerful message you  can send."  </P> <P> But Bagneris said he wants Robbins to remain in the lodge and fight for his  admission.  </P></p>

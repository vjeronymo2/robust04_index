			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 </F> 0524): "Housing Reform Will Take a Firm Step Forward This Year"]    [Text] Beijing, 7 Jan (XINHUA) -- Housing reform, which has  been moving forward along with the deepening of other reform  programs, will achieve a more substantial headway this year.    Ever since Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the general  plan  for housing reform in the early 1980's -- a plan basing on  selling public housing, readjusting rents, and encouraging  people to buy and build houses -- China's urban housing reform  has been moving forward in an exploratory manner. Since the  beginning of the 1990's, the nation has made substantial  progress in housing reform. Although the time for establishing  a new housing system is ripe, as the people's psychological and  economic capacity for housing reform has become noticeably  stronger, housing reform, like all other reforms, has not been  smooth sailing.    According to an analysis made by an authority of the State  Council Leading Group for Housing Reform, the main problems  which housing reform has faced over the past two years have been  difficulties in raising rents and selling housing, and these  problems have stalled housing reform. First of all, according  to the original goal set for housing reform, rents collected at  the end of the eighth five-year plan period should be enough to  cover housing maintenance, management, and depreciation.  However, in areas in which housing reform has been launched,  the average amount of rent collected for each square meter of  floor space has been only 0.3 yuan, far below the 0.75 yuan  required to cover maintenance alone. The main reason why rents  could not be raised was that government, enterprises, and  workers were unable to cope with the increase either  economically or psychologically. According to estimates, the  nation has now 2.7 billion square meters of public housing, if  the rents for this housing are raised to the target set for the  end of the eighth five-year plan period, enormous subsidies will  be needed. This was why the second-step rent increase, which is  part of the housing reform program in some cities and regions,  became "stranded." Secondly, because there was neither any  applicable mechanism nor supporting policy for housing sales,  sizable housing reform was exceedingly difficult.    What should be done to tackle these problems? As we cannot  stop or scrap the housing reform project, we must increase the  intensity of reform. Only by so doing can we break the deadlock  and create a new situation. Housing reform is a link in the  chain of reform. If housing reform fails to move forward in  various sectors with great intensity, the failure will seriously  obstruct China's reform process. Two sets of figures show the  urgent need in China for housing reform: 1) So that rent  collected in 1987 could foot the bill for maintenance,  management, depreciation, interest on investment, and property  tax, subsidies amounting to only 27 billion yuan were paid by  various authorities, this became 41.6 billion yuan by 1990, and  jumped sharply to 67 billion in 1992, increasing by 8 billion  yuan annually on the average. 2) The nation now has 27 billion  square meters of public housing. Based on the need to spend 350  yuan to build of one square meter of housing, annual  depreciation of 2 percent amounts to 18.9 billion yuan. For the  maintenance and management of this housing, the state and  enterprises have to spend 7 to 8 billion yuan each year. This  is to say that the state and enterprises will lose between 25.9  and 26.9 billion yuan per year. This shows that if housing  reform stops, public housing will become a heavy "burden" on the  state and enterprises, and not an asset. If housing reform is  delayed, the direct consequence will be increasingly higher  housing subsidies to be paid by the state and enterprises, as  well as an increasingly higher cost of reform. We should also  be aware that if we fail to speed up housing reform and  establish a new housing system, we can hardly speed up housing  construction or improve housing conditions for urban residents.  While this will seriously affect our efforts to achieve the  goal that all city dwellers have comparatively comfortable  living quarters by the year 2000, it will also prevent  enterprises from replacing their operating mechanisms and  obstruct the work of building a socialist market economic system.    As we are confronted with a formidable task in achieving  noticeable results in improving housing conditions for Chinese  city dwellers by the end of this century, and meeting the demand  to build a socialist market economic system, we must take more  powerful and practical measures to break the deadlock of housing  reform and blaze a new path with Chinese characteristics. To  this end, state authorities have come up with a new idea for  housing reform: While the emphasis will be on selling public  housing, efforts will also be made to rent out public housing  units and build new housing units, and to reform the rent  system, encourage all units to establish public funds for  housing construction, speed up construction of economic and  affordable housing units, and draw up supporting policies for  the development of the housing market so that more commodity  housing units can be built by the public.    The essence of the new idea is to replace the old system,  under which the investment needed for housing construction had  to be found by the state and enterprises, with a new system  under which investment needed for housing construction is  rationally shared by the state, units concerned, and  individuals. Moreover, if we put the emphasis on selling public  housing units, the move will activate the housing inventory,  speed up the recovery of capital, speed up housing construction,  and turn public housing from being a "burden" into real cash.  Estimates show that if only 10 percent of public housing units  are sold, nearly 100 billion yuan will be recovered. Naturally,  housing units can only be sold when the state has drawn up the  necessary supporting policies and measures so that buyers can  afford short-term, medium-term, or long-term payments;  otherwise, the expression selling housing units becomes an empty  phrase.    After many years of exploratory reform, fundamental changes  have started to take place in China's decades-old public housing  system. This year, as China embarks on "expediting reform as a  whole and making breakthroughs in key points," big and firm  strides will certainly be made in housing reform.</p>

The specimens were used to directly estimate the extent  to which DNA is shielded by proteins contained in the chromatin  from binding to the DNA- specific fluorescent stains used in  flow cytometry. It was extremely important that the spheres be  permeable by protein molecules, as this would make the method  much more versatile. It was shown that the method described  makes it possible to fractionate the cells and preserve their  residual components in the form of individual particles of  cellular dimension. By incorporating them into the gel  microspheres, the macromolecular complexes are protected from  physical damage during the course of routine laboratory testing  with enzymes, antibodies, and flow cytometry.

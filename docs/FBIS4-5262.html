			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Question &amp; answer session at Prime Minister Morihiro </F> Hosokawa's news conference at the prime minister's official  residence -- live]    [Text] [unidentified reporter] As you have said, Japan is  in a very critical situation. It seems to me that you felt you  could no longer remain in the post of premier because of the  issue of ethics. You said that not even a single day of  stagnation can be allowed in politics. Under the current  situation, your sudden announcement may confuse the political  situation and invite further distrust of politics, depending on  circumstances. As a leader of Japan, what do you think of your  decision to resign? Also, when did you make the decision?    [Hosokawa] You are quite right. As I have said earlier,  there are many diplomatic and domestic tasks which need to be  settled. Also, deliberations on the budget, which is closely  linked to the people's livelihood, has been stalled. Indeed, I  have said earlier that not even a moment of stagnation can be  allowed in politics. However, I have decided to resign as prime  minister. This is a decision made after much careful thought.  The moral responsibility of a top political leader is heavier  than anything. On that basis, I came to the conclusion that it  was necessary to straighten myself up. Based on this decision,  I considered various possibilities and came to the conclusion on  my own.    [Unidentified reporter] As you were explaining the reasons  for making the decision to step down, you said that a new  problem had been found. You also said that this was a legal  problem. It seems to me that your explanation regarding the  decision to resign as prime minister -- who is the most  responsible planner -- while the deliberations on the budget  remain paralyzed are not adequate. Can you explain in concrete  terms what you were trying to say?    [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, we are seeking to find out the  truth. I want to reveal the details of the problem after the  investigations are finished. I explained earlier that such a  doubt came out.    I forgot about answering the question asked earlier. I was  asked when I decided to resign. The details I revealed were  reported to me by my office late last night. I made the  decision late last night.    [Unidentified reporter] Your resignation will certainly  create some sort of vacuum on the political scene, and your  resignation over the scandal will seriously damage the public's  confidence in political circles since your administration was  inaugurated to carry out political reform. I would like to have  your comment on that point. Also, could you explain your  standpoint as a party head, or an individual politician, on the  future direction of a political party realignment?    [Hosokawa] Concerning the first question, I think the most  important point is that a person should sincerely reflect on his  or her own problems and correct them if necessary. So I decided  to candidly acknowledge the presence of such problems, and to  make them public. I believe my decision will be somehow helpful  for easing public distrust of politics. To win back the  public's confidence in politics, I think my decision was much  better than covering up the fact. That is why I took this  action, and I have stressed this is a bed-rock principle of my  party. I wanted to match my actions with my words.    With respect to future realignment of political parties, I  cannot say too much about that issue right now because I still  have responsibility as prime minister.    [Unidentified reporter] The Hosokawa administration was  inaugurated eight months ago amid the great expectations of the  public. How do you evaluate the eight-month rule of the  Hosokawa administration?    [Hosokawa] I have fully referred to that in my statement. As  a reform-oriented administration, my cabinet has been fully  grappling with internal and external problems which have been  pending for decades. Fortunately, we have reached some  noteworthy achievements owing to public support. While these  are still incomplete, we have at least gained some clue to  settling long-pending issues. I personally have a sense of  satisfaction right now, and I suppose both the Japanese public  and the international community would give me a certain level of  credit for my work.    [Unidentified reporter] Could you describe the schedule for  your formal resignation? And, could you explain your opinion on  the qualifications of the next prime minister to replace you?    [Hosokawa] Regarding the future political schedule, I have  responsibility to pass the budget bill, and I would like to  consult with the ruling and opposition parties on this matter.  Concerning favorable characteristics of my successor, I think  it is inappropriate for me to comment on that.    [Unidentified reporter] Before you made the decision, did  you  consult with some politicians, friends, or your family?    [Hosokawa] I talked with my wife last night.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that basically the  framework of the current coalition government should not be  changed even after your resignation, or do you think you do not  mind even if the framework of the coalition government is  changed as part of the regrouping of political parties -- in  other words, do you think it is possible to reorganize the  framework of the coalition government on condition that the new  government take over the tasks the Hosokawa government has left?    [Hosokawa] I think it desirable that the new prime minister  take over the tasks my government has set. But I do not think I  should comment on this.    [Unidentified reporter] My question relates to the question  you have just answered. Your government is the first  non-Liberal Democratic Party government in 38 years. You have  managed the government for eight months. Are you confident in  saying that coalition is the desirable way to form a government?    [Hosokawa] It is a very difficult question. I think it has  both good and bad aspects.    [Unidentified reporter] A while ago you said it is your  responsibility to have the budget bill passed. Do you mean you  intend to remain in your current position until the bill is  adopted?    [Hosokawa] I think it depends on when and how the succeeding  prime minister will be chosen.    [Unidentified reporter] Would you please state your  present.... [interrupted by another reporter]    [Unidentified reporter] I think the people are very  interested in knowing the main reason for your resignation.  Would you please explain a little bit more about the newly  surfaced problem?    [Hosokawa] It is just as I explained to you a little while  ago. Investigations are underway now to throw light on the  problem. I want to swiftly reveal the details of the problem  upon completion of investigations.    [Unidentified reporter] Would you please state your present  state of mind?    [Hosokawa] I commented on my state of mind a little while  ago. Basically, my government has attained its goals to a  certain extent, but I am personally dissatisfied with what the  government has achieved. I deeply regret that in the current  situation, where we face a lot of problems both at home and  abroad, I have failed to fully meet the people's expectations.  I apologize to the people because, at this juncture wherein  there are a host of domestic and foreign important issues, I had  to decide on resignation in this way.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when do you  intend to dissolve the cabinet?    [Hosokawa] I have no idea at all.    [Unidentified Reporter] How about the timing of choosing  your  successor?    [Hosokawa] I have no idea. It is completely beyond my scope.    [Unidentified reporter] When do you think it is desirable?    [Hosokawa] As soon as possible.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, [word  indistinct]  are you thinking of accepting the opposition parties' call for  summoning to the Diet those concerned with your pecuniary  relations with Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co?    [Hosokawa] I have already stated my position on this matter.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when you assumed  the office of prime minister, you said it is necessary to join  forces in politics mindful of the people. Do you think you have  achieved this goal and satisfactorily answered the people's  expectations?    [Hosokawa] I think there are various ways to interpret the  phrase "politics mindful of the people." I, with the mandate of  the people, am confident that I have directly tackled and  fulfilled my task of carrying out responsible reform without  hesitation.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, I want to ask  about choosing your successor. How do you think the framework  of the succeeding cabinet should be, and is there any  possibility of tying up with the LDP to cope with internal and  external problems?    [Hosokawa] I cannot make a prediction. I have no idea.    [Unidentified reporter] Please answer this question as head  of the Japan New Party [JNP]. Is there any possibility that the  JNP will join the opposition camp depending on the line-up of a  succeeding cabinet, or will the JNP still remain with the ruling  parties to fulfill its duty?    [Hosokawa] Of course, it depends on who will be the next  prime minister, but I think our party members have a strong  desire to continue to come to grips with domestic and foreign  problems as members of the ruling parties.    [Unidentified reporter] Who is investigating the newly  surfaced problem of 1981?    [Hosokawa] My office is conducting the investigations.    [Unidentified reporter] How about you, Mr. Prime Minister?    [Hosokawa] Of course, I have been informed of the details.  However, there are minute details, and each item is being  checked one by one.    [Unidentified reporter] When do you think most of the facts  will be revealed?    [Hosokawa] I do not know. I hope they will be revealed as  early as possible.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you plan to continue your  political activities as the head of the Japan New Party after  you resign as prime minister?    [Hosokawa] Yes, I do.    [Unidentified reporter] [passage indistinct].    [Hosokawa] What did you say is in a delicate situation?    [Unidentified reporter] The economy.    [Hosokawa] Oh, the economy. Of course, there are signs of  economic recovery but the most important thing is for the  government to implement its pump-priming packages in such a way  that they will steadily yield the desired results so the economy  will be put on track toward full recovery. Needless to say, it  is also an important task for the government to have the fiscal  1994 budget bill passed as early as possible. Until the next  prime minister is elected, we will do our utmost to fulfill this  task. I am sure the next prime minister will make his own  efforts toward this.    [Unidentified reporter] Will your resignation affect [words  indistinct]?    [Hosokawa] I can hardly say my resignation will not affect  them at all. But basically, they are moving in a favorable  direction. I am confident that the current political  difficulties will soon be resolved. You do not have to worry  about them.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have said  you  plan to continue your political activities as JNP head after  your resignation but you reportedly plan to form a new party  together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean  Government Party]. Will you promote this plan after your  resignation?    [Hosokawa] I want to refrain from making comments on this  matter.    [Unidentified reporter] You expressed regret that you have  to  resign in this manner, before fulfilling your duties. But I  cannot dispel a concern that your resignation might affect  efforts for three reforms, including economic and administrative  reforms. I wonder if you have to [words indistinct]. Do you  attach importance to realizing these reforms in selecting the  next prime minister?    [Hosokawa] I think I should not say anything about the  selection of my successor. As I said earlier, We are still  uncertain when we can achieve economic and administrative  reforms, but we have clearly indicated measures to achieve them.  What the government should do next is to steadily implement  them. When the Hosokawa government was inaugurated last August,  it planned to compile bills on decentralization of political  power and on public information disclosure before the end of the  year, and to submit them to an ordinary Diet session. This plan  has not changed.    [Unidentified reporter] You earlier explained about your  100-million-yen loan. Did you say that you have not paid the  interest on the loan? You also said investment activities are  legally questionable. Which law are you talking about? Is it  the law that deals with tax and tax evasion?    [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, I cannot tell more because the  whole affair is still under investigation. I said such  investment activities might have dubious legality. I will  clarify everything when all the facts are unearthed.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister.    [Unidentified dean of press corps] Your question will be the  last.    [Unidentified reporter] Just as you set a time limit for the  enactment of political reform bills, I hope you will set a  deadline for disclosing the facts, rather than saying you will  clarify things as early as possible. If all of them are not  revealed by the deadline, you can disclose the facts unearthed  by that time.    [Hosokawa] I cannot decide on a deadline by myself because I  have to hear others' opinions. We have worked hard to discover  the facts, and as a result we learned new details yesterday.  Although we intend to make further efforts, we cannot tell when  all the facts will be revealed.    [Dean of press corps] We will accept one more question.    [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, countries such  as  the United States and South Korea put their expectations on you  because you are young. You said you will continue political  activities as JNP head. Do you have a desire to take the  premiership again if you have such an opportunity in the future?    [Hosokawa] I am not thinking of this at all.    [Dean of press corps] We now conclude the news conference.</p>

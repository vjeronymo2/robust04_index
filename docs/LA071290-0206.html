			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PUT UP OR SHUT UP: DUKES OPEN LEAGUE PLAY  </P> <P> The dress rehearsal went well, but now the Newport Beach Dukes begin for real.  </P> <P> The Dukes open the Team Tennis season against the Raleigh Edge at 7:30 tonight  at the John Wayne Tennis Club in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Making their exhibition debut Tuesday night, the Dukes were introduced to a  crowd of about 1,200, then defeated a UC Irvine alumni team, 30-16.  </P> <P> It didn't prove much of a test for the Dukes.  </P> <P> Mike Briggs, a former UCI All-American now playing on the pro tour, fared best  among the former Anteaters, but he fell, 6-5, to Roger Smith.  </P> <P> Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier formed an overpowering doubles team for the  Dukes, and Marty Davis' experience proved too much for the UCI alumni.  </P> <P> Whether the Dukes can handle Team Tennis opponents as easily remains to be  seen.  </P> <P> But Greg Patton, the Dukes' coach, liked what he saw.  </P> <P> "It's like love at first sight," he said. "I'm real excited."  </P> <P> Patton is still searching for the Dukes' strongest lineup. Tuesday's exhibition  gave him a chance to experiment, and he said he plans further shuffling.  </P> <P> Raleigh, another new Team Tennis franchise, is one of the league's toughest  teams, according to Patton.  </P> <P> The Edge features Tim Pawsat and Tim Wilkison, two Team Tennis veterans.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Chinese airlines struck by bruising losses Chinese airlines are recording heavy and unprecedented losses in the face of stiff competition from foreign carriers and the effects of a sharp rise in operating costs. The Economic Information Daily newspaper reported yesterday that China's airlines were in a 'deep valley' with six out of the country's nine main carriers reporting losses in the first eight months of the year. The slide in Chinese airline fortunes risks slowing anticipated surging demand for new aircraft, with Boeing and Airbus having geared up to supply hundreds of aircraft over the next 15 years. Economic Information Daily quoted aviation officials as calling for stricter controls to be placed on new aeroplanes and new airlines. China had approved some 28 airlines by early this year, but has instituted a freeze following a series of crashes in 1993. The newspaper said that in the first quarter Chinese airlines operating domestic and international services from Beijing airport carried just 35 per cent of passengers. An increasing proportion of Chinese preferred foreign carriers to local airlines. Chinese airlines suffered a serious drop in traffic on the lucrative Hong Kong route with load factors plummeting 10 percentage points to 60 per cent in the first quarter compared with last year's average. China's competitors were flying near to capacity. 'A historical change occurred in China's aviation market late in 1993 when a seller's market that had lasted for two decades turned into a buyer's market,' Economic Information Daily reported. China's airlines reported 20 per cent increases in passenger traffic in the past two years, and this rate of growth was expected to continue for the next four years, slowing to 15 per cent towards the end of the century. The newspaper blamed the unification at the beginning of the year of China's exchange rate resulting in an effective 50 per cent devaluation of the yuan for some of the airlines' woes. The devaluation added dramatically to costs, including leasing and fuel which rose by 25 per cent this year. Other factors included a credit squeeze in mid-1993 aimed at slowing an overheating economy. The paper also blamed the poor safety record of Chinese airlines for the fall-off in passenger numbers. China had at least four serious air crashes in 1993 in what proved a disastrous year for Chinese aviation. Aerospace companies, which have made heady forecasts of demand, may now be obliged to revise their estimates. Boeing had predicted China would purchase some 800 aircraft at a cost of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.3bn) by the year 2010, while Airbus had estimated a more conservative 620 aircraft. A slowdown may also affect foreign airlines' plans to become involved in joint ventures in China. The world's big carriers have been scouring China for opportunities since Beijing announced early this year that it was opening its aviation sector to foreign participation.</p>

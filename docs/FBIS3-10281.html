The jury  ruled that Noriega, who was toppled by the U.S. Army in December  1989 and is serving a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking, was  the instigator of Giroldi's murder. The judicial file stated  that on 4 October Giroldi was shot 15 times in the back on the  patio of the extinct FDP headquarters.    Former Major Heraclides Sucre was also found guilty of  murder. He was the actual perpetrator of the murder and was  tried in absentia. The jury acquitted the other three remaining  defendants in the case: former Captains Ramon Diaz, (who was  also charged with actually committing the murder), and Camilo  Vega and former Mayor Lucinio Miranda, who were tried for  complicity in the crime.

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Neighbourhood fight in Madrid - Peter Bruce watches a takeover battle in Spain's property sector A takeover battle for control of a huge residential area of Madrid recently vacated by the US Air Force promises to be one of the fiercest ever in Spain. The object of the struggle is the property company which owns and is named after the area, El Encinar de los Reyes (Royal Oaks). At stake is a rapid catch-up in property values following an end to more than 30 years of price control. El Encinar is wedged between two of Madrid's most expensive northern suburbs, Moraleja and El Soto de Moraleja. While well-heeled Spaniards have been paying vastly inflated prices to buy into the two Moralejas, property values in El Encinar have been governed by prices agreed in 1958. It was then that the US first established military links with the Franco dictatorship. But the US service families have now departed and El Encinar's owners believe that with a little rebuilding and some paint, the area could be transformed into a boom town. As the Spanish property market continues to fall into the doldrums, El Encinar and its 866 homes must be the only property in Spain capable of generating more money in the next five years than it has in the past 30. The Olazabal family, immigrants to Madrid via the Basque country and Mexico, where they made their fortune, bought control of El Encinar in 1962. They now own 35 per cent of the company and have expanded into other ventures, particularly in Mallorca. Clearly, the Olazabals have been waiting a long time for their sitting tenants at El Encinar to go in order to raise rents or sell the properties. But instead of buying up the shares that still trade on the stock market before the American families left, they waited just a little too long. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) one of Spain's biggest banks and the most powerful Basque-run institution in Spain, began buying shares earlier this year. Through its property affiliate, Metrovacesa, it owns almost 25 per cent. In October, the Olazabals announced they were making a formal bid for 14 per cent of El Encinar at Pta2,500 (Dollars 22.45) a share. On the face of it that would give them just 49 per cent of the company but El Ecinor owns 3 per cent of itself in treasury stock so they would have effective control. Last week BBV struck back with plans to launch a counter offer later this month for 75 per cent of El Encinar. The Olazabals quickly responded with a bid of Pta2,750, and spoke of their 'sense of sorrow that a Basque bank, and especially the BBV, should so violently try to displace a Basque family from exercising its traditional control'. What is being offered up here is a graphic display of how many of Spain's old business families still believe business is something done between friends. BBV, which has been living in a tougher world for some years, immediately said it would beat the new Olazabal offer if it expired unsuccessfully. Last night the family was debating whether to widen the offer to satisfy its angry competitor. It is probably no coincidence that the Olazabal bid is being guaranteed for Pta2.45bn by the BBV's main rival, Banco Central Hispanoamericano (BCH). Even less of a coincidence is that Metrovacesa's biggest property rival is Vallehermoso, which is owned by the BCH. Vallehermoso may not want to take El Encinar away from the Olazabals but it would be most unhappy if Metrovacesa were to walk away with something quite so succulent in a market so depressed. The fight for El Encinar could get ugly.</p>

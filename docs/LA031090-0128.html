			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTY ASSOCIATION'S BACKING OF DROWN SEEN AS KEY ENDORSEMENT IN SHERIFF RACE  </P> <P> In a key endorsement, the San Diego County Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. on Friday  pledged its support for Jack Drown in his bid to succeed longtime Sheriff John  Duffy.  </P> <P> The endorsement, announced at the association's Mira Mesa headquarters, was  made after a survey of the 1,200 members of the labor organization showed  overwhelming support for Drown, and the group's board of directors voted  unanimously to back Drown in this year's campaign.  </P> <P> The support is viewed as a key endorsement because the association represents  about 92% of the sworn members of the Sheriff's Department, and their lead will  likely be followed by other area law enforcement groups.  </P> <P> "Jack has worked his way through the ranks of the department to his current  position (as assistant sheriff) and throughout his career has shown that he has  the skills to fill his post," said Skip Murphy, DSA president.  </P> <P> "He has also shown that he has not forgotten the problems of doing the job or  the problems facing the individual doing that job."  </P> <P> Murphy denied a charge that the endorsement was influenced by Duffy, who  dropped out of the race late last year and then threw his support to Drown.  "That comment was totally without foundation and was totally false," he said.  </P> <P> And Murphy dismissed any contentions that, if elected, Drown would simply  represent a continuation of the 20-year Duffy administration.  </P> <P> "They are different personalities," he said. "They have different management  styles, and I have personally observed issues where they have disagreed,  sometimes very strongly.  </P> <P> "Jack is loyal to his department and therefore loyal to the sheriff, and there  is nothing improper with that. But Jack Drown is not a John Duffy clone."  </P> <P> Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, the only other candidate who is a sworn member of  the Sheriff's Department, said Friday that the association's endorsement of  Drown was certain from the outset.  </P> <P> "As far as I was concerned, this decision was DOA: Drown On Arrival," he said.  "I previously indicated that internal pressures and lobbying was under way to  ensure that Drown would win the endorsement, so I'm not surprised by the  result."  </P> <P> He conceded, however, that association support "probably will be beneficial"  for Drown.  </P> <P> "It's an important organizational endorsement," Roache said. "All other law  enforcement agencies will take the lead of the Deputy Sheriffs' Assn. Now, how  much value that will be in the public's mind, we'll just have to wait and see."  </P> <P> Other candidates are Vincent Jimno, who is on leave as chief of police in  Escondido, and Ray Hoobler, former police chief in San Diego.  </P></p>

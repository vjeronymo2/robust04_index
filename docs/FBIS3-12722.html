			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] United Nations, 3 Mar (INA)--In an official letter  to the UN secretary general, Iraq has refuted Max Van der  Stoel's claims, saying the claims lack credibility and are full  of fallacies.    In its reply to Van der Stoel's report, Iraq clarified that  his anti-Iraq claims fall within the framework of the political  role assigned to him to create crises and to serve aggressive  foreign schemes against Iraq.    The letter, whose official text was published here today,  Thursday, says that by doing so, Van der Stoel exposes the role  assigned to him to prevent the international community from  lifting the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq.    The letter notes that Van der Stoel's report is based on  claims by persons who live in Iran, London, and the Hague, and  who are known for their hostility to Iraq and for their desire  to harm it pursuant to achieving suspect political objectives  that have nothing whatsoever to do with human rights.    Iraq's letter clarifies that Max Van der Stoel's report is  based on blind provocation, and that, consequently, Van der  Stoel was not neutral or objective, but biased, and that he  violated the task assigned to him.    The Iraqi letter exposes Max Van der Stoel's claims  paragraph  by paragraph. It says: Van der Stoel did not take the trouble  to verify what he claims, in terms of information or the  fabricated videotapes and photographs that were supplied to him  by hostile political sides linked with foreign forces whose  objective is to create confusion and to tarnish Iraq's  reputation.    The letter stresses Iraq's official stand toward providing  all the requirements of security and protection for all its  citizens in accordance with its national laws and international  commitments, and toward securing all their civil, political,  economic, social, and cultural rights all over Iraq.    The letter adds that what the competent authorities do is  part of the Iraqi state's responsibility and basic national  duties of maintaining security and stability throughout Iraq.    In its letter, Iraq accused Van der Stoel of involvement in  the political propaganda campaign aimed at dismembering Iraq  geographically. The letter says: Max Van der Stoel's claims  lack credibility and have premeditated hostile intentions  against Iraq.    The letter says: The Kurdish people are part of the Iraqi  people under any circumstances. The national authorities have  continued to provide the northern governorates with rations just  like the other Iraqi governorates.    The letter adds: The militias in the northern region, which  are protected by the foreign forces there, steal these rations.  They either sell them to citizens for double their regular  price or smuggle them to neighboring states.    The letter strongly attacks Max Van der Stoel's calls for  controlling human rights observers in Iraq, and says that the  Iraqi Government categorically rejects this idea, especially  since it flagrantly conflicts with the principles of  sovereignty, independence, and noninterference.    The letter clarifies that Van der Stoel is trying to turn  these observers into political agents for the colonialist  states, and thus, he ignores the Iraqi state's responsibilities  concerning sovereignty and independence.    The letter says: By his claims, Van der Stoel flagrantly  violates two principles of the UN Charter; namely, the principle  of noninterference in the affairs that constitute an essential  part of the state's internal sovereignty, and the principle of  respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.</p>

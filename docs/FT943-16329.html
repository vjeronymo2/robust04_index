			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Berlusconi's grip tightens Silvio Berlusconi, as he prepares to host the G7 summit in Naples later this week, still benefits politically from an aura of novelty. But the euphoria in business circles which greeted his election victory in March is beginning to wear off. The markets are waiting with some anxiety to see how Mr Berlusconi, who in his election campaign rashly promised tax cuts, will deal with Italy's crippling burden of public debt. The government's first official planning document on economic and financial policy is due next week. Meanwhile, it continues to give out signals that it is internally divided, and that its members are more concerned with maximising and perpetuating their political power than with taking the kind of economic decisions the markets are looking for. The Northern League, one of the three main coalition parties, is now on almost as bad terms with Forza Italia as it has been all along with the rightwing National Alliance, and Mr Berlusconi's lieutenants have been threatening it with new general elections. Two things the government was able to agree on last week seem likely to make things worse rather than better. First, it sought to give itself power to reject the accounts and fire the board of the state broadcasting organisation, RAI; then it asserted its right to control appointments to the directorate of the Bank of Italy. Ironically the latter statement was issued by Mr Berlusconi's office just as the government spokesman, Giuliano Ferrara, was assuring the Financial Times that the two bodies were entirely different and that the government would make no attempt to influence the choice of a successor to Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, in his previous job as the bank's director-general. Special position The two bodies are indeed different, but not quite in the way Mr Ferrara thought. The government is right in saying that top officials even in some of the world's most famously independent central banks, such as the Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve, are appointed by the executive. But the Bank of Italy is in a very special position as the one Italian state institution which, alongside the judiciary, managed to preserve its dignity and reputation during the wave of corruption scandals which led to the collapse of the old political system. This position was acknowledged last year when its then governor, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, was named prime minister. He was judged the only figure with the necessary authority and impartiality to govern the country during its political and economic transition. Deeply suspect As prime minister, Mr Ciampi won golden opinions from economists which, perhaps unfortunately, were endorsed by the left in its attempt to gain respectability. That dragged him into an argument with Mr Berlusconi which the voters may be said to have arbitrated in the latter's favour, but which left Mr Berlusconi's own fiscal orthodoxy deeply suspect. Mr Berlusconi cannot now afford to appear to be trying to seize control of the central bank, any more than Mr Dini can afford to appear to seek revenge for the fact that he was himself passed over when the present governor was appointed last year. The RAI, in which jobs under the old regime were cynically shared out between the main political parties, has no such claim to virginity. But the board of five professors which resigned last Thursday had been put in to reform it during the transition. They can fairly complain that they were not given a chance to complete their work. More seriously, the government which has now gained the right to appoint the new board, albeit through the speakers of the two houses of parliament (both drawn from the governing coalition), is headed by the man who in his private capacity owns all three commercial TV channels. It is naive in the extreme for Mr Berlusconi to think he has resolved this conflict of interest by handing over the management of his commercial empire to a trusted lieutenant. He owes it to himself and his countrymen to correct this anomaly as fast as possible, by introducing a broadcasting law to guarantee the independence of both public and private broadcasting, and then selling his own holding at a price fixed by the international market.</p>

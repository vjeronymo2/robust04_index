			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSICIAN LIMIT PROVES A BITTER BREW;  </P> <P> REGULATIONS: A BURGEONING COFFEEHOUSE SCENE IS FEELING THE SQUEEZE OF A LONG  BEACH ORDINANCE REQUIRING A SPECIAL PERMIT IF MORE THAN ONE MUSICIAN PERFORMS  AT A TIME.  </P> <P> Things were percolating despite some empty seats on a recent Monday night at  Midnite Expresso.  </P> <P> Music and caffeine lovers, many of them sporting goatees and red bandannas,  milled about the sidewalk in front of the tiny Belmont Shore coffeehouse, while  inside a lone guitar player on a stool belted out such original songs as "Joth  Is Still Looking for Pia Zadora."  </P> <P> But the musician, C. Lee Clarke, was dissatisfied. "I'd like to have a harp  player," said Clarke, 32, a traveling minstrel who said he lives in his car and  plays wherever he can. A backup harpist would have enhanced his performance, he  said.  </P> <P> Two months ago that would have been no problem, according to owner Mike  Obering. For years, Midnite Expresso had featured groups of local musicians in  addition to espresso, cappuccino, cheesecake, sandwiches and chess. Musicians  performed in duos, trios or more.  </P> <P> Then earlier this summer, Obering said, a police officer appeared one night and  cited the establishment for violating a city ordinance that requires a special  permit for live entertainment by more than one musician at a time. So Obering  reluctantly told his musicians that they could perform only solo.  </P> <P> As a result, he said, he has become involved in an issue that will probably  keep cropping up with the emergence of new European-style coffeehouses in Long  Beach and elsewhere. In the last four years, musicians say, at least five such  cafes have opened in the city, two in Belmont Shore, one downtown and several  in other neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Unlike larger bars and discos that serve liquor and feature popular musical  combos, coffeehouses offer an intimate, non-alcoholic environment in which  conversation can flourish, patrons say.  </P> <P> In addition, they say, the establishments provide performance venues for  less-experienced musicians whose styles are sometimes experimental and often  non-commercial.  </P> <P> Midnite Expresso regular Phil Jacoubowsky said the cafe serves as "a meeting  point. People (come here) to talk philosophy, arts and music."  </P> <P> "We're just a small coffeehouse trying to provide an atmosphere," Obering said.  "We shouldn't be treated like the big (bars) making lots of money."  </P> <P> But Jaunice Floyd, the city's business license supervisor, disagreed. She said  it is her duty to enforce the law equally.  </P> <P> "We treat them all the same," Floyd said of her office's requirements regarding  entertainment licenses. Midnite Expresso "is doing the same thing as a larger  place."  </P> <P> To get a license, all businesses -- regardless of size -- must go through the  same long, costly process, in which the outcome is uncertain. After applying to  the city, Floyd said, an owner must pay flat fees for inspection and approval  by various departments and finally submit to a hearing before the City Council,  at which any neighbor or resident may object to the issuance of an  entertainment license.  </P> <P> The process is necessary, Floyd said, to allow affected parties to comment on  proposed activities likely to affect the quality of life in their  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> While in most cases entertainment license hearings are held before an  establishment opens as part of the general licensing process, she said, city  inspectors -- and on occasion, police officers -- make random stops at  businesses to determine whether establishments are complying.  </P> <P> "Actual citations are rare," Floyd said. "We generally give them lots of  warning."  </P> <P> Neither Floyd nor a spokesman for the Long Beach Police Department could  confirm that a citation had been issued against Midnite Expresso, but Obering  said a police officer had issued a citation.  </P> <P> Moins Rastgar, co-owner of System M coffeehouse in the city's downtown  redevelopment area, said he applied for an entertainment license last year  after city officials told him that he was violating the law by allowing musical  groups to perform.  </P> <P> For four months, Rastgar said, the group performances -- for which his place  was well known -- had to cease while city agencies conducted inspections  related to his application for an entertainment license.  </P> <P> Rastgar said that the inspections and other application costs totaled $2,000;  that business dropped 40%, costing him another $30,000, and that after the  license was issued, Rastgar spent an extra $5,000 in advertising to woo his  customers back.  </P> <P> "You can see how much of an impact it can have," he said. "In a small business,  it could be enough to force someone to close down or sell."  </P> <P> Midnite Expresso, which seats 30, has had a drop of about 20% in business since  the combos disappeared, Obering said. But others said there is an even more  dramatic impact on local musicians, many of whom depend on modest  establishments such as Obering's to showcase their talents.  </P> <P> "It's really sad," said Michael Rothmeyer, 20, a guitarist who has played at  many coffeehouses, including Midnite Expresso. "A lot of people who come to  listen just don't want to go to a bar. Solo is fine, but to have more (players)  offers broader possibilities."  </P> <P> Without venues such as coffeehouses that are accessible to less-established  groups, the musicians said, many will never get the experience or exposure  necessary to hone their skills and move on to larger audiences.  </P> <P> "I believe," said Gregg Young, a Belmont Shore-based musician whose group, the  2nd Street Band, has played all over town, "that the arts are the heart of a  city, and if you have something that's restricting that heart's growth, then  it's not doing the city justice. If you don't have a spot to see (younger  unestablished musicians), how will you know that they're there?"  </P> <P> Obering said his coffeehouse had been allowing musical groups to perform for at  least four years, without interference from the city.  </P> <P> Two years ago, when he bought the establishment from its previous owners, no  one told Obering that he would need a license to continue the live  entertainment that had already become a tradition there, he said.  </P> <P> But the former president of a local residents' group said he had received  complaints about the coffeehouse and had mentioned them in a letter to city  officials.  </P> <P> Bud Huber, who until recently was president of the Belmont Shore Improvement  Assn., said: "I can tell you that (the place) doesn't fit into the category of  one of the necessarily good members of the community.  </P> <P> "We believe that complying with city codes is part of the game of being in  business," said Huber, adding that while he has no objection to coffeehouses  per se, he generally does not favor establishments or activities in Belmont  Shore that add to what he perceives as the congested conditions there.  </P> <P> "If the city is finally starting to enforce its codes," he said, "I say  'Hallelujah!' "  </P> <P> City Councilman Doug Drummond, whose district includes Belmont Shore, said he  is unaware of controversy involving Midnite Expresso but added: "If we permit  one (business) to operate without licensing, then we are opening the doors to  others, and the laws have to be equally applied."  </P> <P> Obering said he is applying for an entertainment license and is considering the  possibility of expanding his facility.  </P> <P> He said he is also forming a committee that will try to persuade the City  Council to change the licensing law to ease the financial burden on smaller  establishments that apply for a license.  </P></p>

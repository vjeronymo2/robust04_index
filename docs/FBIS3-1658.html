This is our plain  duty. We are responsible for holding elections in Hong Kong in  1994 and 1995. The Joint Declaration lays down that the  legislature of Hong Kong in July 1997 "shall be constituted by  elections". Elections have to be fair and open if the territory  is to have a credible Legislative Council, capable of  safeguarding Hong Kong's way of life as set out in the Joint  Declaration, and the rule of law on which it depends.    We wished to hold these elections on a basis agreed with the  Chinese Government, with the aim of ensuring continuity.  Despite a real and sustained effort on our part, over 8 months  and 17 rounds of negotiation, agreement has not proved possible.  By the end of 1993 it was necessary, because of the legislative  timetable, to proceed with legislation in Hong Kong on the more  urgent and less complex issues. Therefore, in December 1993 the  Hong Kong Government introduced draft legislation on the voting  age and voting method for geographical elections, and on the  abolition of appointed seats in District Boards and Municipal  Councils. At the same time, we made clear to the Chinese side  our readiness, in the time made available by introducing  legislation on the more urgent issues, to intensify discussion  on the remaining, more complex issues. But our offer has not  yet been taken up by the Chinese side. We must now start the  legislative process on the remaining issues related to the 1995  Legislative Council elections.    This White Paper is intended to inform debate -- in  Parliament, in the Legislative Council and more widely -- on  what is at stake. It gives a full account of what our talks with  China have been about, why agreement has not been possible, and  how we intend to proceed.    Arrangements for the last cycle of elections in Hong Kong  under British sovereignty cannot be considered in isolation.  They form part of a long process of gradual development in Hong  Kong's system of representative government. The Sino-British  Joint Declaration of 1984, and China's Basic Law for Hong Kong,  which will come into force on 1 July 1997, between them set the  pace for democratic development in Hong Kong. There is no  argument about that. They also establish that Hong Kong will  retain its own, capitalist way of life after 1997, under the  principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong run by  Hong Kong people".    The wishes of the people of Hong Kong are crucial. There has  been a steadily growing demand for Hong Kong people to have more  say in the running of their own affairs. The first part of this  White Paper summarises these developments. It also addresses a  question I am often asked: why did Britain not introduce  democracy to Hong Kong much earlier? The short answer is that  for many years the community had other priorities. There was a  deep-seated concern that the introduction of politics could lead  to open clashes between Nationalists and Communists, and that  this could lead China to invoke its claim to sovereignty over  Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government, and through them the  Governor, were of course accountable to Parliament for the  administration of the territory throughout this period.    A gradual development of democracy has however been under  way  since 1984. 18 members were for the first time directly elected  to the Legislative Council in 1991. The question which  confronted the new Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, on his  arrival in mid-1992 was how to reconcile the clear wish in the  community for further movement towards democracy with the  equally strong interest in legislative arrangements which were  capable of enduring beyond 1997, thus providing an important  element of continuity.    The Hong Kong Government's proposals of October 1992 -- made  with our full support -- answered this question. They provided  for a modest development of democracy. These proposals were  fully compatible with the Joint Declaration, the Basic Law and  any relevant agreements between Britain and China.    The proposals put forward by the Hong Kong Government were  well received in Hong Kong. Despite the hostile Chinese  reaction, we persevered with efforts to get talks underway and  eventually agreed a basis for talks, which opened in April 1993.  The second part of this White Paper gives a full account of  these talks. It shows that we were prepared to make significant  moves on two important aspects of our proposals, the Functional  Constituencies and the Election Committee, provided that the  overall package met our essential requirements. But there was a  point beyond which we could not go if we were to achieve our  objective of fair and open elections. The third part of the  White Paper analyses in more detail the specific proposals  advanced by both sides against that objective.    The balance sheet is clear. Our proposals, even after  substantial revisions in an effort to meet Chinese concerns,  would produce electoral arrangements which were fair, open and,  in our judgement, acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. The  Chinese side's proposals as they emerged in the talks would not.  They proposed electoral arrangements which would have  restricted choice and left the elections open to manipulation.  Despite the evidence that tiny franchises can lead to  corruption and vote-rigging, they proposed freezing all  development in the 21 existing functional constituencies, and  proposed that nine new functional constituencies should be  formed in the same way. They proposed a restrictive and  cumbersome system for the Election Committee to return 10  members of the Legislative Council. They proposed a voting  method for the geographical constituencies which would have the  effect of ensuring that the less popular parties won seats.    We went as far as we could to bridge the gap. As part of  that, we explored fully the possibility of an interim  understanding which would allow legislation to be introduced on  the most urgent issues. But the Chinese side refused to accept  two elements which in our judgement were essential to fair and  open elections. First, they opposed the abolition of appointed  seats in the District Boards and Municipal Councils in 1994/95,  and indicated that the only circumstances in which they might be  able to agree to this would be on the understanding that at  least some of them would have to be reinstated in 1997. Second,  they could not accept the single seat-single vote method for the  Legislative Council geographical elections, even though they had  accepted this method for the District Board and Municipal  Council elections. The Legislative Council voted clearly in  July 1992 that this method should apply to the Legislative  Council elections, and the leaders of the two main parties  confirmed their support for it in November 1993. It would have  served no purpose to have tabled draft legislation that omitted  this point, since members of the Council would be likely to have  amended it to reflect their known views. As indicated above,  the Chinese side were also unable to agree with our proposals to  abolish appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal  Councils. Given the pressure of time, the Hong Kong Government  introduced a Bill on these more urgent issues in December 1993.  This has now been passed by the Legislative Council .    Our door has been open all along for discussion with the  Chinese government. It will remain so. But we can wait no  longer before legislating on the remaining electoral issues.  The Governor is introducing a Bill reflecting his October 1992  proposals. These have been widely discussed in Hong Kong for  over 16 months, and throughout the period have commanded wide  support within most sections of the community. They have been  the subject of three motion debates in the Legislative Council,  and were endorsed by the Council on each occasion. It is now  for the Legislative Council to pass legislation, taking full  account of the views of the community, and against the  background set out in this White Paper. This is a heavy  responsibility, which I am confident the Legislative Council  will discharge in the best interest of Hong Kong. We and the  Governor have consistently said that we cannot go further, nor  can we go less far, than the people of Hong Kong wish us to go.    We are committed to cooperation with China on Hong Kong and  to fulfilling our obligations under the Joint Declaration. It  is common sense that this is the best way to promote the  prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and to secure a smooth  transition. We look to the Chinese side to work with us to  achieve this. In particular we look forward to early agreement  on financing arrangements for the new airport and on Hong Kong's  ninth container terminal. There is also a long agenda of issues  in the Joint Liaison Group which need to be dealt with if  continuity in legal and technical areas is to be achieved. We  shall continue to work for cooperation with China to achieve  full implementation of the Joint Declaration. That is in the  best interests of a successful Hong Kong after 1997.    Douglas Hurd Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth  Affairs  <H3>  PART I: The Development of Representative Government in  Hong Kong  (a) Developments to 1984 </H3>   1. The unique circumstances of Hong Kong have determined the  development of its representative institutions. The policy of  Her Majesty's Government in the case of most other Dependent  Territories has been to promote the development of democracy in  preparation for eventual independence. But independence was  never a realistic option for Hong Kong. Attitudes in the  community reflected this reality. When relatively modest  proposals to develop democracy were made by the then Governor in  the period following the Second World War, they met with  virtually no public support in Hong Kong. The territory's  population had increased sharply, from about 600,000 in 1945 to  2.2 million by mid-1950. Most of these were migrants from  China, whose priorities were to make a decent living for  themselves and their families. In these early post-war years  there was widespread concern that political activity would have  led to the civil war in China between the Nationalists and the  Communists spilling over into Hong Kong.    2. Some constitutional development was again considered in  the mid-1960s. But the Cultural Revolution in China caused  disruption and uncertainty in Hong Kong. Many in the community  feared that elections would lead to open rivalry between the  Communists and Nationalists which would have put at risk the  stability of Hong Kong (there had been Nationalist-inspired  riots in Hong Kong in 1956, and Communist-inspired riots in the  1960s). Local attitudes were also influenced by the knowledge  that China was opposed to the introduction into Hong Kong of  party politics and elections on western lines. There was no  wish to provoke China into challenging the status quo  in pursuit of her standing claim to sovereignty over Hong Kong.    3. The Hong Kong Government therefore sought to develop  greater popular participation in public affairs through a  network of consultation boards and committees, which provided  advice on all areas of government activity. Elected  representation at local level was enhanced in 1973 when the  Urban Council was reconstituted with a mix of elected and  appointed members and granted financial autonomy. In 1982 the  District Boards were established as statutory bodies on a  territory-wide basis. The development of the local  administrative structure was completed in 1986, with the  establishment of the Regional Council with functions in the New  Territories comparable to those of the Urban Council. Elections  to a proportion of the seats on these bodies were on a  geographical constituency basis, with all eligible residents of  21 years and over having the vote.    (b) 1984-1991    4. Two issues in particular stimulated demand for a faster  pace of democratisation. First, the Sino-British negotiations  over the future of Hong Kong, which culminated in the Joint  Declaration signed in 1984. Second, the events of Tiananmen  Square in 1989.    5. The Joint Declaration set the broad framework for Hong  Kong's democratic development. It laid down that the  Legislature--still fully appointed in 1984--would be  "constituted by elections" in 1997. With that framework in  place, the Hong Kong Government issued a Green Paper as a basis  for public consultation on the next stage of development of  representative government. The subsequent White Paper announced  that membership of the 1985 Legislative Council would be  increased from 47 to 56; that official membership would be  reduced from 18 to 10 and appointed membership from 29 to 22;  and that 24 members should be elected indirectly 12 by an  Electoral College and 12 by functional constituencies. The  White Paper also noted that the consultation exercise had  revealed "strong public support for the idea of direct elections  but little support for such elections in the immediate future".  The question of whether direct elections should be introduced  at the Legislative Council elections due in 1988 was explicitly  left open for consideration in a further review in 1987.    6. After 1984, there was increasing public debate on the  question of elections in Hong Kong. The 1985 Legislative  Council was more active than its predecessors, and debated this  and other important issues openly, rather than in closed session.    7. During this period China's Basic Law for the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region (SAR), which will enter into force  on the transfer of sovereignty on 1 July 1997, was being  developed by the Basic Law Drafting Committee, appointed by the  Chinese National People's Congress in 1985. A Basic Law  Consultative Committee was formed in Hong Kong to reflect the  views of Hong Kong people to the Drafting Committee. A first  draft of the Basic Law came out in 1988, and the Basic Law was  finally promulgated in April 1990. It spells out more fully the  constitutional arrangements for post-1997 Hong Kong as promised  in the Joint Declaration. A "Decision of the National People's  Congress", annexed to the Basic Law, set out in some detail the  method for forming the first legislature of the Hong Kong SAR in  July 1997, including its composition. The Decision also set out  the basis on which members of the Legislative Council elected in  1995 could serve through 1997 to 1999 (the so-called through  train concept). The text of this Decision is at Annex 2. The  provisions of the Basic Law and the associated Decision of the  National People's Congress therefore have important implications  for the electoral arrangements to be put in place by the Hong  Kong Government before 1997, given the objective of continuity  and a smooth transition of government institutions.    8. The review of developments in representative government  took place in 1987. It generated considerable public interest.  The Hong Kong Government published a further Green Paper.  After extensive public debate, the resulting 1988 White Paper  concluded that although there was wide support in the community  for the principle of some directly-elected members in the  Legislative Council, opinion was sharply divided as to the  timing of their introduction. The Hong Kong Government decided  to postpone the introduction of directly-elected members to the  Council until 1991, in order to allow the changes introduced in  1985 to settle down further. The White Paper recommended an  increase in the number of functional constituency seats in 1988  and the introduction of 10 directly-elected seats in 1991.    9. The events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 had a  profound effect on Hong Kong opinion, strengthening support in  Hong Kong for a faster pace of democracy than that laid down in  the 1988 White Paper. In July 1989 the unofficial members of  the Executive and Legislative Councils (OMELCO) [acronym as  published] recommended that one third of the Legislative Council  should be directly-elected in 1991 (ie 20 seats) and not less  than 50% in 1995 (ie 30 seats). This became known as the OMELCO  consensus. Senior members of OMELCO came to London to press Her  Majesty's Government to implement it.    10. This posed in acute form the problem of how to reconcile  the clear wishes of the community for a faster pace of  democratisation with the equally strong interest in continuity  of the political system in Hong Kong before and after 1997. The  draft of the Basic Law at that time provided for only 15  directly-elected seats in 1997. Her Majesty's Government took  up this matter in a series of tough discussions with the Chinese  Government in late 1989 and early 1990. The British side  stressed the importance of responding to the clear desire in  Hong Kong for a faster pace of democratic development by  increasing the number of directly-elected members of the  Legislative Council beyond that envisaged in the draft Basic Law.    11. The Chinese side eventually agreed to increase to 20 the  number of directly-elected seats prescribed in the Basic Law for  the first legislature of the Hong Kong SAR. This was reflected  in the final version of the Basic Law published in April 1990.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary confirmed to the House  in February 1990 that the Legislative Council would have 18  directly-elected seats in 1991 and at least 20 in 1995. He also  said that Her Majesty's Government would continue to press the  case for a faster pace of democratisation.    12. The first direct elections, for these 18 seats in the  Legislative Council, were held in September 1991. All 18 seats  were contested. The turn-out rate was 39% of the registered  electorate of 1.9 million, higher than for any previous  elections in Hong Kong. The United Democrats of Hong Kong and  others who had campaigned hard for more democracy won 16 of the  18 seats and over 58% of the vote, a clear expression of the  community's interest in greater democracy.    (c) The Governor's proposals, October 1992    13. The presence of 18 directly-elected members in the 1991  Legislative Council marked a further important step in the  democratic development of Hong Kong. When Mr Patten arrived as  Governor of Hong Kong in July 1992, there was a widespread view  in the community that this process should be taken further in  the last cycle of elections in Hong Kong under British  sovereignty: those for the District Boards due in September  1994, for the Municipal Councils in March 1995 and for the  Legislative Council in September 1995. There was intense  speculation about the new Governor's policy on this. The  pressure of public expectations, as well as the practical need  to set in place in good time the necessary arrangements for  these elections, meant that the Governor had to take action soon  after his arrival.    14. The Governor therefore set out his proposals for  political development in the years up to 1997 in his inaugural  address to the Legislative Council in October 1992 (the main  points are summarised at Annex 1). They were the result of wide  ranging discussions in the community and had the full support of  Her Majesty's Government. The simplest way to respond to the  wish of the community in Hong Kong for greater democracy would  have been for the Chinese Government to agree to amend the Basic  Law in order to provide for a faster rate of increase in the  number of directly-elected seats. Her Majesty's Government  pressed the Chinese Government on several occasions to take this  step. But the Chinese side maintained that the Basic Law could  not be changed before it came into effect in 1997. The Governor  therefore decided, with the support of Her Majesty's Government,  to look for other ways of extending democratic participation, in  conformity with the terms of the Basic Law. Two weeks in  advance of the Governor's address, the Foreign and Commonwealth  Secretary informed the Chinese Foreign Minister of the substance  of the proposals. The Governor subsequently wrote to a senior  Chinese official, outlining these proposals and indicating his  intention to explain and discuss the proposals more fully.  Shortly before the Governor was due to address the Legislative  Council, the Chinese side asked that the announcement of the  proposals be delayed until agreement had been reached through  consultations with the Chinese side.    15. Her Majesty's Government and the Governor, however,  considered that it would not have been acceptable to embark on  negotiations with China without the Governor having set out his  approach to the Hong Kong community. The Governor emphasised to  the Legislative Council that he was setting out proposals, not  firm decisions, and that he wished to discuss them with Chinese  representatives. The proposals were well received in Hong Kong  and by international opinion. In three debates, held in October  1992, November 1992 and January 1993, the Legislative Council  voted by a substantial majority in favour of the Governor's  approach. In spite of the hostile reaction from China, opinion  polls in Hong Kong since October 1992 have shown continuing  support for the Governor's objectives.    16. The Governor went to Peking as soon after his speech to  the Legislative Council as the Chinese side were able to receive  him: on 20 October 1992. He explained his proposals, and again  emphasised the wish of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government to discuss them with the Chinese side. But  Chinese leaders refused any such discussion. They later  demanded in public that the Governor should withdraw his  proposals before any discussion of electoral arrangements could  take place. In the following two months, the Chinese  Government-controlled press in Hong Kong mounted increasingly  strident attacks on the Governor and on his proposals, without  offering any alternative ideas. Statements from the Chinese side  cast doubt on the continuing validity after 1997 of Government  contracts and franchises and suggested that China might begin to  prepare alternative arrangements for the legislature in 1997.  This public campaign caused anxiety in the community in Hong  Kong. The stock market fell temporarily, although Hong Kong's  economic fundamentals remained strong.    17. At a press conference immediately after the Governor's  visit to Peking, a senior Chinese official claimed that the  Governor's proposals violated agreements and understandings  reached in exchanges of correspondence in early 1990 between the  Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and his Chinese counterpart.  To set the record straight, Her Majesty's Government published  the seven documents concerned in October 1992. These showed  that the two sides had reached a common view that there should  be eighteen directly-elected seats in the Legislative Council in  1991, but there was no agreement on electoral arrangements for  1995. These were left open for future discussion.  <H3>  PART II: Talks between Britain and China on Electoral  Arrangements </H3>   (a) Establishing a basis for talks    18. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government  made clear from the outset that they were open to alternative  ideas, either from the Chinese side or from people in Hong Kong.  A wide range of alternative suggestions were made by groups and  individuals in Hong Kong in the months after the Governor's  announcement. The Hong Kong Government published in early 1993  a compendium of these alternative ideas and passed a copy to the  Chinese side. This compendium was intended to assist members of  the Legislative Council when they came to consider the draft  legislation which would be required to give effect to the  electoral arrangements for 1994 and 1995.    19. The Hong Kong Government's original intention had been  to submit such draft legislation to the Legislative Council in  February 1993. But, early in the year Her Majesty's Government,  in conjunction with the Hong Kong Government, took the  initiative to repeat formally to the Chinese side that they were  willing to hold talks about the electoral arrangements without  preconditions. This led to intensive diplomatic contacts in  Peking during February and March 1993 to explore whether a  productive basis for formal talks could be found. Her Majesty's  Government confirmed that they were ready for talks on the  basis, as proposed by the Chinese side, of the Joint  Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law,  and the relevant agreements and understandings reached between  Britain and China. They also made plain that in any talks the  British team would include the necessary Hong Kong Government  officials, on the same basis as other officials from London and  Peking. This was consistent with the practice followed in  previous discussions between Britain and China, including the  negotiations on the Joint Declaration and in the Joint Liaison  Group.    20. The Hong Kong Government introduced into the Legislative  Council in February a Bill covering one aspect of the Governor's  proposals: the establishment of a Boundaries and Election  Commission. This was passed into law in May 1993. In early  February Hong Kong's Executive Council also endorsed draft  legislation embodying the remainder of the Governor's proposals.  Despite strong pressure from the community in Hong Kong for the  draft legislation to be published, the Hong Kong Government held  back publication for five weeks to give the contacts between the  British and Chinese sides the maximum chance of success. But at  the end of that time it had still not been possible to agree on  an acceptable basis for the talks, or that they should start at  an early date. The draft legislation was therefore published on  12 March. But it was not introduced into the Legislative  Council. The publication of the draft legislation was  criticised publicly by the Chinese side. However, on the basis  of a further initiative from the British side, contacts resumed  between the British and Chinese Governments on the holding of  talks. Agreement was announced on 13 April that the talks would  be held on the basis of the Joint Declaration, the principle of  convergence with the Basic Law and the agreements and  understandings previously reached.    21. The objective of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government in the talks was to establish whether an  understanding could be reached with the Chinese side on a set of  electoral arrangements which they could commend to the  Legislative Council in Hong Kong. These would need to provide:    --First, that the elections in 1994 and 1995 should be fair,  open and acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.    --Second, that there should be agreement on clear, objective  and acceptable criteria for the Preparatory Committee (Footnote  1) to apply in 1997 when confirming members of the Legislative  Council elected in 1995 as members of the first legislature of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997 (the through  train).    The through train was a matter of cardinal importance, since  the whole rationale for the talks was to agree on arrangements  which would provide continuity through 1997. Candidates and  voters would need to know in 1995 what criteria would be applied  by the Preparatory Committee in determining whether members of  the Legislative Council could serve through 1997 for their full  four-year term. Without agreed objective criteria for the  through train, there would be no point in agreeing with the  Chinese side detailed electoral arrangements for 1995.    22. The talks fell into four distinct phases.    (b) First phase of talks: April-May 1993 (Rounds 1-3)    23. The British side (Footnote 2) explained that the talks  would need to be completed in good time so that orderly  arrangements could be made to hold the elections in Hong Kong in  1994 and 1995; explained the Governor's proposals, noted that  the Chinese side had criticised them but had not put forward  ideas of their own; and sought specific Chinese proposals so  that the talks could move rapidly to discussion of practical  electoral arrangements; and emphasised the importance of  acceptable objective criteria to ensure a through train for the  Legislative Council.    24. The British side also sought assurances from the Chinese  side on three further points:    --Consultation on the Hong Kong membership of the  Preparatory  Committee. This Committee will prescribe the specific method  for forming the first government and the first Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Fifty  percent of its membership will come from Hong Kong. The British  side proposed that there should be consultation between the two  sides about the Hong Kong membership in the same way as there  was consultation about the membership of the Airport  Consultative Committee.    --The ultimate aim of election of all members of the  Legislative Council by universal suffrage. Annex II of the  Basic Law allows for that in 2007. The British side proposed  that the Chinese authorities make clear that they would support  universal suffrage in 2007 if that was the wish of the Special  Administrative Region.    --Arrangements for selecting Chief Executives of the Special  Administrative Region. The Basic Law lays down that there will  be a "Selection Committee" for the first Chief Executive and an  "Election Committee" for future Chief Executives. The British  side proposed that if the two sides reached agreement on the  method of forming the Election Committee which would elect ten  members of the Legislative Council in 1995, the Chinese side  would use the same model for the future Selection and Election  Committees for Chief Executives and that these Committees would  be selected by open elections.    25. The Chinese side spent the first three rounds insisting  that before discussion could move on to matters of substance, it  was necessary for the two sides to reach agreement on a list of  principles. They claimed that these reflected earlier  agreements and understandings. In fact, these "principles"  would have had the effect of prejudicing the subsequent  discussion of substance. The British side took the view that in  order to be productive, the talks should deal with matters of  substance, that is the practical arrangements for the 1994/95  elections, on which no prior agreement had been reached.    26. At the end of the third round the Chinese side dropped  their precondition about an agreement on principles, and  accepted that the talks should move to matters of substance.    (c) Second Phase: May-June 1993 (Rounds 4-7)    27. The second phase of the talks was taken up largely with  the Chinese side moving slowly to set out their initial views on  the main issues. The British side continued to press for a  discussion of the through train, and of the other three issues  listed in para 24 above.    Footnotes    1. The Preparatory committee is, according to a Decision of  the National People's Congress reproduced in Annex 2, to he  established in 1996 to prepare for the establishment of the Hong  Kong Special Administrative Region, which would come into being  on 1 July 1997.    2. The term "the British side" is used for convenience. At  all stages the position put forward in the talks by Sir Robin  McLaren and (for Rounds 16-17) by Mr. Christopher Hum as British  Representatives, was agreed between Her Majesty's Government and  the Governor, acting on the advice of his Executive Council.    28. The Chinese position on the main issues is set out in  more detail in Part III. In summary, their position was:    --The provisions in existing Hong Kong law disqualifying  members of legislatures outside Hong Kong from serving on the  District Boards, Municipal Councils or Legislative Council  should be amended so that Hong Kong residents who are members of  China's People's Congresses could become members of these bodies.    --On District Boards and Municipal Councils, that their  functions should remain unchanged and some appointed members  should be retained.    --On the functional constituencies, that there should be no  expansion of the franchise in the existing 21 constituencies,  and that the nine new constituencies should not involve a  substantial increase in the size of the electorate, and should  be based on corporate voting.    --On the Election Committee, that the composition and ratio  should follow precisely the model set out in the Basic Law,  Annex I (which specifies the Election Committee that will be  responsible for electing Chief Executives after 1997 and some  members of the Legislative Council) but that the size of the  Committee should be different (600) from that prescribed in  Annex I of the Basic Law (800). One effect of this would be  that Hong Kong Deputies to the National People's Congress, and  representatives of the Hong Kong members of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference would have seats as of right on the Election  Committee, even though they had not been elected in Hong Kong.  (The text of Annex I of the Basic Law is reproduced at Annex 3  of this White Paper.)    (d) Third Phase: July-August 1993 (Rounds 8-9)    29. The position in late June, therefore, was that after  seven rounds of talks the Chinese side had finally put forward  an opening position on the main electoral issues, but one which  contained significant gaps and ambiguities. They had also  consistently refused to discuss criteria for the through train  or the three other issues raised by the British side. Since the  effect of the Chinese position would have been to ensure the  minimum development of Hong Kong's political system based on  restrictive electoral arrangements, there was a wide gap between  the two sides.    30. The Foreign Secretary took the opportunity of his  presence in the region for the Tokyo Summit to visit Peking for  talks with the Chinese Foreign Minister on 8-9 July 1993. His  aim was not to negotiate, but to focus the talks on the  essential issues, and to stress the need for early progress.  The Foreign Secretary set out the principles which would need  to apply if revised electoral proposals were to meet our  requirements:    --On the Election Committee, that its members should be  elected fairly and openly in Hong Kong, not selected; and that  the arrangements for elections which took place within the  Election Committee should themselves be open and fair. If  agreement could be reached on these principles, the British side  would be willing to consider whether an Election Committee could  be devised on the basis of the composition and ratio set out in  Annex I of the Basic Law.    --On the functional constituencies, the electorates should  be  of substantial size. Experience had shown that corporate voting  could lead to an individual having control over several votes in  functional constituencies. With very small electorates, there  was a risk of corruption, of which there had been a recent case  in Hong Kong. The British side therefore proposed to maintain  the gradual development of the existing 21 constituencies, and  would be willing to examine proposals which could meet the  requirements of both sides.    The Foreign Secretary also underlined that the whole purpose  of holding the talks was to achieve continuity, and that it was  therefore essential to reach agreement on objective criteria for  the through train. The two sides agreed to make efforts to  speed up the progress in the talks.    31. In rounds eight and nine, the British side fulfilled the  Foreign Secretary's undertaking by putting forward revised  proposals on the Election Committee and the functional  constituencies, even though the Chinese side still maintained  their refusal to discuss objective criteria for the through  train. The details of the revised proposals are set out in Part  III of this White Paper. Part Ill also explains why the Chinese  proposals on these issues were unacceptable.    (e) Fourth Phase: September-November 1993 (Rounds  10-17)    32. During these rounds, the British side offered further  important moves on the functional constituencies and issues  related to the Election Committee (See paragraphs 35 and 77  below). The Chinese side made some minor adjustments to their  position on functional constituencies. A discussion of through  train criteria finally got underway. The possibility of an  interim agreement dealing with the most urgent issues was fully  explored. At a late stage, the Chinese side made plain that  they would only be willing to reach an interim agreement if the  British side undertook not to take unilateral action on any of  the remaining issues under discussion.    33. The Foreign Secretary held a further meeting with the  Chinese Foreign Minister in the margins of the UN General  Assembly in New York on 1 October. The Foreign Secretary  expressed disappointment at the lack of progress, despite the  major moves by the British side in an effort to bridge the gap.  He emphasised that the British side were working for success in  the talks, but that before the talks could make further  progress, it was essential that a discussion of through train  criteria should begin. In response to a proposal from the  Chinese side, he explained that an interim agreement on District  Board and Municipal Council elections only was not attractive,  since a number of the elements also applied to the Legislative  Council elections (eg voting age and voting method) and should  be dealt with together. The Foreign Secretary briefed the  Chinese Foreign Minister on the main points relating to the  talks on the Governor's Annual Address to the Legislative  Council which was delivered on 6 October.    34. In his address to the Legislative Council, the Governor  was careful not to breach the confidentiality of the talks. But  in the light of extensive press leaks, he confirmed that the  British side had put forward revised proposals on the functional  constituencies and the Election Committee, conditional on  reaching an acceptable overall agreement that included through  train criteria. He emphasised that the British side were  working for success in the talks, but that for practical reasons  there were only weeks rather than months left in which to reach  an agreement.    35. In the course of October, the British side put forward a  further revision of their proposals for the nine new functional  constituencies, taking account of points made by the Chinese  side. The details are in paragraph 77 below. They also put  forward new proposals on the Election Committee, accepting the  Chinese position that the Committee's size should be about 600,  and confirming that Hong Kong residents who were deputies to the  National People's Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) would be free to stand  for election to the Election Committee.    36. In late October, the Chinese side proposed that the two  sides record an interim understanding on five points: that  there would be no change in the nature or functions of the  District Boards and Municipal Councils; that the voting age in  all three tiers of elections, including the Legislative Council,  should be 18; that the restriction on Hong Kong residents, who  are members of Chinese People's Congresses, serving in Hong  Kong's representative bodies should be lifted for all three  tiers; that the voting method for the District Boards and  Municipal Councils should be single-seat, single-vote; and that  the two sides should record their differing view on the question  of abolishing appointed members in the District Boards and  Municipal Councils. On the last point, they proposed that it  should be for the Special Administrative Region Government to  determine on its own the number of appointed members in the  District Boards and Municipal Councils.    37. The British side responded rapidly by developing these  points into a draft Memorandum of Understanding. (The text is  reproduced at Annex 4.) Given the urgency, this draft was handed  over on 3 November, in advance of the following round of talks.  The British Ambassador followed this up by calling on the  Chinese side's Representative on 5 November. The British side  explained that they had added one point of substance to the  original Chinese proposal: that the single-seat, single-vote  method should also apply to the Legislative Council geographical  elections. Provided draft legislation on all these issues could  be introduced into the Legislative Council quickly, a little  more time would be gained to resolve the remaining issues. But  a first stage understanding would have to include the voting  method for the Legislative Council. On all the available  evidence, it would not be acceptable to the Legislative Council  or the community to include a proposal for the voting method for  the District Boards and the Municipal Councils but exclude a  similar proposal for the Legislative Council elections,  particularly since other aspects of the proposed first stage  understanding, such as the voting age and the lifting of the  restriction on Hong Kong residents who are members of Chinese  People's Congresses, were to apply to all three tiers of  government, including the Legislative Council. The British side  reconfirmed their understanding (which had been spelled out in  the draft Memorandum of Understanding handed over on 3 November)  that the formula proposed by the Chinese side would leave the  British side free to abolish appointed membership in the 1994/95  elections, and that the Special Administrative Region  authorities would be free in 1997 to decide whether to reinstate  appointed membership. They explained that unless that was what  the Chinese proposal meant, it would be of no value. The  Chinese side made no attempt either on 3 November or on 5  November or at any point prior to Round 16 to contest this  understanding.    38. Following a Ministerial meeting, attended by the  Governor, on 10 November, the Prime Minister sent Premier Li  Peng a message. He welcomed the progress which had been made  towards an understanding on the most immediate issues, and  indicated that for practical reasons it would be necessary to  reach agreement on them very soon. The Prime Minister also  noted that if it was possible to reach early agreement on these  matters, there would be a little more time to tackle the more  difficult issues, and proposed a more intensive final phase of  the negotiations.    39. The British side therefore sought in the two rounds  following this message (Rounds 16 and 17) to reach agreement on  the text of a Memorandum of Understanding. Also in Round 16, in  an effort to reach agreement on objective criteria for the  through train, the British side handed over a draft of an  extended oath of allegiance to the Special Administrative  Region, to be taken by Legislative Councillors in 1997. This  draft text (which is set out at Annex 5) built on points made by  the Chinese side in the previous round. But the British side  made it clear that it would be unacceptable for the criteria to  apply retrospectively.    40. On the Memorandum of Understanding, the Chinese side  refused to agree that a first stage agreement should cover the  voting method for the Legislative Council geographical  elections. They also said in Round 16 that their formula on  appointed membership did not mean that the British side would be  free to abolish appointed seats in the District Boards and  Municipal Councils in 1994-95. They claimed that there had been  a misunderstanding, notwithstanding the clear statements at the  time by the British side on how they interpreted the formula.    41. In informal discussion during Round 17, the Chinese side  put forward two texts for an oral understanding: one covered  only arrangements for the Municipal Council and District Board  elections; the other covered the same ground but with the  addition, for the Legislative Council elections, of the voting  age and the removal of the restriction on Hong Kong residents  who are members of Chinese People's Congresses. The Chinese  side said that in either case, if the British side would accept  that the voting method for the Legislative Council should not be  included in the understanding, they could accept an "agreement  to disagree" formula on appointed membership that would allow  the British side to abolish appointed seats in 1994/95. The  formula they put forward was as follows: "The British side  propose to abolish appointed seats in the District Boards and  Municipal Councils with effect from September 1994 and March  1995 respectively. The Chinese side propose to retain an  appropriate proportion of appointed seats in the District Boards  and Municipal Councils to be constituted in 1994 and 1995. The  Chinese side state that, from 1 July 1997, the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region Government will determine the number of  appointed seats of the District Boards and Municipal Councils in  accordance with the provisions of Article 98 of the Basic Law."    42. This formula was different from that put forward in  Round 15, notably in the omission of the words "on its own"  after the reference to the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region Government. The Chinese side made clear in their  presentation of this proposal that if the British side insisted  on abolishing appointed seats in 1994/95 the Chinese side would  in the future establish an appropriate proportion of appointed  seats. After 30 June 1997 the Special Administrative Region  Government would, in accordance with Article 98 of the Basic  Law, determine on their own the number of appointed seats. It  did not mean that the Special Administrative Region Government  would in the future determine on their own whether to retain or  abolish appointed seats; that decision would be for "the Chinese  side".    43. Even if the British side had been able to accept the  Chinese prerequisite for such a formula, namely the exclusion  from the deal of the Legislative Council voting method--and they  could not do this they could not have accepted such an  understanding on appointed membership. The Chinese proposal  represented an erosion of the autonomy promised to the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region under the Joint Declaration and  the Basic Law. It should be for the Special Administrative  Region authorities on their own to determine by law the  composition of the "district organisations", including the  question of what (if any) should be the number of appointed  District Board and Municipal Council members. This should be a  matter within the high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong is  guaranteed under both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.  In addition, the Chinese side's reassertion, in the context of  the discussion of a first stage agreement, that we should not  legislate unilaterally on any matter not agreed with the Chinese  side, remained an obstacle.    44. When it became apparent during Round 17 that it would  not be possible to reach agreement on the issues covered in the  British draft Memorandum of Understanding, the British  Representative made plain that his instructions did not give him  authority to continue discussion of a first-stage understanding.  But he emphasised that the British side wished to continue  discussion of the remaining issues, and proposed that a further  round be held in December in order to do so. The Foreign  Secretary sent a message to the Chinese Foreign Minister on 30  November, confirming that for practical and political reasons it  would be necessary for the Governor to introduce draft  legislation on the issues covered in the draft Memorandum of  Understanding to the Legislative Council in the first half of  December, and to announce his intention to do so to the  Legislative Council on 2 December. The Chinese response,  received on 1 December, was to say that this would lead to a  breakdown of the talks. The British side emphasised again in  reply that they were not breaking off the talks and remained  ready for further discussion of the other issues. On 2 December  the Governor informed the Legislative Council that draft  legislation on the first-stage issues would be gazetted on 10  December and introduced into the Council on 15 December. That  legislation has now been fully debated and passed by the  Legislative Council.  <H3>  PART III: Analysis of proposals put forward during the  talks [subhead] </H3>   45. This part considers the various electoral proposals put  forward by the British and Chinese sides against the essential  requirements of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong  Government: that the 1994/95 elections should be open, fair and  acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.    Voting Age    46. The Governor's proposal in October 1992 was that the  voting age should be reduced from 21 to 18 for all elections in  Hong Kong.    47. The voting age is 18 in both the UK and China, and this  proposal was widely supported in Hong Kong.    48. The Chinese side took no position on this issue until  Round 15, when they accepted that the voting age could be  lowered to 18 for all three tiers of elections.    Eligibility to stand for election    49. The Chinese side proposed that Hong Kong law should be  changed to permit Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's  Congresses to serve in the Legislative Council and District  Organisations. But the prohibition on members of other  Parliaments and Councils should remain.    50. The British side agreed in Round 14 that as part of an  agreed overall package, they would be willing to commend to the  Legislative Council an amendment to the law to permit Hong Kong  residents who were People's Congress Deputies to become members  of the Legislative Council and District Organisations. In Round  16 they offered to agree, as part of a Memorandum of  Understanding on the more urgent issues, to introduce  legislation to that effect.    District Board and Municipal Council Elections (1994/95)    51. The Governor proposed in October 1992 that all members  of the District Boards and Municipal Councils should be  directly-elected (except for ex-officio members in the New  Territories, who are elected representatives of rural bodies).    52. Since their inception the District Boards and Municipal  Councils have been moving away from a wholly appointed  membership towards an elected membership. The Governor's  proposal is fully consistent with the principle of open and fair  elections, and of the gradual development of Hong Kong's  political system.    53. The Chinese proposal made in Round 4 of the talks was  that the nature, functions and method for forming the District  Organisations should remain unchanged. Appointed membership  should be retained. In Round 15 they proposed a small reduction  in the number of appointed members (from 31.7% to 27.2% in the  case of the District Boards). Later in the same round they  proposed that, as part of an interim understanding on the  District Boards and Municipal Councils, the two sides should  record their differing views on the abolition of appointed  membership, and that it should be left to the Government of the  Special Administrative Region after 30 June 1997 to determine on  its own the number of appointed members in accordance with law.  The British side built on this proposal in producing the fifth  point in the draft Memorandum of Understanding at Annex 4. This  would have enabled the British side to introduce legislation to  abolish appointed membership at the 1994/95 elections, without  prejudice to a future decision by the Special Administrative  Region authorities on whether to reinstate them. But the  Chinese side made plain in Round 16, and subsequently, that they  could not agree to abolition of appointed members on this basis.  (A fuller account of this issue is set out in paragraphs 40-43.)  The British side continues to believe that abolition of  appointed members in the District Boards and Municipal Councils  is an essential part of the gradual development of Hong Kong's  electoral system, particularly as the Legislative Council will  be composed entirely of elected members from 1995.    Legislative Council Elections (1995)  The "Through Train"    54. The British side proposed in Round 1 of the talks that  the only necessary qualification for legislators elected in 1995  to continue in office until 1999 should be a pledge of  allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the  People's Republic of China and a pledge to uphold the Basic Law.  This would be exactly the same requirement as that set out in  Article 104 of the Basic Law for Special Administrative Region  Government officials, Executive and Legislative Councillors and  members of the judiciary on taking office.    55. The Chinese side initially took the position that they  would only be willing to discuss criteria for the through train  when they were satisfied that the composition of the 1995  Legislative Council would conform to their interpretation of the  Basic Law. They also pointed out that according to the Decision  of the National People's Congress on the Method for the  formation of the First Government and the first Legislative  Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  (reproduced at Annex 2) it would be for the Preparatory  Committee to confirm members of the Legislative Council as  members of the first Special Administrative Region legislature.    56. In Round 13, the British side suggested a method for  achieving early promulgation of objective criteria, consistent  with the role laid down in the Basic Law for the National  People's Congress (NPC) and the Preparatory Committee. This  would involve the two sides reaching agreement on criteria; the  Chinese Government recommending this to the NPC Standing  Committee for approval and promulgation before the 1995  elections; and the NPC Standing Committee deciding that these  criteria--and no other--should be used in 1997 for confirming  members of the Legislative Council. The Chinese side said that  they could not accept this proposal, but that it should be  possible to find a solution. In the event, they did not propose  any alternative.    57. In Round 15, the Chinese side did, however, finally  respond to the British side's proposal on through train  criteria. In addition to meeting the straightforward  requirements in the Basic Law, including a pledge of allegiance  to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Chinese side  proposed that in order to "uphold the Basic Law" a Legislative  Councillor would need to:    --Love China and love Hong Kong;    --Uphold the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong  Kong;    --Be dedicated to bringing about a smooth transition and  transfer of power in 1997;    --Support the "one country--two systems" principle;    --Not commit (or have committed--the tense was ambiguous in  the Chinese statement) actions such as opposing the Basic Law,  or participating in or leading activities such as attempting to  overthrow the Chinese Government or undermining the socialist  system on the mainland.    58. The British side noted that all these points were  already covered by the Basic Law. But the essential point was  that any criteria should be forward-looking; it would be  unacceptable to have any test of past political views or  actions. In a further effort to take account of the Chinese  side's wish for a detailed set of criteria, the British side put  forward in Round 16 a draft of an extended oath to be taken in  1997. (The text is at Annex 5.) It builds on the Chinese side's  points, and makes clear that it applies to future behaviour.  The Chinese side made no response to this proposal.    Voting Method in Legislative Council Geographical  Constituencies    59. The Governor proposed in October 1992 that there should  be 20 members directly elected from 20 single-seat geographical  constituencies.    60. The single-seat, single-vote method is simple, and  preserves a clear link between the electorate in each  constituency and their elected representative. The Hong Kong  electorate is accustomed to this system of voting, which is  already used in the Municipal Council and most District Board  elections.    61. The Chinese side proposed in Round 9 of the talks that  for the 20 Legislative Council geographical seats, there should  be 20 members directly elected from the existing nine  geographical constituencies using the multi-seat, single-vote  method. They refused to accept the single-seat, single-vote  method for the Legislative Council, even though they agreed that  it should be used for all Municipal Council and District Board  elections in 1994-95.    62. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government, the multi-seat, single-vote system would not  provide a fair and open system. It would artificially freeze  the constituencies as they were demarcated in 1991, taking no  account of demographic trends in Hong Kong. It also appears to  be designed to ensure that seats go to parties winning small  percentages of the vote. In 1992 the Hong Kong Legislative  Council itself voted in favour of the single-seat, single-vote  system for Legislative Council elections and in November 1993  the main political parties reaffirmed their support for it.    Election Committee    63. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government  consider that if the election of ten members of the Legislative  Council by an Election Committee is to be fair, open and  acceptable to the people of Hong Kong, two essential  requirements will need to be satisfied:    --That members of the Election Committee should be elected  fairly and openly in Hong Kong.    --The arrangements for the elections of ten members of the  Legislative Council by the Election Committee should themselves  be open and fair.    64. The Governor's proposal in October 1992 was that the  Election Committee should draw all or most of its members from  the directly-elected District Boards; and that the Election  Committee should be able to vote for any qualified candidate,  not just for members of the Election Committee.    65. This proposal meets the two essential requirements. It  would also provide a simple solution, since no new electoral  machinery would be needed.    66. The Chinese side's proposal (tabled in Round 7 of the  talks and later clarified, in response to repeated questions  from the British side, in Round 14) was that:    --The composition and ratio of the Election Committee should  follow precisely the four-sector model set out in paragraph 2 of  Annex I of the Basic Law (notwithstanding the fact that  paragraph 2 of Annex II makes clear that the Election Committee  for the first Legislative Council is not the same as that  provided for in Annex I) but the size of the Committee should be  about 600, not 800 as in paragraph 2 of Annex I.    --The voting method would be that each of the four sectors  would elect three candidates for election by the Election  Committee to Legislative Council making twelve in all.  Candidates would not have to be members of the Election  Committee, but would have to come from the relevant sector. The  election of these three candidates in each sector would be by  block vote, using a simple majority system. All members of the  Election Committee would then elect 10 of the 12 to become  members of the Legislative Council by simple majority.    67. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government the Chinese side's proposals do not meet the  essential requirements and would not therefore provide a fair  and open method of election. It should be noted in this context  Annex I of the Basic Law requires that the Election Committee  after 1997 should be formed in accordance with the principles of  "democracy and openness".    68. Following precisely the composition for the fourth  sector set out in paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law raises  two problems. First, the Basic Law model includes members of  the present Legislative Council, not all of whom have been  elected. Second, it includes the Hong Kong Deputies to the  National People's Congress and representatives of Hong Kong  members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference. These people have not been elected openly and  fairly in Hong Kong; to include them in the Election Committee  simply by virtue of their membership of these non-Hong Kong  bodies would be a major breach of the requirement that the  Election Committee should be composed of people who had  themselves been elected openly and fairly in Hong Kong. It  would mean that part of the Election Committee was produced in  an undemocratic way.    69. The voting method proposed by the Chinese side is  self-evidently restrictive and cumbersome.    70. Following the Foreign Secretary's meeting with the  Chinese Foreign Minister in July 1993, the British side  introduced in Round 8 of the talks a revised proposal on the  Election Committee. In a major move towards the Chinese  position, this accepted that the Election Committee should be  composed of four sectors on the lines set out in Annex I of the  Basic Law. The first three sectors would be elected by groups  of functional constituencies. Electors in each functional  constituency would then elect a specified number of members to  the Election Committee, as well as a functional constituency  representative to the Legislative Council. On the fourth  sector, the British side proposed that it should be returned by  members of the District Boards, the Municipal Councils and the  Heung Yee Kuk (Footnote 3). They made clear that for the  reasons noted above, it would not be appropriate for members of  the 1991 Legislative Council, or Hong Kong deputies to the  National People's Congress (NPC) and representatives of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to  serve on the Election Committee simply by virtue of their  membership of these bodies. During Round 14, in another effort  to narrow the gap, the British side confirmed that Hong Kong  residents who were deputies to the NPC and CPPCC would be free  to stand for election to the Election Committee; and accepted  the Chinese proposal that the size of the 1995 Election  Committee should be about 600, as part of an overall package  deal.    71. On voting method, the British side proposed that the  functional constituencies would elect the first three sectors by  the block-vote method, ie each functional constituency elector  would have as many votes as the number of members to be returned  by that functional constituency. Elections within the Election  Committee would use the single transferable vote method. Any  registered voter who was eligible to serve on the Legislative  Council would be eligible for election by the Election  Committee, provided he or she secured at least five nominations  by Election Committee members.    72. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government, this revised proposal, although less simple  than the Governor's original proposal, would meet the essential  requirements by ensuring that the Election Committee would be  elected by people who had been elected fairly and openly in Hong  Kong, through either the functional constituencies or the  District Boards, and that the elections inside the Election  Committee would take place in an open and fair manner.    Functional Constituencies    73. The Hong Kong Government's 1988 White Paper defined  functional constituencies as representing sectors of substantial  size and importance in Hong Kong. Her Majesty's Government and  the Hong Kong Government consider that if the functional  constituency system is to meet the requirements of fairness and  openness, there are two lessons to be learnt from recent  experience. First, corporate voting, which is now used in  electing 11 of the 21 functional constituency seats, can lead to  an individual having effective control over several votes in  functional constituencies. Second, the very small electorates in  some of the existing constituencies lead to a risk of  corruption, of which there has been a recent example in Hong  Kong. It is therefore necessary to provide for constituencies  of a substantial size.    Footnotes    3. The Heung Yee Kuk represents the indigenous inhabitants  of  the New Territories.    74. The Governor's proposals in October 1992 took account of  these points. He proposed that for the 21 existing functional  constituencies, the process of gradual development should be  maintained by replacing all forms of corporate voting with  individual voters. For the nine new functional constituencies,  the Governor proposed that the simplest and fairest approach  would be to define them so that they included the entire working  population. On that basis, the Governor proposed nine  constituencies based on the existing classification of  industrial and commercial sectors.    75. The Chinese side's proposals, put forward in Round 6 of  the negotiations, were that the composition and voting method of  the existing 21 functional constituencies should remain  precisely as they were in 1991, retaining the concept of  corporate voting. They proposed that the nine new functional  constituencies should be: the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises  Association; one extra seat for the existing Labour Functional  Constituency; agriculture and fisheries; textiles and garments;  Importers and Exporters Association; Kai Fong Welfare  Associations; insurance; maritime; and sports. These  constituencies should also be based on corporate voting.    76. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government, the Chinese side's proposals would not deal  adequately with the problems associated with corporate voting  and very small constituencies. The nine new constituencies they  were proposing would add only about 20,000 voters to the  franchise of 110,000 for the existing 21 constituencies. Some  of their specific proposals also failed to meet the requirements  for functional constituencies. Kai Fong Associations are not  economic or professional groups of importance in the community.  They would in any case yield a tiny functional constituency  since there are only some 60 such associations in Hong Kong.  The proposal for a Chinese Enterprises Association constituency  is inconsistent with Hong Kong's general approach of treating  all investors and enterprises in the same way, regardless of  national origin. It could be divisive to create constituencies  on the basis of "national" interests rather than economic and  professional groups. Many Chinese enterprises are already  registered electors in other functional constituencies. The  Chinese proposal for an Insurance Functional Constituency could  only be formed by splitting the existing Financial Services  Constituency which was already very small. Given the small  number of authorised insurers in Hong Kong (229) the insurance  constituency by itself would be tiny. In later rounds, the  Chinese side hinted that they might be prepared to be flexible  on the number of corporate voters within a corporate voting  system. But they were never specific. The British side's view  remains that corporate voting should in all cases be replaced by  individual voting, for the reasons given above.    77. The British side put forward revised proposals on the  nine new functional constituencies in Round 9. These took  account of the Chinese proposal that functional constituencies  should all be based on organisations, and also built on six of  the nine specific Chinese proposals. In subsequent rounds, the  British side offered a number of further revisions to their list  of functional constituencies, in a major effort to bridge the  gap. After these amendments, the British side's nine proposed  constituencies were:    --Textiles and Garment    --Wholesale/Retail and Import/Export    --Manufacturing    --Agriculture and Fisheries    --Transport    --Utilities and Communications    --Services    --Sports, Culture and Entertainment    --Lands/Works/Housing and Construction    The total franchise for the 30 functional constituencies on  this basis would be some 840,000.    78. In the view of Her Majesty's Government and the Hong  Kong Government, these revised proposals, as part of an overall  package, would still meet the minimum requirements of fair and  open functional constituency elections based on constituencies  of substantial size and importance in the community.    Nationality Provision    79. The Chinese side proposed in Round 9 of the talks that  the Hong Kong Government should implement the nationality  provision of the Basic Law in 1995, two years before the Basic  Law comes into force. This provides that permanent residents of  the Region, who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the  right of abode in foreign countries, may be elected to the  Legislative Council "provided that the proportion of such  members does not exceed 20% of the total membership of the  Council".    80. The British side made clear that it would not be  possible to discriminate in this way against British nationals,  in elections held in 1995 while Hong Kong was still under  British sovereignty. The nationality status of individual  members of the legislature could change between the elections in  1995 and 1 July 1997. But the British side said that they would  be willing to discuss any Chinese ideas as to how this provision  might be implemented after I July 1997, in the unlikely event  that more than 20% of members were at that time foreign  nationals or held right of abode outside Hong Kong.  <H5>  PART IV: Conclusion and the way forward </H5>   81. As the preceding section makes clear, many of the  individual issues covered in the talks were, in themselves,  technical. But the fundamental difference between the two sides  was simple. The proposals put forward by Her Majesty's  Government and the Hong Kong Government were, in essence,  designed to produce a Legislative Council and District  Organisations that would truly represent the interests of Hong  Kong and its community, thereby embodying the concept "Hong Kong  run by Hong Kong people". The Chinese side wanted far more  restrictive electoral arrangements, with far fewer voters. The  smallest of their proposed new functional constituencies would  have had an electorate of under 100. Such arrangements could be  manipulated and would not, in the view of Her Majesty's  Government and the Hong Kong Government, guarantee elected  institutions likely to reflect in undistorted form the interests  of the people they represent.    82. The argument has been made that an agreement should be  reached at any cost, on the grounds that the consequences of  failure to reach agreement would be too serious. As this White  Paper explains, Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong  Government have done everything possible to try to secure an  acceptable agreement. But they do not consider that a flawed  agreement would be better than none. The consequences for Hong  Kong of the electoral arrangements proposed by the Chinese side  would themselves be very serious.    83. The central objective of the Joint Declaration is to  preserve Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, and the open  society on which these are based. At the heart of this, and of  Hong Kong's success over the years, is the rule of law, and  equally important the confidence in Hong Kong itself and  internationally, that this will be maintained after 1997. It is  difficult to envisage the maintenance of the rule of law in a  community where the legislative body is neither fairly elected  nor free from the possibility of manipulation.    84. Fairly and openly elected representative institutions  are also necessary to protect other fundamental aspects of Hong  Kong's way of life. The level playing field for business, which  has brought so much prosperity to Hong Kong, and from which so  much of its international reputation derives, depends in the  last resort on the ability of the Legislative Council to ensure  that Hong Kong's economic and social needs, and not closed-door  pressures from vested interests, determine how money is spent.  Likewise, Hong Kong's success in recent decades has owed much  to its ability to root out corruption. The introduction of  electoral structures or practices which cast doubt on the  integrity of the Legislative Council could threaten that success.    85. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government  regret that it has not been possible to reach agreement with the  Chinese Government on these issues. In the absence of such an  agreement, it is the firm view of Her Majesty's Government and  the Hong Kong Government that Hong Kong's best interest lies in  making electoral arrangements for 1994 and 1995 which carry  forward the already agreed and established process of democratic  development, which are themselves open and fair, and which can  command the broad support of the people of Hong Kong.    86. Within the limits of these principles, the British side  were prepared to offer revised proposals during the talks, in an  effort to secure an acceptable overall package, including agreed  through train criteria. We tried every means to give the talks  the best possible chance of success. We tried to secure a first  stage agreement on the simpler and more urgent issues. When it  became clear that this could not be achieved, we introduced  separate legislation on these issues to create more time for  talks to continue on the other issues. We have now come to a  point where we must get on with legislation on these remaining  issues.    87. Her Majesty's Government and the Hong Kong Government  have given careful consideration to the basis on which that  legislative process might begin. We would have been prepared to  commend to the Legislative Council the revised package of  proposals, if we had secured an overall agreement with the  Chinese side, including the through train. But such agreement  proved out of reach. The Governor's October 1992 proposals, on  the other hand, have been the subject of three motion debates in  the Legislative Council and were endorsed on each occasion.  Throughout the last 16 months they have been widely discussed,  and they command wide support within most sections of community.  They are also compatible with the provisions of the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law, and do not breach any past  agreements between the British and Chinese Governments. They  thus remain our preferred basis for beginning the legislative  process. The Governor, with the advice of the Executive Council  and the support of Her Majesty's Government, has now decided to  introduce into the Legislative Council a bill based on that  package.    88. Constitutionally, the Legislative Council has the  responsibility to pass legislation for the 1994 and 1995  elections. It will have before it the Hong Kong Government's  Bill, as well as other ideas that have emerged in the community,  and in the context of talks with the Chinese side, in the past  16 months. Her Majesty's Government and the Governor have said  repeatedly that they do not wish to go further, or less far,  than the people of Hong Kong wish them to go. We are confident  that the Legislative Council, in discharging its heavy  responsibility, will take full account of the wishes of Hong  Kong people.

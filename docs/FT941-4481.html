			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Lisbon minister puts boot in over tax The Portuguese government has dismissed the head of the tax department and threatened to auction assets of a top football club as part of a crackdown aimed at stemming a big shortfall in tax revenue. The move by Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, was praised as courageous by tax consultants. But officials of FC Porto, the football club, said it was an affront to their dignity - particularly the listing of the lavatory of the referees' changing room as one of the assets to seize. Mr Francisco Rodrigues Porto was dismissed as director general of taxes after revenue in 1993 fell Es373bn (Pounds 1.43bn) below the government forecast. The shortfall was the main cause of a doubling of the forecast budget deficit last year to 8.2 per cent of gross domestic product. However, Mr Vasco Valdes, the member of government directly responsible for taxes last year, was promoted in a cabinet reshuffle in December. Tax specialists said an increase in VAT on basic foods and restaurants had led many small shopkeepers and cafe owners to resort to the black market. The abolition of border collections of VAT on imports had further increased tax evasion. The computer system for processing tax collection was also woefully inefficient, they said, because of government cost-cutting measures that had frozen spending on hardware, software and personnel. No other signal that Mr Catroga is determined to fight tax evasion could have been stronger than his decision to tackle a leading football club. 'Football teams spend billions on foreign players they can't afford and simply ignore the taxman,' said a tax consultant. 'Until now politicians, fearful for their popularity, had just shrugged their shoulders. FC Porto officials were so taken aback by the threat to seize assets to secure part of an estimated Es1bn in tax and social security arrears that they called an emergency meeting yesterday. Analysts now wonder whether Mr Catroga's zeal to combat tax evasion will lead him to tackle a case with more serious implications. The attorney general is investigating 67 companies alleged to have to sold false invoices to other companies to enable them to claim fictitious VAT and corporate tax repayments. Police are reported to be investigating dozens of other companies, many of whom are alleged to be contributors to political party funds.</p>

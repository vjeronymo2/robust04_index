R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;553.510, by requiring that, in addition to remaining operations on continuously mined and previously mined areas, remining operations on areas with remaining highwalls subject to the AOC provisions also comply with other cross-referenced program requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utah proposes to delete existing Utah Admin.

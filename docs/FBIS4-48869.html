			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federal Government has advised critics of the  administration not to take its posture of reconciliation as a  sign of weakness. Briefing State House correspondents in Abuja,  Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya said government believed that  the situation in the country required restraint by everyone.  The chief of general staff also spoke on some other crucial  issues including the interpretations the media gave to the  statement he made on corruption. State House correspondent  Haruna Idriss has the details.    [Begin recording] [Idriss] The chief of general staff said  the constitutional conference is an avenue for all Nigerians to  come together and discuss the future of the nation. He said  government does not intend to tamper with resolutions of the  conference.    [Diya] We are prepared to subject ourselves to the will of  the people. The desire of the people must prevail because this  is a military regime and a military regime cannot say that it is  wiser than the body of men and women who will come and discuss  the problems of this country. You see, the only way I can  answer this question is to propose that the decision will be in  the interest of the people of this country, help its unity and  preserve the territorial integrity of this country. As long as  they are along these lines, the decisions of the conference will  be very, very much respected.    [Idriss] On the various groups which have issued ultimata to  government, Gen. Diya said government does not recognize such  groups but tolerates them as individuals in the spirit of  national reconciliation. Government, he said, is prepared to  listen to reasonable demand but will deal with any group  planning an insurrection against government. Gen. Diya also  spoke on the issue of June 12 which he said was a national issue.    [Diya] It's a national problem. It's a national issue. We  feel it's a national problem, and I think it will be wrong for  any individual with partisan interest or any group of people to  say it is their problem. It's a national problem. In fact, the  government itself is an offspring of June 12. If the election  itself had not been nullified, the government would not have  been in place.    [Idriss] The briefing which was attended by principal  officers of the general headquarters will now be a regular  affair. [end recording]</p>

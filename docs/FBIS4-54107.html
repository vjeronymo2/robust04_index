			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Mun Chong-su,  secretary-general of South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal  Party (DLP), held working-level talks with Li Shuzheng, head of  the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist  Party, to discuss promoting exchanges betweem the DLP and the  Communist Party.    The two parties, which began their exchanges when South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, agreed  to expand the exchanges to low-level party structures and grass  roots, including district chapters and young party members.    Mun, saying party chairman Kim Chong-pil hoped to visit  China  in November, discussed a detailed schedule with Li. He also  invited a senior Communist Party official to visit Seoul, DLP  officials said.    Mun and Li traded views on boosting cooperation to help  peace  take root in Northeast Asia and supported a further  strengthening of economic and overall relations between the two  governments.    After the meeting, Mun met with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at  Diaoyutai, the official guest house, and visited the Foreign  Ministry on Wednesday afternoon.    At the ministry, Mun is scheduled to be briefed by Tang  Jiaxuan, vice foreign minister for Asia, on the situation in  Northeast Asia and they will exchange views on pending major  issues between South Korea and China, including the North Korean  nuclear problem.</p>

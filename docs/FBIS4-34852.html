			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F> correspondent Ruben Pino; place and date not given; first  paragraph announcer-read introduction -- recorded]    [Text] The Association of Caribbean States, ACS, will be  formed in July. The new, regional, intergovernmental  organization will unite nations with highly diverse political  systems and socioeconomic development plans:    [Pino] Over 200 million people on 25 island nations, in  Central and South America, and in 12 Caribbean territories will  establish diverse ties through the ACS. Could this forum  eventually represent a convergence of kindred politics and serve  as the voice of the region on international events? If so, what  about Cuba's participation?    [Robaina] Any integrationist event inevitably can be  considered a forum for political convergence. In some measure,  today's economic integration requires assuming certain positions  and will intensify, above all, the Caribbean voice at important  international events. It is important for us to join the  Caribbean, the Caribbean to which we have always belonged and  from which they have wanted to pretend to tear us. Depending on  how well we get to know each other better and intensify efforts,  we will clearly be better prepared to exchange and unite views  and to have a stronger economic, political, and social voice.  It will be extremely important to present a much more  economically, politically, and socially united Caribbean at  forums like the United Nations. When I speak of politics, I do  not mean similar politics. Integration means that there is no  need for identical ideological schemes to join things. We are  being allowed to take united stands in the international arena.  This clearly establishes a new voice and opens a period for the  Caribbean that Cuba modestly asks to join, so that we can learn  and modestly contribute whatever we can.</p>

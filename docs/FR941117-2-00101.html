			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board requests comment on all aspects of this proposal, including the advisability of meeting the statutory requirements through the establishment of a committee; whether the process should be established by policy statement (as proposed here) or regulation; the types of disputes subject to the committee's jurisdiction; the composition of the committee's membership; and the procedural workings of the committee. Certain of these issues are discussed in greater detail below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Supervisory Disputes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the Act sets forth the material supervisory determinations subject to the review process. Included are determinations related to (1) examination ratings; (2) adequacy of loan loss reserves; and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to the credit union.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board understands the reference to ``examination'' rating to mean a credit union's CAMEL rating. CAMEL is a rating system that provides a numerical score, from 1 through 5 (with 1 being the highest score), in each of five key areas of a credit union's management and financial performance, as well as a composite score. The five rated areas_capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity_provide the basis for the CAMEL acronym.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted that CAMEL is intended and used mainly as an internal supervisory tool by NCUA, to assist the agency in determining how and where to devote its supervisory resources. It is not a public rating and it does not necessarily reflect the level of service a credit union provides to its members.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board proposes that only a credit union's composite CAMEL rating be appealable, but requests comment on whether the individual component ratings (capital, assets, management, earnings and liquidity) should also be subject to appeal. In either case, the Board proposes that only ratings of 4 and 5 be subject to appeal. Credit unions with CAMEL ratings of 4 and 5 are treated differently than those with ratings of 1, 2, or 3. They are generally under much closer supervision. They are often subject to letters of understanding and agreement. All new officials of credit unions with a 4 or 5 CAMEL rating are subject NCUA approval pursuant to Section 701.14 of the NCUA Regulations. The Board believes that credit unions subject to these special supervisory and regulatory procedures are the credit unions whose examination ratings should be subject to the appeal process. Comment is requested on whether additional composite ratings should be subject to the appeal process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board also requests comment on how it should define classified loans that are ``significant'' to the credit union. Should this be left to the discretion of the credit union? Should it be determined by the loan amount as a percentage of reserves? Or is some other definition more appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, with respect to disputes subject to review, the Board proposes to limit the review process to those three categories set forth in the Act and identified above. The Board requests comment, however, on any other specific disputes that should be subject to the committee's review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Timing of Committee Involvement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board proposes that the committee assume jurisdiction over a supervisory determination only when the credit union establishes that it has been unsuccessful in attempting to resolve the matter with the credit union's examiner and the appropriate regional office. The Board does not intend by this requirement to establish a series of regional reviews (e.g. Director of Supervision, to Associate Regional Director, to Regional Director), but only that the credit union demonstrate that an effort was made to resolve the matter with the regional office and an official stationed in the regional office has said no.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board believes that any earlier involvement by the committee would be disruptive of the established organizational structure of the NCUA and the relationships between credit unions and their regional offices. Also, in order to remain flexible and avoid unnecessary bureaucracy, the Board would prefer not to establish specific time frames for resolving issues at the regional level. The Board welcomes comment on these issues, however, and is committed to both preserving the regional chain of command and avoiding unnecessary delays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Committee Composition and Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The committee will be comprised of senior agency staff. The Board proposes that the committee be comprised of five regular members. The members of the committee will consist of the Executive Director, the General Counsel, the Director of the Office of Examination and Insurance, a specified Regional Director, and one additional senior or Board staff member. The regional member will be rotated on a periodic basis (proposed policy is to rotate every two years), and an alternate Regional Director will be named to consider matters arising in the regular member's region. The Executive Director will serve as the chairperson of the committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regular committee meetings will be scheduled four times a year. Special meetings may be called and regular meetings may be canceled based on the workload of the committee. Each committee member will have one vote, the chairperson will only vote in the case of a tie, and a quorum will be required to conduct business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All appeals will be submitted in writing. An appeal may be made by letter, addressed to the Chairman of the Supervisory Review Committee, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314&hyph;3428. The appeal need only include the name of the credit union, the determination being appealed, and the reasons for the appeal. Appellants will be encouraged, however, to provide as much detail and supporting documentation as possible, in order to expedite the appeal process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News research and commentary group] </F>   [Text] Again the Zionist regime has canceled a date, that  for the withdrawal of the occupying Zionist forces from the  autonomous Gaza-Jericho region, which was due to take place on  13 April. In the seven months since the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho Autonomy Accord between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv, this  is the third time that Israel has unilaterally trampled upon the  deadline agreed for withdrawal and postponed it in utter  disregard of Palestine and international public opinion.    Israel has implied that the pullout could take place in the  last days of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May] but the Palestinians,  even those participating in the compromising talks, do not trust  these deadlines. In practice, the Palestinian region has  witnessed more violence, clashes, arrests, and massacres of  Palestinians since the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Accord.    The face of the occupied territories has not changed as  regards peace and compromise and Zionist units continue in their  operations of pursuit and killing. Palestinian citizens still  suffer the throes of hunger, disease, arrests, and annihilation.  In this period, the usurped territories, especially the Gaza  Strip, have experienced the most prolonged economic and military  siege. These areas have been resealed for many consecutive  weeks.    But do not ignore that even if Israel has ostensibly agreed  to withdraw from the Gaza-Jericho region, in practice, it has  continued to renege on adhering to these agreements. Basically,  it has no intention of doing so. What will be implemented, if  it ever is, will be a mere reshuffling of arrangements and  deployment of the occupying forces in these regions. All that  will be achieved is the removal of the Zionist forces from the  streets in Gaza and Jericho and the deployment of Palestinian  forces. They will be stationed around the 19 Zionist  settlements in the region.    Although this will remove the Zionist forces from public  view, the change in the array of forces will fully reveal the  true military nature of the Zionist settlements. Despite the  Zionist regime's constant reneging or rearranging of its forces,  the series of 'Arafat's talks with this regime continues. Every  round results in a new retreat by the compromising Palestinians  and new concessions for the Zionist regime. What is interesting  is that in time, as the privileges given to the Zionist regime  increase, the hope of its withdrawal decreases.    'Arafat has gambled in this dangerous game and has staked  his  reputation and his political and military resources and has  closed every path of return for himself. This has resulted in  his forfeiting the support of the Palestinian nation and its  popular base. He is the main loser in this dangerous game,  which has no prospects.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bid For Midland: Institutional holders disappointed by bid level MIDLAND BANK's instit-utional shareholders yesterday expressed disappointment at the recommended offer by HSBC Holdings as it emerged that the Kuwait Investment Office had failed to reduce its 10.5 per cent holding to 3 per cent. The KIO is keen to secure cash upfront, at about 360p a share, for most of its Midland shareholding rather than wait to take the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's paper and cash offer, valuing Midland shares at 378p. However, it is thought that the KIO had failed to work up demand for its shares which it continues to hold. M&amp;G, which holds just under 6 per cent of the banks' shares, and Phillips and Drew Fund Managers, with about 4 per cent of the stock, expressed disappointment that the offer was not closer to the 400p which most shareholders had hoped for. Some of the smaller institutional shareholders, including the Prudential, Norwich Union, and Mercury Asset Management, are hoping that Lloyds may come in with a bigger offer. One senior fund manager said: 'The Hongkong bank is pricing this one on the nail. If Lloyds counter bid with a bigger offer it would almost certainly be accepted. Nor should anyone automatically assume that the offer will be accepted without a counter bid.' Some shareholders criticised the management of Midland for failing to drive a harder bargain. However, most institutional shareholders accepted that it would be highly unlikely for the offer to be rejected without a counter bid. It is almost without precedent for shareholders of one party which have agreed to be bought by another party to force them back to the negotiating table in order to secure a higher offer. Another fund manager said: 'Without a counter bid the odds are that this offer will be accepted, however reluctantly.' Midland's advisers remain confident that Lloyds' share price was likely to fall in the event of it launching a counter bid, making it harder for the bank to top its offer of 378p a share. City analysts were also disappointed by the terms of Hongkong Bank's offer for Midland yesterday. Mr John Aitken, banking analyst at County Nat West, said the value of the offer was between 20p and 30p too low. 'Midland has squandered a chance to deliver a much better deal for shareholders. Hongkong Bank is a forced buyer and there is a moral case for a higher offer be-cause interest has been shown by another party,' he said. Mr David Poutney at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said Hongkong Bank's offer was inadequate. 'Hongkong Bank is getting about 13 per cent of the UK banking market with only a slight premium to net asset value when Midland has good recovery prospects. 'Given the risks in the Far East, our clients wanted to see a bigger bid at around 400p,' he said. Analysts speculated that the lower-than-expected offer, and opposition to it from institutional shareholders, left the door open for another bidder to appear.</p>

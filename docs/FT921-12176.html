			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories plan to extend private prisons - Home Affairs THE Conservative election manifesto will commit the government to extending its programme of prison privatisation, Mrs Angela Rumbold, Home Office minister, said yesterday. Britain's first privately managed prison, the Wolds remand prison at Everthorpe, Humberside, is due to open in April, while a tender competition has been announced for Blakenhurst local prison near Redditch, Hereford and Worcester. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mrs Rumbold said: 'The difficulty with Wolds is that it was built by the prison service. The ideal is really to say to a firm we will give you the opportunity to develop this new prison and it is a contract to design, build and manage. 'That is always an infinitely better prospect because they don't have to take on some of the possible built-in inefficiencies of somebody else's design.' The government had made no secret of the fact that if contracting-out tests were successful, 'we shall continue to go out to tender for as long as there are people willing to undertake this work'. Mrs Rumbold said while the new Criminal Justice Act gave ministers powers to extend privatisation to all except high security prisons they would proceed slowly. 'It may be that the whole venture at the end of the day is not a particularly successful idea, in which case I don't want to box myself in.' Mrs Rumbold, a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back Group, has expressed concern that private and public sectors might not fit together, and has said she did not want to provoke prison staff. Yesterday she admitted she remained cautious. 'I don't want to foist an idea on to the system without having sufficient caution to say that I am not going to go headlong down that route. I am going to take it step by step so that we can test it properly.'</p>

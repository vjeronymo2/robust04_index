			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 10 January, Keidanren [Federation of Economic  Organizations of Japan] held a meeting of the president and vice  presidents to discuss the economic framework talks held between  the governments of Japan and the United States. At the end of  the discussion, the meeting adopted a statement opposing  "macroeconomic numerical targets" designed to gauge the degree  of market opening by sector in goods and services. The  statement cites two reasons for opposing macroeconomic numerical  targets, saying: 1) The Japanese Government is not in a position  to meet such macroeconomic numerical targets; and 2) if Japan  agrees with the United States on setting numerical values or  anything like them, the United States will force Japan to meet  the numerical values in accordance with the trade act; and such  a trade arrangement could lead both Japan and the United States  to pursue managed trade. The statement also calls on the  governments to "deal constructively with trade issues between  the two countries."    With the Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for 11 February,  negotiations on such sectors as automobiles, auto parts,  insurance, and government procurement are in the final stage,  and Keidanren has compiled the statement in response to the  situation. The statement warns against setting numerical  targets by sector, claiming: "Intergovernmental negotiations  must be confined to sectors for which the governments of the two  nations are responsible and if the intergovernmental  negotiations go beyond those sectors, this will invite the  administration's intervention in the business activities of  private enterprises and run counter to deregulation." The  statement also points out that the European Union (EU) is  showing an interest in managed trade after learning about it  from Japan and the United States.    As an example of self-indulgence [hitoriaruki] in numerical  targets, the statement cites semiconductors and laments that  although the Japanese government is not supposed to commit  itself to the import ratio of foreign-manufactured goods, it has  done so and the commitment has forced Japanese enterprises to  "meet" the import ratio by quarter. As for the level of  Japanese market access for foreign goods, the United States,  which has thus far asked Japan for a specific numerical share,  is now asking for a level equivalent to that of European nations  and the United States. Commenting on the turnaround in the U.S.  trade demand, the statement refutes it, saying: "The  supply-demand structure varies from country to country and the  U.S. trade demand is unreasonable. The ratio of government  procurement in aircraft, farm produce, communications gears, and  medical instruments is higher in Japan than in European nations  and the United States."</p>

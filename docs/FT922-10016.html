			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (12): Good year for regulators - Financial markets THIS has been a good year for Hong Kong's beleaguered regulators. After three years of battling prominent vested interests and each other, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the Stock Exchange finally formed a common front and made moves to clean up and develop the local stock market. For a city with a history of laissez-faire, whereby the rich have been left alone to get richer, there has been a surprising amount of support for the regulators' successful moves to block unfair practices, such as the moves to take private the Evergo and Allied groups, this year. The Stock Exchange's policies of tightening up listings regulations and focusing on a broader more China-oriented market place, have also attracted praise. The main catalyst of this changed approach has been the reform of the Stock Exchange Council. This represented the sweeping away of the old club atmosphere at the Exchange and the introduction of a wider ruling body, without the vested interests that had been its former hallmark. The battle over the Exchange reforms was not easily resolved. Former Exchange deputy-chairman Mr Philip Wong is widely seen as being the catalyst for the SFC's victory. Mr Wong attempted to legalise preferential share allocations for Exchange council members last year. The move was to have been retrospective, because Mr Wong was anxious to clear his name, following evidence he had made use of this dubious perk during the reign of jailed former Exchange chairman Mr Ronald Li. Mr Wong's move was eventually blocked, but it stood out as a glaring example of how the council needed to be protected from control by vested interests. Since this bitter resolution, the relationship between the two regulators has become almost amicable. This has been partly due to some convenient timing, which has seen the resignation from the Stock Exchange of its chief executive Mr Francis Yuen, followed by the departure from the SFC of Mr Yuen's long-standing foe Mr Robert Owen, the founding chairman. Mr Yuen, the ambitious managing director of Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers, took up the helm of the Exchange at 36 and was the product of the free-wheeling Hong Kong corporate world. Mr Owen, by contrast, was a former British diplomat and director of Lloyds Merchant Bank, who headed an expatriate-oriented Watchdog. The two corporate cultures would not merge. But the successors to the two chief protagonists, Mr Paul Chow at the Stock Exchange and Mr Robert Nottle at the SFC, are both technocrats rather than politicians. They have succeeded in ushering in an era of co-operation and progress which few would have believed possible, even a year ago. 'We are low profile. We believe we are there to work, instead of creating public rows,' said Mr Chow. Mr Nottle said he considered the Commission to be in an evolutionary phase, as it passes its third anniversary on May 1. 'In this phase, we are shifting the focus from correcting the problems of the past, to meeting the challenges of the future.' He argued that to rebuild an appropriate framework a number of steps needed to be taken which 'were not popular with some of the Exchange members', but he said in moving forward, the SFC would be involved in projects where there was 'a commonality of interest'. 'In terms of the turf, the Exchanges and clearing houses recognise the role of the Commission as an oversight regulator and a direct regulator in certain areas,' said Mr Nottle. The Stock Exchange has taken over primary responsibility for listing matters, following more than two years of dual responsibility. With the management energy being transferred from politics to the two key areas of market development and minority shareholder protection, significant advances have been made. Investor protection has always been a concern. The tendency for Hong Kong companies to be managed and controlled by sizeable family shareholdings, with few wholly-independent directors to stand in the way of family interests, minority shareholders have been subjected to numerous corporate atrocities. One such, the Evergo privatisation of Chinese Estates, was described by the independent advisers to the minorities as 'wholly inadequate', but was voted through, in spite of vociferous opposition from minority shareholders. However, an aggressive campaign by the Stock Exchange and SFC led to the lodging of an affidavit with the Supreme Court of Bermuda voicing concerns about the vote. The offer was suddenly withdrawn.</p>

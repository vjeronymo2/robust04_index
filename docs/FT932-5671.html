			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Immigrant clampdown urged in EC EUROPEAN Community ministers responsible for immigration policy yesterday called on member states to clamp down on illegal immigration. But the ministers also passed a resolution laying down guidelines for admitting 'particularly vulnerable' refugees from former Yugoslavia. The ministers agreed that persons who had entered the Community illegally, including those who have had applications for asylum turned down, should be expelled unless there were compelling humanitarian reasons for allowing them to remain. The ministerial recommendation has no legal force and does not bring into being any new regulations, but it was seen as a call to member states to tighten up existing controls. The ministers failed yesterday to make any progress on the vexed issue of sharing the burden of refugees from the former Yugoslavia. Some countries, notably Germany, have accepted far more refugees than others, such as the UK, France and Ireland. But they called on member states to take 'suitable measures' for admittance of especially vulnerable refugees. These were defined as including persons from prisoner of war camps, injured and seriously ill people, those under direct physical threat, victims of sexual assault, and those who cannot return to homes in combat zones because of the conflict and the abuse of human rights.</p>

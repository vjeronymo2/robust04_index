			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Queen decrees pay by merit THE Queen is introducing performance-related pay for the whole of the royal household, it was confirmed yesterday. But some of the staff, who are relatively low-paid, are said to be angry at the move. Buckingham Palace said that the system would be introduced gradually for all the Queen's staff. Those most affected will be the 400 domestics employed as butlers, maids, footmen, gardeners and chefs. Pay levels at Buckingham Palace and other royal establishments remain low compared with wages outside royal households. Maids receive pre-tax earnings of about Pounds 6,000 a year, and footmen Pounds 7,000. Chefs earn Pounds 13,000 a year. Performance-related pay will replace the current pay system, which is based on annual increments. The palace said last night that nobody in the Queen's employment would receive less pay as a result of performance-related pay, and that some would receive more for exceptional service. The introduction of the system would come on top of annual cost-of-living increases. At present these rises are capped by the government's limit of 1.5 per cent for all public-sector employees, which is due to end in the autumn. The popularity of performance-related pay is spreading. The BBC is thought to be introducing a performance-related-pay scheme on top of the existing pay structure. Merit-pay schemes have been agreed in the past two months at a number of insurance companies. It has been suggested that many royal household staff will not benefit from a system which might encourage departmental heads at the palace to reward some staff at the expense of others. But a Buckingham Palace official said last night: 'I have not heard anybody complaining about it.' There is no suggestion that performance-related pay might be extended from the Queen's staff to the members of her own family.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ashgabat, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Premier Li Peng today met with around 600 leading Turkmens at  the presidential palace, where he made an off-hand speech on  China's friendly relations with Turkmenistan and other Central  Asian nations.    Li Peng praised the "wise and correct" policies of the  Turkmenistan Government in handling domestic affairs, developing  the economy and seeking friendly relations with foreign  countries, especially with its neighbors.    He also expressed an appreciation for Turkmenistan's policy  on nationalities and religion. Li said China is also a country  with many ethnic nationalities who treat each other equally,  live together harmoniously and seek common development.    Referring to talks held in the past two days, Li said the  two  nations share identical or similar views on many issues.    China is ready to expand friendly cooperation with  Turkmenistan in all fields, including the building of a modern  'Silk-Road' linking China and Central Asia by railways, he said.    "Such ties will also serve to enhance the contact between  Asia and Europe in general," he said, calling the `New  Silk-Road' "not only a broad way for economic cooperation, but  also a brilliant path towards friendship."    President S.A. Niyazov said the leaders of Turkmenistan and  China are determined to develop bilateral ties overall.    Addressing the leading Chinese entrepreneurs traveling with  Li Peng, Niyazov said "The door of Turkmenistan always remains  open for you and we would like to see expansion of cooperation  between the business circles of our two countries."    He added that the agreement signed on bilateral cooperation  during Li Peng's visit will serve to consolidate the basis for a  long-term cooperative relationship.</p>

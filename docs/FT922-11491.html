			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Russian government to raise oil prices sharply OIL prices in Russia are set to rise sharply in the middle of the year, pushing consumer prices up by 150 per cent, Mr Andrei Nechayev, economic minister, said yesterday. After a cabinet meeting in Moscow, he said the government would impose an effective ceiling of Rbs2,200 a tonne (with a floor of Rbs1,800), up from the present subsidised price of Rbs350 a tonne. Gas prices will also rise to Rbs1,100-1,600 per thousand cubic metres for all except domestic users, who will continue to pay the subsidised price of Rbs260. The rise of energy prices, the largest price subsidy left on the budget, is seen by the International Monetary Fund as an essential step towards currency stability. The cabinet was given budget deficit estimates for the first quarter of this year of Rbs24.3bn and Rbs205bn for the second quarter. The latter does not take into account the impact of flows into the country of expected financial aid. Mr Alexei Ulyukayev, an economic adviser to the government, said inflation was likely to come down to 15-20 per cent a month, from a current estimate of 30-40 per cent. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, flies to Washington this weekend for the meeting of the IMF and the World Bank.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in  Japanese at 0028 GMT on 27 February in its weekly 75-minute  "Discussion" program, which begins at 0000 GMT, carries a  25-minute live interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], on current political  issues, including the cabinet reshuffle and political reform.  The interview is conducted by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto  and Tsukuba University Professor Ikuo Kawashima.    Asked to give his view on why Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa wants to reshuffle the cabinet, Murayama says he does  not know the prime minister's true intention. Murayama notes he  is against the idea of a cabinet reshuffle, saying the coalition  government has many other important things to do now. He adds:  "The prime minister never personally told me he would reshuffle  the cabinet." Asked what he thinks of the view that the prime  minister has a vested right to reshuffle his cabinet whenever he  deems it necessary, Murayama says: "Legally speaking, it is  indeed a vested right of the prime minister. According to  political practice in the past, however, even when the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] was in power, prime ministers consulted  with faction leaders before deciding on cabinet reshuffles. I  think this is not a matter which the price minister should  decide by dint of his vested right only. Besides, what we have  now is a coalition government. I think it is a matter of course  for the prime minister to have thorough discussions with other  coalition party leaders and to seek a consensus, while  maintaining harmony among the coalition parties."    Yamamoto asks Murayama if the SDPJ will ask cabinet  ministers  from its party to resign should the prime minister decide to  reshuffle the cabinet. Murayama replies: "No, I do not think  it will be necessary. I am sure we can talk." Asked if Prime  Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, although there is discord between them, can remain as  a team and smoothly steer the political situation, Murayama  says: "I think stories on the discord are exaggerated. The  coalition government was formed with Sakigake as an integral  part." He also says: "I think it is natural that the prime  minister and the chief cabinet secretary sometimes have slightly  different opinions. The coalition administration will not last  long if we have to do everything as the prime minister says. I  think the chief cabinet secretary is responsible for keeping the  coalition intact. He has done well in the job of giving  consideration to other parties. I am sure the issue can be  settled if the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary  have heart-to-heart discussions. Therefore, I am not taking the  issue so seriously."    Noting there are reports that Hosokawa has asked Murayama to  join the cabinet, Yamamoto asks if he would accept such an  offer. Murayama replies: "Judging from the SDPJ's  circumstances, it is not easy for me to accept such an offer."    At 0041 GMT, the topic turns to the question of general  political matters. Asked how the SDPJ will face elections under  the single- seat electoral system, Murayama says: "We no longer  can do in the same manner as we did before under the medium-size  electoral system. Therefore, we will cooperate with other  coalition parties as much as possible in areas where we can  cooperate." He adds: "We have to do our best to prevent the  LDP from regaining power." Kawashima then points out that the  LDP may regain power if the SDPJ fails to cooperate with other  coalition parties in elections. Murayama says he understands it  very well and says: "We need to be flexible in dealing with the  situation. As I said earlier, it is impossible for the SDPJ to  win elections single-handedly."</p>

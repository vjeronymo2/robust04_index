			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN ARSON IS IDENTIFIED;  </P> <P> MARCH 2 FIRE DAMAGED STATE S&amp;L OFFICES  </P> <P> Arson investigators have identified a suspect in a mysterious fire that damaged  the state Department of Savings &amp; Loan office in a Wilshire District  building last March and forced the relocation of hundreds of state employees, a  state fire official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The fire broke out March 2 sometime before 3:30 a.m. on the 15th floor of the  19-story CNA building at 600 S. Commonwealth Ave. Fire officials later said the  blaze was the work of an arsonist but until now had not reported having singled  out a suspect.  </P> <P> No arrests have been made but fire officials said they hope to file a complaint  with the district attorney's office within two weeks.  </P> <P> "In our minds, we know who lit the fire," said E. R. Scott Baker, criminal  investigator for the state fire marshal's arson and bomb investigation unit.  </P> <P> Baker would not elaborate further on motives but added that possible suspects,  such as disgruntled employees, have been interviewed and discounted. The  investigation, he said, has focused on one individual who had regular access to  the building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a State Employee  </P> <P> "The person frequents the building and is in and out often. The suspect is  knowledgeable and has access. We aren't talking breaking and entering. We are  talking use of keys to get in doors."  </P> <P> Baker added that the suspect is not a state employee.  </P> <P> Baker said the fire was deliberately set at a desk outside a computer workroom.  The building, which is outfitted with an alarm system and is guarded, was  locked at the time, he said.  </P> <P> A security guard reported the fire, Baker said.  </P> <P> About 500 employees from six state agencies were forced to find other office  space after the fire, which damaged two offices, the S&amp;L facility and the  state Banking Department. Some smoke and water damage was reported elsewhere.  </P> <P> The fire started in a crucial section of the S&amp;L agency where state thrift  regulators analyze the data they develop from their examinations of  state-chartered S&amp;Ls. But officials downplayed the seriousness of any loss.  </P> <P> William Davis, chief deputy commissioner in the S&amp;L agency, said the fire  destroyed documents from about 20 S&amp;Ls, including at least one that was  seized by federal regulators and is being sued by bondholders for fraud. That  has given rise to speculation that the fire might have been connected to probes  into alleged illegal activity by S&amp;L companies.  </P> <P> But both Davis and Baker said they did not believe that the suspect's motive  was related to an S&amp;L probe.  </P> <P> Davis said his office was still piecing together the amount and type of records  that were destroyed in the fire. He said he believed that most of the documents  that were damaged were duplicates and could be replaced.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fared Fairly Well'  </P> <P> "It (the fire) caused us some problems in lost time in some examinations but,  all in all, we fared fairly well," Davis said.  </P> <P> Davis said employees had updated their computer files the night before the  fire, thus saving a lot of information that might have been lost in the fire.  </P> <P> The state had been leasing offices on nine floors of the CNA building for  several agencies and for the governor. However, the lease had run out for all  the agencies except the S&amp;L, according to Anne Garbeff, spokeswoman for the  state Department of General Services.  </P> <P> Employees from the six agencies -- S&amp;L, banking, corporations, insurance,  commerce and emergency services -- have been working in temporary quarters  since the fire but have begun to lease new office space.  </P> <P> Airborne asbestos fibers were detected after the fire, but a sampling by  CAL/OSHA found the level to be "within acceptable limits," spokesman Richard  Stephens said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer James S. Granelli contributed to this story  </P></p>

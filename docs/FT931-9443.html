			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: BT shares reminder - At a Glance Holders of British Telecom shares will have received notice this week that the final instalment on their part-paid stock is due by March 2. To keep the shares, the final instalment of 105p per share must be paid; those who hold the instalment discount need only pay 90p. BT advises those paying by cheque to ensure the registrars receive this by February 25 so that funds are cleared by the due date. Alternatively, the part-paid shares can be sold using the Number 5 certificates before February 19. If no action is taken, the shares will be lost with the investor receiving no more than 230p per share in compensation. The BT Call helpline is on 0903-503733.</p>

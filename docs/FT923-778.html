			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions DIRECTORS have continued to show faith in the medium term future of their companies, with further buying in the week of currency turmoil. Not only does the market's sharp rally vindicate the heavy buying seen in recent months, but it also leaves scope for the emergence of frustrated would-be sellers over the short term. John Murray, a non-executive director of Southern Business Group, a photocopier supplier, has sold more than 1m shares at 79p - down sharply from the 94p level at which Paul Roberjot disposed of 150,000 shares at the end of July. The company's year-end is September. The insurance broking sector has had a miserable 1992 after a relatively buoyant 1991. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the share price of Bradstock Group. Directors sold heavily in April, June and September last year at prices around 150-165p. During the summer, though, the shares collapsed, hitting a low point of 83p. Now, with the price rallying, directors have taken the opportunity to offload a further 225,000 at around Pounds 1 apiece. Shares in Shandwick, the public relations company headed by Peter Gummer, have surged lately, albeit from a very low base. Further purchases by Gummer and Lord Chalfont bring the total bought during the past two weeks to just over 5m. The most recent deals were made at 5p against a present price of about 15p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           No of Company                    Sector    Shares    Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Bradstock                  InsB     225,000      229       2 BTR                        OthI      45,000      203       2* EIS Group                  EngG       6,685       24       1 Hanson                     Cong     104,666      234       1* Life Sciences Intl         Hlth     100,000      128       1 Scantronic                 Elec     100,000       43       1 Serco                      BuSe      30,000      172       1 Southern Business          Misc   1,005,000      794       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Blue Circle                BdMa      20,000       27       2 British Dredging           BdMa      30,000       21       1 Burton                     Stor      60,000       20       2 Flextech                   Med       20,000       10       1 Gartmore Emerg Pac         InTr      25,000       12       1 Helical Bar                Prop      50,000       40       1 Hillsdown                  FdMa     270,000      216       2 Lionheart                  Misc     100,000       11       1 Mid-Wynd                   InTr       7,000       15       1 MTM                        Chem     395,500      115       8 Parkland Text Ord          Text      42,170       57       2 Ransomes                   EngG      85,500       11       5 Royal Bank of Scot         Bank      10,000       15       1 Scantronic                 Elec      25,000       11       1 Shaftesbury                Prop     100,000       43       1 Shandwick                  Med    1,190,000       57       2 Southend Property          Prop      50,000       20       1 Sphere IT                  InTr     100,000       12       1 St Modwen                  Prop      90,000       11       1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

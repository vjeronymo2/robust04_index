			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Xiangwei] </F>   [Text] In a further indication of China's continuing  efforts to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), it is now considering some adjustments to the special  privileges meted out to foreign investors in the country. Ma  Xiuhong, a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign  Trade &amp; Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said yesterday that  the  ministry was examining how to modify the preferential treatment  to meet the requirements of GATT and its successor the World  Trade Organization (WTO).    "Apparently, some of the preferential policies go against  the  GATT rules and should be modified appropriately. However, there  will be some phase-out periods, as shown by current GATT  members, which could still give preferential treatment to  foreign investors," Ma, the deputy director-general of the  ministry's foreign investment administration, said.    China hopes to join GATT this year before it is replaced by  the WTO.    Foreign investors who operate in China enjoy lower customs  tariffs, more tax incentives, and longer tax holidays than the  domestic enterprises, among other forms of preferential  treatment. The situation is further complicated by the fact that  foreign-funded ventures in the Special Economic Zones and  Economic Development Zones enjoy even better treatment.    Meanwhile, Ma said that she was confident that China would  get the renewal of the most favoured nation [MFN] trading status  from the U.S. "I believe that the Sino-U.S. business  relationship will continue but there will still be quarrels in  the future."    The U.S. President, Bill Clinton, must decide before June 3  whether MFN status, which gives China the lowest tariffs for its  goods, should be extended.    To illustrate growing confidence, Ma announced that China  would hold a large-scale trade and investment conference that  starts next Monday in Hong Kong, the largest of its kind to be  held in the territory. The conference, which lasts four days,  is jointly organised by the ministry and the Hong Kong Trade  Development Council. A team of 160 trade officials from four  Chinese ministries and 24 provinces and cities will seek foreign  investment on 800 projects involved in industries from  transportation to electronics. The Hong Kong conference comes  after China staged a similar large-scale conference in the  United States last month to drum up support from U.S. businesses  for the renewal of MFN.    During the conference, senior officials from the nine  ministries--including MOFTEC, the Ministry of Finance, the  People's Bank of China, and China Securities Regulatory  Commission -- will make presentations.    China has become the favoured destination for foreign  investors. Last year it approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects,  with the contract value of foreign investment at U.S.$110.85  billion (about HK$864.64bn) and a total amount of U.S.$25.76  billion actually invested.</p>

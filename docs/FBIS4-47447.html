A Cardio 80 computer (Contron) was used to  analyze the neurons' activity and to plot poststimulation  histograms. The rats' somatic afferent nerves were stimulated by  measured squeezing of the skin on the foot of their rear  extremity. Their pelvic afferent nerves were stimulated by  blowing into a thin-walled envelope that had been inserted into  their rectums and into the distal sections of their sigmoid  colons. Both types of stimulation were accomplished by devices  permitting digital control of the duration and intensity of  stimulation. During the experiments the rats were anesthetized  with chloralose, immobilized with Flaxedil, and kept warm (their  esophageal temperature was kept at 37C, and the  pCO[.sub]2[/] of their expired air was maintained at 3.5-4  volume percent). When a rat's arterial pressure dropped below  80/50 mm Hg, the experiment was halted. The following drugs were  administered to the rats: morphine (10[.sup]-6[/] to  10[.sup]-5[/] M), DAGO [expansion not given] (5 x  10[.sup]-7[/] to 10[.sup]-6[/] M), D-Pen[.sup]2[/]- and  D-Pen[.sup]5[/]-enkephaline (10[.sup]-6[/] to  10[.sup]-5[/] M), dalargin (10[.sup]-6[/] to  10[.sup]-5[/] M), U-50488H (10[.sup]-4[/] M),  dynorphine[.sub]1-17[/] (10[.sup]-4[/] M), and naloxone.  The -opiate receptor agonists morphine and DAGO and the  -opiate receptors D-Pen[.sup]2[/]- and  D-Pen[.sup]5[/]-enkephaline and dalargin suppressed the  bioelectric activity of the convergent neurons of the dorsal  horns of the rats' spines. The suppressive effects of all of the  drugs were found to be concentration dependent and sensitive to  naloxone. When the aforesaid drugs were locally applied to the  spine, they suppressed reactions to somatic nociceptive  stimulation more strongly than they suppressed reactions to  visceral stimulation. When injected intravenously, morphine had  an identical effect on suppression of both types of stimulation.  Ligands of the _ch_-opiate receptors U-50488H and  dynorphine[.sub]1-17[/] were not found to have any  statistically significant effect on the bioelectric activity of  the convergent neurons of the rear horn of the spine.

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Jerry Lewis Angered: Jerry Lewis has lashed out at a National Enquirer report  that he will play a diminished role in the Muscular Dystrophy Telethon he has  headed for 40 years.  </P> <P> "I mean, come on, if you're gonna lie, at least make up something that has some  meat to it," Lewis said. The paper reported that Lewis went "berserk" when  informed that he had been stripped of his production duties and would be  primarily the telethon's emcee. The story said the move was made in a January  MDA board meeting because telethon ratings were slipping and contributions were  not as high as expected. Lewis and MDA officials denied the claims.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 7 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) will convene a regular Board of Governors'  meeting Tuesday [7 June] for the second consecutive day to  continue discussion of the North Korean nuclear issue.    Nuclear safeguards measures, the key point of the issue,  will  come under intensive discussion by the board members following a  separate report by IAEA Director-General Hans Blix.    Major board members such as the United States, Japan,  Australia, Canada, France and Russia are likely to hold a  separate meeting Tuesday morning to reaffirm their joint stance  on pushing for the board's adoption of a resolution.    But the issue will probably take a clearer shape at the next  meeting slated for Thursday or Friday, when the member countries  adjust their positions after observing developments in the  United Nations Security Council and North Korea.    The board's discussion will be based on Blix's report  pointing out that North Korea's unsupervised refueling of its  5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon and the damage to later  measurement of the discharged fuel rods is a grave violation of  the nuclear safeguards agreement. The board members are likely  to urge North Korea to accept additional IAEA surveillance of  two undeclared sites suspected of being nuclear waste dumps in  Yongbyon.    Blix is expected to report that the IAEA cannot ascertain  how  much plutonium North Korea possesses because of its unsupervised  replacement of fuel rods in the reactor and, consequently, is  unable to accomplish its purpose of ensuring nuclear safeguards.    Blix's report, which has been obtained beforehand,  emphasized  that North Korean cooperation would allow the IAEA to secure  lost information, pointing out that inspection of the undeclared  nuclear facilities at Yongbyon was vital.    In light of some board members' feeling that the IAEA's  strong position on North Korea should be addressed, some form of  resolution will likely be brought up at the meeting Tuesday  afternoon or Wednesday morning.</p>

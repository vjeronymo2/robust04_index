			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Faysal al-Shubul] </F>   [Text] Amman -- Forty Jordanian House of Representatives  members have decided to resort to a new method in opposing Dr.  'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali's government in spite of the latter's  attempt to overhaul his government by appointing 18 new  ministers, 10 of whom are House members.    The new method is to directly address King Husayn as the  head  of the three branches of power and explain the legislative  branch's stand without resorting to the option of a vote of  confidence which will, undoubtedly, lead to a constitutional  crisis in the country that may topple not only the government  but the House as well.    Engineer 'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, a former minister and a  centrist deputy, told AL-WASAT: We will act more responsibly  than the prime minister. He was referring to the relationship  between the government and the House of Representatives, most of  whose members feel that al-Majali has been ignoring the House  since he formed his government in May 1993, and that he has not  succeeded in changing his approach in spite of the three  government reshuffles he has carried out.    Tasked by 40 House members, nine deputies, including  Abu-al-Raghib, are drafting a letter, the first of its kind in  the constitutional history of Jordan, that they will address to  the Jordanian monarch.    Abu-al-Raghib described the letter as worthy both in form  and  content and revolves around three basic elements:    The first emphasizes that the deputies do not want either to  hold another extraordinary session or submit a vote of  no-confidence in the government; meaning that they do not seek  to topple the government through parliament.    The second element stresses that the deputies are aware that  the exacerbation of the crisis will have a negative impact not  only on the domestic level but also on the level of Jordan's  foreign relations and its tackling of various issues, including  the peace process.    The third element outlines the deputies understanding of how  institutional relationships should be and how this calls for  normal relations between the executive and legislative branches  with an emphasis that the deputies have grasped the requirements  of the current stage which is governed by the peace negotiations  on the one hand and the economic pressures on the other.    In the prime minister's third reshuffle, two out of the 18  new ministers drew attention for agreeing to join the  government. The first is Dhuqan al-Hindawi, who has been  appointed minister and deputy prime minister in many previous  governments over the past 30 years, and who repeatedly refused  to join al-Majali's government. The second is 'Abd-al-Ra'uf  al-Rawabidah, who not only voted against the al-Majali  government, but has been one of its most prominent opposers, and  has mobilized many deputies against it.    Al-Hindawi and al-Rawabidah would not have accepted to join  the government without the intervention of King Husayn and Crown  Prince Hasan to convince them of the importance of their  participation to face the challenges of the current stage with a  strong government.    The reshuffle was made in accordance with an idea that  al-Majali be devoted to administer the negotiations, in which  representation will not only be upgraded to the level of prime  minister and foreign minister (al-Majali is foreign minister in  addition to his post as prime minister) but will be shifted to  the region as Prince Hasan announced.    According to Jordanian officials, the Gulf of Aqaba, where  al- 'Aqabah and Ilat cities are situated close to each other,  will be the arena of the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on  border demarcation and sovereignty that will start next July.    Al-Hindawi's condition for accepting to join the government  was that the government should include House of Representatives  members, which was something opposed by al-Majali when he formed  the government, so his government did not enjoy much  parliamentary support.    But the admission of 10 House of Representatives members  into  the government did not increase its supporters because of  al-Majali method in selecting these members. Instead of  consulting with the parliamentary blocs for their  representatives to join the government, he chose 10 deputies  through personal contacts. Furthermore, he tried without success  to convince a Muslim Brotherhood deputy, who is 'Abd-al-Karim  'Ukur, to join the government.    One day after the government reshuffle was announced, the  deputies were furious, including the deputies of the bloc led by  the prime minister's brother Engineer 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali.  Forty-one deputies, out of 80, met and announced their  opposition to the method in which the government was reshuffled.    It was decided to prorogue the parliament's extraordinary  session as of 16 June, hence the parliament went into its summer  break. But the Jordanian Constitution allows the majority to  call for another extraordinary session to discuss specific  issues.    Hence, the deputies resorted to a new method in opposing the  government which advocates the principle of "keeping both the  wolf and the sheep alive" as said one of the nine deputies who  are preparing the message to the king.    Therefore, al-Majali's government is finding itself once  again facing opposition. While it may be true that the  opposition does not seek to topple the government, it will keep  it under close scrutiny and mobilize public opinion against it.</p>

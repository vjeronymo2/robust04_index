			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Health row sparks further cabinet infighting POLITICAL infighting in Mr John Major's cabinet over issues ranging from the future of the coal industry to reform of the police has been fuelled by a new row over the health service. The latest dispute, which has brought to a head long-simmering disagreements over the role of regional health authorities, means there are now more than half-a-dozen unresolved arguments in the highest ranks of the government. The rows have fuelled an atmosphere of intrigue around the cabinet table, with senior ministers accusing each other of making pre-emptive strikes through press leaks. Mr Major has publicly characterised the differences as healthy debate. He has also sought to stamp out charges from the rightwing of the Tory party that the debate over subsidies for the coal industry represents a crucial test of his government's free-market credentials. In the prime minister's view it is question of pragmatism rather than principle - some subsidy for the industry is essential to avoid a renewed Tory rebellion which might overturn the government's 21-seat Commons majority. Senior Downing Street aides have been seeking to identify the sources of the leaks. Initial suspicion over the coal leak has fallen on Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary. The fury of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, at the persistent attacks on his plans is mirrored by the irritation of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, at ministerial briefings against his plans for the police. Several cabinet ministers - including Mr Howard; Mr William Waldegrave, the public-service minister; and Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary - have attacked Mr Clarke's proposal to deprive local authorities of their role in police authorities. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary and Mr Clarke's predecessor at the Home Office, has written to the prime minister to register his objections. The latest dispute over the health service - quite separate from the wrangling over implementation of the Tomlinson report on London's hospitals  -has pitted Mr Clarke and Mr Waldegrave against Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary. After an acrimonious meeting of the relevant cabinet committee the two former health ministers have forced Mrs Bottomley to rethink plans to give regional health authorities a significant role in the supervision of NHS trust hospitals. Mr Hurd has emerged as Mr Waldegrave's sole ally in his attempts to secure firm commitments from cabinet colleagues to reduce Whitehall secrecy as he prepares a white paper on open government. One colleague has described Mr Waldegrave as a 'persistent nuisance' but Mr Major is promising him his personal backing. In a separate dispute over how the government should respond to the prospect of the jobless total topping 3m, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is resisting proposals by Mrs Shephard for an expensive package to guarantee work for the long-term unemployed. Other internal battles include that between Mr Malcolm Rikind, the defence secretary, and Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, over the future of the Rosyth and Devonport naval dockyards. Mr Major's trip to India will ensure that the disputes simmer at least for the rest of this week, but Downing Street is promising a clutch of decisions early next month. Senior officials are making the best of the public airing of internal debates by claiming it gives the lie to criticism that the government is not confronting difficult decisions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic and UN Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi today met  in Pale to discuss how to prevent an outbreak of violence in  another hot spot in Bosnia -- Brcko.    Karadzic said that he had proposed a ceasefire between Serbs  and Muslims in the area, and the deployment of an Unprofor force  there. He also claimed that the Serbs would arrange a unilateral  ceasefire if the Muslims would not agree to one.    While saying that the meeting had been helpful in promoting  the peace process, Akashi would only promise more UN military  observers for Brcko.    Brcko is a key strategic town bordering Serbia, the Serb-  controlled area of Bosnia and the Serb-controlled part of  Croatia.    The Bosnian Muslim government is reportedly preparing to  launch a "war of liberation" in the area.    The Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, while inspecting  the  Muslim military front line near Brcko yesterday, said that the  Muslims were ready for a decisive battle with the Serbs there.    Serb sources claim that the United States has promised to  "take tough action" against the Serbs once the Muslim attack  begins.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANK APOLOGIZES TO BACKERS IN LETTER  </P> <P> Rep. Barney Frank, in a written apology mailed to supporters Friday, said that  "tremendous internal pressures" had led him to a relationship with a male  prostitute.  </P> <P> He promised that his "judgment has improved."  </P> <P> "What I did was wrong," the Massachusetts Democrat said in the letter mailed to  home-state supporters and campaign volunteers.  </P> <P> "It did not affect my public decisions or any public business. But I regret  that some of my past personal actions are troubling to people who placed their  confidence in me."  </P> <P> The letter was not mailed at government expense, a Frank aide said Friday.  </P> <P> It was sent at the end of a week in which the five-term liberal congressman and  his top political advisers moved to quell growing speculation that he would  resign rather than await a House Ethics Committee inquiry into his relationship  with Stephen L. Gobie.  </P> <P> Frank was reelected in 1988 after disclosing the year before that he is  homosexual.  </P> <P> Gobie alleges that he operated a prostitution ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill  apartment.  </P> <P> Frank has acknowledged paying Gobie for sex, then hiring him as a personal  assistant and driver in an effort to change Gobie's life. Frank says he fired  Gobie when he began to suspect the prostitution operation.  </P></p>

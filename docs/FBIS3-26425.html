Koo made the remarks at a meeting of an Economics  Ministry-sponsored task force that is studying ways to decrease  the deficit with Japan.    Koo said the time for using tax exemptions to stimulate  investment is over, and that Taiwan must now establish  independence in high technology in order to get the economy in  gear.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said at the  meeting that the deficit with Japan can be cut by an industrial  structure upgrade and by domestic manufacturers producing higher  quality products in order to tempt Japanese buyers.    Hsu said, however, that domestic manufacturers must get over  their mindset that Taiwan's industries are too weak and reliant  on Japanese imports of key components and machinery. Until this  happens, he said, the trade deficit with Japan will continue.</p>

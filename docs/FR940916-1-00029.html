Engelhard Corporation has applied for certification of equipment applicable to both 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines used in urban buses for all model years up to and including 1993. The application states that the candidate equipment provides a 25 percent or greater reduction in emissions of particulate matter (PM) for petroleum fueled diesel engines relative to an original engine configuration with no after treatment devices installed. A 25 percent reduction is also claimed for engines that have been retrofit/rebuilt with certified new rebuild kits that do not include after treatment devices. The application states that this equipment will be offered to all parties for $2,000 or less (in 1992 dollars). The application would apply to all urban bus operators nationwide that are subject to the urban bus rebuild/retrofit program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The date of this notice initiates a 45 day period during which EPA will accept written comments relevant to the potential certification of the equipment included in this application.

Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> On April 21, 1993, EPA published final Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses (58 FR 21359). The retrofit/rebuild program is intended to reduce the ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) in urban areas and is limited to 1993 and earlier model year (MY) urban buses operating in metropolitan areas with 1980 populations of 750,000 or more, whose engines are rebuilt or replaced after January 1, 1995. Operators of the affected buses are required to choose between two compliance options: Option 1 sets particulate matter emissions requirements for each urban bus engine in an operator's fleet which is rebuilt or replaced; Option 2 is a fleet averaging program that sets out a specific annual target level for average PM emissions from urban buses in an operator's fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A key aspect of the program is the certification of retrofit/rebuild equipment. To meet either of the two compliance options, operators of the affected buses must use equipment which has been certified by EPA. Emissions requirements under either of the two options depend on the availability of retrofit/rebuild equipment certified for each engine model. To be used for Option 1, equipment must be certified as meeting a 0.10 g/bhp&hyph;hr PM standard or as achieving a 25 percent reduction in PM. Equipment used for Option 2 must be certified as providing some level of PM reduction that would in turn be claimed by urban bus operators when calculating their average fleet PM levels attained under the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Option 1, additional information regarding cost must be submitted in the application for certification, in order for certification of that equipment to initiate (or trigger) program requirements for a particular engine model. In order for the equipment to serve as a trigger, the certifier must guarantee that the equipment will be offered to affected operators for $7,940 or less at the 0.10 g/bhp&hyph;hr PM level, or for $2,000 or less for the 25 percent or greater reduction in PM. Both of the above amounts are based on 1992 dollars and include life cycle costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

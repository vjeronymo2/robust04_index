			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Top athletes compete for medals and sponsorship gold: Following victory at the World Championships, Christie, Gunnell and Jackson look set to break earnings records BRITISH ATHLETICS goes into its end-of-season meeting at Sheffield tomorrow trying to work out how to build on the successes of last week's World Championships in Stuttgart. There Linford Christie won the 100m in the second-fastest time ever and Colin Jackson, in the 110m hurdles, and Sally Gunnell in the 400m hurdles, both broke world records. The plan being considered by the British Athletics Federation is to put Britain's top 50 to 75 athletes under contract. The idea is that British athletes will commit themselves to supporting federation events and in return will receive some guaranteed income, medical screening and medical insurance. Mr David Bedford, honorary secretary of the BAF, said that the principle had been agreed for some time and now the federation was discussing the practicalities of the scheme. Britain's world champions are in demand at all the big grand prix meetings around Europe. But for many British athletes the eight or nine domestic televised meetings a year controlled by the federation represent the largest chunk of their incomes. The federation scheme is regarded with scepticism in some quarters. Fatima Whitbread, the former javelin world champion and world record holder, said: 'I don't know where they are going to get the money from. All the athletes had a good laugh. Athletes are individuals, most do not want to be tied down.' She said athletes wanted to be able to tinker with their competition schedules throughout the season to make sure they peaked for the big events, such as the World Championships and the Olympics. These events do not pay appearance money, but provide the prestige which increases earnings. Whitbread is president of a promotional club, the Chafford Hundred, which she founded with Christie and Jackson to promote athletes. British athletes who wear the logo of Lucozade, the soft drink, are part of the club's multi-year deal with SmithKline Beecham which Whitbread says is worth Pounds 1m. So what is the earnings potential of the UK's top track and field stars? Christie earns far more than any other British athlete. His earnings leapt after he won the 100m in the Barcelona Olympics last year and he can expect another spurt in his income after his win in Stuttgart. Even so he is still behind Britain's top soccer players and a long way below the world's best-paid boxers, golfers and tennis and basketball players. Gunnell is the next highest-paid British athlete and Jackson should reach her level after finally winning a big championship. Below them is a small group of well-paid runners, but the rest of the British team, even some who reached finals in Stuttgart, are struggling to get by. Gunnell has complained about the disparity between her race fees and Christie's, arguing that she is a world record holder while Christie is not. One newspaper estimated that the British men's 100m relay team of Christie, Jackson and two individual silver medallists, Tony Jarrett and John Regis, which finished second to the US in Stuttgart, is worth Pounds 2.2m while the women's 400m team, which Gunnell anchored to a bronze medal, is worth Pounds 880,000. One leading promoter said: 'The only one of those who earns anything other than a living wage is Sally and I would be flabbergasted if she earnt that much (close to Pounds 800,000).' Athletes' incomes come chiefly from fees and prize money for races, and sponsorship and endorsement deals. The biggest sponsors are sportswear companies. Christie has a long association with Puma, the German sportswear manufacturer. Gunnell has a contract with Mizuno, the Japanese company. But even athletes of this stature are not secure. Last year Jackson, who is now with Puma, was dropped by Puma's great German rival, Adidas. Paul Magner, sport manager (running) for Adidas UK, said the company decided to concentrate on road running and training shoes because, while sprinters such as Jackson offer marketing spin-offs, the market for running spikes is small. The jewel in Adidas's crown is an athlete who no longer competes: the former decathlon Olympic champion Daley Thompson. Thompson is now a television pundit. 'We got excellent coverage from Daley appearing on the BBC in branded clothing,' said Mr Magner. Among competing athletes the next level is represented by young runners with potential such as Curtis Robb, 21, who finished fourth in the 800m in Stuttgart. After Robb reached the Olympic final last summer he was, said one observer, the subject of a 'bidding war'. He ended up with a contract worth Pounds 20,000 a year for four years from Nike. Mr Simon Taylor of Nike UK said Robb was also part of Nike's global bonus structure which rewards performances in everything from national championships to Olympic Games. The real problem is that athletics is a poor draw in the US, the world's biggest market. Athletics earnings pale alongside Nike's contracts with tennis player Andre Agassi and basketball stars Michael Jordan and Alonzo Mourning. Jordan's contract is worth an estimated Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.5m), while Mourning's is put at Dollars 16m for five years. The runners therefore still have a long way to go. But, as Whitbread said: 'It does not matter how many gold medals you win, there is only so much money in the pot.' Linford Christie, Olympic and world 100 metres champion, is paid about Pounds 30,000 per race - a little more for some big European grand prix events - and runs in up to 20 meetings a year. He and American Carl Lewis were recently paid Pounds 100,000 each to race at Gateshead. These are almost certainly the highest appearance fees ever paid to an athlete. Christie has a contract worth a basic Pounds 60,000 with footwear company Puma. Industry estimates suggest that, including bonuses, this contract will earn him more than Pounds 200,000 this year. He also has a Pounds 100,000-a-year contract with Lucozade and can command Pounds 5,000 for a personal appearance. These are limited by training, racing and commitments to leading sponsors. Sally Gunnell, Olympic and world 400 metres hurdles champion, has a contract with the Mizuno shoe company worth Pounds 220,000 over three years. Her race fee is Pounds 20,000 and personal appearance fee is Pounds 3,000. Colin Jackson's race fee is Pounds 10,000. But that will rise following his victory and world record in the 110 metres hurdles at the World Championships in Stuttgart. His personal appearance fee is Pounds 3,000.</p>

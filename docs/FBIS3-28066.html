Nevertheless, Luis Jalandoni of NDF  emphasized that the peace talks should not be limited by an  executive order. Jalandoni said that the Hague Declaration  should be the guide for the talks. As in the previous  statements, however, the government panel stressed that  Executive Order 125 issued by the government is in accordance  with the Constitution, which sets limits on any peace talks  undertaken by the government.</p>

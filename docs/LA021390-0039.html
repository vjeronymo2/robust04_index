			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GALLEGLY TO JOIN ELECTION WATCH IN NICARAGUA  </P> <P> Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a fervent critic of Nicaragua's Sandinista  government, has joined an international delegation that will observe the  embattled country's Feb. 25 elections.  </P> <P> Gallegly, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will be one of 12  members of Congress in a group that is going to Nicaragua under the auspices of  the Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government. Former President Jimmy  Carter heads the delegation chosen by the council, which is composed of former  heads of state, mostly from Western democracies.  </P> <P> "Despite the Sandinistas' past history, I am hopeful that with the attention of  the world focused on them, they will carry out their promises and let the  people of Nicaragua decide how they should be governed," Gallegly said in  announcing his role with the observer group.  </P> <P> Gallegly is one of several lawmakers recently added to the 30-member  delegation, which was initially selected months ago. The group's expansion  follows the Sandinistas' decision to deny visas to an official 20-member  congressional observer team appointed by President Bush because the  Administration contributed funds to the Nicaraguan opposition alliance.  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), who was appointed co-chairman of the  official congressional group, said Monday, "The White House was apparently  unable to get the Sandinistas to let us in so we've disbanded."  </P> <P> The election is a potential watershed for war-weary Nicaragua. Conservatives,  however, remain skeptical that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega will permit a  free and fair vote, particularly if there is a chance that the Sandinistas face  defeat.  </P> <P> The Carter mission is one of three observer groups that already have been  keeping tabs on the campaign through representatives in Nicaragua. The other  teams are sponsored by the Organization of American States and the United  Nations.  </P> <P> Gallegly, a two-term lawmaker, has visited Nicaragua twice since his election  in 1986. He will be in the Central American nation from Feb. 22 until Feb. 26,  spokesman John Frith said.  </P></p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / The Long View: Meeting the history man THE familiar tones of Steve the strategist came on the line this week. 'Just passing through,' he said. 'I thought I needed to get an update on the latest ERM tensions. Looks like the rest of the year could be all about currencies.' When we met, it turned out that Steve, as a leading global investment guru, was busy gathering material for the autumn conference season. He showed me his diary for September and October, and I decided airline and luxury hotel stocks should go on the buy list for a start. 'Client calls drop right away in August,' he said. 'Time for a bit of longer-term thinking or, at least, a bit of longer-term re-formatting.' This was a new phrase to me. I thought that format was a button on my computer that I didn't know how to use. Presumably, though, it was all part of the idea that presentation beats content any day. 'Why do journalists get so cynical?' complained Steve. 'Still, it's true enough that there are very few good new ideas - just a better supply of new ways to package old ones. Right now, the clients are into history. They want 1992 put into the context of the 1920s and the 1930s, or maybe even the 1890s if you want to be fancy. 'Personally, I think history is junk, certainly for predicting the stock market. But if the clients expect me to have mugged up on Keynes and Schumpeter and Galbraith, then at least I need to have skimmed through the executive summaries. And when the clients want everything formatted in terms of supercycles, they get it.' You can become cynical through talking to global strategists, I thought. Out loud, I said that the clients just might have something. The markets didn't seem to be following the rules or the trend lines that they had for 20 or 30 years. For instance - in the UK, at any rate - analytical devices like bond-equity yield ratios were outside their normal ranges, so strategists who called the market cheap when the ratio hit the normal 2.0 floor were looking exposed now it was down to under 1.8. 'Sure, I've looked at the UK numbers and the dividends are looking exposed,' Steve agreed. 'Dividends have stalled in the past year. But in the five years before then, they rose 90 per cent, or call it 40 per cent in real terms. But the British economy is now only 10 per cent bigger than it was in 1985, and might still be shrinking. Those are the relationships to look at.' Did he think it was worthwhile skimming through the history books to gain insights into this kind of problem? Surely it was fair enough to look at some longer-term data for a better perspective? 'Maybe,' said Steve, 'but you can't make money by doing in 1992 what you should have done in 1932. Look how the Wall Street crash of 1987 was misinterpreted. On the 1929 precedent, the Dow should have collapsed to about 350. Instead it's gone 10 times as high. To me, there's only one way of getting it right in any era and that's to look at what's cheap and what's expensive and feed off the market's illusions.' I said that the expensive junk often seemed to be the kind of stock peddled by his firm's new-issue salesmen. 'Sure,' he said, 'you have to sell into strength. The corporate clients have a surprisingly good feel for when their stock is overvalued. 'There is valuable feedback for me, too. Of course, I have to be careful what I say to clients. But look at what has happened in health care, which soared out of sight last year when investors were desperate for recession-proof earnings. New stock by the billion has poured out, including Wellcome. I see that even ICI is trying to do the splits and dress half of itself up as a fancy bio stock. You can bet it will miss the boat and the dull old heavy chemicals rump will outperform.' But switching between growth stocks and cyclicals had proved a tricky game over the past year, I remarked. Small company stocks, which were among the most sensitive to economic recovery, had been having a rough time. 'It's my longer-term play,' said Steve. 'Remember that Japan has lost the zero cost of capital that allowed it to undermine returns on capital in tradeable manufactures worldwide during the 1980s. Stands to reason that manufacturing in the US and Europe will gain competitiveness through the 1990s. But don't hold your breath.' He added: 'What worries me now is currencies. I was right to go short of the dollar earlier in the year, but US interest rates have nowhere much lower to go. Meanwhile, in Europe the pressure from cheap, dollar-based goods is threatening to bust the ERM apart. Assuming the Italians go down, who will they take with them?' Just suppose, I said, that the French say 'non' to the Maastricht treaty on September 20 and the Bundesbank puts up the Lombard Rate. Then, Bill Clinton could win the US election. At least the winner won't be Ross Perot in a three-way split, but the financial markets would not be at all happy. And we should remember that US Treasury bonds yield less than German bunds. Was that the real order of credit quality? 'You're right to worry. Everybody's worrying,' said Steve. 'But I have to look at it the other way around. What if none of those things happens? A lot of the risk is fully priced into the markets now. Suppose Bush wins - remember, your John Major was a no-hoper before April, according to the opinion polls - and suppose German short-term rates come down before Christmas. Imagine what that might do to the dollar, and then the heat would be right off the ERM. On that scenario, I might even buy the UK stock market.'</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STILL LISTENING FOR THE FOOTSTEPS  </P> <P> On a magical night 25 years ago this month, an ancient boxing shaman told me a  story without an ending, a fabulous gift that transformed me into the most  rewarded of genre writers, the novelist for teen-agers.  </P> <P> At the time, I only knew I was in Las Vegas to cover the heavyweight title  match between Muhammad Ali and Floyd Patterson, and that this old man, Cus  D'Amato, who had once managed Floyd, was a reporter's trove of arcana and  insight. After dinner, we sat by the deserted, neon-splashed swimming pool of  our casino hotel and Cus reminisced about the night he had waited by the door  of his old ghetto gym, listening for the footsteps of a "contender."  </P> <P> If a kid came up those dark, narrow, twisting flights of stairs alone and  running scared, said Cus, there was a chance he might stay with it, hang tough,  find himself through dedication and sacrifice. Fear, said Cus, was like a fire.  It can destroy you or it can make you a hero, a contender in the ring and in  life.  </P> <P> I sat up the rest of that night aflame. To me, at 27, becoming a contender  meant writing fiction. I had never made it up those stairs because I had  nothing to say. But now I had questions to answer. What kind of kid would come  up those dark stairs? What would he be running from? Toward? There was only one  way to find out.  </P> <P> Incredibly, when I got back to New York after the fight, there was a letter  from the Junior Books department of Harper &amp; Row, wondering if I had "ever  considered writing a novel with the ring as its milieu."  </P> <P> Funny you should ask. I've started already. All I can tell you is that the book  will have dark, narrow, twisting stairs, and that it will be titled "The  Contender."  </P> <P> Because the novel was short and linear, sexless (though violent), and the  protagonist was 17 years old, it was packaged for a newly created market, Young  Adult, 12-and-up. It was published in 1967 and rode a literary wave.  </P> <P> Led by Ursula Nordstrom and Charlotte Zolotow of Harpers, a dedicated band of  editors, teachers and librarians created a bridge of words from illustrated  children's books to a lifetime of reading with the novels of such disparate  writers as S. E. Hinton ("The Outsiders"), M. E. Kerr ("Dinky Hocker Shoots  Smack"), Paul Zindel ("The Pigman"), Robert Cormier ("The Chocolate War") and  Judy Blume ("Forever").  </P> <P> Of course, literature for adolescents thrived before books were branded YA.  What is "Huckleberry Finn," "Little Women" and "The Catcher in the Rye"? But  now there were suddenly textbooks, learned journals, library specialists,  graduate studies, all supported by publishing departments filling orders for  designated bookstore and library shelves.  </P> <P> Although "The Contender" was a commercial and critical success, the boom went  on without me. I left sportswriting to write old adult novels and screenplays  with varying success. But nothing came close to the response I was getting from  that YA novel, that sense of reaching out and touching lives. White girls from  Iowa wrote that even though Alfred Brooks was a black boy from Harlem, his  hopes and fears were theirs. Black boys from Harlem wrote that they read the  book because they had to, for school, and liked it until the ending. There was  no ending. What happened to Alfred Brooks? Did he get his friend, James, off  heroin? Did he finish school? Did he make it as a boxer even though he had no  killer instinct?  </P> <P> I answered them all, gently suggesting that the next chapter was theirs to  write. I didn't tell them I considered myself retired, a one-shot YA author, my  future in rewriting King Lear, not Kid Lear.  </P> <P> And then one magical night 14 years ago, while writing an article for Mother  Jones on books that had shaped me as a kid, the phrase "in the prison of my  fat" dropped out of the typewriter. I'd been very fat. How fat? When the number  200 rolled up on the scale, I bailed out. How did I lose all that fat? Well . .  . The letters for "One Fat Summer" were surprisingly similar. Younger readers  make characters their friends. One girl said she understood the fat boy  perfectly because she was "skinny as a broomstick and six feet tall."  </P> <P> This time, I visited schools and libraries and answered questions. Yes, being  so fat had made me a reader and a writer; yes, my own children read my books;  no, I wasn't rich, but meeting them and talking about my characters as if they  were alive was a thrill beyond royalty statements. But I couldn't answer the  most frequent question. I didn't know what happened to Alfred Brooks.  </P> <P> I could tell them about Cus, though. A dozen years after our first meeting, he  heard the footsteps of his contender, an incorrigible 14-year-old who was  punching apart a reform school near Cus' rural retirement home. One of the  counselors, a former boxer, asked Cus to help out. Eventually, Cus adopted the  boy, Mike Tyson. Cus died just before Mike became heavyweight champion of the  world.  </P> <P> By then, I was a television journalist, barely interested in YA, which was now  firmly established as a lucrative genre for publishers and gifted young  writers, and a lightning rod for censors. The only time I thought about it was  when someone I was interviewing, or working with, asked me what happened to  Alfred Brooks. My generation of readers was growing up.  </P> <P> And then one magical night four years ago, a teen-age Indian boy told me about  his feelings of being trapped on the reservation, but afraid to leave. He had  run away once, a triumph of survival, he thought, but he had been returned by  the police, a humiliating defeat.  </P> <P> Would he try again? What was he running from? Toward? There was only one way to  find out.  </P> <P> The publishing house is called HarperCollins now, and Charlotte Zolotow is  about to retire, but "The Brave," about a kid boxer, Sonny Bear, half-Indian,  half-white, who walks into the middle of a Times Square drug war, will be  published next year under her imprint.  </P> <P> I should be looking for a job right now (my talk show was canceled) or at least  trying to scare up some deal, but after all these years, I've finally figured  it out. I, too, want to know what happened to my characters.  </P> <P> Was Sonny Bear's left hook really as good as I thought it was? Does he really  have a chance to become heavyweight champ? His manager, my first contender,  Alfred Brooks, who led me up my own dark stairs, thinks Sonny can hang in there  and go all the way. But for me, there's only one way to find out.  </P></p>

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Giscard and Chirac agree primary poll FRANCE'S two main opposition leaders have agreed for the first time to hold a primary poll to choose a single candidate to contest the next presidential election. Former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the UDF centre-right party, and Mr Jacques Chirac, former prime minister and head of the Gaullist RPR, have asked senior party officials to agree on a primary voting system before July 1, said Le Monde newspaper. President Francois Mitterrand's second term expires in May 1995. This brings to a climax repeated recent efforts by Mr Chirac and Mr Giscard d'Estaing, fierce rivals, to smooth over some of the divisions between and within their parties, highlighted by the opposition's disarray in last week's parliamentary debate on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Mr Chirac stood against Mr Giscard d'Estaing in the 1981 presidential poll, a split which was said at the time to have been a factor in the Socialists' surprise election success. Mr Chirac stood again, unsucessfully, at the next presidential election in 1988. The two party leaders agreed at a private meeting last week that votes in an opposition primary should be cast by an electoral college of 60,000 senior party members, made up of members of parliament and local councillors, according to Le Monde. Fair play would be umpired by a committee of respected personalities, accepted by both sides.</p>

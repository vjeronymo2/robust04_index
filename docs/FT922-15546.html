			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Theodorakis quits Greek government Mr Mikis Theodorakis, the Greek composer, has resigned from the government, leaving the ruling conservatives with only a one-seat majority in the 300-member House, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. Mr Theodorakis, who will now sit as an independent, is the fifth cabinet minister to step down in the past seven months. He was a Communist Party MP before joining the conservatives. His duties as minister without portfolio were never spelled out, but he sometimes accompanied the prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, abroad and helped promote culture at home. Mr Theodorakis said in his resignation letter that he wanted to devote more time to music. But as an enthusiastic supporter of better relations with Turkey, he was known to be disappointed when the government dropped a plan to sign a Greek-Turkish friendship treaty this year.</p>

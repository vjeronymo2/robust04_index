			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHIVE CORP. TO TRIM 108 CIPHER JOBS IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Archive Corp., the data storage products maker that merged in April with rival  Cipher Data Products Inc., said Monday it will lay off 108 employees in San  Diego and reorganize itself into six new business units.  </P> <P> The layoffs, which will only affect employees at Cipher's headquarters in San  Diego, represent a 3% reduction in Archive's 3,300-employee work force. Before  the merger, Archive had about 1,600 employees and Cipher had 1,700.  </P> <P> Archive, based in Costa Mesa, said the job cuts are the result of a reduced  demand for Cipher's products, a need to eliminate duplication after the two  firms' corporate staffs were merged and a transfer of some manufacturing to  Singapore.  </P> <P> After a three-month hostile takeover battle, Cipher Data finally agreed in  April to be acquired by Archive for $123 million. Several top Cipher  executives, including Chairman Gary Liebl, resigned from the company in late  April.  </P> <P> Under the realignment, manufacturing will be consolidated at two plants in  Singapore and corporate finance and administration will be combined in Costa  Mesa. Employees in Costa Mesa will not be affected by the layoffs, said B.J.  Rone, chief financial officer.  </P> <P> "This is the new Archive, the final plan for our merged company," Rone said.  "We haven't made any decisions about one division, (Cipher's Optimem), but this  is the only reorganization and only layoffs we expect."  </P> <P> Allen Strand, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles,  said the layoff was expected and that further consolidations may follow.  </P> <P> Archive and Cipher both make tape drives that serve as backup storage systems  to prevent the loss of data stored in computer hard disk drives in the event of  system crashes or natural disasters.  </P> <P> The merged company will realign itself into six units distinguished by separate  technologies and markets. The changes in the company operations are as follows:  </P> <P> * Archive's original equipment manufacturing products division will make 5  1/4-inch tape drives under both the Archive and Cipher brands. Cipher's San  Diego unit will shift its manufacturing overseas and some employees will be  transferred to Archive's plant in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> * Cipher in San Diego will focus exclusively on its original core business of  making half-inch tape drives for minicomputers. Craig Turner, a longtime Cipher  employee, will serve as the division's president.  </P> <P> * Cipher's Irwin Magnetic Systems, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., will concentrate  on the design and marketing of quarter-inch mini-cartridges and 3 1/2-inch form  factor tape drives and tape backup subsystems. Ed Carlson will be president of  Irwin. Herb Amster, a founder of Irwin, will move to the Archive corporate  staff as senior vice president of corporate development.  </P> <P> * The tape drive manufacturing operations of both Archive and Cipher will be  consolidated in Singapore under the supervision of Jess Parker, senior vice  president of operations for Archive.  </P></p>

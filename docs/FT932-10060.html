			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Letter: Sunday trading; government, the public interest and the social viewpoint (2) Sir, Your leader suggests that it is in the wider public interest to deregulate. From a purely economic viewpoint, this may well be the case, although the argument is far from proven - the impact of recovery of overheads, varied contracts etc, may not yet have been fully accounted for in the rush to achieve seven-day trading. However, from a social viewpoint, the wider public interest is unlikely to be served by turning Sunday into just another High Street trading day. The traditional 'different-ness' of Sundays portrayed as a rest day or family day, seems to me to be essential in the longer-term welfare of society. The break of routine that the weekend, and particularly Sunday, provides is an important contribution to the well-being of us all. I am sure that our creator God knew best when a day of rest was included in His blueprint for the pattern of life. G R Bull, 8 Highfields Close, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire LE65 2FN</p>

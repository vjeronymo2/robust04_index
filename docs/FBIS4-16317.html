			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Deputy Economics Minister, Valeriy Fateyev,  called for urgent renewal of talks between Russia and Chechnya.  He suggested in an interview with Interfax today that the  Federation Council must recognize the legitimate character of  the presidency of Johar Dudayev and send a delegation for talks  on all issues concerning Russian-Chechen relations.    As the Head of the Russian parliamentary delegation Fateyev  visited the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict, the Chechen  Republic and met Chechen President Johar Dudayev on his own  initiative. Fateyev examined the present situation in Chechnya.    "What doubts could there be about the legitimacy of  Dudayev's  presidency after the three years of his being in power?" Fateyev  wondered. He believes that recognition of Chechen President  Johar Dudayev by Moscow would be a move towards normalization of  the situation which will bring significant positive results.  "The attempts by the Russian leadership to negotiate with the  Chechen opposition and to make signing of the bilateral treaty  conditional on early parliamentary and presidential elections  will be of no use to Russia," Fateyev emphasized. He considered  this to be a syndrome of imperial policy.    Fateyev suggested that for the time-being the Russian  leadership had no definite position on the Chechen issue but  certain politicians were trying to use it in their own political  interests. "This is manifested in the fact that very few people  are concerned over diametrically opposite statements which a  politician may make on this issue," Fateyev remarked. He said  these people were mostly concerned over their image.    Speaking on his impressions from the meetings with President  Dudayev, Fateyev defined him as a complex and strong person with  a strong will. "It is important for Russia that this will be  used in its interests," Fateyev stressed.    "The economic situation is the main factor of the state  leadership's capacities. The economic situation in Chechnya is  manageable and under control. Certainly, it goes through a  crisis. Certainly, there is a decline but not a catastrophic  one, Fateyev concluded.</p>

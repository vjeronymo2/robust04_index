			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE'S POWER IN HOUSE COULD BE CURBED IF IT CAN'T RETAIN COELHO'S LEADERSHIP  POST  </P> <P> House Democrats from California, who had hoped to use their immense legislative  power this year to address a wide range of state needs, are in disarray after  the decision by Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) to resign as the Democratic  leadership's third-ranking member.  </P> <P> Coelho, who has said that he will leave Congress rather than face a lengthy  ethics inquiry into his acquisition of a $100,000 junk bond, is giving up the  job of majority whip, which controls the flow and content of key House  legislation and can have a crucial impact on measures affecting California.  </P> <P> Members of the state's 27-person Democratic delegation are now trying to  replace Coelho with one of their own by rallying support for Rep. Henry A.  Waxman of Los Angeles. But they concede that Waxman, an influential liberal who  has been active in health care and clean air issues, faces an uphill fight  because he entered the race later than his three competitors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waxman Has 'a Shot at It'  </P> <P> "That's a handicap, there's no question about it," Waxman said Thursday,  pausing briefly in his efforts to lobby colleagues. "But I think we have a  definite shot at it."  </P> <P> Another problem is that Waxman has yet to declare his candidacy formally. He  said that he is still "checking out the situation to see whether there is  enough support out there. I'm acting like a candidate, but the decision is not  final."  </P> <P> As they wait for Waxman's decision, Californians are mourning the loss of a  leadership post that had come to symbolize their growing power in the House.  California's Democratic delegation -- the largest from any state -- controls  key House committees and had planned to flex its growing muscle this year on  issues ranging from air pollution and rapid transit to AIDS and immigration  funding.  </P> <P> "There's no question that having (the majority whip job) taken away hurts the  state," said Rep. Robert T. Matsui of Sacramento. With a Californian in that  post, he added, "we had direct access to the leadership, and they were  sensitive to state concerns."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reparations Bill Cited  </P> <P> Matsui said, for example, that having a Californian as whip had been crucial to  winning House approval of $1.2 billion in reparations for Japanese-Americans --  most of them from California -- who were put in detention camps by the federal  government during World War II.  </P> <P> "The leadership made this a priority, but it was a Californian who made the  difference in actually bringing it to a vote," he said. "That's a clear  advantage."  </P> <P> Rep. Leon E. Panetta of Monterey, who heads the House Budget Committee, said  that it has helped California to have someone in the leadership "who is  sensitive to state needs . . . ."  </P> <P> If a non-Californian is elected to the whip post, he added, "California will  have to fight a lot of these legislative battles with more difficulty. We'll  have to make the same arguments to people who are friendly but not necessarily  so sympathetic."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Coelho made an emotional farewell speech at a breakfast meeting  of the state Democratic delegation. He urged members to work together but did  not pledge to work for Waxman or any other candidate running for majority whip.  </P> <P> However, most members indicated that they would support Waxman when the House  Democratic caucus votes in several weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disunity Blamed in Burton Defeat  </P> <P> Rep. Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco said that Californians realize they need to  act more as a unit to protect the state's interests. She said that the late  Rep. Phil Burton (D-San Francisco) would have been elected majority leader in  1976 over Jim Wright of Texas if the delegation had been more unified. Burton  lost by a thin margin.  </P> <P> "We're all very enthusiastic about this candidacy," said Rep. Don Edwards of  San Jose, the dean of the Democratic delegation. "We're going to go to work and  elect Henry Waxman."  </P> <P> In the race for majority whip, the early front-runner is believed to be Rep.  William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), who heads the House Democratic caucus and is the  highest ranking black in the House. Also in the competition are Rep. David E.  Bonior (D-Mich.), the chief deputy whip, and Beryl Anthony Jr. (D-Ark.), who  heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hadn't Considered Running  </P> <P> All three began making plans to run for the whip job several weeks ago,  expecting that Coelho would move up to the No. 2 leadership position in the  House if a vacancy occurred at the top. However, Waxman did not consider  entering the race until Coelho's unexpected announcement that he was resigning  from Congress, potentially leaving California without a voice in the House  leadership.  </P> <P> Waxman must now try to win over some members, including Californians, who would  normally have supported him but had already lined up behind other candidates.  </P> <P> "I respect Henry a great deal, but I told Dave (Bonior) that I would be with  him several days ago," said Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson of Los Angeles. "Right  now, I'm working to round up support for Bonior."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, House members do not discount Waxman's chances.  </P> <P> "You certainly can't count him out," said Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N. M.), who  is uncommitted. "Henry is the most formidable organizer in the House. Starting  late is a factor, but he compensates for that with the most impressive ability  to line up support for a position that I've seen around here."  </P></p>

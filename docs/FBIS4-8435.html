The press release recalls that on the committee's proposal,  the Council of Ministers adopted a decree banning the export,  transit and re-export of petroleum products from Bulgarian ports  on the Danube River. On the Customs Department's proposal, the  government passed another decree limiting the time period for  transit of goods across Bulgaria and envisaging speedy use of  detained goods posing an environmental hazard.    An order by the ministers of the interior, transport, and  finance, effective as of March 31, details the obligations of  the three ministries and their interaction for strict  enforcement of the UN sanctions along the Danube.    A series of meetings have been held with representatives of  the Western European Union and the Sanctions Assistance Mission  to achieve better coordination of concerted action for the  implementation of the UN sanctions.    A commission appointed by the Customs Department has checked  customs documents relating to the export of diesel oil by the  Rutoplast company. It has held an inquiry into the actions by  which the customs authorities placed the ship Khan Kubrat laden  with diesel oil under customs control.    The Transport Ministry has prepared a proposal for  amendments  to the Code of Merchant Sea Shipping and the Statute of Merchant  Shipping, envisaging suspension of licences in similar and other  serious violations.    Investigative proceedings have been instituted on the basis  of information on the incident involving the Khan Kubrat  gathered by the Ministry of the Interior. Six Bulgarians and  four Yugoslav nationals face charges. The investigation is  going on.    An Interior Ministry commission has held an inquiry into  actions of the ministry's units in "the Khan Kubrat case."  Standby crews and equipment have been checked. The Interior  Ministry units have prepared plans for reaction in similar  circumstances.    Representatives of the three ministries reported that  disciplinary punishments had been imposed. The Transport  Ministry reported that it had imposed fines.    The government Committee on UN Sanctions discussed an  initiative by the U.S. Government on the transportation of  Balkan agricultural products detouring Yugoslavia (spring 1994).    The committee discussed proposals for foreign financial and  technical aid ensuring sanctions enforcement by this country.    The Committee on Sanctions heard a report on the preparation  of a claim by the Bulgarian Government concerning damage  sustained by this country as a result of Iraq's aggression  against Kuwait.</p>

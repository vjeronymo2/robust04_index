			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA gold mining strives to retain its glister - A mood of grim determination pervading an industry in distress THE RELEASE of the March quarterly results of the South African gold mining industry, which commences today, will reveal a picture of an industry under considerable stress, fighting bravely to stay afloat. Mr Gary Maude, managing director of the Gengold group, characterises the mood as 'grim determination'. He adds: 'People are really determined to find some way of preserving their livelihood.' The source of the industry's problems is familiar: revenues have been flat, while costs have escalated sharply. To be more precise, the average annual Rand gold price during the period 1988-91 stayed within the very narrow range of R992-R1,000 a troy ounce. During the same period, inflation averaged 15 per cent. The crutches that the industry used to be able to rely on - a buoyant gold price in times of uncertainty, or a weakening rand - have both been removed. Indeed, the prospect of the state assisting the industry by allowing the rand to depreciate is very remote. Although gold is still very important as a foreign exchange earner - 30 per cent of total exports, by value, in 1991  -and as a source of employment, its influence is otherwise on the wane. Its contribution to gross domestic product has slipped to less than eight per cent, and it only contributed one per cent of state revenues in the 1991-92 fiscal year, compared with 9.6 per cent in 1982-83. The state could help enormously by bringing down the inflation rate, the industry's single greatest problem. Few economists believe, however, that South Africa can expect much better than high single digit inflation in the foreseeable future. For all the industry's difficulties, it must be remembered that even at the current weak gold price of R1,000 an ounce, or R32,000 a kilogram, only a small portion of the industry is actually at risk, though all feel the squeeze. Chamber of Mines figures indicate that mines that are making a working loss at the present price account for roughly 15 per cent of gold mine employment and 12 per cent of total production. Superficially, the industry appears to be in reasonable health. Total gold production has been virtually constant for the past three years at 600 tonnes, productivity has risen significantly and hence profitability has improved. Mr Nick Goodwin, analyst at stockbrokers EW Balderson points out that, in the December 1991 quarter, the industry profit margin improved from R185 to R233 an ounce. A look behind the figures, however, is salutary. Improving productivity has meant cutting production costs and lifting output. Both come with considerable costs attached. Since labour represents about 52 per cent of working costs on a mine, the axe has fallen hardest here. Lifting output means pursuing the best grades available, or 'high-grading'. This has the effect of shortening the life of a mine. Improvements on the cost front have been impressive. Chamber of Mines figures show that the working cost per kilogram of gold produced in 1991 rose by only 1 per cent during 1990, or one-tenth of the inflation rate. On the labour front, a rough estimate is that job losses are running at nearly 3,000 a month. In December last year, the number of people employed on Chamber of Mines gold mines, which account for the vast majority of the country's production, was 407,000; down from an average 473,000 employees in 1990 and a record 534,000 in 1986. In terms of grade, the average grade of ore mined in the industry rose to 5.20 grams a tonne in 1991 from 5.05 grams in 1990. That reverses a long-term downward trend, but the scope for improvement is limited and it is very much a short-term measure. A disturbing trend is the declining capital expenditure, which has negative implications for production in five to eight years time. Mr Goodwin notes that it is basically maintenance of production capital expenditure that is being cut and this can be caught up, provided cuts do not continue for too long. He points out that new shafts, such as the Leeudoorn extension to Kloof, are going ahead. That is also the reason why gold production is staying fairly constant, despite marginal shafts being closed. The unavoidable conclusion is that, while it is true to say that the industry is leaner and fitter than it was a few years ago, this is not the same as saying that it has improved life expectations. For all the industry's efforts to address the symptoms of the problem, the problem remains. Mr Maude notes that, despite all the achievements, 'I'm just closer to the point where I have to think about closing mines than I was a year ago'. The great unknown, on the supply side, is exactly how long mines can continue rationalising operations before being forced to close. Mr Goodwin notes: 'Mines don't close, they just fade away' - a reference to the fact that comapnies tend to close marginal shafts, even on rich mines, rather than whole mines. Mr Maude argues that, despite strenuous efforts, there is still more that can be done to lengthen the life of his group's marginal mines. He says the message emerging from the mines is that the increasing attention given to 'soft' social issues has diverted attention from basic mining issues where improvements can be made. He says grade improvements on their mines bears this out. Many in the industry are hoping for a demand-led rescue to the industry's problems, through increased jewellery offtake and changed sentiment, so that the price improves. Mr Mike Tagg, general manager at Gold Fields, notes that a price of R36,000 a kilogram would improve the industry's position considerably. The 10-15 per cent rise in prices necessary to achieve this was 'nothing in terms of commodity prices'. He acknowledges that the old attitude that what was bad for the world was good for gold and South Africa has been tempered by gold's failure to respond positively to the Gulf War. Demand for gold from the jewellery industry in 1992 exceeded newly-mined supply in the western world for the third consecutive year and may even have set a new record, according to preliminary estimates by the World Gold Council, the producer-backed promotional organisation. Jewellery fabricators may have used more than 2,000 tonnes for the first time.</p>

Everything is  full of politics as it is. At the same time, there has been  almost no illumination of the country's economic state. People  know very little about what is going on at a neighboring  enterprise, not to mention in another city or oblast. But  everyone perceives perfectly well the negative consequences of  the reforms if they affect him personally. That is, the majority  of us does not know the overall situation in the country and the  tendencies of its further development. We are suffering in  isolation.    It is high time to think together, how to live on. But,  first, a small analysis of what has occurred with the  reformation of the economy over the last 3 years. And not with  the reforms in general, but rather, with their main component,  which has been called upon to ensure the life of commodity  production.    Being noticeably carried out are just two standard  procedures  for introducing a market economy -- privatization and financial  and tax transactions. But how are they proceeding? If you take  the privatization process, only one of its stages is being  implemented at an intensified pace -- the political stage. A  change in the property owner is occurring. The second stage,  however, the stage of economic privatization, has not yet begun  and, in my opinion, is not being planned. The discussions about  the fact that the secondary issuing of shares, the funds from  which will be directed toward the development of production and  will help the market transformations, are groundless.    The main question is -- who will buy the enterprises'  shares?  Who will acquire them? And it is answered with the help of a  concentrated advertising campaign based on one scenario -- to  take available money from people and put it not into commodity  production, but rather, into the so-called "buy-sell"  transactions. That is, at the present time, the purchasing of  the enterprises' shares for the purpose of stabilizing  production has, for all practical purposes, been excluded. And  if someone talks about this, then this is the same kind of  deception as the one that, for a voucher invested in an  investment fund, it is possible to receive some inconceivable  interest rates. A source for the development of commodity  production through a change in the owner is thus excluded.  Privatization is not fulfilling its basic function.    The credit, financial and tax policies being pursued by the  government exclude both the second and third basic sources of  financing and development of the economy -- credits and profits.  The so-called financial stabilization begun in June of last year  has led to the most negative consequences for the commodity  producers. First, the enterprises' working capital was not  indexed and all the promises in this regard on the part of  several government components just remained empty phrases. And,  for the plants and factories, the working capital is the same  thing as wages for people. And, since the prices for raw  materials and energy resources rose by a factor of 1,000 and  more, while the working capital remained frozen at the level of  January, 1992, it is clear that a production crisis was  inevitable. This is precisely the main reason for the  non-payments in all spheres of commodity production.    There is no sense at all in talking about profit as a source  of life support for the commodity producers. The state has set  up such taxes that, for all practical purposes, the enterprises'  entire revenues are being taken away. Yet, indeed, it is well  known that, in any confiscatorial system, there is an optimum  limit which, when crossed, does not lead to an increase in  payments into the treasury, but, rather, confronts the  entrepreneurs with two questions: to swindle or to cease  activities. Which is what is happening in our country: small  structures are concealing profits from taxes and the large ones,  for whom this is more complicated, are shutting down.    Yes, there are commercial organizations which are making  money even under these conditions. But this capital has also  been cut away from commodity production. It is not profitable  under present conditions for a single commercial bank to invest  funds in production, since they will not produce quick and  significant revenues. Hence follows the conclusion that a split  has occurred between financial and industrial capital, which is  increasing with every passing day. Money has become expensive  and inaccessible for commodity producers and there is constant  competition for it, but the outcome has been automatically  predetermined to the disadvantage of the commodity producers.    The conclusion is unambiguous: the transformations carried  out in the country have led to the opposite result, a landslide  drop in commodity production, and have threatened the very  existence of the nation and the state.    An especially difficult situation has taken shape in the  production lines which determine the technical level of the  produced goods. In electronics, instrument making and the  machine-tool industry, the slump is around 50 percent, it is  more than 45 percent in the chemical industry, it is also 50  percent in light industry and more than 40 percent in the  production of meat and milk protein. It is necessary to add to  this the fact that, everywhere, the number of employed people is  declining, giving rise to more and more new waves of  unemployment. It is not necessary to be a big economist in order  to arrive at the conclusion: what is occurring are the  de-industrialization of the national economic structure and its  conversion into a raw materials base for other countries.    Yaroslavl Oblast has always been notable for the stability  of  its situation and the carefully weighed nature of its decisions,  but even it has not become an exception. The rate of the slump  in production for some sectors in our oblast is even higher than  that of our neighbors. The instances of enterprises being shut  down have become more frequent. Not working a full week has  become a common occurrence.    As per a report of 1 February, 65 percent of the oblast's  enterprises were either shut down or working according to a  shortened schedule. Hidden unemployment exceeded 16.5 percent of  the labor force.    Light industry is almost at a standstill. The conversion  enterprises are in a most difficult situation. Destruction of  the agrarian sector is occurring. The financial situation of the  majority of plants and factories is critical.    What kinds of measures need to be adopted?    I will tell you right out: we have divided them into three  levels. The first is one which depends on the enterprises and  labor collectives themselves. What has been concealed is the  fact that not everyone clearly understands the special features  of working under market conditions, including people in our  management team.    The second level of requirements is the level of the region.  If a large portion of the taxes remains at the disposal of the  local organs of power, then, naturally, it is also necessary to  decide the matters of their efficient use here, locally, taking  into consideration the interests of all sections of the people.  The logic is simple: if the enterprises do not survive, then  there will be nothing to support the budget-controlled workers.    However, the third item is quite obvious: the first two  directions will produce positive results only when the necessary  foundation for the reforms is provided at the federal level. The  president and the government should such rules of the game as  would be advantageous for the commodity producer and motivate  him to work efficiently.</p>

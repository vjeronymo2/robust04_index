			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tariq Tarshishi: "Al-Hariri Insists That </F> Franjiyah Must Leave Cabinet"]    [Excerpts] Beirut -- As Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri  stayed away for the third day, mediation efforts were  deadlocked, and hopes are now pinned on a Syrian mediation to  resolve the crisis between the Lebanese leaders who are in  disagreement on the question of reshuffling Prime Minister  al-Hariri's cabinet.    A prominent mediator told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the local  mediations stopped following the appearance of obstacles which  are insurmountable without Syrian mediation. Syria has often  mediated and ironed out such obstacles in the past. The  conclusions reached by the mediators were as follows:    1. Prime Minister al-Hariri insists that the cabinet must be  reshuffled and made effective and he is not prepared to change  that position. He is willing to discuss eliminating the  difficulties in his relations with President Ilyas al-Hirawi and  Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri after the reshuffle.    Prime Minister al-Hariri bases that position on his  conviction that keeping the cabinet as it is now implies the  intention to get rid of him because it would mean that the  cabinet would be under the threat of defeat. [passage omitted]    2. The president of the republic is agreeable to a cabinet  reshuffle. The reshuffle draft al-Hariri took with him to  Damascus last Saturday had the approval of the president.    3. The Chamber of Deputies speaker would support a reshuffle  affecting the Interior Ministry provided that that portfolio is  given to Deputy Prime Minister Engineer Michel al-Murr with the  current Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij becoming state  minister or social affairs minister. Birri believes that such a  step would "put things right."    If there is to be a reshuffle, he insists that the Finance  Ministry should go to a Shiite in place of Minister Fu'ad  Sinyurah.    The same mediator told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that among the  obstacles which could not be overcome without Syrian mediation  were the fact that Prime Minister al-Hariri wants Minister of  Municipal and Village Affairs Sulayman Franjiyah out of the  cabinet, and Birri's insistence that the finance minister must  be a Shiite in any cabinet reshuffle.

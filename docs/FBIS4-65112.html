			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Democratic Union President Valery </F> Giscard d'Estaing by Patrick Jarreau; place and date not given:  "Giscard d'Estaing: `Fight Against Unemployment Too Crucial To  Wait for Referendum'" -- first paragraph is LE MONDE  introduction]    [Excerpt] Philippe Seguin's 1 May proposal for a referendum  on employment confirmed that the Right's presidential election  campaign will be focused on economic and social policy issues.  In this interview, UDF [French Democratic Union] President  Valery Giscard d'Estaing explains why he believes the fight  against unemployment cannot wait for the procedural reform  required to consult the French on such a topic in a referendum.    [Jarreau] What do you think of Philippe Seguin's proposal  with respect to a referendum on employment?    [Giscard d'Estaing] I am delighted to see that the debate on  unemployment and employment has regained momentum. There is one  point I regret, however, and that is the fact that no one has  dared to utter the word "full employment," and that we are still  only looking for means to curb the growth of unemployment.    The referendum proposal has to do with form, not with  content. One could envision extending the scope of Section 11 of  the Constitution to include issues such as education or  employment, but this would imply that the government needs to  draft a bill of law to that effect before the French can be  consulted.    The experience of the five-year employment act passed  earlier  this year showed that this legislative approach is probably not  the most efficient method. We need to go about it differently.  Asking the public to voice its opinion on a controversial issue  is not an intrinsically bad idea, but we need to know which  concrete measure would be embedded in the bill subjected to a  referendum.    [Jarreau] Do you think that such a proposal for a referendum  may take away a number of responsibilities from elected  officials and members of Parliament?    [Giscard d'Estaing] That is a real danger. Charles Millon  [president of the UDF caucus in the National Assembly] was right  to emphasize it. The best way to avert it would be to have  Parliament discuss the bill first. A referendum held pursuant  to Section 11 can only be decided during a parliamentary session  or on a joint proposal from both houses. One can hardly imagine  that the public would then be consulted on a bill against the  will of the National Assembly.    Concretely, such an approach would go like this: parliament  would be given an opportunity to discuss the bill and to  indicate that it does not oppose it, and then a referendum would  be held. In my opinion, a debate in parliament is essential to  improve the bill, to lessen the excessive influence of senior  civil servants, and to help French people understand the bill.    The extension of the scope of Section 11 on referenda is a  reform that must be carried out thoughtfully and seriously. The  urgency of the unemployment problem does not allow us to wait  for such a reform to come to pass. [passage omitted]</p>

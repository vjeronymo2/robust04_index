			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Shining example of laser's speed COPPER CABLES are a bulky and expensive way of transmitting voice and data, so in many countries telephone traffic is being switched to lightweight optical fibres the width of a human hair. A new type of laser light pulse generator has been developed by Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, which allows more than 80 times as much information to be packed into fibre-optic telecommunications lines. The pulse generator enables the capacity of fibre-optics telecommunications links to be boosted to 600,000 telephone channels from the present 7,000. In a fibre-optic telecommunications link, coded bursts of laser light are fired down the line to be picked up and decoded at the other end. Pirelli's new laser light pulse generator is able to fire bursts of light 10,000 times shorter than current systems, allowing more signals to be packed into a single line.

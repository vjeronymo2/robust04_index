			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 2 Feb (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today offered a 10-percent  adjustment of fuel transportation tariffs to end the strike that  businessmen in that sector began on 1 February. De Leon  demanded that the National Transportation Coordination Board  (CNT) lift the strike, warning them that otherwise he would have  to open up the fuel transportation business in order to  eliminate the monopoly. At a news conference at the Presidency,  De Leon said that the government's final position is to grant a  10 percent adjustment to current tariffs and 0.5 centavo of a  quetzal per gallon of fuel transported as insurance.    The CNT has not replied to the president's offer, who said  that transportation businessmen must "accept today" the decision  of the Economic Cabinet.    "I urge businessmen to end the strike immediately;  otherwise,  we will take" drastic "action," de Leon stressed. De Leon said  that the strike called by the transportation businessmen is  illegal, as they abandoned a dialogue with a high-level  government commission.    He added that the Attorney General's Office has been  instructed to initiate legal action against the businessmen  because they are disrupting public order by creating a fuel  shortage. "The government will not tolerate illegalities from  the businessmen, as they have already caused too much harm in  addition to encouraging a strong feeling of uncertainty among  the people," the president warned.</p>

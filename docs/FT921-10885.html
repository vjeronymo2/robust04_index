			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Appointments: Squaring the circle Keith Orrell-Jones, 54, is to succeed Jim McColgan as group managing director of Blue Circle, one of the world's largest cement companies. McColgan will be leaving in September when he reaches Blue Circle's normal retirement age of 62. For the past year Orrell-Jones has been president of Blue Circle's US operations. He was previously chief executive of ARC, the aggregates and concrete subsidiary of Consolidated Gold Fields which was acquired by Hanson in 1989. Orrell-Jones joined ARC in 1972 and was president of the group's north American business between 1981 and 1987 before returning to the UK to become chief executive. According to McColgan, Orrell-Jones's tenure in the US for Blue Circle has coincided with one of the worst construction recessions that country has seen. 'The US division had problems other than the recession. Keith Orrell-Jones, however, has managed to reduce costs, increase management efficiency and improve cashflow. I cannot think of many European cement companies operating in the US which will be able to boast of a similar record.' Orrell-Jones was educated at Newcastle High School and St John's College, Cambridge and is married with four children.</p>

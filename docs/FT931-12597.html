			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Export boost for Chicago soya futures US SOYABEAN futures got a boost from news of export demand and record domestic use of soyabean meal, but Chicago's maize futures remained stuck in a morass of oversupply, and wheat prices only managed a small rebound from Tuesday's 5 cents-a-bushel tumble. Late in the session soyabeans for March delivery were up 5 cents at Dollars 4.81 1/4 a bushel. News from the US Department of Agriculture late on Tuesday afternoon that an 'unknown' country had bought 256,000 tonnes of US soyabeans helped boost that market early yesterday. Commercial traders thought the mystery sale was going to 'a European destination', although there had been some suggestion that China was the buyer. US soyabean exports are far ahead of last year. Some 70 per cent of USDA's projected export sales are already placed, with the marketing year only one-third over. Yesterday morning, the department released its monthly report on US soyabean crushing. Analysts said it implied that US farmers and livestock feeders used a record 2.246m tonnes of soyameal in December. The crush figures aided the soyabean rally. Mr Dan Cekander, director of grain research at the Chicago brokerage firm of Rodman and Renshaw, said the high soyameal consumption figures were in line with bigger livestock herds in the US. 'Cattle, hogs, and broilers - in every category we have higher meat numbers than last year,' he said. Maize rations for livestock are supplemented with soyameal to boost protein and quicken weight gain. US maize futures held in a tight range. The year's huge crop has left farmers with large stocks on hand. Each time futures prices manage a small rise, producers flood country terminals with grain, keeping a lid on any advance. Late in the day March maize was barely changed at Dollars 2.16 3/4 a bushel. March wheat futures were up 2 1/4 cents at Dollars 3.80 3/4 a bushel late in the afternoon, in part because of news that Sri Lanka was seeking to buy 100,000 tonnes of US wheat under the Export Enhancement Program. Morocco and Lebanon were also US wheat buyers, helping to offset Russia's inability to purchase US wheat because of credit problems.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Bavarian Minister President Edmund </F> Stoiber by Elmar Oberhauser -- live]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Oberhauser] Let us come to  the topic of the European Union [EU]. You said today that  Austria's entry would be a chance for Austria. However, the  people in Austria have witnessed for some days now a violent  controversy over the blocking minority within the EU. The  question is increasingly asked whether this entry date of  January 1995 that one is striving for can still be maintained.  Is the EU not currently giving a terrible impression to an  applicant for membership or a nation that wants to become a  member?    [Stoiber] I agree with you because domestic policy problems  in Great Britain are being shifted to the EU, and the behavior  of the Spaniards, which is definitely too demanding, is also in  the limelight. I can only say that those who upgrade the  question about 23 or 24 votes as the Britons or Spaniards do --  I openly say it here -- wrong the spirit of the EU and the  necessary development. We, the EU, have gone through most  difficult negotiations with Austria, Finland, and Norway. In  this way, Europe will be fantastically rounded off and this  Western EU will develop into a pan-European union. Those who  question this really have to expect most violent controversies.  That is to say, my government, the Free State of Bavaria, but  also Germany as whole, will do everything to dissuade the  Britons from being stubborn in this respect.    Personally, I openly have to tell you that new entries and  the enlargement of the EU are so important to me that I would  finally swallow the bitter pill and not necessarily insist on  the correct solution of 27 votes. That is to say, I give  absolute priority to 1 January 1995 and it has to be pushed  through.    [Oberhauser] Is that realistic? A few days ago,  Parliamentary President Klepsch said on this program that the 27  votes cannot be changed.    [Stoiber] This is the problem of the European Parliament.  Certainly, if the Britons really do not move and continue to be  uncooperative, one has to see, of course, the alternative. The  alternative is that the four states cannot become members, which  may be in the interest of one or another state. It may be the  case that the Mediterranean countries say that there is no hurry  regarding the entry of these strong countries. However, from  the point of view of Germany, Europe, and Bavaria, this would be  extremely disastrous because we simply need the Austrians to get  the other Central and East European countries closer to the EU.  The next would be Hungary, then the Czech Republic or Slovakia  would come. Actually, Austria's function is to break things open.    [Oberhauser] Let us come back again to Germany, where one is  talking of the superelection year of 1994. The Bundestag  election is the focus of interest, also for politically  interested Austrians. If one can believe the opinion  researchers, although they have repeatedly been wrong lately,  there are many indications that Kohl's era is coming to an end.  Do you see it differently?    [Stoiber] This has often been the case, that is to say, it  often looked like it. The reality was different. I am firmly  convinced that Helmut Kohl will continue to be the chancellor,  although I have certainly had many controversies with him, but I  must openly say that one can see now the difficulties that  Scharping has when something specific is at issue. That is to  say, if he classifies those who earn 50,000 German marks per  year in Germany as people with a better income and demands an  additional tax of 10 percent from them, he deeply breaks into  the group of skilled workers. This is also shown by the present  controversies.    I also think that now that we have a chancellor who is  absolutely recognized in Europe and the world in these difficult  times, it would be disastrous in the field of foreign politics.  One cannot call someone to this office who is really an  apprentice in this question, as compared to the chancellor.    [Oberhauser] Putting it very cautiously, the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP] seems to have difficulties. Is a grand  coalition between the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian  Social Union [CSU] and the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD] conceivable for you?    [Stoiber] No. The CSU stated several times that there will  be no grand coalition with it in Bonn. Since the CDU/CSU can  only make a uniform decision in this respect and the CDU, even  if it wished this, had to show consideration for the CSU, there  will be no grand coalition with the CSU and thus with the  CDU/CSU in Bonn, unless there is a disastrous situation, which,  however, is certainly not perceptible.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Minister-President, thank you for having  been our guest.    [Stoiber] You are welcome.    [Oberhauser] Have a nice evening in Vienna.    [Stoiber] Thank you.</p>

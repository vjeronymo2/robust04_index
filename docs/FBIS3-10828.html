Members of the pro-Cuban Army of National Liberation (ELN)  perpetrated the mass kidnapping. This action prevented the  holding of elections in the small town of Carcasi.    The rebels intercepted a bus and took seven members of the  National Civil Registry Office, which organized the elections,  and 25 students who were going to act as voting officers in that  locality, to an unknown destination.    During the past month, groups linked to the Simon Bolivar  Guerrilla Coordinating Board (CGSB) intensified their attacks to  sabotage the legislative elections, although the government said  today those attempts failed.    In addition to kidnapping electoral authorities, the CGSB  also kidnapped three government officials in Cesar Department,  blew up a stretch of the country's main oil pipeline, attacked  intermunicipal buses, and activated medium-intensity bombs that  did not cause any victims.    Colombians renewed today 102 Senate seats and 163 in the  Chamber of Representatives (deputies) and elected Ernesto Samper  as presidential candidate for the Liberal Party, which used the  opportunity to hold an internal "popular primary."</p>

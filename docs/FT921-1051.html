			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Cut in housing stock buoys Barratt BARRATT Developments said yesterday that a big reduction in its stock of unsold houses together with cuts in the number of houses held under part exchange deals had helped the group to a Pounds 2.5m pre-tax profit during the six months to the end of December. This compared with a Pounds 14.5m pre-tax loss during the corresponding period a year earlier when the group made a provision of Pounds 16m to cover falling property prices. Sir Lawrie Barratt, chairman, said the improvement had been achieved as a result of better housekeeping and savings flowing from the closure of some subsidiaries. Reductions in group borrowings had cut interest payments from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 9.9m. The number of unsold houses on its books was cut from 1,000 at the end of June to 500 by the end of December generating a saving of Pounds 45m. A further Pounds 15m had been saved by speeding the sale of 'second hand' homes acquired under part exchange. About 60 per cent of group sales are assisted by part-exchange deals. Cuts in administration costs had reaped a further Pounds 6m, said Sir Lawrie. He said that more savings would occur during the second half of the year. Property sales amounted to Pounds 5.9m in the first half. A further Pounds 4.2m of sales had been completed since December. UK housing turned round from an Pounds 8m pre-tax loss to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.3m despite incurring a further loss in southern England. US housing incurred a reduced loss of Pounds 3.8m compared with a deficit of Pounds 6.5m last time. COMMENT Sir Lawrie Barratt cheered the market with his announcement of a return to profits, an improving balance sheet and optimistic remarks about prospects for a steady recovery in the UK housing market. It is still too early to talk of a revival in the market but sales have picked up. Election uncertainty, however, could still disrupt what has been only a modest improvement. For Barratt it is a case of so far so good. Gearing remains high and more needs to be done. Pre-tax profits this year of Pounds 7m would put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 16. Sir Lawrie, however, still has his fans and a return to even a tiny dividend by the year end would help the rating.</p>

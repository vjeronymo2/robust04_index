			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Two Sessions" column by staff reporter Zhang Mingxin (1728 </F> 2494 2450)]    [Text] Beijing, 22 March (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--With the  emergence of the labor market and the upgrading of the  enterprise system, trade unions in China will surely play a  bigger role in the market economy.    All trade unionists attending the "two sessions" were aware  of their own new role: Being the "mouthpiece" of the interests  of staff members and workers. They presented their views  vehemently on numerous issues ranging from staff and worker  ability to withstand the strains that should be given  consideration in the course of reform, the status of workers and  trade unions after the introduction of "a company system" to  state-owned enterprises, protection of the legitimate rights and  interests of Chinese personnel of foreign-funded enterprises,  and perfection of a social security mechanism. Under the  planned economy characterized by single ownership, the main role  of trade unions was to care for staff and worker well-being and  to ensure production. Thus the work of the then trade unions  was figuratively summarized into "issuing film tickets, managing  meal coupons, and collecting bathing tickets."    China's trade unions are now becoming "antishock valves"  enabling reform to progress in a stable society. At present the  problem of Chinese enterprises suffering losses in operation,  and suspending or partially suspending production remains  pronounced. In many localities, prices have gone up quite  rapidly, making life difficult for some staff members and  workers. Many deputies to the National People's Congress and  members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference who were trade union members  appealed to the government to give full consideration to the  economic and mental ability of the general public to withstand  the resulting strains of the various major reform measures to be  taken. Meanwhile, they also briefed the sessions on moves taken  by the trade unions in various localities to alleviate  contradictions and reduce friction. Sun Hongrong, president of  the China Textile Trade Union, said: As Shanghai's textile  industry was confronted with structural readjustment, staff and  workers would have to leave their current posts and seek new  jobs. The trade union of the municipality's textile departments  sponsored all types of training courses to pass on job-seeking  knowledge free of charge to staff members and workers who had  quit their current posts, and ran job introduction centers and  undertakings in the tertiary industry to find jobs for them. Li  Guozhong, president of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of  Trade Unions, remarked: Liaoning is a heavy industrial base.  In recent years, some enterprises have been in depression.  Trade unions kept files of staff members and workers who had  exceptionally great financial difficulties and reported their  situations to the government so they could receive relief funds.  Trade unions also organized retired staff and workers of  state-owned enterprises to do part-time jobs in township and  town enterprises. This enabled them both to bring their  remaining energies into play and to increase their incomes.    Whether the status of staff members and workers drops after  state-owned enterprises establish a modern enterprise systems is  also a hot point with which trade unionists are very much  concerned. In the past, a state-owned enterprise had an  enterprise management committee, a congress of representatives  of staff members and workers, and an administrative affairs  office, dubbed "three old bodies," and its staff and workers had  a great say in enterprise policy making. Once enterprise  structural reform is introduced, an enterprise has a congress of  shareholders, a board of directors, and a supervisory organ,  dubbed "three new bodies." In some newly established  shareholding enterprises, the "three old bodies" have come to a  standstill. Fang Jiade, vice president of the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions, informed this reporter: Currently,  in giving publicity to enterprise reform, undue emphasis is laid  on property rights relationship to the neglect of labor  relationship and on funds and equipment to the neglect of the  role of laborers in pushing productive forces forward.    As China further opens up to the outside world and the  number of foreign-funded enterprises expands, labor-capital  disputes are also increasing in number. The question of  infringement of the rights and interests of Chinese personnel  has attracted the attention of trade unionists. Jiang Rong,  former president of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade  Unions, provided this reporter with material like this: A  foreign-funded restaurant in Shanghai gave half an hour for job  aplicants to read the Chinese- version contracts and then asked  them to sign English-version contracts. During the probation  period, when the employees who could not bear the illegal  actions of searching their bodies and bags asked to renounce  their contracts with their 340 yuan in cash pledge lost in  accordance with the Chinese-version contracts, the enterprise  showed them the English-version contracts, which stipulated that  if the employees wanted to renounce contracts, apart from  returning their cash pledge, they should pay 5,000 yuan in  compensation fees. Hence, there was an outcry among the  employees. On the issue, he said: In foreign-funded  enterprises, it is imperative for trade unions to hold  collective talks with enterprises on the employees' behalf on  such issues as wages, working hours, labor protection, and  safety in production, and to sign common collective contracts.  The pressing matter of the moment is to speed up establishment  of trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises. According to  statistics, of the foreign-funded enterprises which have already  started operation, less than a half have set up trade unions.    Trade unionists also confessed: To safeguard the interests  of staff members and workers once and for all, it is necessary  to perfect the social security system and solve for members of  society the difficulties caused by old age, diseases, injury and  disability, unemployment, and poverty. At present, it is  necessary to enact "labor," "social security," "labor  protection," "minimum wage," and "labor contract" laws as  quickly as possible. Trade unions should be invited to  participate in the whole process of drafting laws which have a  bearing on staff member and worker immediate interests. Just as  a labor expert said: Internationally, no country in the world  can effect an economic takeoff when labor-capital relations are  strained and society is turbulent. In countries with a  developed market economy, a "three-party" principle has been  developed, under which labor relations are handled by the  government, enterprises, and trade unions through consultations.  China joined the "Treaty on Promotion of the Implementation of  International Labor Standards Through Three-Party Consultations"  four years ago. This clearly shows China's positive attitude  toward the issue. With the improvement of the socialist market  economic structure, the "three-party" principle will be  gradually established in China and the status or role of trade  unions will become increasingly important.</p>

			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Chicago's Acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer and his chief Democratic rival, Cook  County State's Atty. Richard M. Daley, sprinted to the finish of a hotly  contested primary race in the nation's third-largest city. Despite holding a  lead in the polls, Daley, son of legendary "Boss" Richard J. Daley, who ruled  the city for 21 years, crisscrossed the city with less than 48 hours to go  until the polls open Tuesday. Daley picked up endorsements from Jewish Voters  for All Chicago and the Jewish Committee for Responsible Government. Sawyer,  who 14 months ago succeeded the late Harold Washington, the city's first black  mayor, doubled Daley's pace on the second-to-last day of the campaign --  scheduling more than a dozen appearances citywide.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CABLE CON IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A  </P> <P> The cable television situation in South-Central Los Angeles is obviously a  fiasco: In the early 1980s, when Los Angeles was in the process of awarding  cable franchises, the right to serve the predominantly black area was awarded  to Mayor Tom Bradley's long-time supporter Eli Broad, who is white, on the  condition that he offer a 20% interest in the venture to black community  leaders and groups, all of whom had close ties to the mayor.  </P> <P> Bishop H.H. Brookins was one of the beneficiaries of the process, as were other  politically influential clergymen, and developer Danny Bakewell.  </P> <P> They were among the minority partners who were not required to invest any of  their own money. None have participated in the operation of the franchise.  Their only activity has been to collect profits. It shows: Today, seven years  after the franchise was awarded, 52,000 homes in South-Central Los Angeles are  still without any access to cable television.  </P> <P> The revelation in The Times Sunday that Brookins and others in the mayor's  circle of enterprising friends were handed shares in the lucrative franchise as  virtual gifts is more than just another example of how badly the Bradley  Administration's chronic cronyism has abused and affronted the public interest.  For the most distressing aspect of the ongoing City Hall tale is that so much  of the self-enrichment accomplished by the mayor's friends was achieved through  manipulation of city programs intended to expand economic opportunities for  women and ethnic minorities. Canny insiders like Brookins apparently took them  as just another chance to do well for themselves.  </P> <P> In the end, the real victims of the avarice evident in this and other such  affairs that recently have come to light are the struggling minority  communities whose interests the mayor's cronies claim to exemplify.  </P></p>

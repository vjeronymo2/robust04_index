			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's statement by President Kiro Gligorov to </F> delegates of People's Assembly; unattributed: "Conditions for  Economic Revitalization"]    [Text] "I would refer to 1993 as the year of accomplishing  our international legal and political recognition and  sovereignty. Since 8 April of this year, the Republic of  Macedonia has been a member of the United Nations. At this  moment it has been recognized by more than 50 countries, some of  which are of extreme importance, and the process of recognition  by others has already been announced. Finally, the Republic of  Macedonia has become an international reality. It is a new and  prospective [as published] state in the Balkans, a factor of  peace in the region." This, among other things, was emphasized  by Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov in his new year's  statement to the delegates and numerous guests at the 72d  session of the Macedonian People's Assembly. He also made a  review of everything that has been achieved during the past  year, particularly what lies ahead of us and what our duties and  obligations are in the year to come.    Talking about the current internal situation, President  Gligorov pointed to the necessity of adopting a stabilization  program. "That is, probably, the number one issue in  Macedonia," he emphasized, and stressed reality as the only  possible way of approaching that subject. According to him,  reality means starting from the objective economic and social  situation in which we find ourselves now, from its influence on  the stability of the country, and the further reinforcement of  its international position. "The Republic of Macedonia is in  transition." he pointed out, "and we should make that period  easier by opting for that which will exact the smallest economic  and social price of all of us, without exception."    The second point of the review by President Gligorov within  the framework of the stabilization program was the social and  political security of the country. That is the basis on which  the future development of democracy and construction of a legal  state depends. Therefore, in the opinion of President Gligorov,  besides the indispensable restrictions, the program should also  take into account social endurance and establish a system for  solving the social conflicts. In this context, he stressed the  need for a speedier establishment of the judiciary system,  because, in his words, it has a direct impact on the entire  social and political stability of the state.    President Gligorov also said that "it is of special  importance for us to create an economic, social, and political  milieu that will guarantee the stability of interethnic  relations in Republic Macedonia. We have been hearing for three  years that Macedonia will `without a doubt witness an  interethnic conflict' and that will be the end of this state.  But what has reality demonstrated? First, it demonstrated that  such an interethnic conflict is not unavoidable if we have a  clear political option, that this is the state and fatherland of  all those living in it, that the nationalities must enjoy their  rights, but also respect and perform their duties toward the  state. Those rights must be realized and solved through  dialogue, understanding, and political measures within the  system and its institutions. And second, the realization of  that unique alternative, as a guarantee to peace and  harmonization of interethnic relations, is very much dependent  on the economic and social status of the state."    As the last segment on the importance of the stabilization  program President Gligorov stressed its influence on the  reinforcement of the republic's international position. "That  position," he said, "at this moment must, first of all, be  bolstered on the economic plan and reaffirmed abroad. That is  our real interest, but also it is in the interest of the  international community at large. The stabilization and  economic rise of Macedonia is an important part of that plan.  Any other choice will either mean pushing the country into a  hopeless isolation or placing it on the margins of the world  economic market."    Continuing, President Gligorov made a special presentation  on  maintaining and reinforcing the security of the Republic of  Macedonia. "Our republic, today, is on relatively stable  foundations. However, we do not and must not underestimate  those possible dangers, particularly because there is a bloody  war going on in the region. That is why our basic idea is to  make the Republic of Macedonia an equal member of the collective  European and world security. The CSCE is the first link.  However, it is of no less importance for us, in the interest of  our own security and the security in the region, to be included,  first of all, in the NATO Council, and then in NATO. It is  therefore of extreme importance that the Macedonian People's  Assembly has already come to a firm decision on that," President  Gligorov emphasized.    "The foundations of the sovereign and independent state of  Macedonia," President Gligorov said furthermore, "were lain on 8  September 1991. They were reaffirmed by the Constitution of the  Republic and by the admission to the United Nations. The  centuries long aspirations and wishes of the Macedonian people  are our reality -- what we are experiencing today -- an  independent and internationally recognized state, as a  continuity of the 1903 Ilinden [the first Macedonian Republic in  Krusevo], and the 1944 ASNOM [Anti-Fascist Council of National  Liberation of Macedonia]. Honored delegates, there is no such a  force that can change all that. Many have tried in the past  three years, claiming from the outside, that we are `an  artificial creation', a `communist invention.' For the sake of  the truth, all those claims have been exhausted. The Republic  of Macedonia is a respected reality.    Allow me, in the end, to express my deep belief that the  Republic of Macedonia is opening up a new page in its history.  Its basic orientation will still be an independent state, with  an open European option, fully integrated in the International  Community and its security systems; a democratic state in which  the interethnic relations are and will be regulated by  international standards; a market economy and full candidacy in  the world market.    That is why, finally, I stress the necessity for the  People's Assembly and government, as well as for the other  factors in the republic, to turn to economic and social  questions, to the stabilization and development of our economy.  That will ease the transition and create conditions for  economic revitalization. That will be a thorny road, with  problems and numerous sacrifices. However, there is no other  road."    Congratulating the orthodox delegates and guests on the new  year and the Christmas holidays, President Gligorov sent a  message asking all of us to gather the necessary strength to  completing that which began with the Declaration of  Independence, the Constitution, and the realized international  recognition, in order to leave to the next People's Assembly and  Government a complete state with all its attributes.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  "Main Argument" </H5>   "The question of the economic survival of the Republic of  Macedonia is a question of the intensive engagement of many in  the Balkans. It was always offered as "the main argument",  saying Macedonia could not survive as a state, because it was  not able to survive economically on its own. That is why we  have been exposed to various blockades in the past three years  since our independence.    We demonstrated our ability to maintain our state under such  conditions, taking into account its economic vitality and  positive stimuli from privatization. We hear, even today,  threats to destabilize us through economic measures.    However, the most important thing at this moment is for us  not to allow an economic collapse inside the country, which  would erode democracy, thus jeopardizing the life and stable  fabric of our state. There is not one single political goal  that could justify that," President Gligorov emphasized.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  End to Balkan Wars </H5>   "The question on the dispute over our name has acquired its  real framework. It has been proven that we do not endanger any  of our neighbors, and our independence and international  recognition are not cause for a new Balkan war -- on the  contrary. We have demonstrated ourselves to be a factor that  has impeded the expansion of the war to our southern border. We  demonstrated that the independence of the Macedonian state is  the key to peace in the south of the Balkans. Through all this  historical mistakes have been corrected. It, independent  Republic of Macedonia, put an end to the historical reasons for  Balkan wars and conflicts; it impeded attempts for another  division of Macedonia.    I deeply believe that knowledge about Macedonia being of  vital interest for neighboring Greece will become more and more  widespread. We have many more reasons to fully cooperate as  good neighbors, instead of creating a new region of conflict in  the Balkans," President Gligorov said.  <H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5> <H5>  Moderation and Realism </H5>   "The difficult process of our recognition," President  Gligorov said, "demonstrated that moderation and realism are the  only possible routes in our foreign policy. It demonstrated  that it is neither justified to idealize international relations  and practice, nor to have a completely nihilistic attitude in  that regard. Reality demonstrated that international relations  and practice rely on real interests and principles. They can  neither be idealized nor denied."</p>

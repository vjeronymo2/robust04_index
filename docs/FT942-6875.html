			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National swaps Y30bn deal into dollars New issues in the eurobond market were scarce yesterday with Wednesday's resurgence of volatility in the bond markets scaring off issuers and investors. As a result, attention focused on Abbey National's Y30bn offering of three-year eurobonds, the proceeds of which were swapped into floating-rate dollars. When the deal hit the screens, the pricing and the swap rates at the time led many syndicate managers to believe that the bank had missed its funding target by a wide margin, fanning talk of a subsidy on the swap. This was hotly denied both by joint lead manager Merrill Lynch and by Abbey. Mr Jonathan Nicholls, director, corporate finance and capital markets at Abbey, said the deal had been in the works since Tuesday and that the pricing and the swap had been set on Wednesday. 'We are not in the business of asking for or getting subsidies,' he said. CCDQ, Quebec's co-operative banking movement, saved at least 15 basis points by raising CDollars 100m of five-year debt in the eurobond market rather than the domestic bond market. Lead manager Wood Gundy said CCDQ has a strong retail following in the eurobond market and by the end of the day, around one-third of the issue had been placed. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was largely unchanged. The spread on Ford Motor Credit's Dollars 150m offering of three-year debt launched on Wednesday was steady at around 45 basis points due to ongoing demand from European retail investors, attracted by the 6 3/4 per cent coupon. Bacob Bank, Belgium's eighth-largest credit institution, could well tap the eurobond market in the near future following the signing yesterday of a Dollars 1bn multi-currency medium-term note programme, arranged by Morgan Stanley. The International Securities Market Association (ISMA), the eurobond market's trade association, is expected to announce a reduction in the settlement period for eurobonds at its annual general meeting next Thursday in New Orleans. From June 1 1995, eurobonds will settle after three working days rather than the current five days.</p>

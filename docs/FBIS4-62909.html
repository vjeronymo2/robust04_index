			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Levitskiy report under the general heading </F> "Lithuanian TV Companies Dreaming of Winning `Ostankino'  Channel. Estonian TV Already Paying for Its Closure"]    [Text] Tallinn -- Under a government directive the  retransmission in Estonia of the last Russian channel --  "Ostankino" -- has ended. The reason given for the ban is that  Russia is not paying for its programs to be shown. But the  victory over "Ostankino" has been very costly -- communications  workers have lost their main source of funds. The government  has had to allocate 1,580,000 krooni ($115,000) to meet the  expenditure generated by the ending of Ostankino retransmissions.    The communications workers used to receive a much higher  rental from Ostankino than they do from Estonian TV and local  commercial TV firms. To all intents and purposes Russia had  been subsidizing the local TV.    Having now lost their Ostankino hard currency, the  communications workers have been forced to set realistic tariffs  for state TV and commercial studios. But these are claiming  that they are unable to pay in full. The government was then  forced to provide compensation out of the budget for some of the  former Ostankino subsidies. The Ostankino ban has hit the  taxpayer.</p>

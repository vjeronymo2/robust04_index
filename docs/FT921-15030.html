			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Arts: Xerxes - Coliseum Occasionally, very occasionally, things get better.  This celebrated English National Opera show, probably the most widely admired and influential Handel opera staging of the 1980s, has returned after a three-year interval for its latest revival - and affords three-and-a-half hours of purest delight, a pleasure and a boon which in the grey days of January only the most determined puritans will be able to deny themselves. The Nicholas Hytner production, an infinitely ingenious and sophisticated meeting of late-1730s taste and late-20th-century theatrical legerdemain, is expertly revived by Julia Hollander. Far from having dimmed or dated, as yesterday's chic successes are wont to do, it gleams and glistens with wit, intelligence, comic sparkle and a deep sympathy with the absurd intricacies of human passion. The work, a late-Handel mixture of musical-comedy lightness and opera seria depth, comes across as a sui generis masterpiece, Mozartian, Shakespearean and Handelian all in one go. The slight air of archness which the production carried when new, in 1985, has completely disappeared. This must be because the original cast members (Ann Murray, Christopher Robson, Jean Rigby, Christopher Booth-Jones) have sunk themselves wonderfully deep inside their words and their music, and the newcomers (Yvonne Kenny, Rosa Mannion, Norman Bailey) are all absolute experts in this delicate mesh of vocal and dramatic style. Anyone who assumes Mr Bailey can only do noble veterans is in for the happiest of surprises - his red-faced, thigh-slapping military man is a perfect silly-ass cameo, and agilely sung to boot. One despairs, indeed, of doing justice to the cast - each member merits long hymns of praise. Miss Murray (Xerxes) speaks volumes with the subtlest of glances and vocal inflections (but she's a little short on chest-register power in her final showpiece). Miss Kenny (Romilda, in utterly ravishing, heart-melting voice) and Miss Mannion (Atalanta) are enchantingly well-constrasted as fair elder and deceitful young sister. Mr Robson's penetrative countertenor and bluff, frank manner make a bold match with Arsamenes's emotional upheavals. And though Miss Rigby's rich mezzo sounded a touch clouded (an unannounced cold?), her faithful, tender-hearted Amastris seems warmer and lovelier than ever. The conductor is Ivor Bolton; this is his house debut. The touch is gentler, softer, more leisurely and lingering than that of his sparkling predecessor, Charles Mackerras. On Friday not every slow tempo seemed ideally judged or sustained. Yet the unique flavour of the opera and the production was communicated with marvellous acuteness. In a word, unmissable.</p>

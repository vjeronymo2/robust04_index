			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: MAINSTREAM SEEMS TO SUIT  STILL-THRIVING TEATRO META  </P> <P> Raul Moncada, director of the Old Globe Theatre's Teatro Meta program, crossed  his fingers when he was told last year that the Globe would be absorbing Teatro  Meta as a department rather than continuing with it as a separately funded  branch.  </P> <P> The fear expressed by some observers was that mainstreaming might water down  the project and ultimately eliminate it.  </P> <P> Moncada was never one of the public naysayers, but he does acknowledge now that  he was more than a little worried at the time.  </P> <P> "There was that time of hesitation when we didn't know how the incorporation  would work out," he said.  </P> <P> Now, with the inclusion of "La Fiaca" -- a 1987 Teatro Meta workshop  presentation -- on the 1991 winter schedule, as well as a new play by Argentine  playwright Lillian Garrett ("The White Rose"), Moncada said he feels that  mainstreaming is working.  </P> <P> His confidence in his project's future is further bolstered by a $45,000  playwrighting grant that came in just last week from the Ford Foundation.  </P> <P> The money is designated to commission four first drafts from North American  Latino playwrights. The Old Globe might produce those scripts, but has no  obligation to do so, Moncada said.  </P> <P> Moncada, who translated "La Fiaca" by Argentine writer Ricardo Talesnik, as  well as the Globe's 1990 presentation of "The Granny" (another Teatro Meta  discovery) by Argentine writer Roberto Cossa, will also continue to seek out  new work by Latin American authors.  </P> <P> Moncada has traveled to Argentina, Venezuela and Uruguay in search of scripts,  and is headed next to Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica on Oct. 11-31. The  trip is being sponsored by Partners of the Americas, a national organization  based in Washington.  </P> <P> The San Diego Repertory Theatre is continuing its commitment to Latino theater  with its annual Teatro Sin Fronteras project. The San Diego premiere of "Man of  the Flesh," by Texas playwright Octavio Solis, will play Jan. 5 to Feb. 2 in  the Lyceum Space.  </P> <P> "Man of the Flesh" replaces Ariel Dorfman's "Widows." The 20th-Century  reworking of the Don Juan story will be co-directed by San Diego Rep Producing  Director Sam Woodhouse and UC San Diego Professor Jorge Huerta, for both  English and Spanish performances.  </P> <P> In the play, Juan is a womanizing young man from the barrio who gets a  comeuppance from his mother on "El Dia de los Muertos," the Mexican "Day of the  Dead" when spirits travel between this world and the next.  </P> <P> In the English version, the all-Latino cast will be double-cast as  working-class Latino actors and upper-class Anglos from La Jolla; in the  Spanish version the cast will double as working-class Latinos and upper-class  Mexicans from La Jolla.  </P> <P> The play was commissioned by the city of Dallas in 1988, originally was  performed by Teatro Dallas, and received its professional world premiere at the  South Coast Repertory in Orange County last May.  </P> <P> Solis is working on a Spanish translation that will premiere at the Rep.  </P> <P> When "Loot" closes Saturday at the San Diego Rep, actress Suzanne Schefke will  be bidding a fond farewell to her coffin.  </P> <P> Schefke made her professional debut as the corpse of Mrs. McLeavy in Joe  Orton's black comedy, and for her, it has been anything but a "deadening"  experience.  </P> <P> It may seem an odd choice for a nurse who left that profession for acting  because she wanted to get out of what she calls "the illness" of nursing.  </P> <P> But "it's been a wonderful experience," said Schefke. "I lay still for long  periods doing shallow breathing. And it's carried over into my personal life.  Over the last few weeks, I found myself much more able to concentrate on  things."  </P> <P> Schefke gets into her coffin before the audience is allowed into the Lyceum  Stage area. She has to remain there for thirty minutes until the play starts  and then at least another 20 to 25 minutes before Jon Matthews, who plays her  son, Hal, gets the idea to hide stolen money in her coffin and hide her dead  body in the closet.  </P> <P> At that point, she has to be emptied upside down into the wardrobe. Which was  why the first question at her audition was whether she could stand on her head.  </P> <P> "Of course I said yes, because I really wanted to do this," Schefke said. "But  I didn't know if I could."  </P> <P> She does it, though, for just about a minute and a half until the wardrobe is  closed and she can sneak out through a trap door in the wall behind.  </P> <P> The experience has given her a new perspective on her chosen profession.  </P> <P> She saw a clip from Franco Zeffirelli's "Romeo and Juliet" Monday and the part  that impressed her the most was -- you guessed it -- the scene in the crypt.  </P> <P> "I thought it was just amazing that Olivia Hussey (who played Juliet) stood  still for that long. I was really impressed that I couldn't see her breathing."  </P> <P> PROGRAM NOTES: Following the model of the Bowery Theatre's arrangement with the  Kingston Hotel, NewWorks Theatre has signed an agreement with the Horton Park  Plaza Hotel to create a performance space in the basement of the hotel at E  Street and Fifth Avenue. Dick Nichols, general manager of the Horton Park  Plaza, said work needs to be done to transform the basement into a working  theater, but, "in principle, they have a home."  </P> <P> NewWorks is presenting a new play, "Afterwards," by Timothy Gerald Ash, at the  Kingston Playhouse on Mondays and Tuesdays through Sept. 25. . . .  </P> <P> The Sunday 2 p.m. performance of "My Children! My Africa!" will be  simultaneously signed in American Sign Language, preceded by a discussion of  the play by interpreters at 1 p.m. Tickets for the hearing impaired will be  available for $10. Meanwhile, a new production of Athol Fugard's play is set to  open tonight at the National Theatre of Great Britain in London. The production  will star Fugard's daughter Lisa and will go on to tour in Fugard's native  South Africa. . . .  </P> <P> Bowery Artistic Director Ralph Elias will star in the Bowery's San Diego  premiere of David Mamet's "Speed the Plow," along with Laura Rearwin and Paul  Nolan. Los Angeles-based director Frank Dwyer will direct.  </P> <P> "Starlight Express," the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical on roller skates, will  play through Sunday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center.  </P></p>

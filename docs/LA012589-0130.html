			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AST REPORTS BIG LOSS, LAYS OFF 70 WORKERS IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> AST Research Inc. in Irvine, buffeted by increasing competition in the personal  computer industry, laid off 70 Orange County workers Tuesday and reported an  $8.9-million loss for the quarter ended Dec. 30.  </P> <P> The company said it handed out pink slips Monday night and Tuesday morning to  70 management, marketing and assembly employees in Irvine. The terminations  took effect immediately.  </P> <P> Another 20 Orange County positions that were vacated last month through  attrition will not be filled, the company said.  </P> <P> In addition, AST said it is eliminating 30 positions in other areas of the  United States and overseas through a combination of layoffs and attrition,  bringing the total work force reduction to 120.  </P> <P> As of Dec. 30, AST had 1,234 employees in Orange County and 2,025 workers  worldwide. The company said the dismissed employees would receive severance  pay.  </P> <P> Several employees contacted Tuesday said they had expected the layoffs after  AST announced earlier this month that it would report a sizable loss for its  fiscal 1989 second quarter, which ended Dec. 30.  </P> <P> "There have been rumors for the last 3 weeks to a month about layoffs," said  Lloyd Allsopp, a worker at AST's Irvine manufacturing facility. Allsopp was not  laid off.  </P> <P> AST said it lost $8.9 million on revenue of $110.9 million for the 3 months.  The company earned $2 million on revenue of $92.6 million in the same quarter a  year earlier.  </P> <P> AST's announcement did not surprise Wall Street. Several high-technology  companies have announced personnel cutbacks in the last few weeks, including  Western Digital Corp. in Irvine and Wyse Technology in San Jose.  </P> <P> Western Digital, Orange County's largest technology company, said 2 weeks ago  that it will lay off 200 permanent employees and 90 contract workers in Irvine  by the end of March.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Company Has Problems'  </P> <P> "AST's action doesn't come as a surprise," said Lawrence Harris, an analyst  with the Los Angeles brokerage of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. "The company  has some problems."  </P> <P> AST President Safi Qureshey was unavailable for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Founded in 1980, AST got its start making printed circuit boards that increased  the memory and other features of IBM-compatible personal computers. Then, in  1987, AST started selling its own line of personal computers.  </P> <P> About a third of AST's second-quarter loss stems from a write-down of the  recorded value of assets of the company's Camintonn division, which makes  products for systems compatible with Digital Equipment Corp. computers.  </P> <P> AST has said it would like to sell Camintonn. The company took the write-down,  said Finance Vice President Jerry Ulrich because AST believes that the price it  eventually receives for Camintonn will be about $3 million below the stated  value of the division's assets.  </P> <P> Another $2.6-million loss reserve was booked in the second quarter to account  for the cost of employee severance packages and a drop in the value of some of  AST's inventory.  </P> <P> "Given current market conditions, we believe some of the inventory (will sell)  at a lower price than originally believed," said Ulrich.  </P> <P> The remainder of the loss was attributed to costly marketing strategies adopted  by AST to try to keep its customers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protecting Market Share  </P> <P> For example, the company began offering bulk discounts in the second quarter to  dealers who carry AST personal computers.  </P> <P> "We are still relatively new in the marketplace, and we are trying to protect  our market share," said Ulrich. "We believe in the long run that these price  incentives will pay dividends as we come into the marketplace with new  products."  </P> <P> Personal computer manufacturers other than the Big 3 -- IBM, Apple and Compaq  -- have suffered in the last 6 months as new technology has made some of their  products outdated. IBM recently started selling a type of personal computer  similar to those marketed by AST and other secondary computer makers, touching  off a price war.  </P> <P> AST's marketing strategy has been to underprice its bigger competitors. That  strategy allowed the company to capture a 13.4% of the personal computer  market, but its bottom line is beginning to be affected, analysts said.  </P> <P> "They have a good product, but there is a lot of other good product out there,"  said Jay Vleeschhouwer, an analyst with the New York brokerage of Bear Stearns.  "So the AST way to win customers was to cut prices, but it's hurt them."  </P> <P> Several analysts said AST should return to profitability in about 6 months as  some of its newer products infiltrate the marketplace.  </P> <P> AST announced the layoffs and second-quarter loss after the end of trading on  Tuesday. The company's stock closed at $8 a share, up 12.5 cents.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lucille Renwick contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama by DOMINGO </F> reporter Almiro Santos; place and date not given]    [Text] [Santos] Mr. President, you speak of an economic and  social council. What do you have in mind exactly?    [Dhlakama] We are experiencing a very serious problem.  Although it is I alone, as leader of the Mozambique National  Resistance [Renamo], who is raising this question, I think that  the Mozambican people and other opposition leaders support my  view because it is right.    In August last year, I drew up a small blueprint with a view  to creating something to be known as the Economic and Social  Council.    [Santos] Basically, what is the Economic and Social Council?    [Dhlakama] It would be a small body made up of members from  Renamo, the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo], and unarmed  opposition parties. What was my idea? It was aimed at freeing  my brother Joaquim Chissano from criticism. He and his  government have been accused of corruption and diverting state  funds. Frelimo cannot prove that it is not doing it. That is  why I proposed this council.    [Santos] What was President Chissano's reaction?    [Dhlakama] He went to the extent of saying that that would  be  a coup d'etat. I said it would not. I told him that I was  suggesting the creation of the council not because Renamo signed  the General Peace Accord, but because we are part of the  opposition and we are presently in a transition period. My  concern at this moment, as leader of the opposition, is to be  truly sure that the Mozambican Government is not misusing state  funds.    No one can assure me now and say: Look, Dhlakama, remain  calm. That is not happening. Can anyone say that what I am  saying is political propaganda? No, it is not. I think it is  now clear why the government does not want to approve such a  council. That is why, in my electoral campaign, I want to  accuse the Frelimo government of diverting state funds and  misusing state vehicles. The state and the party are not one  and the same thing, but party members here receive state  vehicles.    What is happening in Mozambique today is exactly the  opposite  of what is happening in other countries. In other countries,  state vehicles have their own registration number, but here no  one knows which are state vehicles and which ones are not.    [Santos] Very soon, state vehicles will bear the word  "state".    [Dhlakam] Yes, the government is going to do that, but I do  not know when. In the meantime, they are using the vehicles and  will continue to use them. They are violating government rules.  It is not only vehicles; there is also the question of money.  For example, I do not know how many billions and billions of  meticals are in our banks. I also do not know how many billions  of meticals the government is withdrawing daily from these banks  to sustain its policy.    Now, how can President Chissano assure me saying: Look, my  brother Dhlakama, that is not happening. He cannot. I want him  to tell me: Dhlakama, you are lying, because we are not  misusing state money and we are not diverting investment funds.  Here is the proof.    That is why I continue to demand the creation of an economic  and state council or a body with any other name. It could, for  example, be called an economic commission. What I want is that  this body should be able to control us and assure us.    [Santos] What is your fear?    [Dhlakama] My fear is: I belong to the opposition. It is  not because I do not have money. Even if I had billions and  billions of dollars, I would not allow a party to use state  funds. People can say that I am saying this because Renamo does  not have money. That is not the case. Even in the United  States or any other country, no opposition party would allow the  government to misuse state funds. That is a the rule. Here in  Mozambique, people do not understand. They think Dhlakama is  raising this issue because his party does not have money. They  want benefits. That is not the case. We do not even want to  rule with the government. What we want is to end this misuse of  funds and vehicles.    President Chissano says he is working for democracy. He says  he is making changes to usher in democracy. He is not telling  the truth because a democrat is open. He puts the cards on the  table and says: Look, I am not corrupt. I do not do what you  say I do, and here is the proof. Or he may say: I was in the  wrong, but now I have stopped doing that.    Unfortunately, Chissano cannot say this. He is still  creating conditions for me to continue to point an accusing  finger at him. I like President Chissano very much. He is a  very good friend of mine. We signed the General Peace Accord  together, but there are things that he does not accept. It is  not because he does not want to.    [Santos] What is the reason then?    [Dhlakama] I understand. The Frelimo Party is a very heavy  machinery. It has about 100 orthodox Marxists who do not  believe in democracy. I continue to insist the government  should create this opening, because we are in a transition  period and we are going to hold elections this October. I fear  that the government may be using state funds to buy vehicles,  bicycles, motorcycles, flags, and pamphlets for its political  propaganda.    [Santos] Does the Renamo president have proof or not?    [Dhlakam] It is not a question of proof. As an opposition  leader, I have to be concerned with the government's actions. I  shall only stop to criticize the government when President  Chissano says: Afonso Dhlakama was wrong. Let us investigate.  As long as he does not do that, I shall continue to criticize  the government, with proof or no proof. I want him to tell me  that I am not saying the truth. Then, a commission should be  created which will contact bank managers, even the president  himself, to prove that the Frelimo Party is not using state  funds.    [Santos] This commission you are proposing would more or  less  be a body to inspect government activities?    [Dhlakama] My brother, I would not exactly put it that way.  Now that we are in a transition period, this council would work  to control all funds. For example, let us suppose that even  today Great Britain announces that it is going to give  Mozambique $25 million for economic rehabilitation. It will be  giving that money to the Mozambican state and not the party. It  will be giving this money to be used for economic  reconstruction, to rehabilitate towns, and so on. Who is going  to tell me that that money will not be diverted from  rehabilitation projects that would benefit the people and be  used to buy vehicles for the Frelimo Party?    [Santos] Don't donors try to ensure that the money they give  is used correctly? Do they not investigate?    [Dhlakama] It is somehow difficult. We have many instances  where money has been misused. I am a Mozambican and was in the  bush for 16 years. Donors themselves know that even if they do  investigate, they cannot do it fully. What's more, it is not  only a question of controlling foreign investments in  Mozambique. There is a need also to control our own money.    I belong to the opposition. I do not know how many billions  of meticals are in our banks. I want to know. It is not  because I want that money. I just want to know how many  billions of meticals we have. I fear that the Frelimo Party may  be misusing that money. If the government says Dhlakama has no  right to know, then that is not democracy because they can  misuse this money whenever they want. There is no democratic  country worldwide where opposition concerns are not satisfied.    [Santos] You are, therefore, accusing the government?    [Dhlakama] I am not accusing Frelimo of stealing money. I am  only demanding that Frelimo should stop misusing funds if it has  been doing so in the past. For it to stop, we should create  mechanisms, such as an economic and social council.    [Santos] Your main concern now is to establish this control  mechanism?    [Dhlakama] Yes, that is my concern. I do not know how many  billions of meticals the state is getting daily through taxes,  import and export tariffs. Who is controlling this money?  Where is it? The Mozambican Government should be accountable  to Parliament, but it is not saying anything. The Assembly of  the Republic belongs to Frelimo. That is my concern.    What is more, we have thousands and thousands of houses. You  know that with independence, houses were nationalized, and  although the rents are not high, but taking into account that in  all houses throughout the country people must pay rent, the  Administration of State-Owned Buildings is receiving billions  and billions of meticals monthly. Where is this money and how  is it being used? All these houses belong to the state.    [Santos] With regard to vehicles, do you have proof that  they  are being bought with state money to be distributed to Frelimo  members?    [Dhlakama] The government is distributing new vehicles.  People, like directors, state officials, Frelimo Central  Committee members, who did not have cars before the signing of  the General Peace Accord, now have Land Rovers and Mercedes  Benz. If we total these vehicles, there are hundreds and  hundreds of them, costing billions of meticals and millions of  dollars.    Where is Frelimo getting this money? Is it really getting  this money from its funds as a party? If that is the case,  then, let it prove it. That is not all. With independence,  companies were nationalized and most of these companies belong  to the state. These companies are making money. Who is  calculating these companies' profits and in what projects is  this money being used? If it is in the bank, who knows how much  it is?    Vehicles continue to be bought. They continue to be  distributed. Frelimo has already ordered more than 600,000  bicycles and motorcycles for its political propaganda.    [Santos] You could be confusing this with what the  government  is ordering for the electoral process. The government has the  responsibility to organize the electoral process. Do you not  think all these bicycles and motorcycles were ordered so that  they can be used by the electoral commissions?    [Dhlakama] No, no. All these things are not for the  government to organize the electoral process. They are meant  for the Frelimo Party itself.    [Santos] For the electoral campaign?    [Dhlakama] Yes, for Frelimo's electoral campaign. That is  why, I am talking about bicycles, motorcycles, and money here.  This has nothing to do with the National Elections Commission  [CNE]. The fund for the CNE's operation comes from donations  from the international community. I, as the leader of the  opposition, have a representative in this body. My concern is  to know where Frelimo gets its money.    [Santos] Perhaps from its companies....    [Dhlakama] I agree that any party can have its companies.  Frelimo has members who already have their own private  companies. We have nothing to do with that. If there is a  minister who has a company and gives his profits to the Frelimo  Party, we have no problem with that. We are also going to do  that. So that is not what we are talking about. We are talking  about all these buildings that we have. For example, the Rovuma  Hotel gets thousands and thousands of dollars each month. We  hear that the hotel belongs to the Frelimo Party. How is that  possible? How did the Frelimo Party buy it? From whom and  when? All we know is that all the hotels in the country were  nationalized.    [Santos] But your concern, Mr. President, are the thousands  of dollars from the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] that  end up in Frelimo coffers?    [Dhlakama] If we count all the months that have passed, we  shall see that thousands and thousands of Unomoz dollars have  ended up in Frelimo coffers.    [Santos] Now, you do not believe that the Rovuma Hotel  belongs to Frelimo Party?    [Dhlakama] I do not believe that it belongs to Frelimo,  because I know that it is one of the hotels that was  nationalized by the state. Now when the government says that  this or that belongs to the Frelimo Party, that raises  questions: When did the party buy it? Who received the money,  to confirm that the Frelimo Party has truly bought it? There  are many questions that we can raise. My concern is that the  Frelimo Party should stop using state funds. If it wants to  continue using state funds, then these funds should be divided  among the parties -- the Frelimo Party, Renamo, and all other  opposition parties. The Frelimo Party is not the state. It is  just a party.    [Santos] Is this situation the result of the single-party  system that existed in the country, where the party was confused  with the state?    [Dhlakama] That could be the case, but Frelimo now is  grabbing everything.    [Santos] Everything?    [Dhlakama] Yes, everything. For example, now there is  confusion. We do not know what belongs to the state and what  belongs to Frelimo. Houses were nationalized in favor of the  state. Now, we see Frelimo ministers privatizing them among  themselves. Everyone knows this. Frelimo knows that with a  multiparty national assembly, everything must be made clear.  What are they doing? They are grabbing everything, and this  worries me.    Things here are privatized among Frelimo party officials.  For example, they say that they want to sell a state building  for 3 billion meticals. A common citizen cannot even get 10  million meticals. This is only meant to deceive people.  Someone could win the bid, but where is he going to get 3  billion meticals?    [Santos] He can go to the bank....    [Dhlakama] He will keep going to the bank for three or four  days without getting any money. Then they will tell him the  deadline is over. Since you have no money, you cannot buy the  building. But when it is a Frelimo official, it is just a  matter of lifting the telephone and calling the bank. He does  not even need to withdraw the money. He will just fill the  forms, and then register as having bought the building. That is  not democracy.    [Santos] It is corruption?    [Dhlakama] It is not even corruption. It is not. It is  disorganization and total disrespect for the Mozambican people.    [Santos] And opportunism?    [Dhlakama] They want to take advantage of everything. They  continue to take advantage. I think this is to deny our people  democracy. They fear democracy, because a person who does not  fear democracy creates conditions for others to operate.    For example, we were all against "apartheid" in South  Africa,  but our black brother Mandela, African National Congress [ANC]  president, is now participating.    [Santos] In the case of Mozambique, the participation that  you are referring to, would be a transitional government?    [Dhlakama] Mandela is not in a transitional government. He  does not have ministers in the white government, but a mechanism  has been created to control everything. Today, the white  government can no longer use 20 rands from the state funds  without the ANC saying yes. When Mandela makes this demand, it  is not because he does not trust the white government. This is  what it should be in democracy. He does not want the white  government to use state funds, and the entire international  community supports Mandela's stand. Why is my stand not also  supported? Is the South African democracy different from ours?    [Santos] Regarding the creation of an Economic and Social  Council, does the president of the republic continue to think  that it is a coup d'etat?    [Dhlakama] Now, I do not know. I raised this issue one week  ago, and yesterday (Friday) I read in the newspaper that he is  out of the country. That was his reply at that time.    [Santos] You mean last August?    [Dhlakama] Yes, last year. He told me in a conversation, as  a brother, that that would be a coup d'etat. I said: No, Mr.  President, it is not. That is democracy. You are being  criticized and how can you tell the people not to criticize you?    I even said to him: I am insisting on this to save your  image, Mr. President.    [Santos] You mean the Renamo president wanted to save the  image of the president of the Republic?    [Dhlakama] Yes, certainly, that is what I want, because I am  always criticizing him. When will this bad image then disappear  from the people's minds? Only when he says that he is tired of  being accused of doing something that is not true.    [Santos] But of what do you accuse him exactly?    [Dhlakama] I say his government is using state funds. When  he says that he is tired of being accused of doing something  that he is not doing, then a commission should be created, made  up of some economists from Renamo and the opposition. This  commission will go to the bank and see the figures, it will see  the state vehicles and then say: "Look, we are not using these  vehicles for political campaign. We are using them as state  vehicles."    I agree that an administrator needs to have a Land Rover, as  a state official, but I do not agree that a Frelimo Party first  secretary in a district should move about saying: Long live  Frelimo. I mean....    [Santos] Is it not the same thing for a Frelimo Party first  secretary to have a vehicle and a Renamo provincial delegate to  also have a vehicle and move about....    [Dhlakama] That is not the case. It is only now that Renamo  is trying to buy vehicles. There are not even 20 vehicles. Our  delegates move about on foot because we do not have vehicles for  them to visit districts. We now want to buy vehicles for the  party.    [Santos] But are there Renamo delegates with vehicles?    [Dhlakama] It is possible that there are delegates with  vehicles, but the vehicles are identified as theirs. If there  is a Frelimo secretary who has bought a vehicle with his own  money, we have no problem with that. What we know up to now is  that all Frelimo Party officials use state vehicles. That is  why the government does not even want to come up with a  registration number to identify these vehicles as state vehicles.    [Santos] In brief, this concern is because of elections. Do  you think elections will still be held in the country this  October?    [Dhlakama] My concern is not only because of elections. This  concern was presented last August. The cease-fire came into  force in 1992. I was waiting to come to Maputo to present this  concern. I could not do it from Maringue. When I came here for  the first time, I presented my concern. Answering the last part  of your question, I believe we shall have elections in 1994.    [Santos] Even with delays in confining troops?    [Dhlakama] It is true that the confinement process is behind  schedule, but it is Frelimo that is delaying the confinement  process. It does not want to confine its troops.    [Santos] What is the reason? Do you have any explanation?    [Dhlakama] Since I do not belong to Frelimo, I do not know  the true reason behind this behavior, but I believe it is  because of disorganization in the army. I do not want to make a  serious accusation that Frelimo may be preparing another war,  because it does not possess the capacity to do it. A Mozambican  Army does not exist now. It does not exist. All that Frelimo  has are men with weapons. There are thousands of men with  weapons, military ranks, and so on. But an army, as an organ,  does not exist.    I know that Minister Chipande does not know where his troops  are. I know that the chief of the General Staff does not know  where his troops are. Army Chief Tobias Dai does not know where  troops are.    Military commanders live in apartments with their families  while soldiers are scattered.    [Santos] That means therefore that the problem of delay in  confining troops is not a political problem?    [Dhlakama] First, I am saying that it is a problem of  disorganization. Who gives orders to whom? Who begins to give  orders? For example, President Chissano, who is the commander  in chief of the Armed Forces, gives orders to whom? Does he  give orders to the defense minister, the army commander, or the  chief of the General Staff? These in turn, give orders to whom?  To the provincial commanders. But where are they? They live  in apartments while the troops are in barracks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Imre Szekeres, executive deputy  chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], if the MSZP  wins the elections, the return of the nomenclature which existed  four years ago is out of the question. Szekeres, speaking on  the "Sunrise" program on Hungarian television, confirmed that  even if the MSZP obtains the absolute majority of the votes, it  would consider it necessary to have the broadest possible  coalition government. Although many expect it, the MSZP does  not intend to bring the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] into the government. The reason for this is the KDNP's  performance over the past four years.    Imre Szekeres and Ivan Petoe, chairman of the Alliance of  Free Democrats, who also participated in the TV program, both  agreed that the tone of the elections ought not to change in the  second round. In their view, the voters should concentrate on  the individual candidates of the parties, and it would be  desirable if these candidates could have an opportunity to  introduce themselves to the electorate on Channel 1 of Hungarian  Television, and not only on cable television.</p>

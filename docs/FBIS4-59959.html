			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has arrived in Washington for  wide-ranging talks with President Clinton. During his stay in  the U.S. capital, Mr. Narasimha Rao will meet the decision  makers and exchange views on bilateral and international  matters. He will address the joint meeting of the U.S. Congress  today. The Rao-Clinton talks tomorrow are expected to break new  ground in bilateral relations. This will be their first meeting  and also the first high-level contact between the two countries  since the end of the cold war. Expansion of economic  cooperation and better appreciation of each other's stand on  issues like nuclear nonproliferation are likely to be the focus.  Indian officials say that the Clinton Administration wanted the  summit meeting to cover the situation in Russia, the role of the  United Nations in peacekeeping, and the Nonaligned Movement.    Shortly before leaving for Washington, Mr. Narasimha Rao  said  in Boston that an important purpose of his current visit is to  invite America to join the Indian efforts for speedy  industrialization and infrastructure development. Delivering  the (Joe Deddy) memorial lecture at the Harvard University, the  prime minister said true North-South cooperation demands  collaboration between the developed countries which have a huge  research and development base and the developing countries. He  also called for development of new technologies that can result  in creation of maximum number of jobs at minimum cost. The (Joe  Deddy) memorial lecture established in 1955 is for the promotion  of tolerance, understanding, and goodwill among the nations,  particularly the East and the West. Rajiv Gandhi and V.S.  Naipaul were the prominent personalities who delivered the  lecture in the past. The prime minister spoke at length about  the Indian scene and the economic reform process. He said  globalization of economies should be on the basis of partnership  and should be a smooth affair. Amid lusty cheers from the  audience, Mr. Rao declared that despite occasional clashes and  agitations India will remain united with its unmatched  attractions.    The former U.S. ambassador to India and noted economist,  Professor Galbraith, introducing the prime minister to the 1,000  strong student audience said India is America's most enduring  friend. Prof. Galbraith said the bilateral relations are deep  rooted and the so-called concerns belong to the realm of  bureaucrats.</p>

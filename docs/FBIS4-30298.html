			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies have been  held in different parts of Korea to denounce the Japanese  reactionaries' suppression of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan.    Rallies took place in Kaesong adjacent to the Military  Demarcation Line and Sariwon, the seat of North Hwanghae  Province, on June 22 and 23.    The speakers at the rallies denounced the recent raid on the  office of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by  Japanese police and its search of 27 places including houses of  Chongnyon officials on charges of "violation of the national  land utilization law" as a brigandish fascist outrage and  political suppression which was committed in broad daylight on  no reasonable ground.    They strongly demanded the Japanese authorities ponder over  the grave consequences that might arise from their anti-DPRK,  anti-Chongnyon campaign, immediately stop such barbaric acts,  sincerely apologize for all their crimes and punish the  criminals.    They urged the Japanese authorities to ensure the Chongnyon  officials and Koreans in Japan all legitimate rights and  treatment as foreigners and fully guarantee their human rights  according to the principles of international law and  international usage.</p>

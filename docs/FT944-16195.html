			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Cause for mild celebration The weakness of the Berlusconi government is in stark contrast to the strength of the Italian economy, which is now recovering faster from recession than any other in Europe. Gross domestic product has registered growth in three consecutive quarters. The latest figures, covering April-June, show that the economy grew by 2.3 per cent over the quarter compared with the same period in 1993. All the indicators point to strengthening of demand - from a pick-up in investment, to increased imports and a rise in domestic consumption. The revived fortunes of Fiat, the Turin-based automotive group, is typical of the turnround in industry: Fiat claims the worst is over, with sharp increases in sales and a return to profit. Small and medium-sized businesses say they are flush with export orders from machine tools to shoes. The only area where the recession is still biting is in the south. But this reflects the problems of the state-controlled companies that are so important to the southern economy and the reduced flow of public funds to the mezzogiorno. Though the picture is still patchy nationwide, employment levels overall are beginning to stabilise. However, unemployment remains high in the south, often double the 6-7 per cent levels in the north. The Berlusconi government has been in office for too short a time to claim much credit for what has occurred. The recovery has been export-led since the middle of last year, and dates back to the boost given to foreign sales by the devaluation of the lira in September 1992. Nevertheless the government has been anxious to stimulate the recovery. Mr Berlusconi insists that the overall tax level should not be raised above the 1993-94 level. He instinctively feels that higher growth is the best way to boost treasury receipts, rather than higher taxes. Accordingly, he has provided tax breaks to encourage new investment and jobs. The government has also helped the construction sector by unfreezing the 18-month-old block on public works, imposed as a result of the corruption scandals uncovered in the placing of contracts for such work. The rapid return to growth provides further evidence of the traditional resilience of the economy, especially its productive base. It also confirms the old adage that the economy grows in spite of 53 postwar governments - not because of them. However, economic growth is still shaped by high interest rates, which are 4 percentage points higher than German rates. So long as Italy retains a large stock of public sector debt - currently more than 125 per cent of GDP - interest rates cannot easily be brought in line with the main EU partners. The perceived weakness of the government has seen consistent speculation against the lira since July. In mid-August, the Bank of Italy raised the discount rate by half a percentage point. One consequence of this increase is that the cost of servicing the government's debt will exceed the projection in the 1995 budget. Further political instability is bound to mitigate against a lowering of rates. A second reason for the summer's interest rate rise was to curb inflationary pressures. Since July, inflation has edged up beyond the budget projections to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent. With the economic recovery stronger than expected, this could put further pressure on prices. Few believe Italy can achieve the 2.5 per cent inflation target set by the government for the end of 1995. A central element in reducing the rate of inflation has been wage moderation, with wages having declined in real terms since 1992. A new spirit of pragmatism was enshrined in the July 1993 agreement between the government, unions and employers under which the unions agreed to link wage rises to productivity. They also dropped wage indexation - automatic increases in line with inflation - in return for government commitments on better job training and investment in R&amp;D. However, the confrontation between the government and the unions over the 1995 budget is likely to put considerable strain on this accord.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAVENS VS. TORTOISES  </P> <P> The desert tortoise faces extinction unless there is a program to kill off at  least some of the common ravens that are killing an increasing number of the  reptiles, a detailed government study has concluded. Public responses to a  proposed program to reduce raven populations are due by Feb. 13.  </P> <P> Experts from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the California Department  of Fish and Game have collaborated in drawing up a detailed assessment of the  situation and offering the options.  </P> <P> At the foundation of the problem are the intrusions of people that have so  changed the environment that ravens, rare in the area only 40 years ago, are  rapidly increasing. The birds now are a major cause of the dangerous decline in  the tortoise. Both state and federal officials have proposed the tortoise for  the endangered-species list.  </P> <P> "Over 80 individual desert tortoise shells have been found under single raven  nests," the scientists report.  </P> <P> The only way to save the tortoises is to under-take a supervised program of  poisoning and shooting ravens, with controls to minimize or eliminate the risk  of affecting other wildlife in the areas of the Mojave Desert that are  involved, according to the report.  </P> <P> Wildlife experts tell us that this is not the first time that a program has  been proposed to kill one species to save another. Arctic foxes were killed  with poison and gunfire to protect the Aleutian Canada goose, an Audubon  Society official recalled. "You need to be darned careful, and it seldom  works," he said, adding that "killing ravens is like bailing out the ocean."  </P> <P> But it seems to us that this plan is worth trying. The report reflects a  painstaking effort to assess all the risks and alternatives. It will be  important to remember, however, that ravens are not the only threat to the  tortoise. Off-road vehicles used in uncontrolled fashion are another serious  threat -- a fresh argument to get on with proposals for expanded protection of  the California desert.  </P></p>

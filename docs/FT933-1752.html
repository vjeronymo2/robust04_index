			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CI makes Pounds 0.91m in difficult trading CI GROUP, the steel and engineering combine, reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 905,000 for the six months ended July 31 1993, compared with Pounds 860,000 adjusting for FRS 3. Mr Patrick McTighe, chairman, said overall sales were held at Pounds 35.3m but at the expense of margins. Operating profit fell from Pounds 2.19m to Pounds 1.35m but was maintained at a similar level to the second half of last year. Interest payable dropped 24 per cent to Pounds 375,000. Exceptional items of Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 101,000) were charged and the previous half year suffered a Pounds 558,000 loss on sale of discontinued operations. The chairman said the outlook for those sectors which affected group business was 'still far from clear' and progress for the rest of the year was likely to remain constrained. Given current trading conditions it could well be the latter part of the financial year, at the earliest, before 'we see the benefit of any recovery,' he added. Earnings per share for the half year came to 0.69p (same). The interim dividend is 0.4p (0.825p).</p>

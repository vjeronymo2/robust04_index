			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Christophe Beaudufe] </F>   [Text] Bonn, Feb 21 (AFP) -- European and U.S. experts on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, boosted by the success of the NATO ultimatum  against the Bosnian Serbs, meet here on Tuesday [22 February]  with their Russian counterparts to build on the momentum gained  to seek a political solution to the conflict there.    Within two hours of the expiry of the ultimatum, U.S.  President Bill Clinton declared: "The NATO decision and its  results provide new potential for progress toward an end to the  tragic conflict in Bosnia."    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel added here: "We should  make use of this fortunate moment to ensure that this first test  will be transformed into a global solution."    The Bonn meeting will bring together foreign ministry  representatives from Germany, France, Britain, Belgium, Greece,  Russia and the United States. The U.S. delegation will be  headed by Clinton's special envoy for Bosnia, Charles Redman,  who has stepped up contacts with the warring sides in the past  week.    The meeting is being held at Russia's request and reflects  Russia's return to the stage of international diplomacy  alongside the major powers, diplomatic sources here said.    They pointed out the emergence of a new rivalry between the  Russians and the Americans, now directly involved in the Bosnian  crisis. Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev called last  Friday for a meeting along the lines of the one to be held in  Bonn.    The U.S. State Department greeted the proposal with extreme  caution.    Diplomats will be charged with smoothing out the differences  of view that have appeared in the past few days. The West,  particularly the Europeans, are set on promoting a negotiated  solution, come what may, on the basis of the European plan which  envisages Bosnia being partitioned into three mini-states, and  do not intend to allow themselves to be deflected by Moscow.    But Russia, which has said it is ready to send 400 more  paratroops into Sarajevo in the framework of the UN operation,  in addition to the 400 already sent, could make its influence  felt on the content of the negotiations because of its influence  over the Bosnian Serbs.    With the shifting of the focus for negotiations to Germany,  Bonn will be able to play a stronger mediating role. "The goal  for we Germans has been above all to include Russia" in the  negotiating process, Kinkel emphasised Monday.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl made several telephone calls to  Russian President Boris Yeltsin before the NATO ultimatum  expired at 0000 GMT Monday with the objective of persuading  Yeltsin to accept NATO's decision. He also spoke of organising  an international conference on Bosnia, for which the Bonn  meeting could do the groundwork.    The Germans hosted a Croat-Bosnian summit in early January  and have good relations with both non-Serb parties to the  conflict. They have been working behind the scenes to facilitate  a rapprochement, "essential for a political solution" of the  conflict, according to Kinkel.    On Saturday Croat and Moslem Bosnian negotiators met in  Frankfurt and announced that their positions had drawn closer  after a day of talks on putting relations on a "lasting basis."    In the Netherlands, Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans  supported the idea of applying a NATO ultimatum to Tuzla and  Srebrenica, but said "I think it would be very desirable if a  decision of this kind could also be taken with regard to Mostar."    He said the situation in government-held eastern Mostar was  "very serious and an ultimatum could also have a positive effect  there."    Koojimans, interviewed on Dutch radio from Hilversum, said  he  thought it was "too early today to speak of a decisive turning  point towards peace."    "We have seen too often what we thought we had achieved  collapse and as long as shots are heard, we should maintain the  ultimatum in force."    "We should also be certain that all heavy weaponry has  really  been withdrawn," he added.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOHNSON IS SHARP IN UCLA SCRIMMAGE  </P> <P> Freshman quarterback Bret Johnson completed 13 of 17 passes for 166 yards  Saturday in the Rose Bowl in UCLA's first full-scale scrimmage of fall  practice.  </P> <P> The Bruins' other would-be starting quarterback, sophomore Jim Bonds, completed  10 of 15 passes for 96 yards.  </P> <P> "I thought both quarterbacks did some really nice things," said Coach Terry  Donahue, who is not expected to name a starter until the week before UCLA opens  its season Sept. 9 against Tennessee.  </P> <P> Johnson led the only two scoring drives, moving the offense 50 yards and then  55 yards to touchdowns.  </P> <P> The first touchdown was scored on a 22-yard run by Ricky Davis, a freshman  tailback from Germantown, Md., who carried 22 times for 125 yards, in the  absence of Brian Brown and Shawn Wills, who sat out with minor injuries. Brown  had a slight concussion Friday in practice and Wills sprained an ankle  Thursday.  </P> <P> Kevin Williams, the Bruins' ballyhooed freshman tailback, carried 15 times for  24 yards.

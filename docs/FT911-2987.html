			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (31): Saints' plan illustrates the intermediary trap - Savings Schemes / Even direct investors must pay commission - Investment trusts THERE is a risk that investment trust savings schemes may lose their status as one of the cheapest ways of buying into the stock market. The danger results from the trusts' attempts to widen their appeal by selling via financial intermediaries. Intermediaries have tended to favour unit trusts in the past, for the understandable reason that they receive a 3 per cent commission for doing so. The natural response is for investment trusts to do the same. A number of management groups have started to offer intermediaries a 3 per cent commission for introducing new client funds. One of the most recent to do so was the Scottish American Investment Company (Saints). But the payment of commission raises a number of difficult questions, many of which are related to the concept of 'best advice' which intermediaries are supposed to provide. Saints, for example, has had to decree that all investors who buy shares via lump-sum investments in the savings scheme will have to pay commission, whether they get advice from a financial intermediary or not. Otherwise, intermediaries would be obliged, under best-advice guidelines, to tell prospective investors to buy their shares independently. This is bad news for those who wanted to use the Saints scheme as a cheap way of buying into the trust, since new investors, and not existing shareholders, pay the commission. The difficulties do not end there. Some discount brokers charge as little as 1.25 per cent for making a sale or purchase of shares. Saints makes a Pounds 10 charge for selling. So buying and selling, say, Pounds 5,000 of shares through a discount broker would cost Pounds 125; but Pounds 160 through the Saints scheme. (Stamp duty would also be payable in both cases). How can it be 'best advice' for the intermediary to recommend the scheme in such an instance? And for a small sum of Pounds 1,000, even a broker charging 1.85 per cent would be cheaper than the scheme. It has been argued that the trust's shares will go up, and that when the investor comes to sell, he might well be paying 1.25 per cent of a much larger sum. A 3 per cent upfront charge could thus in the long run be cheaper. However, this is a difficult argument to sustain. Using a Pounds 1,000 sum as an example, the investor would pay Pounds 12.50 upfront via a discount broker, against Pounds 30 via the Saints scheme. For the total of broker commissions to be larger than the Pounds 40 total of Saints charges, the shares would have to rise in value to Pounds 2,280. It is hard to believe that the financial intermediary will make that calculation - and even if he did, he certainly will not be able to guarantee such a rise. Of course, there is a significant danger that the shares could go down. In any case, it is hardly 'best advice' to tell clients to pay a high charge upfront, given the time value of money. But the most telling argument that this system runs counter to 'best advice' is the fact that not all investment trusts pay commissions. The investor who buys through the Saints scheme is starting off with almost a 3 per cent disadvantage, compared with the investor who buys via the savings scheme of another which does not pay commission. The charge in the Foreign &amp; Colonial savings scheme, for example, is only 0.2 per cent. The investor will only be better off if Saints performs better than other trusts which do not pay commission. But how can the intermediary be sure it will do so? Past performance provides no proof. An investor who placed Pounds 1,000 in Saints on January 1, 1980, would have seen his capital grow (ignoring dividends) to around Pounds 5,000; the same amount invested in Foreign &amp; Colonial would have grown to over Pounds 8,000. The upshot of all this is that it is hard to see any justification for an adviser's recommending a client to buy trust shares via a commission-paying scheme. The private investor, if recommended a trust by an intermediary, should establish whether or not he is being charged commission. Intermediaries want to make a living and put food on their family tables; that is understandable. But if private investors want to be charitable, they should give to charity; if they want to buy investment trust shares, they should use a non-commission paying savings scheme.</p>

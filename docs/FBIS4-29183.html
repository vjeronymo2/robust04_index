			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Hisao Tonedate] </F>   [Text] Capetown, 14 Jun -- South African Trade Minister  Tleber Manuel [name as published] granted an interview to a  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Capetown. During the  interview, the minister indicated an intention to visit Japan  this year to hold talks with Japanese leaders on measures to  increase trade with Japan and Japanese investment in the  country, following similar talks with the United States and the  European Union (EU). He stated that, in addition to investment  in resources-related industries, South Africa hopes that direct  foreign investment will lead to an improvement of the social  infrastructure in such areas as housing construction,  electrification, and water supply as well as in tourism, to  which the Mandela administration is attaching importance.    Both the United States and the EU have moved toward closer  trade relations with South Africa. For example, they have  decided to apply general preferential duties to the country,  which has put an end to its apartheid policy following a  constituent parliamentary election in April. In showing  interest in consultations with Japan, the trade minister stated:  "Japan has been positively investing in foreign nations, and it  has enjoyed trade surpluses." He expressed hope that Japan will  help revitalize the South African economy by promoting both  investment and trade.</p>

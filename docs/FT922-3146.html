			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / NHS to rule on 'gagging' GUIDELINES are to be drawn up by the Department of Health over 'whistle blowing' by NHS staff worried about possible malpractice or poor patient care. The guidance, expected to be issued later this year, will make clear how NHS employees can speak out about their worries. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is expected to give details of the move in a speech to NHS managers today. NHS staff have claimed their contracts prevent them from going public about poor conditions. Two months ago, Mrs Bottomley refused nurses' demands to outlaw 'gagging clauses' which are being introduced in NHS trust contracts. She told the Royal College of Nursing annual congress that staff had a duty of confidentiality. Nurses should not go running to the press. Any concern about possible malpractice should be reported to their managers first, she said. It is understood Mrs Bottomley has accepted there is a 'serious problem' and that guidance is needed on the issue. Mr Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, yesterday told health chiefs to abandon 'macho' bully-boy sackings and to seek alternatives to dismissals. His order follows a spate of firings of middle-ranking managers which, he said, created a climate of 'fear and despair' in the health service. Mr Nichol told the Institute of Health Service Managers at its conference in Bournemouth: 'In my book, there is no place for the 'clear the desk tomorrow' syndrome.' Staff must be treated 'fairly and with dignity'. NHS reforms placed new emphasis on performance appraisal and increased pressure on managers to meet targets, he said. This was no excuse for sacking low performers when more suitable posts could be found for them. Mr Nichol said the problem had become 'more widespread' in the last 12 months. It was not confined to any one region but was seen right across the health service. A hotline set up by the institute for staff anxious about their future was now receiving four times as many calls as a few months ago.</p>

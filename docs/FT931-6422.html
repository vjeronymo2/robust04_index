			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: China in US talks on Gatt entry SENIOR Chinese and US officials yesterday focused on conditions for China's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at talks in Beijing. It was the highest level contact between the US and China since the change of administration in Washington.

China was a founding member of Gatt in 1948, the year before the communists swept the US-supported nationalists from power. Formal consultations between Beijing and Washington on Gatt accession - China launched its bid to rejoin Gatt in 1986 - were suspended after the 1989 Tiananmen episode in which hundreds of democracy protesters died in an army crackdown.</p>

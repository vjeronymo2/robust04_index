			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / News at Ten pledge demanded THE Independent Television Commission is to demand that the eight ITV companies which proposed keeping News at Ten at its traditional time when they applied for new licences should stick to their commitment. The companies have since said they want to move ITN to an earlier slot so that films and dramas can be shown without interruption after 9pm. Sir George Russell, ITC chairman, and the other members were unanimous on Thursday that News at Ten was a cornerstone of quality on ITV. They intend to do everything they can to keep it at its present time. The stance means that a clash between the ITC and the ITV companies seems likely, although no formal proposal of any kind has yet been put to the commission. A formal proposal to move News at Ten will go before the ITV council on July 5 with 6.30pm the current favourite time. ITV has to show the programme in prime time, which is defined as being between 6pm and 10.30pm. If the commission is able to hold even one ITV company to a promise to retain News at Ten, that could be enough to prevent the programme moving. The rules state that the main news programme should be broadcast simultaneously throughout the ITV system. There is no doubt that Sir George is prepared to take tough action to maintain what the commission views as quality in ITV. Some ITV chairmen are happy to use the threat of News at 6.30 as a lever to win a compromise  - News at 10.30. This too will be resisted by the commission, which believes that 10.30 is too late to begin the flagship news programme. If the commission stands firm on News at Ten the issue could end in the courts. All the ITV companies which supported News at Ten in their applications  - some with qualifications  - have received, or will receive, letters from Mr David Glencross, the commission's chief executive, asking why they have all apparently changed their minds only six months into new 10-year broadcasting licences. ITV argues that the proposal for an earlier evening news is part of a detailed review of the entire network schedule. According to ITV analysis, between 10pm and 11pm it loses its lead to the BBC  - in May, for instance, ITV's audience share fell to 35 per cent compared with 46 per cent in the previous hour. The ITV companies argue that an earlier main news plus an extra bulletin, probably at 11pm, would result in more evening news on the network. TSMS, the UK's largest television airtime sales house, clients of which include Central and Anglia, yesterday signed a co-operation deal with the Paris-based Information et Publicite for advertising sales and research across Europe.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Burmese junta to strengthen its power Demoralised Burmese opposition leaders said yesterday there was little they could do to stop the military junta securing a new constitution that would give the armed forces a dominant role in future governments, writes Victor Mallet in Rangoon. Burma's ruling generals, known collectively as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), moved a step closer to their goal of constitutional power with the opening in Rangoon of the latest session of a national convention to draft the constitution. The Slorc - which jailed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi more than four years ago and ignored the results of the 1990 election won overwhelmingly by her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) - has already engineered a series of 'constitutional objectives' which include a leading role for the military. Most of the outspoken NLD members who might have been delegates at the convention have been imprisoned, exiled or disqualified; others have been cowed into submission and silence by threats of jail and worse. One NLD delegate, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, expressed concern that the armed forces were adopting tactics like those of the military in Indonesia to entrench and legitimise their influence. 'There is no discussion here,' he said in the convention hall. 'It goes according to their (the armed forces') will. They say it's settled.' Asked why the emasculated NLD bothered to continue, the official replied: 'What alternative is there? We have to keep our political platform. If we fail to attend this, most probably they will disband our party.' He acknowledged, however, that the remnants of the NLD could achieve 'more or less nothing'. Burma's armed forces appear to be in a stronger position than they have enjoyed for several years. Ethnic rebel groups along the borders have agreed to negotiate ceasefires after decades of fighting, and the economy, with the help of Thai, Singaporean and other investors, has started to recover after a long period of stagnation and decline.</p>

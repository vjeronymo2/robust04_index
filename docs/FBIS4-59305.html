			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial, AL-BA'TH discusses the U.S.  secretary of state's new tour in the region. It says: It is  almost certain that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  will return to the region next Saturday [14 May] and that his  tour may be limited to shuttle missions between Syria and Israel  in an attempt, as he has said, to activate the stagnant peace  talks and, hence, crystallize a formula that will push the peace  process forward.    It is well known that the U.S. secretary was in the region  not long ago. In that tour, he tried to bring about some  progress on the Israeli-Syrian track. That objective, however,  was not achieved because of the Israeli position that remained  unchanged, refusing to abide by the resolutions of international  legitimacy, on whose basis the peace process was started.  Several Western, and even Israeli media organs, have reported  the U.S. Administration's dismay over the proposals which  Christopher conveyed to Syria.    The paper believes the U.S. Administration has felt that the  Israeli proposals are unable to push the peace process in the  direction of achieving the just and comprehensive peace.  Therefore, one can say that the Israeli proposals, as stressed  by Syria, aim only to escape blame and do not serve the peace  process and the conditions for its success. They only mean a  new attempt to circumvent the peace process as a whole.    AL-BA'TH adds: If the peace process is to follow its correct  path, then Israel should announce its complete and absolute  compliance with the implementation of the resolutions of  international legitimacy as an initial and basic step to achieve  progress that would in turn achieve the desired peace.    The paper adds: Anything else would mean that Israel is  continuing with the policy of maneuvering and procrastination  out of its belief that it may be able to achieve other  agreements, similar to the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Here, we  must stress once again that Syria, which is working very  seriously on achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the  region, will continue to reject the incomplete peace, the peace  that would not return rights to their rightful owners.    AL-BA'TH concludes: We hope that Christopher's new tour will  carry practical ideas to activate the stagnant peace process and  place the region on the path of the just and comprehensive peace.    On the same subject, TISHRIN says in an editorial entitled  "Christopher and the Israeli Obstacle:" : Rabin's government  opposes any move toward the genuine peace, even if such a move  comes from Washington. Warren Christopher knows this fact and  knows for certain that Rabin's government has always sought to  undermine the Madrid formula and suspended the Washington talks.  He also knows that Israel abhors the principle of just and  comprehensive settlement and prefers, instead, to sign separate,  secret deals, similar to the one it struck with the PLO, that  would give Israel everything, deprive the Arabs of their rights,  and maintain the Israeli occupation and hegemony in the region.  Therefore, the results of Christopher's forthcoming tour will  not be different from those of previous tours if the United  States continues to refuse to apply pressure on Israel and  continues to supply it with all kinds of advanced weapons.    TISHRIN adds: President Clinton's administration has  announced its compliance with the principle of comprehensive  settlement that is based on the UN resolutions. Syria and the  other Arab parties have responded positively to that U.S. trend.  Only Israel rejected that principle and undermined all the  opportunities that were made available in the region to achieve  the just and permanent peace. This is the reality, which  Washington is certainly aware of. It also knows that the  Israeli obstacle is the one that prevented any success in the  U.S. initiative and progress in the peace process.    The paper believes that if the U.S. secretary wants his  forthcoming tour to succeed, then his efforts must be directed  toward removing this obstacle and overcoming the difficulties  which the Rabin government is fabricating in the face of the  peace process.    The paper adds: This will only be achieved when Washington  translates its peace intentions into reality and abandons the  mailman role and exercises real pressure on Rabin's government  to force it to accept the principles for establishing a just and  comprehensive peace in the region.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: If the U.S. secretary manages  to remove the Israeli obstacle and the mines which the Rabin  government has placed on the path of peace, then the chances for  success in his mission will certainly be guaranteed. Only then  will the region enter a new era of the comprehensive and just  peace that will end all forms of aggression, injustice, and  occupation.</p>

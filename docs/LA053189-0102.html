			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Bulgaria took the offensive at the opening session of an international human  rights conference in Paris by blaming Turkey for recent violence involving  Bulgaria's ethnic Turks. The monthlong conference, the first of three mandated  by the Vienna review committee of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, is to review human rights progress among the 35 signatories of the 1975  Helsinki accords. In one of the first speeches, Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Petur T. Mladenov accused "foreign circles" -- a reference to Turkey -- of  being behind recent disturbances in his country in which ethnic Turks  reportedly have been killed. Bulgaria has recently deported an estimated 300  ethnic Turks.  </P></p>

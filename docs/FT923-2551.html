			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Mortgages safe until next week MORTGAGE lenders reacted with dismay at the prospect of a sharp increase in mortgage interest rates yesterday, but said the market was in such disarray that no decision about a new rate could be taken before next week. Halifax and Abbey National, the largest mortgage lenders, forestalled a mortgage rate rise by small lenders by indicating swiftly that they would not raise rates immediately. There were widespread fears that any tentative recovery in the housing market could be seriously set back even though the higher level in lending rates is to be limited to 12 per cent. 'Confidence is bound to be damaged,' said Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive of National Westminster Bank, the UK's second biggest bank. Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, the biggest bank, said that 'some companies may go down' if economic recovery is delayed. Leading UK industrialists reacted with dismay yesterday to the rise in interest rates before the announcement last night that the second increase would not take place. They also expressed fears that this would deal a further blow to consumer demand and deepen the recession. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'We are disappointed that the government has been blown off course by the currency markets. 'We think the Government should urgently restore some certainty to its financial policy, because the absence of clear guidelines will further weaken business confidence and the prospects for economic recovery.' Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'This crisis demonstrates the need for a single currency in Europe. But what is essential now for the UK - irrespective of what happens to the pound - is to formulate an industrial strategy which will promote recovery and sustained economic success.' A minority, led by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, the industrial conglomerate, argued that sterling should be taken out of the ERM entirely. 'These are war conditions. We have to know what we are fighting for. Is it a British pound or a D-Mark pound?' Sir Owen said. 'If we start to devalue, all the precedents say we don't know what the rate should be. If we float, we know what the real value is for the British pound and call up the troops.' Most industrialists reluctantly accepted, however, that the government had little choice but to act as it did and supported its efforts to defend sterling's parity within the European exchange rate mechanism. For most businesses the most pressing concern was the outlook for demand. Some argued that, almost regardless of what happened next, yesterday's events had inflicted a devastating blow to consumer demand.</p>

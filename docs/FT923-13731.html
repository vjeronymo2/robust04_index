			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Sport: Exquisite Gower turns off the power - Cricket AS WITH cricket, so with tennis. First everyone welcomes the dawn of a new era - power play. In cricket the West Indian fast bowlers of the 60s, such as the thunderous Wes Hall, made pure pace the dominant force in the game. While the serve and volley tennis players were blasting back line tennis off the courts. A generation later, there are rallies in tennis, but no beautiful batting or subtle bowling in cricket. All is hard and fast, at the expense of the skilful. Hence the rapture among English cricket fans as there seems to be a renaissance of touch play in Test matches. We are overdue for one. Graham Gooch has never made a secret of the fact that he thinks batsmen are there to score runs. The method is unimportant; the number is vital. Anyone privileged to see his unbeaten 154 at Headingley last summer, fought out through seven hours of rain-soaked determination, to win the first Test against the West Indies, will understand the power of his argument. Runs are crucial. Lovers of stylish batting would merely point out that, under pressure, style can be as good as brute force at scoring runs. Witness David Gower's gracious 73 in last week's Old Trafford Test, scored in the heat of battle, with light touch and exquisite timing. Gooch is a believer in work, sweat and training as the tools of success and much has been made of the idea that he does not like the devil-may-care element in Gower's cricket. Gower's flight over Queensland's Carrarra Ground, in a 1938 Tiger-Moth, on England's ill-fated, ill-tempered tour of Australia in the winter of 1990-91, brought him grim disapproval from Gooch and the tour's officials. Little was made of the fact that Gower hit two consecutive Test centuries in tough matches and his tour average was 45, second only to Gooch's 53. It is significant that it is to Gower that the English captain and selectors have turned in their hour of need, with England's batting stale and unconvincing. Not only does this move admit that style can be strong, but it may also help to take away some of the mythology which tends to make people suspicious of stylish cricket. Gower is a rare phenomenon. Salim Malik, the Pakistan vice-captain, is a more typical stylish batsman, who also uses fire and muscle. His repertoire includes hard-hit swings, cuts and chops, as well as his elegant shots off the front foot. Alec Stewart bats with an air of defiance, a refusal to feel the bruises, which often draws attention away from the handsome character of his strokes. Just because he carried his bat (69 not out) heroically through the collapse and chaos at Lord's, as England's second innings was destroyed by Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, does not mean that he did so stolidly. His footwork was fast and many of his shots, especially off his legs, deliciously deft. Watching Stewart deal with Pakistan's lethal bowling was delightful in the same way that watching Waqar deliver his lethal bowling, with sudden, fierce swings and movements of the ball, was delightful. It was fascinating and satisfying. Waqar's is fast bowling with class, too quickly gone for easy wallowing in its delights. Wasim, though bowling wonderfully well at Lord's, has a less mysterious technique and his appeal is simpler, at its searing best with stumps spinning through the air. English crowds seldom see that kind of bowling. The scurvy of our game is medium pace. Effective though it can be at times, it is not inspiring. Nor would it seek to be; it wears its victims down, batsmen and spectators alike. We are plagued with medium pace bowling in all its prosaic abundance. Small wonder that stylish batsmen are few; they have only occasional forays into the subtleties and temptations of slow, flighted, spin bowling to sharpen their wits. It was the more succulent, then, to feast on a weekend of all sorts of bowling in the Lord's Test, with spin, swing and speed showing off their respective splendours. Spin bowling is stylish by nature. It has to be because it is slow and its power lies in bewildering the batsman with the unexpected movement of the ball. If its movements become routine, it is done for. Spin has always been one of the glories of the game in India and Pakistan, where good leg-spin is the supreme bowling achievement. Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistan's new young leg-spinner, can be wayward, but he can spin the ball drastically from leg to off. His googly action disguises the deception of spin from off to leg. It is enough to unnerve as experienced a batsman as Robin Smith, brought up on bowling that does not need to be deciphered before it is played. When Mushtaq bowled him in the first Texaco one-day game, Smith had no idea where the ball had gone, even after it had re-arranged his stumps. In the Lord's Test, it was a fine sight to see Ian Salisbury, the Sussex leg-spinner, still tossing the ball right up to the batsmen and still seeking to turn it at the end of a full day's play, with Pakistani victory impending. He does not spin the ball as much as Mushtaq but he stays on the attack and he stays calm. These are valuable qualities for a spin bowler. Too much mystique is not a good thing. It can distract the bowler as well as the batsman and the supreme skill of spin bowling is to find the right balance between enigma and aggression, so the batsman never feels safe. Mushtaq and Salisbury are only 22 years old, with plenty to learn about this. As long as they do not give up, however expensive and discouraging the process may be, art and guile stand a good chance of coming into their own again.</p>

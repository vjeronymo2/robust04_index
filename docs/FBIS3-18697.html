Since efforts to do this at the multilateral level  in the Paris Club of the creditor countries have failed, Iran is  now trying for bilateral solutions. Austrian claims from  state-secured export business, which amount to about 12 billion  schillings, are also affected. Negotiations are to be held in  March. However, it will not be easy to come to an agreement,  because Tehran wants to pay its overdue liabilities with oil  deliveries.    Algeria is another country that internationally is  considered  as a candidate for rescheduling, because its revenues from  business in natural gas are suffering under the decline in oil  prices. So far, Algiers has paid its debts to Austria. In this  case, liabilities amount to about 14 billion schillings, 9  billion of which come from a railroad project.    There are also problems with Russia (liabilities: about 40  billion schillings), which has not fulfilled obligations  incurred in the rescheduling agreement with Austria for paying  interest. For this reason, in contrast to its original  intentions, the Control Bank is not issuing any more guarantees  for exports to Russia for the time being.    The situation is similar regarding most other CIS states.  Only painstakingly chosen projects are insured and financed,  which should guarantee the servicing of such debts. Business is  normal only with Kazakhstan and Belarus, which have been granted  credit lines. The Control Bank was able to slightly loosen  conditions for insuring exports to Poland (liabilities: about  40 billion schillings), which is fulfilling its rescheduling  obligations most punctually.    In 1993, the Control Bank's focus shifted toward the  neighboring reform states and the Southeast Asian countries  because of premium reform, economic development, and the  development of risks as well as the release of soft loans.    If Austria becomes a member of the European Union [EU], this  would also have consequences for the Control Bank. It would  then retreat relatively quickly from short-term business with  OECD countries for the benefit of private loan insurers, but the  range of claims that are worth refinancing would be extended by  the risks insured by these private insurers. EU membership  would further stimulate business with the neighboring reform  states because of the elimination of discrimination in the  processing trade.    Last year the Control Bank's turnover in guarantees declined  to 45.1 (48.2) billion schillings, but promissory notes rose  clearly to 41.9 (27.5) billion schillings, which raises the  expectation that business will recover this year. The volume of  rescheduling loans and guarantees has increased to 87.1 (78.2)  billion. Payment of damages from liabilities (without  rescheduling) went down to 3 (4) billion schillings, or to 1.9  (2.9) billion minus refluxes.  <H5>  Countries for Half Retention Listed </H5>   The recent amendment to the Export Promotion Regulation  (AFVO) stipulates, among other things, a 5-percent limit for  deliveries to countries whose credit standing has improved.  Even though a list of such countries is still being drawn up,  it probably will be more comprehensive than was feared after  first restrictive comments by the Finance Ministry.    According to the latest information, about 15 to 20  countries  will probably be on the list. This applies, in particular, to  Asian as well as the reform states of East and Central Europe  and a few countries in Latin America and Africa. The final  decision is to be made over the next few days.</p>

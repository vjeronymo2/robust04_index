			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / The Week Ahead Results Due ASDA, the highly-indebted Leeds-based grocery chain, will have much to tell its anxious shareholders when it reports its full-year results today. Analysts have pencilled in an Pounds 80m profit figure but this could be severely depressed depending on how much of a financial hit Asda takes on its redundancy programme and whether it accepts the charge above or below the line. The hard-pressed company has also warned that it is likely to take a substantial write-down on the portfolio of 60 stores it expensively acquired from Gateway in 1989. This could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Shareholders will want to know how Asda plans to tackle its shrinking volumes and pinched margins. The company's chief executive, Mr Archie Norman, has been in the hot seat for six months now and investors are growing restless for some answers. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewer, is likely to report today pre-tax profits for the year to April only marginally ahead of Pounds 217m a year earlier. Higher interest charges have eaten up much of the increase in operating profits. On Wednesday, the UK's biggest electrical chain, Dixons, will report its full year results, which should provide a a good insight into whether there are any flickerings of life on the high street. At the time of its interim results, chairman, Mr Stanley Kalms was upbeat about the strength of the recovery, but since then demand is believed to have slackened. Pre-tax profits are expected to have fallen by some Pounds 10m to Pounds 71m, with the company's US operations continuing to drag down the overall numbers. The Rank Organisation is expected to report on Thursday six-month pre-tax profits of between Pounds 90m and Pounds 94m, slightly down from last year's Pounds 96m. The fall is likely to come from Rank's share in Rank Xerox and particularly from Fuji Xerox, hit by the downturn in the Japanese economy. Rank's own businesses, which include Butlin's camps and Shearing coach holidays, tend to have a far busier second half than first. The group will be asked how much progress it has made in disposing of the 22 UK hotels it has put up for sale, but analysts do not expect much news yet.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ivan Menshikov of RIA-NOVOSTI for IZVESTIYA, on </F> interview with PLO Leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis on 13 April:  "'Arafat Grateful to Yeltsin for Invitation, But Not Really  Counting on Successful Mediation by Moscow"]    [Text] Tunis -- Yasir 'Arafat is certainly not  experiencing the best days of his life as he prepares for his  trip to Moscow, where he first went as a student back in 1955.    Those close to him say that, even during the days of  defending Beirut against Israeli troops or during the siege of  the Lebanese city of Tripoli by the Syrian Army, the Palestinian  leader was never so worried as he is today.    He has staked his all by agreeing to separate peace with  Israel 13 September 1993. But after nine months of persistent  talks, the results are very modest: Not a single one of the  interim agreements has been observed. On 13 April 'Arafat was  to have already installed himself, together with his  administration, in Jericho, and the Israeli troops were to have  left. Instead, I am talking to him in his same old modest  office in Tunis in which everything was ready for the move three  months ago.    "Despite the fact that we are firmly maintaining our  commitment to the peace process," 'Arafat stressed, "we are  forced to point out the attempts by the Israeli side to delay  and thwart the schedule for the implementation of agreements we  have already reached."    The Israeli Government's "free interpretation" of the signed  agreements, whose quintessence is reflected by what Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said -- "For us there are no sacred  deadlines" -- is putting the Palestinians out of countenance.    It is this attitude by the Israeli Government that has  allowed extremists on both sides to organize themselves and step  up their joint offensive against the peace process, 'Arafat  believes.    That is possibly precisely why the Palestinian leader did  not  look too enthusiastic about the upcoming talks in Moscow. When  asked whether he believes in the success of Russian endeavors to  mediate between them and Premier Rabin, who is nowadays also  preparing for his first official trip to Moscow, he answered  laconically: "That would be highly desirable."    "The first Soviet-Palestinian political contacts were made  in  1968 when Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir took me to Moscow and presented me  there," 'Arafat explained, smiling for the first time during the  almost one-hour long interview, given on the eve of his trip to  Moscow. "We were received by Brezhnev straight away."    'Arafat kept silent about what the Kremlin leaders discussed  with the Palestinian nationalist-capitalist, but the main thing  is obvious: The PLO received political and military support.  But that is not the most surprising thing, nor is it how he  managed to get on with all the general secretaries from Brezhnev  to Gorbachev; the most surprising thing is how he managed to  maintain good relations with Moscow even after August 1991. In  the first few months after the failure of the putsch, he was  counted among the "sworn enemies" of the new Russian democracy,  together with Saddam Husayn, Kim Il-song, and Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, whereas today Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev flies to Tunis in order to give him an official  invitation from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to visit Russia.  Furthermore, the Russian minister is praising the "courage and  political insight of the chairman of the PLO Executive  Committee."    'Arafat is a realist and a pragmatist, who has studied the  political machinations of the Near East thoroughly. He  understands perfectly well that everyone can end up in a  difficult position. Only a few know how to get out of them with  honor. Suffice it to recall that, having expressed "moderate  sympathy" for Iraq during the Gulf War, and having lost the  support of rich sponsors in the Gulf, not to mention the United  States and West Europe, 'Arafat was able to focus the attention  of the international community, and primarily the "victorious"  U.S. Administration of President Bush, on the fact that the  smoldering Arab-Israeli conflict in the Near East would  regularly provide this kind of setback if the process of a Near  East settlement did not begin.    To give the Palestinian leader his due, he has always tried  to maintain the impression of the equal importance of the two  powers sponsoring world talks in the Near East. At times you  get the impression that he even plays up to Russia's desire to  appear more important in the region than it actually is today.  He tactfully left unanswered the question about who blocked  Moscow's proposal to conduct a new "Madrid-2" multilateral  meeting, although U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's  letter, which demands that 'Arafat give up supporting any  "unsanctioned" initiatives, is well known in diplomatic circles  in the Tunisian capital.    As for sending a Russian contingent to Palestine to protect  the civilian population, then 'Arafat stressed that the presence  of Russian observers in Palestine side by side with Americans is  not only desirable, but even follows from the actual text of UN  Security Council Resolution No. 904.</p>

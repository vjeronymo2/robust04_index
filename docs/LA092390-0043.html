			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> The other day a friend of ours was asked by his daughter, age 6, if their  family owned the house they were living in. "Well, yeah, sort of," our friend  replied, thinking that was the end of that.  </P> <P> "Do we own it all the way down to the Earth's molten core?" she asked.  </P> <P> "Why do you ask, sweetie?" he said, taken aback.  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't have a place to live, do they?" she asked.  </P> <P> "No, honey, they don't."  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't have enough to eat, do they?" she asked.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid not. Does that make you sad?"  </P> <P> The girl nodded. "What's a human right?" she asked.  </P> <P> Our friend started to sweat. "Human rights?" he replied. "Well, umm, they're .  . . "  </P> <P> His daughter came to his rescue and said: "A lot of people don't have what we  have. I know that." She sat there and looked at him. He suddenly remembered  something.  </P> <P> "Would you like to go to a concert?" he asked her. She thought that was a  splendid idea.  </P> <P> When she wanted to know what kind it was, and where it was being held, and who  would be there, he told her that Amnesty International USA was presenting a  gospel concert for human rights at 5 p.m. today, featuring the Double Rock  Baptist Choir, the West Los Angeles Choir and the Bethel AME Choir.  Assemblywoman Maxine Waters will be on hand as a guest speaker. The concert,  which is being produced by Frederick Jones and his Christian Information News  Alert organization, will be held at the Bethel AME Church, 7916 S. Western  Ave., Los Angeles. Admission is free. (Call (213) 388-1237 for information.)  </P> <P> "Any more questions?" he asked her.  </P> <P> "That's it for now," she said. R.D.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEN. ROBERTI ON ABORTION  </P> <P> I am quite disturbed that the pro-abortion crowd does not understand that a  viable Democrat such as Roberti cannot hold his own view on abortion. If  Roberti and many of his constituents see abortion as murder and denial of an  inalienable right to life, how can he simply change his vote just so he does  not have to come under the wrath of the pro-choicers?  </P> <P> Would this group prefer that Roberti and many other Democrats move over to the  other party and become Republicans? I would think not. It is ludicrous to look  at only one issue.  </P> <P> As good Democrats, we have to lead on many other issues, such as child care,  equal rights for women and all people, health care, poverty, homelessness,  crime and arms control and affordability of housing, to name a few.  </P> <P> Those in favor of pro-choice, do what you have to do to defend your issue. But  we have already lost thousands of Democrats to the Republicans; do not push  more good Democrats into the GOP. You may win on the abortion issue, but we  will lose on all the rest of the issues. Is it worth it?  </P> <P> CHRIS J. RYDER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

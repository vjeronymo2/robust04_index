			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax and house rental I MOVED home as a result of changing my job and so I am renting out the whole of my main residence. I am considering purchasing a second property for investment purposes and renting one out as well. 1. Can the excess interest on the loan for the second property, over and above rental income, be used to offset tax on the income from letting my original home? 2. Does it matter, for tax purposes, on which house the loan for the second property is secured? 3. Can qualifying expenses incurred in the tax year immediately prior (1990-91) to letting these properties, and solely related to preparation for letting, be used as an allowance for tax purposes against rental income in the current tax year (1991-2)? 4. Can you recommend a thorough text which covers residential lettings in detail? The solicitors who acted for you in the purchase will be able to guide you through the income tax and capital gains tax maze. (Before formally appointing a firm to act for you, however, it would be prudent to check that it has someone who is competent in the tax aspects of domestic property transactions.) 1. Yes; subject to the conditions set out in section 355(l) (b) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) by virtue of section 355(4). 2. No; it is the use of the borrowed money which matters - not the security for the loan by virtue of section 354(l). 3. No. However, such expenditure may be deductible in calculating the chargeable gain when the house is sold, by virtue of Inland Revenue statement of practice D24: 'Expenditure on initial repairs to a property (including expenditure on decorations) undertaken in order to put it into a fit state for letting, and not allowable for the purposes of Schedule A, is regarded as allowable expenditure for capital gains tax purposes under section 38(1) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.' 4. You are probably better off talking to your solicitor. The following free pamphlets from your tax office may be helpful, but tend to oversimplify the intricate and arbitrary rules laid down by Parliament: CGT4 - Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses IR87 - Rooms to let No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

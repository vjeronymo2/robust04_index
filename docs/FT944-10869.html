			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / South Korea eyes the North's attractions: Economic benefits of Seoul's easing of business links with Pyongyang Seoul has opened the door to economic co-operation with North Korea, offering the possibility of long-term peaceful integration between the two bitter foes. But investment by South Korean companies is likely to be modest for the immediate future. Investment guidelines announced by the Seoul government yesterday will guarantee a gradual expansion of economic ties. South Korea's decision to ease trade and investment curbs follows the settlement of the international dispute over North Korea's nuclear programme last month. Seoul suspended economic co-operation with Pyongyang two years ago after North Korea threatened to withdraw from the international nuclear safeguards agreement. Initial investments will be limited to light industry, but large-scale infrastructure and energy projects will be postponed until progress is achieved on such political issues as intra-Korean nuclear inspections. South Korean businessmen and technicians will be allowed to travel to North Korea to conduct feasibility studies, establish branch offices and manage factories. Machinery can be shipped to the North to equip factories handling reprocessing orders from the South. South Korean companies will also be permitted to employ cheap North Korean labour in third countries for construction and natural resources projects. They will also be allowed to participate in investment projects through joint ventures with other countries, primarily China, or multilateral programmes such as those sponsored by the UN Development Programme. South Korea's President Kim Young-sam's decision to resume economic ties is meant to encourage the opening of North Korea and promote the gradual reunification of the divided peninsula, while acknowledging Pyongyang's new leadership under Mr Kim Jong-il. But the South Korean investment guidelines are the result of a domestic political compromise on the issue. Full-scale economic co-operation would have angered conservatives who argue that industrial investments would only resuscitate North Korea as its economy appears headed for collapse. But South Korea's powerful conglomerates, or chaebol, have been lobbying strongly for an easing of investment restrictions because they want to take advantage of North Korea's cheap labour force and the country's potential as a new market for consumer goods. They have also expressed fears that US, European and Japanese companies may establish a foothold in North Korea before they do, if the restrictions are left in place. The chaebol appear ready to live with the remaining economic restrictions since they are cautious about committing large amounts of investment to North Korea. Concerns range from the country's poor infrastructure to the absence of investment guarantees and a double taxation treaty. South Korean companies have been scouting production sites in North Korea since 1989, with 13 chaebol having sought government approval to conduct negotiations with Pyongyang on investment projects, according to ministry of trade, industry and energy officials. Proposed investments mainly concern the production of light industrial goods, including textiles, electronics, and food products. Several companies also want to develop tourist facilities near Mount Kumkang, one of Korea's most famous scenic areas. Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar are reprocessing textile products in the North. Short term, Samsung wants to expand activity to include manufacture of electronics products. Lucky-Goldstar plans to produce daily consumer items, while Daewoo hopes to establish an electronics assembly complex in the port of Nampo, near Pyongyang. The chaebol eventually want to win construction orders for infrastructure projects and operate gold, zinc and iron mines in North Korea. Hyundai has expressed interest in establishing a ship repair yard in Wonsan and producing railway carriages, while Lucky-Goldstar would build oil refining and petrochemical facilities. These investment plans will be affected by Pyongyang's conditions governing foreign investment. North Korea has been seeking foreign investment to revive its troubled economy, which has contracted by an annual 5 per cent in the past four years. It has recently copied many of China's foreign investment laws. But North Korea still has ambivalent attitudes to chaebol investment. 'The North Koreans fear they will become an economic colony of the chaebol and would prefer doing business with smaller South Korean companies,' said one western business consultant who travels frequently to Pyongyang, 'but they also realise the chaebol are the only ones possessing enough financial resources to undertake the big industrial projects that would benefit North Korea.' North Korea may try to place geographical restrictions on where the chaebol can operate to prevent the population from being exposed to foreign influences that could undermine support for the Pyongyang government. It has been trying to limit foreign investment to the country's north-eastern region, but potential foreign investors complain the area is too isolated and lacks transport links. The confidence of the South Korean government and chaebol concerning North Korean investment will be strengthened if Seoul is allowed to build new and safe nuclear reactors to replace Pyongyang's current nuclear programme, scheduled to be dismantled under its recent nuclear deal with the US. The project is considered a key test of North Korea's willingness to co-operate with Seoul and accept the presence of at least 1,000 South Korean workers who will help build the reactors - the first significant venture between the two countries.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Second challenge to council revamp Somerset County Council is to seek leave to apply for a judicial review of the Local Government Commission's proposal to scrap the council and replace it with three unitary authorities. Its action follows a similar move by Cleveland on Tuesday and will increase pressure on the government to abandon its review of local government structure. Somerset describes the recommendation as 'perverse' and wants it declared null on the grounds that the commissioners have acted unlawfully and unreasonably, and ignored evidence from opinion polls conducted for the commission by MORI. The commission, headed by Sir John Banham, originally proposed replacing the county council and five district councils with a single unitary authority for most of Somerset. But after public consultation it recommended three unitary councils. All four of the Conservative MPs in Somerset, including Mr Tom King, the former cabinet minister and MP for Bridgwater, have supported the status quo. The request for judicial review has all-party support on the council, which the Liberal Democrats won from the Conservatives in May. Cleveland is Labour-controlled and its move has divided local Labour MPs. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, MP for Redcar, supports the county but Mr Peter Mandelson, MP for Hartlepool, believes the legal action is a waste of money. Mr John Whitcutt, Somerset county solicitor, said yesterday that the commission's proposal was not supported by its own published evidence. A MORI poll showed 19 per cent support for three unitary authorities and 14 per cent support for one unitary authority, but 32 per cent preferred the present arrangement. Another 24 per cent wanted a two-tier Somerset on its former, pre-1974 boundaries. Together with the 14 per cent who wanted a single unitary authority, the poll showed 70 per cent wanted some form of strategic county-wide authority. Mr Whitcutt said that figure compared with an equivalent figure of 60 per cent for Gloucestershire, where the commission this week recommended the status quo.</p>

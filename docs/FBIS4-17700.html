			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Recorded report by Mikhail Rudkowski] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] By a majority vote, Supreme  Soviet deputies have declined the question of violations of the  Constitution in connection with the signing of the monetary  merger agreement with Russia. This motion was supported by only  63 votes.    Since the former -- 13th -- Supreme Soviet session did not  adopt a resolution on the activity of the temporary commission  for combating corruption, which is headed by Alyaksandr  Lukashenka, this issue was again included on the session agenda.  However, this issue was declined by a majority vote. [passage  omitted]</p>

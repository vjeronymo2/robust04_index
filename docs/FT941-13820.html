			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Ulster hopes recede further Hopes of a peace deal in Northern Ireland faded further yesterday when Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, urged the UK government to tell unionists that their future lay with 'the rest of the Irish people', Tim Coone and David Owen write. Interviewed on RTE Radio in Dublin, Mr Adams said that if the government did so, Sinn Fein would be 'flexible' and would seek 'a peaceful development towards an accord which everyone can give allegiance to'. His remarks dealt a further blow to faltering hopes of peace because such a move would require an unlikely climbdown from the government. Ministers have consistently said they will not join the ranks of the 'persuaders'. Yesterday's comments came as the Loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, said it carried out Saturday's two fire bomb attacks on stores in Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology's  Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (Ken'ichi Matsuno, Director)  has set a goal of developing new electric discharge processing  technology which would make it possible to process freely even  the interior of metal receptacles with small entrances which are  difficult to process. It is possible to process even previously  unprocessible spots when an ``electric blade'' using electric  discharge is guided by laser beams.    The new technology is called the laser-induced electric  discharge processing method.    Electricity is passed through the metal which is the  material  to be processed. Electric current is applied at low voltage  between the material to be processed (negative pole) and copper  wire (positive pole). This leads to electric discharge at the  end of the copper wire. When a laser beam is simultaneously  shone on the negative pole, metal plasma is created at the point  where the beam is radiated and the electric discharge from the  copper wire flies at the plasma. Voltage is low so insulation  within the atmosphere will be low and electric discharge will  easily occur.    An experiment was conducted in which a YAG laser (output:  0.45 joules) one millimeter in diameter was shined on the  surface of a one millimeter thick copper sheet (negative pole)  and electric discharge was induced from the copper wire  (positive pole) on the back through a hole opened in the copper  sheet to the point where the laser was shined. The distance  between the negative and positive poles was 50 to 100  millimeters and voltage was 100 volts to one kilowatt.  Atmospheric pressure was ten to 400 pascals.    The experiment showed that the electric discharge can be  guided to make a u-turn from the point where the laser beam  radiates opposite the hole through the copper sheet. When  voltage is high the electric discharge is diffused around the  point of laser radiation, but when voltage is low, electric  discharge can be made to occur within a diameter of one  millimeter around the point of laser radiation. When laser beams  are reflected off a mirror, then it should be possible to  process inside metal receptacles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi 17 May -- The Human Resource Development  Ministry has denied that the passage of the amended Copyright  Law in the parliament last week was in any way connected to  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's U.S. visit. Yogendra Nath  Chaturvedi, additional secretary in the ministry, and other  senior officials during their informal talks with reporters said  that it was only a coincidence that the law was passed on eve of  the prime minister's U.S. visit. According to some press  reports, the law was passed in `haste' just before the prime  minister's U.S. visit. Rao, by getting the law passed in the  parliament, wanted to assure the United States that legal  arrangements have been made to stop the theft of U.S computer  programs. The Prime Minister's Office was afraid that this  issue would be raised during Rao's visit. The general complaint  of U.S. computer companies is that the theft of their computer  programs is very common in India.    The ministry officials today clarified that in fact the  joint  parliamentary committee formed to study the law had submitted  its report on the last day of the monsoon session of the  parliament. Following that, the law was given its final touches  after consultations with various ministries, including the Law  Ministry. It was not possible to table the bill to this effect  in the parliament before the budget session.    According to Chaturvedi, Shahid Ali Khan, former deputy  director general of the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property  Association, has termed the bill as the one of the best  copyright laws in the world, which has incorporated all  "progressive" steps keeping in view all new challenges likely to  be posed. He said to ensure strict enforcement of the law at  least in the state capitals, state governments are being asked  to set up a cell in the police department. The cell will  comprise police and military personnel. The training of these  personnel for enforcement of the copyright law will be entrusted  to the Human Resource Development Ministry. Other than this,  the ministry will organize a seminar in November, with the help  of World Intellectual Property Association, to create public  awareness about the copyright law. Such seminars are also  planned at the state level.    Chaturvedi said that the main aim of the amended Coyright  Law  is to protect interests of big publishers, video and cable  operators, writers, artists, and musicians. With this aim in  view, the bill has a provision for setting up copyright  societies. These societies will provide legal protection to  their members. The members in turn will pay a small part of  their royalty to the concerned society. Such societies are very  popular in Balkan states, Japan, and Germany. However, it will  not be compulsory for writers and artists in India to be members  of such societies as it is in other countries.    According to Chaturvedi, now video recordings of the public  performances by artists, singers, dancers, and snake charmers  will not be allowed without their permission. There was no such  arrangement earlier. The law especially ensures that the  royalty paid for the work of writers or artists will be clearly  mentioned in the contract. It will also have to be made clear in  the contract between the two sides as to what will be the  transfer area, period and geographic limit of a copyright.</p>

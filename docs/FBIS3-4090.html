This article tends to make brief comments on  the origin, progress, and characteristics of the new taxation  system.  <H5>  Long Consideration, Aiming To Break Through </H5>   The establishment of a taxation system and operational  mechanism in conformity with the socialist market economic  structure in China is not the result of subjective will at all,  but has been considered over quite a long time. Where water  flows, a channel is formed; this is inevitable.    In the 30 years from the founding of New China to 1978,  China, being influenced by a highly centralized planned economic  structure, practiced the "unified collection and unified  spending" financial taxation system. The system played a  historic role in pooling financial resources and laying an  economic foundation for socialist construction. However, it  also has many negative effects. Therefore, after the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the reform of  the taxation system in China began to lay stress on arousing the  enthusiasm of both the central and local governments and on  handling the relationship between the state and enterprises.  The reform began with the replacement of profits with taxes  handed over to the state and developed gradually.    Two steps have been taken in replacing profits with taxes  handed over to the state.    The first step (experiments were carried out in 1979 and the  step was taken in January 1983): Instead of handing over a  portion of their profits to the state, state-owned enterprises  paid income tax. Many forms were adopted for the distribution  between the state and enterprises, such as levying regulatory  taxes on after-tax profits of enterprises. This move broke the  long-standing fixed pattern of interest distribution, but the  situation of the coexistence of taxation and the handing-over of  profits began to take shape. The second step (in September  1984): The system of allowing state-owned enterprises to keep  all the remaining profits after paying income tax enabled the  enterprises to have greater power in carrying out operations  independently and to assume greater responsibility for their  profits and losses. It also created conditions for reforming  and establishing a system for the management of the budget of  the central and local governments. However, because things in  the price system were not yet straightened out, its limitations  were also very clear.    Later, some corresponding readjustments were made in light  of  the implementation of the overall financial contract system and  a complex taxation system with multiple categories of taxes,  multiple links, multiple tiers, and with the turnover tax and  the income tax as the main body and other auxiliary categories  of taxes as a supplement began to take shape. Nevertheless,  because the new taxation system has not yet been established,  contradictions between, and problems in, the new and the old  taxation systems tend to become even more conspicuous. They are  mainly expressed in: The burden of taxation is not fairly  shared, two separate taxation systems are used for domestic and  foreign enterprises, and the burden of taxation for domestic  enterprises differs greatly because of difference in ownership  and localities; the relationship of distribution between the  central and local governments and between the state and  enterprises is jigsaw-like and is very irregular; the methods  for tax collection and management are backward and full of  loopholes, resulting in great losses; and the legal system is  not sound, and a system in which the legislation, administration  of justice, and law enforcement related to taxation are mutually  independent and mutually conditioned has not been formed. The  deep development of the market economy has called for deepening  taxation reform. We must take big steps forward and make  essential breakthroughs in the establishment of a new taxation  system.    Careful Planning, Clear Target    Abolishing the old and establishing the new, formulating  regulations and rules, and constantly perfecting them are  difficult tasks to fulfill in financial and taxation reform in  China.    Regarding this, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee has clearly put forward three focal points.  The first is the replacement of the overall financial contract  system with the tax-sharing system. The second is the reform  and improvement of the tax collection system. The third is the  improvement and standardization of the double budgetary system.  As far as the establishment of the new taxation system is  concerned, if we say the first and the third points are for  creating necessary prerequisites and conditions, the second  point is the main implication and key point in the establishment  of the new taxation system. In essence, it is also to reform  the industrial and commercial taxation systems. As viewed from  the past two months, the Chinese Government has firmly grasped  these vital points and is providing, and will continue to  provide, guarantees by means of changing the structure to  fundamentally solve this focal problem of interest distribution.    The plan for the establishment of a new taxation system was  promulgated a year ago and more than 60 supplementary policies  have been implemented since 1 January. This shows the planning  was well made and well publicized. Its guiding ideology,  principles, contents, and key points can be generalized as  "unifying taxation laws, fairly sharing the taxation burden,  simplifying the taxation system, and rationally dividing power."    "Unifying taxation laws" means the legislation of sound  taxation laws and their relevant rules and regulations, putting  all taxation activities on the orbit standardized by taxation  laws, paying taxes according to law, and administering taxation  according to law, so that the role of market mechanism for  taxation activities will be in keeping with the strengthening of  macroregulation and control.    "Fairly sharing the taxation burden" means gradually  resolving the issue of having different categories of taxes and  different tax rates for enterprises of different kinds of  ownership and in different localities and, through unifying the  income tax of enterprises and improving the turnover tax,  enabling a more or less fair taxation burden among different  kinds of enterprises and creating conditions for competition on  an equal basis.    "Simplifying the taxation system" means adopting relatively  standardized methods of taking international practices for  reference, abolishing tax categories which do not conform with  the development of the market economy, combining duplicate tax  categories, and levying new categories of taxes which are really  necessary in a bid to optimize the taxation structure and to  make operation simple and easy.    "Rationally dividing power" means putting in the hands of  the  central authorities tax categories which involve the macro  policies and correspondingly centralizing the power of taxation  for regulating production and product mix. Taxation power which  is useful for local governments in regulating local economy and  organizing income, the power to formulate procedures for tax  collection and tax management, and the legislation power  concerning the levying of a small number of local taxes, should  be given to local governments.    At present, China is smoothly carrying out reform of the  taxation system in several major aspects in accordance with the  above train of thought.    The turnover tax, the main body of the new taxation system,  is being extended universally to domestic- and foreign-invested  enterprises. The practices of putting products under taxable  items and separately fixing different interest rates have been  abandoned. The new methods are: The value-added tax is  universally levied in production and circulation and on this  basis, and the sales tax is also levied on a selected small  number of consumers' goods; the levying of business tax is  maintained in providing labor service, the transfer of  intangible assets, and the sales of fixed assets; the unified  industrial and commercial tax for foreign-invested enterprises  is abolished; and the product tax for agricultural, forestry,  livestock, and aquatic products is replaced by the agricultural  special product tax and butchering tax.    The goal of unifying the income tax of enterprises will be  realized in two steps. The first step is the institution of the  unified domestic-invested enterprise income tax system, which is  being implemented at present. As a result, the method of  collecting income tax according to the ownership of enterprises  has been abolished and state-owned enterprises will no longer  use the method of handing over income tax to the state on a  contract basis. The second step is the combination of the  income tax of domestic- and foreign-invested enterprises as the  occasion demands in a bid to eventually unify the taxation  system.    The basic purpose of levying and readjusting personal income  tax is to levy tax on people with a relatively high income and  to exempt or reduce such tax on people with intermediate-level  income and low income so that the tax burden can be lowered to  some extent and that some people can become rich earlier than  others and the gap between the poor and the rich will not be too  big.    The value-added land tax, which has recently been levied, is  aimed at levying tax on the added value of transferred real  estate. Taxpayers, irrespective of their economic nature,  whether they are domestic-funded or foreign-funded enterprises,  and whether they are specialized or not, have to pay tax on the  basis of the volume of added value. The general result will  still be relatively high after-tax profits for real estate  operators.    To promote rational development and utilization of resources  and to regulate differential incomes, necessary readjustments  and reform of the resources have also been made. The scope of  taxation includes all products of mineral resources and the tax  to be collected is based on the category and quantity. Upper  and lower limits are set, that is, the amount of tax on products  of the same category may vary based on the conditions of the  resources.    It is learned that, following the current large-scale  reform, the number of taxable items will be reduced from 32 to  18, the taxation structure will become more rational, and a  highly efficient and simplified taxation system will be realized.  <H5>  Seeking Truth From Facts, Being Fair and Reasonable </H5>   In establishing the new taxation system, from planning to  implementation, China has always adhered to the principle of  proceeding from the present reality of China and seeking truth  from facts, and therefore, what has been done is fair and  reasonable.    Advancement as a whole and comprehensive supplementary moves  have made it possible to make breakthroughs in the establishment  of the new taxation system. The formulation and implementation  of "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several  Questions Concerning the Establishment of the Socialist Market  Economy Structure" have undoubtedly provided favorable social  conditions for the reform of the taxation system and have  enabled the establishment of the new taxation system to enter a  new historical stage of being more responsive and ready.  Although reform of the financial and taxation system is the  focus and most the important of four major reforms this year,  the supplementary reforms of the banking, investment, and  planned systems will be carried out simultaneously and they will  all give powerful support to the financial and taxation reform.  Even viewed from a smaller scope, reform of the taxation system  and reform of the financial system have matched and integrated  with each other and the target strategies, and the long- term,  medium-term, and immediate results have all been repeatedly  planned, expounded, and proved. The process of proceeding at a  commanding height from the general to the local evidently shows  a clearer goal and is more conducive to turning possibility into  reality in the establishment of the new taxation system.    Being geared to the future and paying attention to giving  consideration to various aspects have provided a bridge for  transition in the establishment of the new taxation system. The  goal of the reform is clear and we are quite determined to carry  it out. However, we have to do things step by step. It is  precisely because of this that China has paid attention to  adopting some transitional measures in the course of  establishing a new taxation system. For example, the enterprise  taxation system must be unified and this direction cannot be  changed, but we are not impatient and will not try to hit the  target in one try. Foreign-invested enterprises and foreign  enterprises continue to pay the original income tax and  preferential policies have remained temporarily unchanged. The  additional portion of tax paid after the collection of the new  turnover tax by foreign-invested enterprises set up before 1  January this year will be returned to them. The design of all  important taxation items and categories involving the  readjustment of interests has taken into consideration the  circumstances and has given expression to firmness in achieving  the goal of reform and to flexibility of a progressive  transition. A careful and safe start will inevitably speed up  the realization of the goal and the practice of establishing the  new taxation system in China has proved, or continues to prove,  the correctness of this conclusion.    The integration of the will of the government and that of  the  masses of people and the conversion of such will into conscious  action by the whole society have provided a deep and solid  foundation for the establishment of the new taxation system.  Since the latter half of last year, especially since the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Chinese  Government has paid great attention to regarding the direct  participation of the grass-roots level and the broad masses of  the people as indispensable conditions for the establishment of  the new taxation system. Therefore, it has issued "red-banner  documents" to define policies and measures and has convened  meetings for senior officials of departments in charge of  relevant work to give explanations, to help overcome  difficulties, or to run study sessions to pass on the essentials  on operation. The radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and  other mass media and tools for public opinion have all tried  their best to publicize and promote reform of the taxation  system. According to informed sources, in the course of the  establishment of the new taxation system, efforts made by the  government in organizing, leading, and publicizing the degree of  concern and support of the masses of the people, and the  stability of society have become the solid and firm social  foundations for achieving comprehensive success in the new  taxation system.    Because of all these, we have full grounds to hope for a  stronger fragrance from this wonderful blooming flower of the  new taxation system in China and to invite all people of the  industrial and commercial circles who want to display their  skills in China to enjoy the fragrance to the full.</p>

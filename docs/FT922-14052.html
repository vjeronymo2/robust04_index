			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Row flares over rise in charge for debit card THE ROW between banks and retailers over charges for debit and credit cards flared yesterday when Sir Ian MacLaurin declared he was 'very, very unhappy' about proposed increases. He used stronger language in saying that the British Retail Association was aiming to take a firm line in negotiations with the banks. Mr David Malpas said the banks had behaved disgracefully. The group had invested up to Pounds 30m in the equipment to take debit cards, he said, because the banks had decided it would be easier to handle transactions electronically rather than using cheques. When customers pay by debit card the money is electronically transferred from their bank account to the retailer's account. Mr Malpas said the banks were now 'hiking up charges to an unsupportable level'. Banks and retailers had agreed that the charge for debit cards would be no more than for cheque processing, about 4p to 5p a transaction across the industry. The banks were looking to charge retailers twice that for handling a transaction on Switch, the electronic-only debit card system, he said. Switch accused the retailers of wanting a Rolls Royce service for the cost of a Mini. 'Switch was costly to develop, costing over Pounds 100m to set up. We did tell many of the retailers that the prices we offered during the start up period were initial pricing but they seem to have been taken by surprise that rates have finally had to go up,' Mr Tim Green, managing director of Switch, the largest UK debit card scheme, said. Mr Green conceded that the charges for Switch were now higher than those for cheques. 'We admit that at present Switch's charges are a few pence more than the price of cheque collection. But it is too good a service for the retailers to pass over.' Barclays said that the flat charge on each Visa debit card transaction went up from 10.5p to 12p two months ago, though it was still well below the 17.5p charged in 1987 when the card was launched. Tesco said that the banks had also unilaterally demanded an increase in fees for credit card transactions. Mr Malpas said that about 40 per cent of Tesco's sales were paid for by credit or debit cards. He said customers liked using the debit cards and their usage had grown rapidly.</p>

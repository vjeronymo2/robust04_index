			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dmitriy Frolov from the "Space" column: </F> "Strategic Missile Base Will Become Cosmodrome"]    [Text] As SEGODNYA reported earlier, at a conference with  representatives of the Amur Oblast Administration Boris Yeltsin  discussed the question of building the Svobodnyy-18 cosmodrome.  Now it has transpired that the president promised Major General  Aleksandr Vinidiktov, chief of the Space Equipment Test and  Operation Center, that he will make available 4 trillion rubles  over the next 10 years to convert the former strategic missile  base into a cosmodrome.    Until recently there were 60 launch silos at the base. Now  the majority have been dismantled. Only five silos remain  mothballed. But even this number is more than is required to  launch small satellites: Only relatively small spacecraft can  be launched from the silos. It was decided to keep only two of  them. From 1996 satellites weighing up to 1.5 tonnes will be  put into orbit from the territory of Amur Oblast with Rokot  rockets. The whole project for building the new cosmodrome will  call for substantial financial and manpower resources. Some  10,000 people will be engaged in building various cosmodrome  installations.</p>

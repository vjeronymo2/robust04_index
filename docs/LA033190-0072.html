			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS URGED TO ADOPT BETTER ID FOR LEGAL WORKERS;  </P> <P> DOCUMENTS: THE U.S. COMPTROLLER GENERAL SEEKS TO DISCOURAGE THE SCRAPPING OF  SANCTIONS AGAINST EMPLOYERS WHO HIRE ILLEGAL ALIENS.  </P> <P> The director of the General Accounting Office on Friday discouraged Congress  from lifting legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, calling  instead for improved documents to help companies tell legal workers from  illegal ones.  </P> <P> Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher's testimony before the Senate Judiciary  Committee came in response to a study by the GAO, the investigative arm of  Congress, which charged that the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act has  led to "widespread discrimination" against legal Latino, Asian and black job  applicants.  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the panel's immigration  subcommittee, has introduced legislation calling for repeal or reform of the  law within 30 days. An identical measure has been filed in the House.  </P> <P> However, Bowsher told the committee he blames most of the discrimination on  "good-faith confusion on the part of the employer" about the law's  requirements. The easy availability of counterfeit worker identification papers  also is prompting employers to shy away from all foreign-born workers for fear  of being penalized for hiring an illegal one.  </P> <P> "Most (employers) are just very dubious of the multiple sets of documents that  people can present to them," Bowsher said.  </P> <P> He endorsed Immigration and Naturalization Service efforts to pare the variety  of worker-authorization documents accepted to as few as two. He also spoke in  favor of developing a uniform, "counterfeit-resistant" worker identification  card that employers could trust. Either approach "could reduce the amount of  discrimination," he said.  </P> <P> A coalition of immigrant rights groups are seeking repeal of the employer  sanctions. Those groups also are fighting any move toward what they call a  "national identity card."  </P> <P> Lucas Guttentag, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigration  project, said even a voluntary form of such identification "could become a de  facto minority identification card. The people who don't fit the stereotype of  American would be forced to get that card."  </P> <P> But Bowsher said identification documents are already a commonly accepted part  of American life.  </P> <P> "Ask people in L.A. when the last time was that they could cash a check without  having to show their driver's license," he said.  </P> <P> The congressional study, released Thursday and based on surveys of more than  9,400 employers nationwide, found Los Angeles employers at or near the top in  use of discriminatory practices compared to other large cities around the  nation.  </P> <P> About 29% of Los Angeles employers were rejecting applicants on the basis of  appearance or citizenship, 10% more than the national average, the study found.  An estimated 16% were subjecting Latino and Asian applicants to special  scrutiny, and 17% were only willing to hire U.S.-born workers.  </P> <P> Bowsher and other GAO officials said employer education efforts should be  intensified to combat such discrimination.  </P> <P> In a survey last year, about 40% of employers "still said they didn't  understand the specific document requirements. They didn't quite understand the  specific hiring restrictions," said Richard Fogel, the GAO assistant  comptroller general.  </P></p>

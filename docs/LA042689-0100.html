			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT DEFENSE GOES HIGH-TECH IN ATTACK ON COMMONALITY OF SLAYINGS  </P> <P> With some high-technology visual aids, an attorney for Randy Steven Kraft  argued to jurors Tuesday that there were too many discrepancies in the 16  slayings his client is charged with to think that one person committed them  all.  </P> <P> The case against Kraft, said defense attorney C. Thomas McDonald, "is a  painting by a very clever prosecutor, to make these acts appear as if they were  done by a single perpetrator."  </P> <P> Kraft, 44, is on trial in Santa Ana, accused by prosecutors of killing more  people than anyone else in California history. While he is charged with the  murders of 16 young men in Orange County, prosecutors have linked him to 45  specific victims in Southern California, Oregon and Michigan.  </P> <P> Beyond that, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown contends, each entry on a list  found in Kraft's car stands for one of Kraft's victims. It has 61 entries, with  five of them -- "2 in 1 Hitch" and "GR2," for example -- representing double  victims, prosecutors say.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Victims Mutilated  </P> <P> Brown completed his closing arguments Tuesday morning by suggesting that the  fact that two victims had been burned on the eyeballs and nipples with  cigarette lighters makes it unlikely they were killed by different people.  </P> <P> "You've got the person here in court," Brown told the jurors. Brown, who began  his closing argument Monday, finished shortly after noon Tuesday.  </P> <P> After the lunch break, the courtroom lighting was dimmed and a 67-inch,  self-contained rear-screen projector was placed before the jury.  </P> <P> Then McDonald, with the help of computer expert David Parkin, flashed on the  screen blue and white moving graphs and pie charts McDonald said were designed  to show the numerous dissimilarities in the 16 deaths.  </P> <P> McDonald and co-counsel James G. Merwin are expected to take all day today to  complete their closing arguments. Brown is then scheduled to present his  rebuttal argument Thursday morning.  </P> <P> Judge Donald A. McCartin warned jurors that on Thursday afternoon, after he has  given them their instructions, he will sequester them at a hotel to begin  deliberations. The judge has announced he will also permit them to deliberate  on Saturday, rarely done in Orange County criminal cases.  </P> <P> The judge left the bench to find a seat in the corner to watch the defense's  computer graphics display. McDonald presented 10 displays intended to show  discrepancies among the victims: the types of drugs and varying alcohol levels  found in their systems, the causes of death, their personal features, where  their bodies were found and how many were Marines.  </P> <P> "The prosecution would have you believe that all these victims died of ligature  strangulation," McDonald said. But his color graphic showed that seven died of  ligature strangulation and nine died of other causes.  </P> <P> In his rebuttal, however, Brown is expected to show that in the nine other  cases, most of them had some signs of injury to the neck or face.  </P> <P> Parkin, who represents a legal graphics support service in Mission Viejo,  declined to say how much Tuesday's presentation cost because all defense costs,  which come from public funds, are sealed by court order.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sits Near Jury  </P> <P> Kraft, a computer expert himself, was permitted to leave his seat and move  closer to the jury so he could watch the presentation.  </P> <P> The 16 deaths vividly displayed on the screen occurred between 1972 and Kraft's  arrest on May 14, 1983.  </P> <P> In the older cases, where prosecutors have no physical evidence directly  linking Kraft to the victims, Brown is relying on their commonality with  murders for which he does have physical evidence. For example, most of those  victims were found with a shoelace missing. Brown contends Kraft drugged his  victims, then tied their wrists with their own shoelaces. In murders where he  does have stronger evidence, shoelaces are missing too.  </P> <P> But in his closing argument Tuesday, McDonald contended that there were so many  other discrepancies that nothing clearly points to Kraft leaving his  "signature" on these victims.  </P></p>

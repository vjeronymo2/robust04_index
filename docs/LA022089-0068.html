			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> The 59 Soviet ballet dancers stranded in Baltimore for two weeks after their  U.S. producers ran out of money and their nationwide tour was canceled,  performed in North Branch, N.J. on Sunday and were also scheduled to perform in  Washington at the end of the month, following a last-minute booking in New York  this week. The dancers, from the Donetsk State Opera and Ballet Theatre of the  Ukraine, have been staying in Baltimore while New York producers and the Howard  Gilman Foundation have tried to arrange a new tour. Meanwhile, Mikhail  Baryshnikov, artistic director of the American Ballet Theater and a director of  the Gilman foundation, has offered the dancers scenery, costumes and rehearsal  space, the Associated Press has reported. The company is now scheduled to  appear from Wednesday through Saturday at New York's City Center Theater, and  to dance seven performances in Washington's National Theater, from Feb. 28 to  March 5.

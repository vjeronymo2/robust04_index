			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of Logistics (1): Relentless drive to reduce costs - Big retailers are increasingly contracting out their supply operations. But most manufacturers prefer to move their own goods Logistics is the currently fashionable term for an industry which started out as haulage and warehousing, moved on briefly to become 'distribution', and then settled on a title borrowed from the field of military science. In practice, logistics is a delivery truck calling every 15 to 20 minutes at Marks &amp; Spencer's London Marble Arch store to top up the racks of clothing. It is a Leicester warehouse geared up to overnight delivery of Land-Rover spares and to a two-hour turnaround time for emergency orders for tractor parts for Massey Ferguson. But this is only the most visible part of the logistics industry, the contracted-out part of the business when manufacturers hand over their delivery problems to an outside professional. In-house logistics still dwarfs the contracted-out sector despite the move by a growing number of multinational companies to using outside suppliers. For many companies bringing in components and making deliveries to customers is still too crucial a part of their business to entrust to others. The challenge to the logistics professionals is to persuade manufacturing industry that this is a business which it can, with profit, hand over to somebody else. Retailers and parts of the consumer sectors have already been convinced but broad swathes of industry still remain to be converted. 'The industrial market is growing but it is not as advanced as the retail sector,' commented Mr Chris Masters, chief executive of Christian Salvesen, a UK logistics company and provider of distribution services for M&amp;S. The logistics sector also faces an enormous problem in bridging the gap between industry best practice and the average performer. Many companies are poor at measuring the efficiency of their internal logistics operations. Yet they are also frequently disappointed by their experience of contracting them out to a third party, a number of recent surveys have shown. Less than half of large UK companies have a logistics strategy or know their logistics costs, according to a study carried out by Andersen Consulting and the Institute of Purchasing and Supply. Forty per cent of UK companies which had contracted out their logistics were dissatisfied with the way their affairs were handled and felt there were insufficient controls, a survey by PE Consulting and the Institute of Logistics found. 'Companies do not do enough to analyse their logistics,' said Mr David Ecklund, European commercial director of Caterpillar Logistics Services (CLS), an offshoot of the US manufacturer of earth-moving equipment and owner of the Leicester warehouse. 'For something with so much importance for customer satisfaction that is worrying.' Why do so many companies which contract out their logistics feel dissatisfied? They often fail to appreciate that they must still work closely with their logistics supplier, sharing management information and even integrating staff, said Mr John Brinkhurst, CLS business development manager. The scope of the contract and the services to be provided must be defined in detail and performance standards should be set, he warns. Modern commercial logistics is a combination of three elements. Its traditional components are haulage and warehousing allied to a more recent arrival, information technology. Computers allow a company to locate a product in its warehouse, to devise a delivery schedule which makes the most efficient use of its vehicle fleet, and to track a consignment on its way to its final destination. Managing the supply chain can lead to considerable reductions in the amounts of stock which have to be held. 'We have been recruiting large numbers of information systems people to develop bespoke systems for our clients,' said Mr Martyn Pellew, marketing director for Exel Logistics, a UK-based company. Logistics professionals believe that the commercial pressure of increasingly competitive international markets is working in their favour. In Europe, the creation of the single European market is drawing in Japanese and US companies keen to exploit the reduction of trade barriers and forcing local companies to rethink their strategies. Globally, the shortening of product life-cycles and increasing consumer pressure for quality and low prices is forcing manufacturers and retailers to redouble their efforts to cut costs. Companies are being forced to concentrate on what they do best and farm out the non-essentials to outside suppliers. Employing a third party logistics company removes the need to operate a vehicle fleet, to acquire and maintain warehouse space, and to manage the intricacies of world-wide distribution. The sums which industry spends on logistics-related activities are staggering, though only a small percentage is currently handled by outside suppliers. A survey by the Cranfield Centre for Logistics and Transportation estimated the size of the UK market at just over Pounds 100bn, the European market at Pounds 570bn and the world market at Pounds 2,500bn. It arrived at these figures by combining the present spend of businesses on warehousing, holding stock, transport, administration and packaging. Statistics on the size of the market which might realistically be available to the logistics professionals are not readily available, however. One of the main concerns facing European companies in particular is how to handle their distribution activities throughout the continent. Companies are realising that they hold too much inventory at too many locations across Europe and are moving from, say, 15 distribution points to just four or five regional centres, according to Prof. James Cooper, director of the Cranfield logistics centre. 'Yet this transition is easier said than done. Sales and marketing managers may be uncomfortable with the prospect of sourcing products from different countries and having to make delivery arrangements with associates who speak another language.' Companies which overcome these hurdles are able to make significant savings. Nike, the US manufacturer of trainers and sportswear, is replacing more than 20 national and local warehouses with a new European distribution centre in Belgium following a similar move to centralise its US activities at a single 'hub' in Memphis a few years ago. Concentrating all of a company's delivery activities in one centre not only reduces the levels of stock which have to be held. It means that a wider range of stock is available to customers and allows the distribution centre to add extra services. Electronic products such as computers can be customised at the last moment depending on the national market for which they are destined or the demands of the individual customer. Exel says its book distribution arm selects and packs books for customers, sends out invoices and collects payments for publishers. Suppliers to the automotive industry add value to the service they provide by collecting components from suppliers and delivering them on to the final assembly plant according to a schedule which meets the needs of the assembly line. Not satisfied with the progress which has already been made to reduce stocks and squeeze waste out of the supply chain, the logistics companies and their clients are seeking even further savings. The most ambitious attempts are by some Japanese automobile manufacturers to create an international stock-free delivery chain. Being willing to agree to deliveries of essential components from another country straight into the assembly linewithout the comfort of a buffer stock requires cool nerves. But this is the way that industry is moving, said Mr Pellew. On a more local basis the logistics industry is looking hard at the concept of 'cross-docking'. This requires manufacturers to supply yoghurt, washing powder or motor components to the distribution warehouse just in time for them to be combined - 'consolidated' - with other products destined for the same customer and shipped out immediately. The aim is to reduce inventory at the distribution centre. This pushes responsibility for matching production runs to customer demand back to the manufacturer. A survey by Food Industry News showed that in the food sector at least, manufacturers appeared confident they could handle these pressures without any increase in the size of their own stocks. But companies cannot afford to relax. 'There is a massive drive to take costs out of the system,' said Mr Masters. 'The whole logistics market place is becoming more complex and more demanding.'</p>

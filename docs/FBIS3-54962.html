Maley is also the chairman of the National Security  Council's Inter-Ministerial Committee dealing with military  industry, which operates beside the Russian president.    [Vida] Not long before the September crisis, you resigned  your position as presidential adviser and expressed your  dissatisfaction with the current economic policy in a sharp  interview in the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Are you still so  pessimistic about the future of Russian military industry?    [Maley] The economic situation has not improved but the  situation is much better from a structural point of view. The  president has acquired full powers. The existence of the  National Security Council has also been included in the  Constitution, which is particularly important in the coming  transitional period, when coalition debates make the  government's work more difficult, because its 10 committees can  in theory deal with any issues and substitute for any  ministries. All this gives us great hope. At the same time,  the results of the elections carry the danger that the political  struggle will again draw Yeltsin away from the economy's burning  problems. Necessary decisions are being delayed while time is  running out before our eyes. Within three to five months at the  latest, we have to begin massive changes in the economy....    [Vida] Do you want a change of course?    [Maley] I would not be with the president if I did not agree  with the reform policy. What is more, 80 percent of the  military industrial complex's directors would not agree to any  kind of regress. We do not want to and cannot return to what  was here before. All we want from Yeltsin is that he should  make the reforms quicker and more thought-out so that we can at  last begin to establish a new economy on the ruins of 1992 and  1993. Therefore, we are supporting him as we did in October,  but we are also trying to convince him of our views.    [Vida] It is interesting what you are saying because one of  the basic tenets of Gaydar's reform ideology is that the  military industrial complex as a social phenomenon is a  conservative and reactionary factor.    [Maley] It is possible that, because of its outward  characteristics, the oboronka appears to be a conservative  force, but scientific life is concentrated here just as it is  anywhere else in the world. The denouncement of military  industry was a methodical mistake on Gaydar's part. Instead of  using it as a motor for the reforms, he set himself the task of  destroying it. No government will be able to do this. This  industry has found the suitable counteraction because the line  of enterprises with the chain of loans actually began with us.  The strategically accumulated stocks of raw material in  military industry, which was compulsory in the past, made it  possible for production to continue. At the moment, the most  important thing is that the president, who had been made to  believe that the "oboronka" was an antagonistic environment, has  understood that the Gaydar approach is wrong. However, we had to  wait 18 months for this, the fight against the military industry  lasted as long as that.    [Vida] How can the political situation that has emerged  after the elections influence the prospects of the military  industry?    [Maley] All in all, the defense establishment came out  victorious from the political shocks of the past few months.  First of all, this is because we support Yeltsin and he is  beginning to understand that we are the only means left for  continuing the reforms. Secondly, the serious defeat of the  Gaydar bloc, Russia's Choice, actually means the defeat of the  enemies of military industry, and this will probably be a  warning for those who still have not realized what kind of force  they are facing. Finally, as the military industry is an island  of calm and social peace, all political forces will try to win  us over. In order to gain as precise as possible information on  the interests of the military industrial complex, we will soon  establish an electronic information system including all 2,200  enterprises, with the help of which we can ask the views of the  directors and trade union leaders of all of these enterprises on  important issues within a few hours.    We would as soon as possible like to launch the experiment  of  economic reform that will affect the Udmurtia, Mari, and  Chuvashia Republics, and Nizhniy Novgorod and Moscow counties,  namely the areas where the military industry is concentrated.  We will maximally decentralize the control of the economy and  make this industry export-oriented. According to our plans, 70  percent of the foreign currency income would go to the regions  and only the remaining amount would have to be given to the  federal budget. We will request bids for the military programs  and the winner will be the supplier of the Army while the losers  will be able to go to the international markets with their own  solutions.    [Vida] What changes do you consider necessary in Russian  foreign politics to establish favorable conditions for the  Russian military industry on foreign markets?    [Maley] First of all, we need pragmatism. We will restore  the state monopoly of weapons exports. The president himself  will approve the one-year and five-year export plans. We will  market our latest military equipment: We would always like to  sell one dollar cheaper and one technical unit better products  than our competitors. If you observe the activities of Kozyrev,  you will see that he reached pragmatism from an absolutely  pacifist position, he realized that the markets that we are  leaving are immediately taken up by his closest friends over the  ocean, without the slightest sign of a guilty conscience. Even  under the current circumstances, when we have lost many of our  traditional partners, we consider it possible to get some $10 to  12 billion a year from weapons exports by 1995.    [Vida] To what extent is Russia able to work together with  Ukraine and the other successor states in military production?    [Maley] In this area, our relations continue to be  excellent. Russia is the only one of the Soviet Union's  successor states that, as a last resort, could be fully  self-sufficient, the others cannot even cover 30 percent of  their military needs on their own. Therefore, integration is  unavoidable, providing our neighbors understand the realities.  What if they do not? We have already taught a lesson with  energy resources, which mainly made Ukraine suffer, and we can  provide another lesson. Weapons are even more expensive than  oil or gas.</p>

He also told Israel Radio that the deaths - the highest one-day toll since Israel established its 'security zone' in south Lebanon in 1985 - would not affect Middle East peace talks. Mr Rabin brushed off calls by opposition MPs to suspend peace talks. 'That would be the worst thing that could happen,' he said. 'What will that yield: stopping talks with Syria? An increase of extremism, Iranian influence, more Iranian aid?'</p>

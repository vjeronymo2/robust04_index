			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD came under pressure on the London bullion market, slipping below Dollars 329 a troy ounce in thin trading. Support was expected around Dollars 328  - 'but if there's no recovery from here then it might put itself under pressure,' said one dealer. A break through Dollars 328 could take the price down to around Dollars 325. London COCOA finished near the day's lows, but held above support at Pounds 723 for May. Losses were largely driven by bearish sentiment on charts, particularly in New York, although London was underpinned by continued sterling weakness. London's robusta COFFEE largely recouped earlier losses by the close, boosted by a resumption of this week's upward trend in New York. The market mood had become much more constructive in the last few days, dealers said. COPPER continued to encounter difficulty in making upside headway on the LME. But a steady undertone emanated from escalating violence in Zaire and the Mexican copper refinery strike, dealers said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

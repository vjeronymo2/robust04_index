			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's action amends 40 CFR 270.4 to require that owners and operators of TSDF for which a final permit has been issued by the EPA prior to June 5, 1995 must comply with the air emission control requirements for interim-status TSDF under 40 CFR 265 subparts AA, BB, and CC until the facility's permit is reviewed or reissued by the EPA. The EPA's rationale for adopting this implementation practice for today's rulemaking is explained in section VI.E of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For tanks in which waste stabilization activities (sometimes referred to as waste fixation) are performed as of December 6, 1994, be the effective date of the final rules will December 6, 1995. As of the extended effective date for stabilization tanks, each TSDF owner or operator and each hazardous waste generator subject to the final rules must either install and operate the specified air emission control requirements on all affected tanks used for stabilization, or begin performing the specified waste determinations and recordkeeping to indicate that a stabilization tank is exempted from these requirements. Under circumstances where required air emission control equipment cannot be operational on stabilization tanks by December 6, 1995, an implementation schedule for installation of the required air emission controls must be developed and placed in the facility operating records no later than December 6, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In such cases, for stabilization tanks, the facility must have all air emission controls required by the final rules in operation no later than June 8, 1998. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Rule Changes Since Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA proposed the rule on July 22, 1991 (refer to 56 FR 33491). Based on public comments received by the EPA at proposal as well as the EPA's evaluation of additional information obtained after proposal, certain requirements of the rulemaking have been changed from those proposed. The major changes affect provisions establishing the rule applicability, the procedures for determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste, and the air emission control requirements for containers. In addition, the EPA has made many changes to the specific regulatory text to clarify the EPA's intent in the application and implementation of the rule requirements. The substantive changes to the rulemaking since proposal are summarized below. A summary of the requirements of the rule as promulgated is presented in section VII of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. TSDF Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A new subpart CC is added by today's action to both 40 CFR parts 264 and 265. Subpart CC under 40 CFR part 264 applies to owners and operators of permitted TSDF while subpart CC under 40 CFR part 265 applies to owners and operators of interim-status TSDF. All changes since proposal to subpart CC in 40 CFR part 264 and to subpart CC in 40 CFR part 265 are identical with the exception of changes to the rule reporting requirements. There are no reporting requirements under 40 CFR 265 subpart CC for owners and operators of interim-status TSDF. Hereafter for convenience in this preamble, the term ``subpart CC standards'' is used collectively to refer to both subpart CC in 40 CFR part 264 and subpart CC in 40 CFR part 265. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The compliance time for the subpart CC standards has been revised since proposal to allow up to an additional 30 months after June 5, 1995 to install and begin operation of air emission control equipment required by the rule provided that the owner or operator develops and places in the facility operating records by this date an implementation schedule for installation of the equipment. Compliance dates and implementation requirements for the final rule are explained in sections I and VIII of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

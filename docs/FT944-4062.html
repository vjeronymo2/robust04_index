			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (15): Another piece of the jigsaw slots in - Scotland / Even though the Edinburgh office market is still moving fairly slowly, the scene in the capital is the most upbeat in Scotland A few days ago, funding was agreed for a 100,000 sq ft office development in the heart of Edinburgh. The project, known as Exchange Plaza, is one of the largest speculative developments being undertaken in the UK. It will slot into place another piece of the jigsaw in the Lothian Road area whose realisation at the end of the 1980s looked problematic as developers failed. Exchange Plaza, which is being funded by the Scottish developers CALA-Morrison and by Railways Pension Trustee Company, will stand near the new Edinburgh International Conference Centre, and a new headquarters being built for Standard Life. It will help relieve Edinburgh's shortage of modern open-plan office space, a shortage that has been masked by the comfortable supply of available office stock, much of it either old or requiring refurbishment, according to the chartered surveyors Ryden. Even though the Edinburgh office market is still moving fairly slowly, the scene in the capital is the most upbeat in Scotland. When restrictive planning policies were eased in the mid-1980s, demand for space far exceeded supply, pushing rents up to peaks of Pounds 27 per sq ft. Now there is space available in the Georgian New Town and city centre, rents for modern accommodation are between Pounds 18 and Pounds 20 a sq ft, comparable with UK cities such as Leeds and Birmingham. 'Edinburgh has come back into the pack,' says Mr Alan Robertson of Jones Lang Wootton's Edinburgh office. 'We now have space and rents to attract incoming businesses.' He points to surveys where Edinburgh comes near the top of preferred relocation destinations. New developments are building up steadily on the western fringe of the city, close to the motorway system. The two big Scottish banks have moved many of their activities there and the first projects are taking shape for Edinburgh Park, a high quality business park. But the move by financial institutions and professionals into new office buildings around Lothian Road area has left about half of the stately Charlotte Square empty. However the recent granting of planning permission to Helical Bar for a project to develop at the rear of the square while maintaining the Georgian houses intact appears to offer a way in which the square can be revived. There is rather less movement on the Glasgow property scene. In the late 1980s Glasgow, traditionally the biggest and most stable market in Scotland, renewed much of its office stock and extended the core down to the river Clyde. But as Mr James Thomson of Jones Lang Wootton's Glasgow office says: 'things have been very quiet for the past three years.' Much of the new property took a long time to fill up and although the amount of office space let each year has increased steadily there is still a considerable number of empty floors. Yet paradoxically the city also has a shortage of large open-plan floor space. 'If you wanted 50,000 sq ft of space in a building you'd be pushed to get it,' says Mr James Thomson, a partner in Jones Lang Wootton's Glasgow office. 'There is a lot of second-hand space hanging over the market, with tenants unable to get out of their leases. Site values are back at the levels they stood at in the mid-1980s before the last upturn.' Prime rentals, according to Ryden, have fallen back to Pounds 17.50, backed by substantial incentives. Whereas a year ago there was not a single crane working on a private sector development in central Glasgow, now two construction projects are going ahead. Hill Samuel Life Assurance and London &amp; Wiltshire are building a 23,000 sq ft building on a speculative basis in St Vincent Street, and Scottish Life House nearby is being refurbished. One of the most important developments is promised for a 49-acre site about a mile from the city centre at Pacific Quay, used for the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 and lying idle ever since. Miller Developments and CTP are working on a project whose key element, in addition to leisure facilities, is a 250,000 sq ft business park. According to the Glasgow Development Agency which owns the site, the city's performance in winning inward investors continues to suffer because of the shortage of good quality serviced industrial-business premises, particularly in comparison with the new towns of East Kilbride and Cumbernauld.</p>

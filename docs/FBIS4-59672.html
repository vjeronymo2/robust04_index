			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, today received U.S.  Ambassador Arthur Hughes who conveyed a message to the president  from the U.S. Administration related to the developments in our  country and issues of concern to the two friendly countries.    The SABA' news agency learns that the message referred to  the  firm U.S. stand on unification of the homeland on 22 May 1990,  and its support for Yemeni unity and democracy, the march of  stability, and the free market economy policy in the Yemeni  Republic. The message stressed the U.S. desire to put a  peaceful end to the current dispute within the framework of  unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy.    The Presidential Council chairman voiced his appreciation  for  the U.S. attitude toward our country and its desire to support  unity, democracy, and political pluralism. He alluded to the  challenges which the Socialist Party's rebellious and  secessionist gang wanted to impose on the homeland and the  people by opting for war and its endeavors to implement its  secessionist plot to dismember the homeland. He asserted that  the Yemeni people's choice is unity and democracy and there can  be no retreat from this choice. He said that during the coming  phase, efforts will be pooled to compensate for the shortcomings  of the previous phase and to build more, based on unity,  democracy, political pluralism, respect for human rights,  comprehensive development, and developing local government on  the basis of decentralization in administration, finance, and  social progress.    The meeting was attended by Planning and Development  Minister  'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani.</p>

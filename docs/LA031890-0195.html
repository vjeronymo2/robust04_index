			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORKER AT SHELL OIL'S CARSON SUBSTATION IS ELECTROCUTED  </P> <P> An employee of an electrical contractor working on a substation at the Shell  Oil refinery in Carson was electrocuted when he came in contact with a live  circuit Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> Lloyd Grant, 31, collapsed about 12:40 p.m. while working on a substation panel  that carries 15,000 volts, said Deputy Dean Scoville.  </P> <P> Before losing consciousness. Grant, a Colorado resident, told colleagues at the  Wilmington Avenue facility that he had received a shock.  </P> <P> Workers began trying to revive him with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and  county paramedics were called to the scene. Grant was taken to Harbor General  Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:31 p.m. of cardiac arrest.  </P> <P> Homicide detectives were assigned to investigate the incident, but "initial  indications are that it looks to be an accident," Scoville said.  </P> <P> Grant was part of a team from Asea Brown Boveri, a Philadelphia-based  electrical contractor hired by Shell to conduct tests on the substation. The  facility has been out of service for routine maintenance since March 3, said  Shell spokesman Gene Munger.  </P> <P> Although the substation supplies energy to the refinery's alkylation unit,  where a flash fire on Thursday caused minor injuries to two workers, Munger  said the two accidents were not related.  </P> <P> "The circuits were being energized selectively with test equipment at the time  of the incident," Munger said. "He obviously came in contact with something  somehow with very, very unfortunate results."  </P></p>

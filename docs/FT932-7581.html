			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Deflated expectations Cynics will have quickly rumbled yesterday's inflation data. Strip out the poll tax and mortgage interest effect and the underlying rate of inflation appears back on a gently rising trend. Insofar as this means companies have some room for manoeuvre on pricing, this need not be bad for the equity market. Especially so, since the fall in unit labour costs adds to the striking competitive advantage UK companies enjoy compared with their German counterparts. The low headline rate of inflation will also dampen wage demands for some time. Despite this week's blip in output figures, these factors should be beneficial for earnings in the manufacturing sector. That may help explain the 23 point rise in the FT-SE Mid 250 index this week while the large FT-SE 100 fell 35 points. But the market has also discounted earnings growth and worries have emerged in other areas. Rights issues are flowing again, the brewers are fighting for market share, brand values are under threat in the food industry, and low wage increases will not do much to boost retail spending. To compensate for its lack of overall direction, the equity market is still inclined to look for movement in individual sectors. Property shares are the height of fashion. The enthusiasm has spread to banks who can expect falling provisions if property values rise, and even to companies such as Forte and Ladbroke which have considerable property interests. The market could have sensed an accelerating recovery, but it has been running ahead of the underlying market for much of this year. The latest excitement may be simply a case of boredom causing it to suspend its disbelief.</p>

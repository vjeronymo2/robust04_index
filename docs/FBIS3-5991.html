			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Wimon Wongwanit  yesterday emotionally reminded U.S. Ambassador David Lambertson  that Thailand was a sovereign state and it was totally  unacceptable for any foreigner to make groundless accusations  against her. "The Foreign Ministry will not give in to any  condemnation which is totally groundless. I consider that we  are a sovereign nation and no one has the right to condemn us  like this," said the army commander. He was speaking after  presiding over a funeral ceremony at Wat Sommanatwihan of an  army officer killed by a Khmer landmine at the border in Ubon  Ratchathani.    The army commander made the remark after being asked by  reporters to comment on Mr. Lambertson's statement on Wednesday  about Thai military contacts with the Khmer Rouge. Gen. Wimon,  however, said that the U.S. embassy here has clarified the  ambassador's statement and denied the press report which quoted  the ambassador as saying that the Thai military was still  backing the Khmer Rouge.    Gen. Wimon said if a statement is made by an ambassador it  must hold some truth. "The U.S. ambassador denied that he made  such an allegation. I don't know how the press could go ahead  and publish it when he (the U.S. ambassador) said he did not  make the allegation," said Gen. Wimon.    Asked about Ambassador Lambertson's call asking the military  to sever its contacts with the Communist Khmer Rouge, Gen. Wimon  asked reporters whether the U.S. Government could bar Mexicans  from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. "Can they do that? It  could not be done as the common border is quite long. I'm a  Thai and have dignity and would not allow anyone to criticize us  without a basis. We have our own dignity," said the army  commander.    Gen. Wimon said he feels bitter whenever he learns that Thai  people have started believing in allegations made by foreigners.  He said despite making it clear on several occasions on the  neutrality of the Thai military over the conflict in Cambodia,  outsiders have not stopped making such allegations against the  Thai military. "If you reporters don't believe in what I say  then it's time you stopped asking me any more questions," said  the general.    When asked to comment on the border situation along the  Khmer  Rouge stronghold in Pailin concerning reports that Phnom Penh  was rushing reinforcements to the area in preparation for a new  offensive, Gen. Wimon quipped: "Ask the U.S. ambassador. He  might be able to comment."    Meanwhile, Army secretary Maj. Gen. Chaturit Phromsakha Na  Sakonnakhon also said that the U.S. ambassador had clarified the  matter with the army over his remarks. Maj. Gen. Chaturit said  the ambassador denied press reports quoting him as saying that  the military is still backing the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. "That  is not true," said Maj. Gen. Chaturit. "The U.S. government does  not believe that the Thai Government or the Thai military still  backs the Khmer Rouge."    He said the misquoted report dispatched by some foreign news  agencies could cause a misunderstanding and tarnish the  country's image. [passage omitted]</p>

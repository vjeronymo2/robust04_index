			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Thatcher may face Pergau quiz: MPs want aid link explained Baroness Thatcher, who as prime minister approved a donation of aid to Malaysia for the Pergau dam project, has been invited to appear before a leading Commons committee and be questioned on the affair. Members of the foreign affairs committee yesterday sent an invitation to the former prime minister asking her to appear before them in public and explain the link between the UK's offer of Pounds 234m of aid to the Malaysian government and a Pounds 1bn arms deal. Lady Thatcher's appearance would be the first by any former prime minister before a select committee of the Commons. It would mark the highlight of the committee's investigation, in which three former members of her cabinet have already been interrogated. Parliamentary rules state that, as a member of the House of Lords, Lady Thatcher is not obliged to accept the invitation. But Mr Dennis Canavan, Labour MP for Falkirk West, who is on the committee, said yesterday that it would 'look bad' if she turned it down. Some Tory MPs on the committee argued strongly yesterday that an invitation should not been sent because it was unclear whether the former prime minister had been aware of the link between the arms and aid deals when they were made in 1988. It is alleged that the linkage broke Whitehall guidelines on aid provision. In his evidence to the committee, Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, said that the decision to link the two had been taken entirely by Lord Younger, then defence secretary. Lord Howe also suggested that attempts to break the link between the two deals had been mainly led by himself. Another Tory MP argued that the invitation to Lady Thatcher would delay progress in completing the committee's report into the affair. However, Labour MPs said there was strong documentary evidence that Lady Thatcher had played an important role in attempts to hide the connection between the aid and arms deals. In June 1988 she wrote a letter to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, confirming that the offer of aid would go ahead but also expressing her hope that the defence contract could be signed later that year. Members of the committee also want to know why Lady Thatcher gave a green light to the offer of aid for the dam earlier in the year, although Foreign Office officials had been given only two days to carry out a project assessment. Members of Lady Thatcher's staff could give no indication last night of whether she would attend.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Hamburg voters snub establishment THE VOTERS of Hamburg last night delivered a resounding snub to the ruling coalition of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and to the opposition Social Democrats, in a clear indication of popular anger with the German political establishment. The winners in the city election campaign were all the protest parties, led by the Greens, who almost doubled their support from 7.1 per cent in the last election to 13.5 per cent last night. A non-political citizens' protest party, called the Statt (Instead) Partei, won eight seats in the 121-member Hamburg parliament with a vote of 5.7 per cent. To universal relief, the extreme right-wing Republicans failed to win any seats by the narrowest of margins, gaining 4.9 per cent support - just below the 5.0 per cent needed to enter the assembly. Both Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, with a slump from 35 to 25 per cent support in the election, and the SPD suffered their worst poll results in the city since the second world war. The setback to the ruling establishment was confirmed by a disastrous result for the liberal Free Democratic party, the minority partner in Mr Kohl's Bonn coalition, which will lose all its seats in the parliament. Its support tumbled from 5.4 to 4.1 per cent. The Hamburg city election, called two years early after the CDU was found guilty of undemocratic methods of selecting its party candidates in 1991, is the first of no fewer than 20 national, state and local elections in the next 13 months. The SPD, which has ruled Hamburg virtually without interruption for 46 years, ended the night with 40.4 per cent support, compared with 48 per cent in 1991, giving it 58 seats in the parliament. It has therefore lost its absolute majority of one seat, and will now have to negotiate - either with the CDU, the Greens, or the Statt party - to form a coalition city government. The collapse in the CDU vote was the biggest surprise of the night. Mr Kohl's party was clearly one of the main losers to the Statt party, which was formed by dissident Christian Democrats. The FDP also lost support to the non-party protesters. The result for the Republicans was clearly a disappointment for the party, which had been slipping in recent opinion polls. However, the total far-right vote, including the German People's Union (DVU), reached almost 10 per cent. The result for the extremists suggests their overall support has peaked. Mr Henning Voscherau, the Hamburg lord mayor and SPD party leader in Hamburg, must now decide with whom to negotiate a coalition city government. The most likely outcome is a coalition with the Greens, who campaigned openly in favour of such an outcome.</p>

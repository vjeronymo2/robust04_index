Chief </F> Editors Talk in Different Languages"]    [Text] Yesterday, representatives of some PRAVDA  executives proposed to the State Duma that a draft law  forbidding foreign control over the Russian mass media be  introduced. It is to be recalled that on 4 February, members of  the editorial office held a meeting of the work collective where  Viktor Linnik was removed from the position of chief editor and  Aleksandr Ilin appointed instead. Mr. Linnik and Mr. Ilin told  your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the split in the  collective had happened over the difference of opinion on  whether to continue cooperation with the PRAVDA publisher -- the  Greek Stilayt Holdings Ltd [as transliterated]. As the former  chief editor put it, a "Greek coup" had happened in the  newspaper. Aleksandr Ilin for his part stated that "he and Mr.  Linnik are like two heads talking in different languages."    Viktor Linnik told your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that  in April 1992, when the newspaper PRAVDA experienced serious  financial difficulties, its chiefs started looking for sponsors.  It was then that the Greek company Stilayt Holdings Ltd offered  its services as the newspaper's publisher. As a result, a joint  venture "PRAVDA International" was set up in which the  controlling block of shares (55 percent) belonged to the Greek  side, and the rest belonged to PRAVDA work collective. Mr.  Linnik points out that "It has already been 16 months since the  joint venture was created but newspaper employees have not yet  received their shares." According to Mr. Linnik, the newspaper  kept appearing after the joint venture had been formed despite  all the difficulties and small salaries (16,000 to 20,000  rubles). Relationships between PRAVDA chiefs and the Greek side  were "tolerable" all that time. But only until the point where  the Greek side demanded its inclusion among the publication's  founders.    Viktor Linnik stated: "I was against letting the Greeks have  the newspaper." In his opinion, the Greek partners want to own  the newspaper in order to get a big credit against it.  According to Mr. Linnik, the Greek side had provoked a meeting  of the work collective on 4 February where a decision was made  on dismissing the chief editor. Mr. Linnik described the voting  and the meeting itself as illegal because only 90 out of the 216  employees on the payroll voted to dismiss him. According to  Viktor Linnik, he has information attesting that taking part in  the voting were mainly employees of the Greek firm (bar women,  cleaning women, and other service personnel). Mr. Linnik added  that in his view, the meeting was illegal. He also stated that  if the PRAVDA work collective themselves fail to resolve the  conflict, he would go to court to resolve the dispute. Mr.  Linnik noted that taking part in putting out the newspaper now  are the part of the collective who had supported the appointment  of Mr. Ilin to the position of chief editor right from the start  of the conflict. Interestingly, members of the current  editorial board do not wish this announced in the newspaper.    Aleksandr Ilin, today's chief editor of PRAVDA, pointed out  in an interview to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent that the  Greek company had been the only one that helped the newspaper in  its hard times. In his view, now "it would be unethical to  break off relations with the Greek friends." Mr. Ilin said that  Viktor Linnik had long been looking for Russian partners but  that not all his efforts had been crowned with success. He  stressed that subscribers who had paid their money do not care  about whom the publication cooperates with, and the collective  has no right to deny them the newspaper over their own internal  conflicts. To your KOMMERSANT- DAILY correspondent's question  on whether the Greek partners were going to become founders of  the newspaper, Mr. Ilin categorically declared that this "was  not, is not, and will not be the point." He also pointed out  that PRAVDA's former and current chiefs made a mistake by airing  their internal problems publicly. The chief editor said that  despite their personal ambitions, the colleagues who "split off"  continue to help put out the newspaper.</p>

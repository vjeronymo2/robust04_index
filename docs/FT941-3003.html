			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Egyptian officers executed Egypt executed two army officers yesterday for plotting to kill President Hosni Mubarak, and sentenced nine Moslem militants to hang for trying to kill Prime Minister Atef Sedki, Reuter reports from Cairo. The militants, held in cages in the court, chanted: 'We will go to paradise, Mubarak. You will burn in Hell. We will kill you, Mubarak.' The two army officers were convicted last month of planting explosives at an airstrip near the Libyan border which was to have been used by Mr Mubarak. A third officer sentenced to death is on the run. The three have been hailed as heroes by Gama'a al-Islamiya, which is fighting to replace the Egyptian government with a strict Islamic state.</p>

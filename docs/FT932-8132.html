			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / People: Boleat's pro-active stance for the insurers Mark Boleat, who has won plaudits throughout the industry during his seven years as director-general of The Building Societies Association, will be lending his voice, from August, to an entirely different industry as director general of the Association of British Insurers. He says that after 20 years at the BSA he felt it was time to move on, the attraction of the ABI being that it represented an opportunity to speak for 'a more complex industry' and to wield a budget six times as large. 'I didn't want to be stuck being known as someone who can do one thing only' remarks Boleat, who has in the past been assumed to harbour national political ambitions. Indicating that it wanted a fresh approach to try and put behind it a string of public relations disasters, the ABI engaged headhunters to find its first director general. Boleat explains 'they want a much more pro-active stance, with the ability to anticipate developments a bit more, rather than just being responsive'. Mike Jones, who joined the Life Officers' Association in 1968 and who has been chief executive of the ABI since 1987, says he is leaving, 'looking for fresh woods and pastures new.' Boleat, 44, reckons his biggest achievement at the BSA and the Council of Mortgage Lenders, of which he has been director general since 1989, has been 'to help make it the most effective trade body in the financial services industry'. 'We have helped to create the right regulatory and prudential framework for building societies. It is remarkable that despite (the problems in the housing market) the societies have come through a bit battered, but intact.' Analysts said that, while he could appear arrogant, he had 'worked like a dog for the industry'. 'There are a huge number of regulatory issues, many of which will be identical at the ABI, notably the establishment of the Personal Investment Authority' Boleat adds. At the same time, he acknowledges that the interests of the 450 members are much more diverse, with general and life companies often having directly contradictory agendas. In his new role he may also find himself doing public battle - where the interests of insurers and building societies diverge - with his former colleague Adrian Coles (right) who steps up from the position of head of external relations to succeed him at both the BSA and the CML. Coles has already won himself plenty of friends - 'quieter but with an intellectual credibility second to none' was the comment of John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at UBS.</p>

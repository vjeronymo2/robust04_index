			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swiss buying lifts platinum to 7-month high - Market report Swiss buying boosted the PLATINUM price yesterday as other precious metals languished. After a quiet start the white metal moved up to Dollars 409.50 a troy ounce at London's afternoon fix and then gained another Dollars 3.50 to reach the highest level since last August. Swiss dealers, who had 'got out of their longs' earlier in the week, 'came back in on the lows', one trader said. Meanwhile GOLD closed just 55 cents up and SILVER shed another 7 cents.

This  was confirmed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina.    Robaina said we have not received official invitations for  the Cuban Government and authorities. He disclosed, however,  that singer Silvio Rodriguez; the House of the Americas  director, poet Roberto Fernandez Retamar; and Latin American  Studies Center Director Luis Suarez have received personal  invitations to the event.    In comments to ANSA, Robaina said: "We hope it (Chile) will  continue on that path."    The foreign minister said Cuba respects the way the Chileans  have handled the presidential inauguration and reiterated that  Havana is in no hurry to resume ties with Chile.    Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations on 11 September  1973 after the bloody military coup against constitutional  Chilean President Salvador Allende.    The two countries resumed relations at a consular and  commercial level in 1991, as a prior step to the definite  normalization of their bilateral relations.</p>

The  Foreign Ministry has said that, in a telephone conversation  today, the two ministers resolved to discuss further joint steps  regarding Kinkel's visit to Paris on 24 March. Reports on  alleged anxious remarks by French Ambassador Francois Scheer on  Franco-German relations were devoid of any foundation.    Scheer met Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the Foreign  Ministry, this morning. According to media reports there was  annoyance in Bonn about Scheer's remarks. Speaking to foreign  correspondents in Bonn, Scheer had, among other things, called  for closer cooperation between France and Germany in the  expansion of the European Union.</p>

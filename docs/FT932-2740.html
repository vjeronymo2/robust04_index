			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Porter Chadburn shares rise 30% despite Pounds 3.6m deficit EXCEPTIONAL losses of almost Pounds 7m, mostly related to the discontinuation of the loss-making Gola business, pushed Porter Chadburn, the packaging, consumer products and specialist distribution group, into a Pounds 3.62m pre-tax deficit in the year to April 2. The final dividend is cut to 0.4p, halving the year's total to 1.25p. However, the shares jumped 30 per cent - from 20p to 26p - reflecting positive comments on the outlook from Mr Raymond Dinkin, chairman. He said there had been 'continued growth' in the US since the year-end and reported 'a few encouraging signs,' including some stronger order books, in the UK. The loss, which had been expected, led to losses per share of 4.82p; in the previous year there was a profit of Pounds 5.59m giving earnings of 5.18p. The results were prepared in accordance with the FRS 3 accounting standard. Mr Dinkin said 1992-93 had been 'a year of mixed performances' with Porter Chadburn's enlarged labelling business in the US performing well. But the UK leisure and household marketing and distribution activities suffered badly from recession which hit sales and margins, particularly in the second half. Group turnover from continuing operations increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 132.3m (Pounds 110.8m) including Pounds 11.9m from acquisitions. Discontinued operations added Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 21.5m). Operating profit from continuing operations fell by 50 per cent to Pounds 4.14m (Pounds 8.3m), and acquisitions provided Pounds 1.56m. The discontinued Gola operations incurred operating losses of Pounds 1.36m (Pounds 2.36m). Turnover in the packaging division, led by Lord Label and the recently acquired Lancer Label in the US, jumped by 62 per cent to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 32.6m) and operating profits increased to Pounds 4.78m (2.63m). In consumer products sales also grew slightly to Pounds 61.7m (Pounds 60.2m) but operating profits slumped to Pounds 214,000 from Pounds 4.07m. Profits from the specialist distribution businesses slipped to Pounds 709,000 (Pounds 1.61m) on turnover of Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 18m). Net interest payments fell to Pounds 978,000 (Pounds 1.36m) and year-end borrowings were Pounds 10.9m, representing gearing of 56 per cent.</p>

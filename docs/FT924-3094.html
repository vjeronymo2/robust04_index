			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: European shipbuilders face a brighter future - But recovery is still some way off European shipbuilders have been hit hard this year by a combination of negative factors: a weak dollar, falling tanker rates and volatility in European financial markets over economic convergence. However, some analysts believe that the sector may be reaching the bottom of the present cycle and forecast an upturn as the scrapping of older vessels accelerates over the next few years, thereby reducing the present surplus capacity. Mr Ole Slorer, a transport analyst at County NatWest, says that the world's VLCC tanker fleet (Very Large Crude Carriers ranging from 200,000 to 300,000 dead weight tonnes) has 'a heavily skewed age profile with some 50 per cent of the fleet built in the 1972-1976 period'. With a tanker having an average life of 20 years, Mr Slorer notes that 'once scrapping commences the concentrated age profile will lead to a very rapid contraction of tonnage'. Kvaerner, Europe's largest shipbuilder and the fifth-largest in the world, has seen its free shares slip from a year's high of NKr229 (Dollars 38) in January to a low of NKr117 in early September. The price has come back recently on the dollar's strength, closing at NKr135 yesterday. However, some analysts believe that the group is in a good position to benefit from a turnround in the sector. Its eight-month results were upset by heavy losses in its mechanical engineering unit, while the shipbuilding division, accounting for some 30 per cent of group sales, showed a healthy 46 per cent rise in profits to NKr494m. The group's recent acquisition of the Warnow shipyard in east Germany has strengthened its European network of yards and, says County NatWest, a shipbuilding order book of NKr14bn 'puts Kvaerner in a position to achieve substantial profits growth'. Merrill Lynch notes that both Kvaerner's Finnish and Norwegian yards are now operating profitably while the Govan shipyard in Scotland, bought from the UK government in 1989, although still lossmaking, is showing signs of improvement. The broker concludes by arguing that the current p/e ratio of around 7 times appears low and suggests that a multiple of 8 to 9 times 'would be more appropriate for the group at this stage of the business cycle, implying a price of around NKr180'. Bremer Vulkan, Germany's largest marine technology and shipbuilder, is forecast by some analysts to have the potential for a rapid growth in earnings following a strategy of reorganisation and cost-cutting. Its recent acquisition of the east German shipbuilder MTW is likely to increase its shipbuilding capacity by some 50 per cent. The group has also been diversifying further into marine electronics and away from shipbuilding: the latter, which had accounted for 66 per cent of sales in 1982, had fallen to 43 per cent by the end of 1991, and this trend is set to continue. The group has been helped, as with most European shipbuilders, by government subsidies which are currently running at some DM30m-35m (Dollars 19m-22m) year. It will also benefit from last month's announcement that subsidies to the German industry are to virtually double next year. Mr Alex Magona, German analyst at Map Securities in London, forecasts that the group will resume dividend payments in 1993, coinciding with the the company's centenary year, after a 16-year suspension. However, the transport team at County NatWest is more cautious: while acknowledging that the shipbuilding order book is healthy, 'high profitability is unlikely until the second half of the decade,' it says, rating the stock as neutral over the long term.</p>

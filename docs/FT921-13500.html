			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Trade News: GEC Alsthom wins Pounds 545m Dutch gas turbine contract GEC ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French power engineering group, yesterday underlined its growing presence in the world market for large gas turbines by announcing a Fl 1.75bn (Pounds 545m) contract to supply equipment for a new Dutch power station. The deal is GEC Alsthom's biggest turbine order, and forms the lion's share of a Fl 2bn project planned by Electriciteits Produktiemaatschappij Oost en Noord-Nederland (Epon), the biggest Dutch electricity supplier. Work begins this spring on the project at Eems, in the north of the Netherlands. The 1,700MW station will be one of the world's two biggest outside Japan, using the combined cycle process; waste heat from a gas turbine drives a steam one, producing greater thermal efficiency and fewer emissions. The deal is a blow to GEC Alsthom's two big European power generating equipment rivals, Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri. It confirms the advantage the Anglo-French group has with its Frame 9F gas turbine, developed jointly by General Electric of the US and GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbine Company (EGT). The 9F is the world's biggest gas turbine, specifically designed for high performance in combined cycle operation. Mr Kelvin Bray, EGT chairman, said the latest order, after a recent contract from National Power in the UK and one with Electricite de France, 'will allow us to establish the 9F and its derivatives as the turbines for large combined cycle stations'. At Eems, EGT will supply five 335MW Vega 109F units, incorporating the gas turbine, steam turbine and generator on a single shaft. Overall thermal efficiency will be about 55 per cent, against an average 41 per cent in existing Dutch power stations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, May 1 (XINHUA)--Sichuan, China's most  populous province and largest producer of grain and edible oil,  is expected to have a bumper harvest this summer.    The provincial agricultural department predicts that wheat  output will reach that of 1992, a record year, and rapeseed  output will increase by 10 percent over last year.    Sichuan's grain and edible oil output decreased last year.  Since the beginning of this year, local governments have  attached more importance to agriculture and taken measures to  lessen the burden on farmers.    Meanwhile, the provincial government has sent some 100  experts to the countryside, who, together with 25,000  agronomists working at the county and township levels, have  helped local farmers to manage 2.33 million hectares of  farmland, 30 percent of the province's crop-growing areas.    The local governments are now working out purchasing prices  for wheat and rapeseed. Local farmers say that they expect  higher and more reasonable prices for their products.    The rapeseed output of the province makes up 17 percent of  the national total. The provincial government expects to  purchase 400 million kg of edible oil this summer, half of which  will go to the rest of the country. Local officials say that a  good harvest in the province would stabilize the country's  edible oil market.</p>

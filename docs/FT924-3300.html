			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Henderson in Pounds 42.5m expansion HENDERSON Administration has agreed to pay Pounds 42.5m cash for Touche Remnant, its fellow fund management group. The two companies announced they were in takeover talks in October. As part of the deal, Societe Generale, Touche Remnant's current owner, has agreed to take on the 22 year lease of TR's headquarters in London's Puddle Dock. The TR staff will transfer to Henderson's office in Finsbury Avenue; Henderson estimates this will save Pounds 2.5m a year. A condition of the deal is that Touche Remnant has net assets of Pounds 15.4m, and net cash (or its equivalent) of Pounds 18m, on acquisition. The combined company will have about Pounds 9.9bn of funds under management, of which a quarter will be in investment trusts - making the group the biggest investment trust manager in the UK. Mr Paul Manduca, Touche Remnant's chairman, will join the Henderson board and will be deputy group managing director. The acquisition circular shows that Touche Remnant incurred an operating loss of Pounds 3.07m in 1991. Interest receivable of Pounds 2.4m reduced the pre-tax loss to Pounds 668,000. Henderson said that the takeover should bring considerable cost savings. Its operating expenses are equivalent to 0.4 per cent of funds under management; Touche Remnant's expenses represent 0.8 per cent. The deal will have to be approved at an extraordinary meeting of Henderson shareholders on December 21. Henderson's shares rose 47p to 685p yesterday.</p>

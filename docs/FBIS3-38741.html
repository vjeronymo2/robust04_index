It has been  made painfully clear that the relationship between the 40  million or so Irish Americans and Dublin is more durable than  the one between the White House and Downing Street.    It would be a great shame if the pique of the Prime  Minister,  John Major, or some of the collateral fall-out from the visit of  Mr Adams to the U.S., distracted from pursuit of the peace  process set out on December 15.    There is a tendency among British and Unionist politicians  to  throw up their hands in horror at the idea of the Sinn Fein  leader being given carte blanche to present himself as a person  of peace. However, this grossly underestimates the wisdom of all  those who watched his show in action.    His constant resort to attacks on the perceived colonial  power, Britain, and events that took place more than 70 years  ago, tends to be as unconvincing as Colonel al-Qadhdhafi's  attempt to blame all the world's ills on American imperialism.  It is the defence of someone who does not have the intellectual  fire power to justify violence, even on contemporary grounds.    The other benefits of Mr Adams' visit, are, first, the  acknowledgement by President Clinton that the December 15  declaration was the best way forward. Having the world's only  superpower behind the process can be helpful, as the  Israeli-Palestinian deal proves.    Second, as high level officials in Dublin point out, it puts  pressure on Mr Adams and the IRA to deliver on a ceasefire.  When he arrived at Dublin airport early yesterday he described  moves towards peace as being their "final phase," a timely break  in his recent meanderings on the need for clarifications.    In fact, it is something of a distraction that Sir Patrick  Mayhew should have chosen now, just as the impact of Mr Adams's  visit is being absorbed in Ireland, to have changed horses by  refettling the existing political process. His ideas, including  a measure of power devolution to a new assembly and cross-border  co-operation in tourism and environment, are fine, and maybe  even sensible.    But the timing is appalling. It gives the appearance of a  domestically driven, political reaction to Mr Adams's megaphone  in New York. It does seem that Sir Patrick has again played  what is perceived in Dublin as his weakest suit: the failure to  consult with those directly concerned in the Nationalist and  Loyalist communities.    Senior ministers in Dublin believe that the Downing Street  declaration faces its stiffest test in the next few weeks. Once  the European election campaign moves into high gear in the  spring (polling is in July) politicians on both sides of the  border -- but particularly the Unionists in the North -- will be  so trapped by the need to show the respective power of their  factions, that the boldness which brought James Molyneaux to  Dublin will be snuffed out.    The government of the Republic has made an unusual effort  to cultivate Unionist support for the Downing Street declaration  with the Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] and foreign minister,  Dick Spring, travelling to Belfast and the Shankill as part of  the effort to demonstrate that politicians in the South do not  have horns. Indeed, there is a view here that Sir Patrick  should have spent as much time closely cultivating Unionist and  Nationalist factions, instead of pronouncing from Stormont in  the manner of the old-style British ruler.    What essentially has been going on since December 15 is  waiting on the IRA. It was clear from day one that, despite the  prelude of the Hume-Adams talks (and the accord which may never  even have been put down on paper) and the disclosure of the  unofficial contacts between Britain and Sinn Fein, that the IRA  was nowhere near ready to accept the concept of a ceasefire let  alone laying down its arms.    What has followed has been a kind of double bluff. Mr Adams  has waffled on ad nauseam about the need for clarification of  the Downing Street declaration. Albert Reynolds and the Dublin  government and Downing Street (to a lesser extent) have obliged  by delivering a series of speeches and statements looking across  a range of issues-including demilitarisation.    However, the real clarification that Mr Adams has been  seeking, according to high level offficials here, is not from  the main parties to the declaration (their positions are  basciaUy known) but from within the IRA itself. Adams is seen  as in the centre of a "poisonous" power struggle. He is  representative of a better educated generation which believes  that the armed struggle can never be won and that it is time to  modernise the IRA cause and move away from the hardline  republicanism, hatred and mythology of past generations.    But Mr Adams's ability to bring the moderates along, let  alone the extremists, is a high-wire act, and it is by no means  clear whether he will cross to the other side. It must be  remembered that the IRA has a strong vested interest in  maintaining an armed struggle that has brought them a large flow  of informal funds from the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and  created a black economy built on racketeering.    Moreover, nobody -- including Mr Adams -- knows what the  reaction will be in the cells of South Armagh, the greatest  stronghold of republicanism. If Mr Adams pushes too far he  could find himself with a bullet in the neck, unleashing  internecine warfare within the extremist nationalist movement.    There is no great optimism in Dublin government circles of  the Downing Street declaration advancing. It believes it could  fail for a number of reasons: the exposure of Mr Adams, failure  of the British Government to maintain its secret track of  dialogue, the weakness of John Major which leaves him vulnerable  to the pressure of the more extreme Loyalists.    Sir Patrick's mid-course correction smacks of that. Despite  all of this there is a conviction here that the gains in  economic co-operation and standards of living which would follow  rapprochement are far too important to be lost. Failure now  would mean another two decades of armed stalemate and lost  economic opportunities.</p>

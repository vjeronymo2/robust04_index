In this regard the following points are worthy of  notice and further discussion:    1. There is no doubt that the broadcast of the Voice and  Vision organization's answer over the national radio network was  irresponsible, because Article 76 of the Constitution states  that the Majles has the clear right to research and investigate  all the nation's affairs.    Apart from its insults to the sacred Majles and its  respected  deputies, the answer from the Voice and Vision organization did  not have sufficient evidence.    Even assuming that there was material in the report from the  Inquiry and Investigation Group that does not conform to  reality, the authority to determine that is not the body that is  being investigated! That body can defend itself in a judicial  trial and if any right has been violated, it can take steps to  vindicate its rights. Otherwise, all the bodies and  organizations investigated would want to investigate and even  judge and issue an opinion about the work of the Majles,  including any report it issues about their own organization, and  such a right is not given in the Constitution to any body,  organization or government unit in any of the ordinary laws or  the Constitution.    2. From the failure to broadcast the subsequent portions of  the answer from the Voice and Vision organization, it appears  that this decision was precipitous and hasty, and a violation.  The question arises, why does the supervisor of the Voice and  Vision organization act on his own in matters of such  importance? What is the penalty for doing this?    3. The question of the competence of a deputy or deputies is  the concern of the executive councils, the Guardian Council and  also the Majles. This matter is pursued by the deputies  themselves at the beginning of each term. In any case, a deputy  who has taken a seat in the Majles is competent in the eyes of  the people who voted for him and also in the eyes of the  deputies themselves. How is it possible that his competence can  be questioned by a body that has been investigated for improper  performance?    The insults to the sacred Majles and its deputies, which are  in the first part of the answer from the Voice and Vision  organization, are unprecedented, and the Voice and Vision  organization certainly must make amends.    Public opinion expects the honor of the deputies who have  been slandered to be restored.    4. Among the insults, which have been improperly propagated,  is the claim that is in the first of the answer from the Voice  and Vision organization in the sacred presence of Imam Khomeyni  (peace be upon him). Although the criticism in the answer is  useless and it contains completely incorrect material, it is not  without benefit to mention the following in order to reveal for  readers the logic of those who prepared the answer.    The answer from the Voice and Vision organization states:  "The goals of the Voice and Vision organization are guidance,  training, information, education, recreation, amusement. This  organization has never once broadcast a neutral program and it  does not do so. All the programs have goals and are educational.  This is not a claim that the Voice and Vision organization is  making, this is the opinion of His Holiness the Imam, may God be  pleased with him, in the fall of 1366 [1987]."    Although in a message in the year 1366 [21 March 1987-20  March 1988] His Holiness the Imam said "violations are sometimes  rarely seen, and one must be more vigilant." The officials of  the Voice and Vision organization believe that they have not  broadcast a neutral program even once, and they have also  connected that to the Imam's testimony.    First of all, the Imam's blessed manuscript pertains to what  had been broadcast, not to what would be broadcast in the  future. Second, His Holiness the Imam said "violations are  sometimes rarely seen." Thus it is not as the gentlemen claim,  not even once.    Third, has the supervisor of the Voice and Vision  organization forgotten that on 8/10/1367 [1 November 1988] the  Imam wrote a harsh letter protesting what was being broadcast by  the Voice of the Islamic Republic?    For Mr. Hashemi's information, we present His Holiness the  Imam's opinion:    In the name of the Almighty    Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, executive director of the Voice and  Vision organization of the Islamic Republic:    It is absolutely regrettable and sad that yesterday  (Saturday, 8 Bahman [28 January]) material was broadcast over  the Voice of the Islamic Republic on the model for women, which  one is ashamed to repeat. The person that broadcast these things  is to be punished and fired and those involved in this will be  punished. If it is proved that there was an intentional insult,  without a doubt the person making the insult will be condemned  to death. If this sort of thing is repeated, it will mean severe  and serious punishment and penalties for the high-level  officials of the Voice and Vision organization. Of course the  judiciary will take steps in all areas.    11/9/1367 [29 January 1988] Ruhollah al-Musavi al-Khomeyni    Do you still claim that all the programs are educational?  Now  answer, which of the Voice and Vision organization's goals were  being pursued by insulting the sacred things of Islam, in such a  way as to draw a protest from His Holiness the Imam (peace be  upon him)? Was it guidance, education, information, information,  training, recreation or entertainment?    Apart from any kind of penalties that the law may set for  him, the supervisor of the Voice and Vision organization  certainly must remember the holy presence of His Holiness the  Imam in relation to the violation he has committed and he must  also apologize to the deputies of the Majles  Footnotes [location within text not indicated]    [.sup]1.[/] Newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI    [.sup]2.[/] Sahifeh Nur, Vol. 21, p 76</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> LEGENDARY WALKING VIOLIN MINSTREL DIES AT AGE 76  </P> <P> Elston Johnson, the "Violin Man" who wandered the streets of Whittier for  nearly 25 years playing lively tunes on his fiddle, has died. He was 76.  </P> <P> Johnson died Sunday afternoon at his home after suffering from a prolonged  illness, said Gladys French, Johnson's caretaker.  </P> <P> Visitations for the fiddler will be held from 2 to 8 p.m. today at White  Emerson Funeral Home, 13304 E. Philadelphia St., Whittier.  </P> <P> Johnson, a kind and gentle-mannered fellow who looked a little like Santa Claus  with his long white beard, had become a legend in Whittier. When Johnson was  younger he walked between 10 and 25 miles a day through Whittier, playing his  fiddle.  </P> <P> After Johnson became ill several months ago, French and her husband, Paul,  would drive Johnson to a park or street corner where he could play his carefree  tunes.  </P> <P> Johnson, also known as the "Whittier Walker," said during an interview in  September that he put on the impromptu concerts because he loved music and  fresh air.  </P></p>

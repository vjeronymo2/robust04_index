			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Help sought in tracing Maxwell funds ACCOUNTANTS trying to trace the assets of the late Robert Maxwell yesterday called on the government to put diplomatic pressure on Liechtenstein and Switzerland to help unlock information held in secretive foreign trusts. Mr Peter Phillips, a partner with accountancy firm Buchler Phillips and receiver to Mr Maxwell's personal estate, said he needed high-level support to identify funds held in more than a dozen trusts in several countries. Mr Phillips, who has traced up to Pounds 10m of Mr Maxwell's assets, said: 'Now the government has started using words like crime and fraud in relation to the Maxwell case, it should come out of its shell and offer help to groups trying to recover assets.' His views reflect the concerns of others searching for assets stolen from pensioners and creditors to the Maxwell empire who have found their work blocked by regulations to maintain secrecy. They believe that substantial assets may have been either channelled through, or be currently placed in, offshore trusts which are refusing to co-operate. Mr Neil Cooper, the partner at accountancy firm Robson Rhodes who is liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management - manager and trustee of the Maxwell pension funds - said he had been offered no assistance from the government in his search. 'We need jurisdictions overseas to recognise the special nature of this case, in which we are tracing stolen assets,' he said. 'That sets it aside from the normal secrecy and privacy conditions by which these countries operate.' He said investigators had no sense of the total value of assets which may have been held in offshore trusts, and had not been able to see their accounts or interview their directors. Other accountants attempting to trace assets include partners at Arthur Andersen, administrators to more than 400 companies in the private Maxwell business empire. The government said it would provide help to those tracing Maxwell assets through a special unit, the creation of which Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced in the Commons on Monday. The Department of Social Security said it would hold discussions with anyone able to assist in returning stolen assets either in the UK or abroad. It saw no need to involve the Foreign Office in diplomatic discussions. The unit is expected to be operating within a few days, and is currently assembling civil servants and private sector employees to work in it. The appointment of a chairman drawn from the private sector with financial experience is expected to be announced early next week. Mr Cooper said: 'We wait to see if the government is prepared to extend the channels being proposed to put pressure on banks and institutions to other institutions and to other states. We would welcome any assistance that could be given.' The assets identified by Mr Phillips includes about Pounds 3m from a Frankfurt office building sold earlier this year and traced to a bank account in France.

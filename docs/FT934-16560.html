			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Norway seeks US go-ahead for whaling NORWAY said yesterday it would seek US agreement for a limited resumption of commercial whaling, after a decision by President Bill Clinton to delay imposing trade sanctions against Oslo for breaking an international ban on such whaling. The president said on Monday that Norway's resumption this year of commercial hunting of Minke whales, defying a 1985 International Whaling Commission moratorium, merited sanctions under US law. However, Mr Clinton told Congress that US objectives would be best achieved by delaying such a move 'until we have exhausted all good-faith efforts to convince Norway to follow agreed conservation measures'. Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norwegian prime minister, responded by saying that Norway would set no commercial quotas for its whalers for next year until after the next meeting of the IWC in Mexico next May. Even so, officials in Olso made clear that Norway would try to persuade the US at the IWC meeting to support a resumption of limited commercial whale catches. 'That is definitely our purpose,' a Foreign Ministry official said. Norway decided to defy the IWC moratorium earlier this year after the commission had voted to keep it in place, despite a recommendation by its scientific committee for a limited harvesting of the Minke whale. For the 1993 season, Oslo allowed its whalers a commercial quota of 160 Minke, of which 156 were caught. Mrs Brundtland and Mr Johan Joergan Holst, foreign minister, have lobbied hard in Washington to avoid sanctions. Their efforts seem to have been helped by the goodwill which Norway has amassed through its mediation which led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last month. Norway, with annual exports to the US worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.32bn), had feared retaliation against its fish exports, worth some Dollars 70m. Its salmon exports to the US are subject to anti-dumping duties.</p>

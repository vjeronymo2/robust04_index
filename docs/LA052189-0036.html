			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAKING A SMALL CLAIM IN COURT  </P> <P> Your article of May 11, "How to Proceed in Small Claims Court" (Legal View by  Jeffrey S. Klein), was most instructive and should certainly help litigants to  be better prepared.  </P> <P> The public, however, should have been made aware that a Small Claims Advisory  Service exists (at the request of the courts) and is run for the benefit of the  consumer by the County of Los Angeles under the auspices of Consumer Affairs.  Any Small Claims Court Clerk will give out the number of the nearest advisory  service (there are several locations throughout the county). Advisers give  non-legal advice to plaintiffs or defendants on procedural matters, fees,  subpoenas, appeals, collection methods and general conduct in Small Claims  Court.  </P> <P> ANNE F. HEINEMAN  </P> <P> Small Claims Court Adviser  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

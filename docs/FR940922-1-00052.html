Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 184 requires that in reviewing the recommendation of the OTC, EPA must evaluate whether the additional control measures are ``otherwise consistent with this [Act].'' In general, states, with the exception of California, are prohibited under section 209(a) of the Act from regulating emissions from new motor vehicles. However, section 177 of the Act provides an exception from this prohibition that allows a state which has plan provisions approved under part D of title I of the Act to adopt California's standards relating to control of emissions from new motor vehicles and to take other actions otherwise prohibited under section 209(a) if_  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Such standards are identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) California and such state adopt such standards at least two years before commencement of such model year (as determined by regulations of the Administrator). Nothing in this section or in Title II of this Act shall be construed as authorizing any such state to prohibit or limit, directly or indirectly, the manufacture or sale of a new motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in California as meeting California standards, or to take any action of any kind to create, or have the effect of creating, a motor vehicle or engine different than a motor vehicle or engine certified in California under California standards (a ``third vehicle'') or otherwise create such a ``third vehicle''.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 42 U.S.C. &sect;7507.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 177 of the Act provides the only exception in the Act from preemption of state standards for control of emissions from new motor vehicles under section 209(a). The control measures recommended by the OTC must therefore be consistent with section 177. EPA noted in the NPRM that four aspects of the OTC recommendation may implicate section 177 of the Act. See 59 FR 21735. First, the OTC recommends that EPA require use of California LEVs but specifically states that adoption of California reformulated gasoline is not a part of the recommendation. Second, the recommendation does not require inclusion of the ZEV sales requirement in any state regulations except to the extent the sales requirement is required under section 177. Third, EPA noted that the recommendation did not explicitly incorporate California's regulations. Instead, the recommendation merely stated that the OTC recommended adoption of a low emission vehicle program that includes certain elements detailed in the recommendation, pursuant to the requirements of section 177. EPA also noted that the OTC recommended incorporation of California's fleet NMOG standards and that some commenters believed incorporation of the NMOG standards was inconsistent with section 177. Finally, EPA requested comments regarding whether section 177 allows a state to adopt a California vehicle program in a portion of the state, rather than the entire state. This final point is not addressed in this section of the preamble, but is addressed in section IV.A.2.(c)iii., above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the publication of the first NPRM, EPA has received comments indicating that other aspects of the OTC's recommendation may violate section 177. One commenter asserted that a state's incorporation of the California LEV program after the program is initiated in California may create a ``third vehicle'' because of the operation of California's emissions credit banking regulations. Also, a commenter questioned whether a state without a current nonattainment area or an approved state implementation plan can impose the California LEV requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA today proposes to find that the OTC's recommendation for EPA to require implementation of the OTC LEV program throughout the OTR is consistent with section 177. Moreover, EPA proposes to find that implementation of the ZEV sales requirement is not necessary in order for the recommendation to be consistent with section 177. Therefore, EPA proposes not to require that states in the OTR adopt the ZEV sales requirement. Individual states may, at their discretion, incorporate the ZEV sales requirements into their programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. California Fuel Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes to find that the OTC's failure to include California's clean fuel requirements in its recommendation does not violate section 177. EPA believes that the failure to include the California fuels requirements does not violate the requirement of section 177 that standards must be ``identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted for such model year.'' EPA also believes that the lack of California fuel requirements does not violate the ``third car prohibition'' of section 177.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

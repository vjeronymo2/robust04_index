			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex energy futures system in London ACCESS, the electronic system for dealing energy futures developed by the New York Mercantile Exchange, will go live in London tomorrow. There are already 100 Access screens in the US, but the 10 screens in London will be the first outside Nymex's domestic market. Nymex officials said 70 traders in London had been trained to use the screens, which operate outside normal Nymex trading hours. The next stage is to install screens in the Far East. Average daily volume on Access reached 2,000 contracts in October, ahead of targets. According to dealers, the success of the system is partly due to the global nature of the oil market. Oil futures can used by oil producers, and companies which need to buy large quantities of oil, to hedge their exposure to price changes. Six leading brokerage houses have taken screens, which will give access to a pool of around 100-150 accounts each, a Nymex official said. One of the London screens has been taken by Mobil, reflecting interest among commercial companies, as well as brokers. Dealers said the arrival of Access screens was likely to boost volume on London's International Petroleum Exchange, since it will allow dealers to trade the spread between the IPE's Brent and Nymex's WTI (West Texas Intermediate) contracts during the whole of the London trading day. Currently, traders cannot do this until Nymex opens at 9.45 local New York time. Chevron Corporation of the US has been awarded exploration rights for a 1,820 square kilometre bloc in the East China Sea under an agreement signed at the weekend with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Kosovo's autonomy must be restored Sir, As sanctions are imposed on Serbia and as the possibility of using aerial and naval blockades to restrain Serbian aggression in Bosnia Hercegovina and Croatia is seriously considered, in my view not before time, the EC ministers must give serious attention to the situation in Kosovo. I have just returned from observing Sunday's unofficial elections there and can confirm your correspondent Laura Silber's report, 'Kosovo elections raise risk of conflict' (May 26). The position in that province, which had full autonomy within the former Yugoslav federation, is that of a people under occupation. Police are everywhere and, even in the short time I was there - a day and a half - I was questioned once by the roadside and on another occasion taken to a police station for three-quarters of an hour. Most of the police are young, about 20, appearing at once aggressive and insecure and all armed with Kalashnikovs. The policy of the Albanians, led by Dr Rugova, has been to seek to avoid both confrontation and violence. It is hard to forecast how long this can hold in the face of continued harassment, the closure of educational establishments (there has been no Albanian secondary education for over a year and Albanians have been sacked from the university, this in a province which is 90 per cent Albanian and only 8 per cent Serb) and the erosion of job opportunities. At any time things could snap, and given that the Serbians have all the military power and have shown a capacity to use it, unhesitatingly and ruthlessly, the outcome could be horrendous. Throughout the break-up of Yugoslavia the EC approach has been misplaced, first believing that Yugoslavia could, even ought, to be held together and then attempting even-handedness between Serbia and Croatia, in the face of the evidence of Vukovar, Osijek and Dubrovnik. Now that the approach is more realistic, the problem of what to do about Kosovo cannot be avoided. It is not simply that Kosovo would be made to suffer disproportionately if sanctions bite, it is the fact that, so far, the EC has only reacted to displays of force. The Albanian community in Kosovo has avoided force, so it has had little attention paid to it by the EC and relatively little media attention. If this peaceful approach is ignored much longer, it cannot hold and we would share responsibility for the outcome. The EC should now make it unequivocally clear to Milosevic that the general resolution of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, which must come at some stage, has to include provision for the restoration of autonomy to Kosova. It should be guaranteed an internationally organised plebiscite on its future, similar to what was done in the Saar.

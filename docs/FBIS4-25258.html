			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of China Northwest Airlines will  resign to take the blame for China's worst air accident, airline  sources said yesterday. Gao Junyue expressed his desire to  resign to civil aviation officials who are in Xian investigating  Monday's crash, which killed 160 people. Gao was told the  resignation would not be accepted until a preliminary  investigation reports whether the accident was a result of poor  maintenance.    The revelation came as the identities of four Hong Kong  people, including a prominent Sydney businesswoman, were  released yesterday and workers recovered the aircraft's flight  recorder. The official Hong Kong China News Agency said last  night the Xian disaster showed China's poor air safety situation  had not improved, despite a new leadership in the Civil Aviation  Administration of China (CAAC). The CAAC's deputy director, Yan  Zhixiang, said the air safety situation in China remained "grim".    The rapid tendering of Gao's resignation is a result of  agreements signed by all airline presidents in March, sources  said. When presiding over his first national aviation safety  meeting, China's new aviation chief, Chen Guangyi, forced  airline presidents to sign agreements promising to "take  personal responsibility for any crashes". "I signed, so I must  be responsible," Gao was reported to have said yesterday. The  vice-president of the airline, Wang Wancai, who is in charge of  flight operations, is expected to replace Gao.    The Russian-built Tupolev TU-154M crashed at about 8.20am in  Changan county, minutes after leaving Xian. It is believed  there was an engine failure and the pilot was trying to return  to Xian when two explosions tore the aircraft apart.    Airline officials identified three of-the Hong Kong victims  as Lau Chi-cheung, Chu Ym-ming and Mak Hong, all males. Their  ages ranged from 35 to 70. An immigration spokeswoman, Tammy  Keung, said the department was able to contact relatives of the  three Hong Kong residents. The families left for Xian  yesterday. The fourth Hong Kong victim was a businesswoman,  Margaret Shen Beaumont, an Australian national who was born in  the territory and lived in Sydney. Her family in Australia is  expected to leave for China this week.    Other victims include a Taiwanese, an Italian couple and  their two children, aged nine and 10, two Americans, and two  male British tourists. Chinese authorities said all the bodies  had been recovered.    Shen, a prominent member of Sydney's business community, had  been visiting a friend in Xian and was to have joined an  Australian trade delegation in Guangzhou before the group, led  by the New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, travelled to Beijing  yesterday. Fahey expressed his condolences yesterday and said  he was "shocked and saddened" by Shen's death.    A spokesman for Fahey said Shen, who travelled to China  frequently on business, was to have joined the delegation as an  adviser because she co-owned a business in Guangzhou. The  airline notified Fahey, who spoke with Shen's step-father, a  retired senior Hong Kong police officer now living in Sydney.  Shen, whose family owned the Noble House Chinese restaurant in  Sydney, is survived by a daughter and a grand-daughter.</p>

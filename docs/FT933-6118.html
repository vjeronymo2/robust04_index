			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / School finance change urged LIMITS ON investments in state schools should be abolished to allow more investment from the private sector, Mr Michael Fallon, the former schools minister, argues in a pamphlet published today. His move extends the debate on the private finance initiative announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, in the last autumn statement to the education sector. Mr Fallon describes the current system of capital investment in schools as 'bureaucratic and fossilised'. He adds: 'Worse still, it cuts across the government's central objective of extending parental choice.' He proposes that schools themselves, rather than local authorities, should be given access to private-sector capital investment. This liberalisation could lead to joint ventures and leasing arrangements with private developers and other educational institutions. The private sector could also build and run language laboratories, sports halls and drama workshops which could then be contracted for use by a range of state schools and local companies, Mr Fallon suggests. Schools, he adds, could work with universities, colleges and the private sector to create 'education parks' for multiple educational use. Mr Fallon also attacks planning arrangements which stop schools being built if other nearby schools have unused capacity. He describes this as the 'thrombosis at the heart of the system' and suggests that full reform would 'encourage new schools quite irrespective of over supply provided that they can demonstrate sufficient commitment on the part of local parents to transfer from existing schools'. The pamphlet suggests that when a new school is needed in an area it should be put out to tender with either existing schools or private promoters free to bid for a contract. Brighter Schools.

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Road tolls: excise option more efficient and fairness essential to their success (2) Sir, The Budget announcement that the government has decided to go ahead with motorway charging as soon as the electronic technology is ready almost certainly defers implementation of any such scheme until after the next general election. However, it does not defer the need to continue efforts to ensure that charging, when it comes, is both sensible and fair. Once again, it seems probable that the intransigence of the Treasury will turn out to be the main obstacle. Charging can be made acceptable to the motorist only if the money raised is committed to spending on the road network; is additional to current road investment; and there is a realignment of other motoring taxes to make introduction of a charging system fair and not unduly onerous. If the Treasury cannot accept direct hypothecation of revenue from user charges then the motorist will resent motorway charging. An unfair system will have 'poll tax potential', and could backfire on the government. The UK's 35m motorists make up a significant proportion of the electorate and will not accept a proposal that is grossly unfair. The Treasury should look to the future and radically review its own rules, which look increasingly like outdated dogma. For those concerned about provision of a road network on which the economy will remain hugely dependent, the battle over the coming months must be to secure a fundamental Treasury reappraisal.

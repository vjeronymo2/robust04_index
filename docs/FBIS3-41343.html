			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning Peru" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] President Alberto Fujimori's official visit to  Colombia has concluded. The last day of his visit was very  important, as the Neighbors Agreement that was signed will  increase and strengthen Colombia-Peruvian relations. Both  presidents spoke out in favor of the defense of participative  democracy in the hemisphere. The presidents visited the [word  indistinct] neighborhood, one of the most poverty stricken in  this capital. [passage omitted]    Subsequently, President Alberto Fujimori visited Congress  where he met with Senate President Jorge Ramon Elias, who  invited him to sign the book of illustrious guests. [passage  indistinct]    In the afternoon, the closing ceremony was held at the  ministers' council room with the participation of state  ministers, congressmen, and businessmen. On this occasion  President Cesar Gaviria and President Alberto Fujimori signed  the document organizing the Neighbors' Commission and  Peruvian-Colombian integration.    Immediately after, the joint declaration signed by the  presidents was read. The document contains 15 points of which  the main ones are: Make official the conversations between the  military commands to strengthen both nations' security;  stimulate direct investment and the flow of capital; and step up  agreements to wipe out drug production, trafficking, and abuse.    In the drug struggle, Peru and Colombia will develop  specific  initiatives with consumer nations. The presidents reiterated  their rejection of terrorism and agreed on prompt implementation  of bilateral measures to wipe out this scourge.    To conclude, during a news conference, President Fujimori  added that there will be greater exchange of information with  Colombia in the struggle against drugs, the goal of which is to  attack top drug traffickers. With regard to trade, he noted  there is interest on the part of Colombian businessmen to invest  in the Peruvian fishing sector. Here is what President Fujimori  said:    [Begin Fujimori recording] Obviously, in the drug  trafficking  activity there are relations between groups who operate in Peru  and Colombia. The arrest of the El Vaticano [Demetrio Chavez  Penaherrera] is the best evidence of the results of this  cooperation. We must continue on this road. Of course, there  must be greater exchange of information; there must be extensive  reciprocal cooperation in the investigations, in the sharing of  experiences in the struggle against terrorism and drug  trafficking that each country has gained in these past years.  In my opinion, in this manner we could speed up somewhat the  results against these social scourges. On this matter, I  believe there is a great deal one can learn from past  experiences, a great deal. Peru, for example has had specific  experiences in its struggle against terrorism; its efficiency  has been highly considered worldwide. This is an experience that  we will gladly exchange with Colombia's experience where other  mechanisms have also been used. [end recording]</p>

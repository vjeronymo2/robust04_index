			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A POET ON THE PROWL;  </P> <P> DEVICES AND DESIRES BY P.D. JAMES (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 435 PP.)  </P> <P> Phyllis Dorothy White James can now safely be called the pre-eminent English  writer of mysteries. "Devices and Desires" is a main selection of the  Book-of-the-Month Club, as was her previous book, "A Taste for Death." It will  have a first cloth printing of 175,000 and a Quality Paperback Book Club  edition to follow.  </P> <P> Her books, like those of John Le Carre there and Tony Hillerman and Elmore  Leonard here, have slipped the comfortable bonds of genre to reach far wider  audiences, helped by the television dramatizations of some of her earlier books  such as "Death of an Expert Witness."  </P> <P> She is not the heiress-apparent to Dame Agatha Christie and reportedly does not  enjoy being thought such. Christie's ingeniously improbable plottings are not  James' forte, and commercially, Christie, the reprint rights to whose works  changed hands a couple of years ago for $92 million, remains in a class by  herself.  </P> <P> James is her own voice, creating her own tradition. Her writing does have  echoes of a longer, Victorian tradition: the spacious novel with its loving  attention to environments and atmospheres, the delineation of character (which  Christie tended to skim over with telegraphic speed) and the conveying of  nuance in relationships and moments. "Devices and Desires" is a comfortably  spacious 424 pages long, as tidy and well-furnished as a Victorian parlor.  </P> <P> Her continuing protagonist, the poet-detective Adam Dalgliesh, a sensitive  loner touched with sadness, has brought out a new, slim volume of verse and,  resisting his publisher's desire to push it like a candy bar, has retreated to  the Norfolk coast to compose his soul in a converted windmill he has inherited,  with a sizable sum of money, from a beloved, bird-watching aunt.  </P> <P> James' descriptions of the Norfolk coastline in its remote, spare beauty, quite  unlike the overdeveloped littoral elsewhere, appears to be born of close  familiarity and abiding love. It is lovely to read about.  </P> <P> Dalgliesh's only chore is to deliver proofs of a cookbook to its local author.  It is enough to embroil him reluctantly in the local scene. The author is the  sister of a man who directs a nuclear-power station near the sea. The station  is under a publicity assault generated by an earnest, penniless young man who  lives nearby and is sheltering a homeless mother and child.  </P> <P> A serial killer of young women, whom the media has named the Whistler, is  stalking the vicinity (James is very good at evoking the horror of the  confrontations) and Dalgliesh is sought out by a former London colleague who  now heads the local CID and who regards Dalgliesh with a mixture of respect and  scarcely muted resentment. (James is very, very good at the shoals and  cross-currents of relationships.)  </P> <P> The large dramatis personae includes the director's ambitious assistant, whom  he is attempting to phase out as his mistress, too; a retired clergyman, his  wife and the nice young woman who looks out for them; a free-spirited painter  attempting, with the help of a beguiling and precocious daughter, to care for  his motherless brood; and various boffins and stenos from the power-plant  staff.  </P> <P> The director's assistant is murdered, seemingly the latest victim of the  Whistler. But it turns out that the Whistler had been nabbed not long before  the killing, and a key question is: Who knew, Who didn't? Even Dalgliesh is at  least briefly a suspect; the victim was found at the shore, not far from the  windmill. ("I suspect everyone . . . and no one," a sleuth once remarked.)  </P> <P> As Greyhound used to say, getting there (in this case to the solution) is half  the fun. In "Designs and Desires," as in many mysteries, it is substantially  more than half the fun. It is an irony particularly applicable to James that  the more extensive the scene-settings and the more (Henry) Jamesian the  characterizations, the more rickety and anti-climactic the denouement can seem.  </P> <P> The detecting of who did in the assistant is intricate and professional, and  although it mounts to what used to be called a sock finish (and fiery as well),  it also feels oddly perfunctory, like a grand opera built around a visit to  Disneyland.  </P> <P> As if she were aware that the atmospheres (even the evidence of careful  research about the perils and controversies attending nuclear power) were not  enough, James has attached a subplot, involving a pair of minor-league  terrorists at the plant, that is arbitrary and owes more to the work of  Alistair MacLean, say, than to her own sensitive interpretations of present  society.  </P> <P> She is not a poet of the abnormal, like her nearest rival, Ruth Rendell, who  peers into the darkest recesses of the aberrant psyche as no one else does. But  James is in her own right a poet of, perhaps, more universal men and women and  especially those whose lives are touched with crime and death.  </P> <P> This is James on Terry Rickards, Dalgliesh's touchy colleague: "Dalgliesh  thought of him as a type of police officer less common than formerly but still  not rare; the conscientious and incorruptible detective of limited imagination  and somewhat greater intelligence who had never supposed that the evil of the  world should be condoned because it was frequently inexplicable and its  perpetrators unfortunate."  </P> <P> This is Dalgliesh -- on the same page; Rickards' wife is expecting momentarily  -- remembering his wife and son who died at childbirth: "His memory of her,  which for years, a traitor to grief and their love, he had resolutely tried to  suppress because the pain had seemed unbearable, had gradually been replaced by  a boyish, romantic dream of gentleness and beauty now fixed forever beyond the  depredation of time. His newborn son's face he could still recall vividly and  sometimes did in his dreams, that white unsullied look of sweet, knowledgeable  contentment, as if, in a brief moment of life, he had seen and known all there  was to know, seen it and rejected it."  </P> <P> Passages of such eloquence and sensitivity are not frequently come upon in  fiction anywhere, and they have earned James her rightful pre-eminence. In  context, they suggest that crime fiction as such has no limits, only  limitations.  </P></p>

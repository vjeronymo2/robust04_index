			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Economics: Signals may point to UK recovery THE MARCH unemployment figures will be the main focus of attention in the UK this week. Economists are waiting to see whether February's surprise 22,000 drop in the jobless total heralded a turnaround in the employment picture. Most believe it was erratic and that last month unemployment climbed again by about 25,000. Other UK figures this week may, however, add to the fairly convincing signs of recovery in the economy. Retail sales are expected to be roughly flat, month on month, but the annual rate of increase is forecast to rise to over 3 per cent. There is also a survey of the retail sector from the Confederation of British Industry this week, and figures for bank and building society lending. The picture in Germany is likely to be less rosy with inflationary indicators this week forecast to reflect the recessionary forces gripping the west German real economy. Pay settlements in the 1993 pay round have tended to run at about 3 per cent, there is virtually no producer price inflation and money supply growth appears to be falling into its target range. Other economic highlights and figures this week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of analysts' forecasts, provided by MMS International, a financial information company.

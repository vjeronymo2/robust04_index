			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Treasury hints on insider dealing law THE TREASURY has indicated to City institutions that it will consider changing its widely criticised proposals for tougher rules on insider dealing when MPs debate the legislation next year. The government will face pressure in the Lords today over proposals in the Criminal Justice Bill that many in the City fear define insider dealing too broadly, outlawing some legitimate practices in the financial markets. The government will try to block amendments tabled by Lord Mottistone - a Tory peer advised by the Confederation of British Industry - which it regards as unworkable. But Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, has indicated that he will consider seriously any proposals for change when the bill moves to the Commons - probably in January. Under Lord Mottistone's proposals, the Treasury would be forced to publish precise guidelines on the offence of insider dealing and exempt anybody who follows the guidelines. The Treasury has been consulting widely with financial institutions on its proposals since they were published in October. The bill, intended to align UK law with the European Community's insider dealing directive, defines an 'insider' as anyone who has inside information as a result of their employment, profession or duties. It is expected to become law in May. Critics believe the measures might catch share analysts who are traditionally briefed by companies about results. Institutions that underwrite share issues may also be trapped if they have advance knowledge of the issue - as may directors of companies who build a stake in another company in advance of launching a takeover bid.</p>

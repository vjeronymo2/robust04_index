			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGE LOSS LOOMS IN INDIA FOR GANDHI'S RULING PARTY  </P> <P> Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi appeared headed for political disaster today as  official results from one of India's bloodiest elections indicated that his  ruling party would lose its majority for only the second time in history.  </P> <P> Using final totals from almost half of the nation's districts and substantial  totals from the rest, statistical analysts on state-run television predicted  that Gandhi's Congress-I party, which has governed the nation for all but 30  months since Indian independence in 1947, will lose more than half the seats it  has held in the nation's 543-member Parliament.  </P> <P> About 130 people were killed during the three-stage election, with voting on  Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.  </P> <P> Officially, as of midday today, winners have been declared for 222 of the 524  seats up for election, with Congress-I having won just 80. Analysts on  government television predicted that the ruling party would win a total of 200  seats, compared to the 415 it won during the last general election five years  ago.  </P> <P> Even after all votes are tallied, no clear winner is likely to emerge from the  polls, the analysts said, basing their projections on what they called  "irreversible trends" in most of the races.  </P> <P> The opposition National Front alliance led by former Gandhi aide Vishwanath  Pratap Singh was leading for just 91 seats, having been declared official  winners in 51 contests.  </P> <P> The television analysts said that the most startling result was the emergence  of a third force in Indian politics, the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya  Janata Party, which was ahead in 75 races after having won only two seats five  years ago.  </P> <P> The most likely outcome of what several independent analysts already are  calling a landmark election will be a "hung" Parliament, in which Congress-I  may be the largest single victor but will not be able to govern without forming  coalitions.  </P> <P> "It is going to be a very close finish," said Prannoy Roy, a prominent Indian  statistical analyst.  </P> <P> It would be the first time in Indian history that a coalition would attempt to  rule, and analysts said it would herald a new era of uncertainty and  instability on India's traditionally dynastic political landscape.  </P> <P> "In any case, Rajiv Gandhi's leadership of the party is going to be challenged  -- that is without doubt," said independent political analyst Bharat  Wariavwalla. "It is clear he is now a liability to his party. And the whole  defeat can be neatly blamed on him."  </P> <P> Privately, several senior ruling party members agreed.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old Gandhi, who inherited the mantle of leadership from his mother,  Indira Gandhi, after her assassination in 1984, made himself the centerpiece of  the ruling party's monthlong campaign, barnstorming the nation by jet,  helicopter and limousine and addressing scores of rallies.  </P> <P> The election also was billed as a report card on Gandhi's five years in power,  during which the young leader had vowed to usher in a new era of science and  prosperity in long-impoverished India. Most analysts concluded that the  dramatic swing against Congress-I is largely due to Gandhi's failure to meet  the nation's heightened expectations, as well as persistent charges of  corruption that reached as high as Gandhi's own office.  </P> <P> Gandhi had pledged to rid government of such corruption, and charges that he  personally may have profited from kickbacks on an Indian arms deal with the  Swedish firm Bofors in 1987 was a major plank in the opposition's campaign.  </P> <P> "Rajiv certainly will be in trouble if we fail to get a majority, and we will  most likely go for his head if we win less than 200 seats," said one senior  ruling party leader as early trends emerged.  </P> <P> In fact, the fate of Gandhi's own seat in Parliament remained uncertain today.  After documenting widespread abuses, including armed intimidation and vote  fraud by the ruling party in his Amethi constituency, the federal election  commission ordered new polling today in 97 of the district's 930 polling  stations. Counting also will begin there today.  </P> <P> The Amethi race had been billed as "Gandhi vs. Gandhi -- the battle of the  grandsons," with Rajiv Gandhi, grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first  prime minister, running against Rajmohan Gandhi, the grandson of Mohandas K.  Gandhi, the father of Indian independence.  </P> <P> But polling in Amethi was so tainted by violence and fraud that human rights  organizations and intellectuals condemned the race there as symbolic of the  bloodshed and rigging that took place in many areas nationwide.  </P> <P> The prime minister has denied that his party workers committed abuses in  Amethi. But, at a press conference Sunday, his opponent, Rajmohan Gandhi, said,  "The whole election was a fraud from A to Z on their side."  </P> <P> Rajmohan Gandhi then called for the prime minister's resignation and declared  that he will not accept the official results of the Amethi poll, win or lose.  </P> <P> Although the prime minister is expected to retain his seat when the final count  is in, many of his key party colleagues were faring poorly elsewhere in the  nation.  </P> <P> Gandhi's trusted interior minister, Buta Singh, lost badly, as did several  other powerful Cabinet ministers. His Speaker of the house, Balram Jakhar, lost  in the north Indian state of Rajasthan, a traditional Congress-I stronghold  where the party is not expected to win any seats.  </P> <P> In fact, a large majority of Gandhi's candidates were heading for defeat  throughout the north Indian "cow belt," which has been the ruling party's main  vote bank for four decades. And some of the prime minister's most bitter foes  were taking their places.  </P> <P> Gandhi's estranged sister-in-law, Maneka Gandhi, who attracted international  attention in 1982 when then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expelled her from the  family home, was leading by a large margin in a remote district of India's most  populous state of Uttar Pradesh, where Gandhi's cousin, Arun Nehru, who split  from the ruling party in 1987, also was expected to win handily.  </P> <P> The only bright spot for the ruling party today was in the four southern states  that have been under opposition control for the past several years. There,  Congress-I surprised all analysts by sweeping Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and  Andhra Pradesh, where the regional opposition party of film idol N.T. Rama Rao  was dealt a humiliating defeat.  </P> <P> "It is a major vote for change -- not only at the center, but a vote for change  everywhere," said pollster and analyst Roy, who was anchoring state-run  television's election coverage. "All over, they're voting against the party in  power. The electorate has become more critical."  </P> <P> For analyst Wariavwalla, the result is not simply an indication of negative  voting. "It shows that the Indian electorate is a very intelligent and  discriminating electorate," he said.  </P> <P> And analyst Pran Chopra, of New Delhi's Center for Policy Research, added: "It  shows that gimmicks are not enough. There has to be a system, and there has to  be a program. And the people clearly have created a situation in which a  coalition becomes necessary."  </P> <P> The formation of such a coalition, though, is likely to take days or even  weeks, the analysts concluded.  </P> <P> "What's going to become critical in this election are the smaller parties,"  said Roy. "And who will become the next prime minister . . . will take some  time to decide."  </P> <P> Given its large new voting bloc, for example, the Hindu national Bharatiya  Janata Party has flatly refused to form a coalition with Gandhi's party.  </P> <P> "I will not support any government which includes the Congress-I," declared L.  K. Advani, the party's president, after winning his New Delhi seat by an  overwhelming margin Sunday night.  </P> <P> "We are entering into an exciting period," Wariavwalla said. "But the most  important thing to see is that for the first time in 42 years, the dominance of  one party and the dominance of one family has been broken."  </P></p>

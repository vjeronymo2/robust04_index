			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MORE MUSCULAR MADNESS FROM STALLONE IN 'LOCK UP'  </P> <P> "Lock Up" (citywide) is yet another Sylvester Stallone macho fantasy in which  he plays an underdog of superhuman endurance. Once again, his ability to  survive extreme brutality is used to justify equally savage acts of revenge. As  experienced a rabble-rouser as Stallone is, he by now defies credibility to the  point of inviting unintended laughter.  </P> <P> As a convict at the mercy of Donald Sutherland's crazy prison warden and his  equally sadistic goons, Stallone survives one horrific physical and  psychological assault after another, yet emerges after each hideous session as  smiling and relaxed as if he had spent a weekend in Palm Springs. Increasingly,  Stallone has become the hero of live-action cartoons.  </P> <P> In his own view, Stallone's Frank Leone ought never have gone to prison in the  first place. He was only avenging his foster father, an auto mechanic, after  the old man had been attacked by thugs with "connections" that enabled them to  get Leone sent up. When Sutherland's hateful Warden Drumgoole refuses to allow  Leone a deathbed visit to his foster father, he breaks out, even though his  sentence has only two weeks to run. The incident draws Leone additional time at  a "country club" facility, but it also generates bad publicity for the warden,  who is transferred to the notorious old Gateway penitentiary, a vast pile with  an immense copper Beaux Arts dome. (All this has happened before the picture  starts -- and thus requires a heavy dose of exposition.)  </P> <P> In the darkness of night, the warden somehow manages to have Leone moved to  Gateway, where he will have six months in which to destroy the convict. The  warden may be a man obsessed, but Stallone's writers make sure their star has  plenty of scenes in which he can display his good-natured camaraderie with the  nicer convicts. Consequently, "Lock Up" veers constantly between unabashed  sentimentality and unspeakable violence, all of it underlined broadly by Bill  Conti's score.  </P> <P> As supremely silly as "Lock Up" (rated R) essentially is, it is the work of  film makers who know exactly what they want and how to get it. Lean and tough,  Stallone looks great, and so does this film. Although at 108 minutes it's  overly long, it moves well under John Flynn's slam-bam, pumped-up direction.  Much of the time Stallone is laid-back and humorous, confident enough in his  star power to allow his supporting players showy turns: John Amos (as the  warden's adamantine but reflective second-in-command), Sonny Landham (as a  looming, vicious con who does the warden's bidding), Tom Sizemore (as the  garrulous prisoner Dallas), Frank McCrae (the hulking, kindly Eclipse) and  Larry Romano (as the doomed, 20-year-old First Base).  </P> <P> Sutherland seems to have tongue firmly in cheek, and Darlanne Fluegel has  precious few moments as Leone's rather dim-seeming fiancee. (Why doesn't she  get the press to investigate Leone's transfer, for example?). As for Stallone,  he's overdue in stretching his talent, not just his muscles. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

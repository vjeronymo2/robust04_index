A partial exemption from the 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Section III.D.1.(a) requirement to perform the third Type A test of each 10-year service period when the plant is shut down for the 10-year plant inservice inspection was granted in Amendment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 83 dated September 8, 1993. However, requests for partial exemptions from the requirements of Section III.A.1.(a) (the requirement to stop a containment integrated leak rate test if excessive leakage is detected) and Section III.A.5.(b) (acceptance criteria for containment integrated leak rate tests with respect to determining the frequency of conducting future tests) was deferred pending resolution of ongoing rulemaking activities associated with Appendix J. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SECY&hyph;94&hyph;036 dated February 17, 1994, described the staff's plans for completion of rulemaking on Appendix J and how plant-specific requests for contingency and performance based exemptions would compete for limited staff resources. The SECY paper further stated that the availability of staff resources for reviewing such exemptions would be extremely limited. Subsequently, by letter dated August 15, 1994, the licensee withdrew the amendment request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 31, 1993 (58 FR 16864). However, by letter dated August 15, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated February 17, 1993, and the licensee's letter dated August 15, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street, Clinton, Illinois 61727. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 15th day of September 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Douglas V.

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of The Computer Industry (3): Lightweights that buck the trend; Mobile Computers - The view from the US, Louise Kehoe in San Francisco assesses changing market strategies and unveils a palmtop SINCE the early 1980s, when the desktop personal computer was still in its infancy, there have been numerous attempts to create 'portable' versions of PCs. Only recently, however, have semiconductor, data storage and display technology advanced to the point where a fully-functional PC can be packaged in a compact, lightweight, carry-along unit. These technology advances are creating an increase in sales of laptop, notebook and pocket computers, with world-wide sales expected to top Dollars 8bn this year. The market for mobile computers has become one of the fastest growing sectors of the computer business. The increase in mobile computer sales comes as sales of desktop personal computers are beginning to sag, particularly in the US. By the mid-1990s, portable computers will represent close to 50 per cent of all types of PCs sold, market analysts predict. In Japan, laptop computers account for over 40 per cent of all PC sales. In Tokyo's crowded offices the smaller laptop computers are widely used on the desktop. Europe is also caught up in the mobile computer revolution with unit sales expected to rise by over 30 per cent this year. Spurring much of this growth is the new category of notebook computers - battery-powered machines that are small enough to fit in a briefcase and weigh 8 lbs or less. More than 840,000 notebook computers were sold in the US in 1990, according to International Data, a research company. It predicts that sales could rise to 1.4m units in 1991 and rise to 6.2m by the middle of the decade. The US portable computer market has so far been dominated by Compaq Computer and Tandy of the US, the Zenith DataSystems division of France's Groupe Bull, and Japanese makers Toshiba and NEC. However, over the past year, as many as 40 computer companies have announced new portable computers. Many have yet to deliver these products with delays blamed on shortages of displays, disk-drives and microprocessors. Also entering the portable computer fray are some of the largest US and European computer manufacturers. International Business Machines recently unveiled its notebook computer in its third attempt to find a place in the portable computer market. The IBM Personal System/2 L40 SX notebook computer is slightly larger and heavier than most products in this category, but it is designed to provide the full functionality of the current generation of desktop computers, whereas many notebook computers compromise performance to achieve lower weight and price. The IBM notebook features a full-size keyboard virtually identical to that found on IBM's PS/2 desktop PCs; a standard memory of two megabytes and maximum memory of 18 MB; a 60 MB hard drive and a 10-inch Video Graphics Array (VGA) display. All this comes in a 7.7 lb package priced in the US at Dollars 6,000. The recent entry of IBM into the notebook computer market, and the anticipated announcement by Apple Computer this year of notebook-sized versions of its Macintosh computers are expected to expand sales rather than to unseat established suppliers. Digital Equipment, Unisys, NCR and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph are expected to launch mobile computer products this year. Portability still comes at a premium price, with most mobile computers up to 50 per cent more than equivalent desktop machines. Competition is spurring price cuts with some companies such as AST Research offering substantially lower prices on notebook computers. Technology advances are significantly expanding the capabilities of portable computers. Flat panel colour displays have recently been introduced by Toshiba and other leading portable makers. The portable computer of the future will incorporate 'wireless communications' according to many industry experts. Last month, NEC of Japan introduced one of the first portable computers with wireless communications. The 6.6 lb laptop computer incorporates a radio transceiver which enables it to send and receive messages without a phone line. NEC is offering the wireless computer only in Japan. Leading US computer makers also see radio communications becoming an important feature of portable computers in the future. Apple recently filed a petition with the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that, if approved, would let computers transmit and receive information over radio waves instead of through a wired network. For today's users of portable computers, wireless communications represent a potential solution to the difficulties of hooking portable computers up to telephones. While desktop personal computers that incorporate a model generally have their own phone line, the portable computer must be plugged into a phone in whatever location the user finds himself. Yet to be resolved is one of the toughest technical challenges of building portable computers - short battery life. Although power-management systems and low-power components have significantly extended computer battery life, battery technology is advancing only slowly, computer makers complain. A new category of PCs that is beginning to show promise is the hand-held or pocket computer. This market has been pioneered by Poqet Computer of Sunnyvale, California, whose 1.1 lb IBM-compatible PC fits easily into a coat pocket or handbag. The Poqet has been picked up by Infonet, the international value-added network provider, as a portable communications terminal, for sending and receiving electronic mail and other types of messages. Mr Stav Prodromou, founder and vice-chairman of Poqet, sees pocket-sized computers creating new types of PC applications. These tiny computers are so unobtrusive, he suggests, that they could be used to take notes during a meeting. Their light weight also makes them suitable for use as an electronic appointments calendar or time organiser. Also about to enter the hand-held computer market is Hewlett-Packard, which this month will introduce a calculator-sized unit with a built-in version of the popular Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. On the horizon is yet another new type of portable computers known as slate computers. These notebook-sized devices will replace the familiar keyboard with an electronic pen. The user will simply write on the 'slate' or point to icons to select functions. Numerous applications are envisaged for these pen-based computers among people who do much of their work while standing or moving around. Doctors and nurses might use them to update patients' notes or order tests, for example. Software that enables the computer to interpret hand-written notes has been developed by Go Corporation, a California start-up. Microsoft, the leading supplier of PC software, is also developing handwriting recognition software that could be used as an extension of its existing PC operating systems. Grid Systems, one of the pioneers of the portable computer market, offers a slate computer with limited handwriting recognition capabilities. IBM and Apple Computer have both expressed great interest in the potential for this new technology. Market researchers at BIS Strategic Decisions predict that sales of slate computers will top Dollars 1.5bn by 1995 and could become a Dollars 7bn market by the end of the decade.</p>

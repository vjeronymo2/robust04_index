			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our correspondent contacted President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani a few moments ago via telephone. About the  Iranian Muslim people's concern in the wake of the [shooting]  incident, the president said:    [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] I am very grateful to  the people and to you for taking measures to reassure the people  so that they do not worry. In my opinion there is nothing to  worry about. If the exact proceedings of the incident at that  place [Khomeyni's shrine] were broadcast, the people would not  worry.    As the reporters present saw, the point from which the shot  was fired was a long way away from the platform. I first  thought a light bulb had exploded, but when I heard several more  sounds it became clear, and I came to the conclusion that it was  not a light bulb but gunfire. In my opinion there is no cause  for concern at all. It was an incident in the corner of a huge  gathering in the mosque. The proceedings of the meeting were  not interrupted either. I am not certain whether it was being  broadcast live or not. Everything continued as normal.    I am very grateful to everyone for demonstrating such  kindness. I ask you to inform the people somehow that there is  no cause for concern at all and no one should worry. [end  recording]</p>

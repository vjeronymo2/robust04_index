			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> WRYLY COMICAL VIEW OF THE OLD WEST IN 'EL DIABLO'  </P> <P> There haven't been many inspired comic Westerns -- "Cat Ballou" and "Blazing  Saddles" are notable exceptions -- but HBO's two-hour "El Diablo" (which  premiered last Sunday and repeats at 3:30 p.m. today) is offbeat and off-center  enough to be surprisingly diverting.  </P> <P> Right off the top we know our young protagonist by the way he stumbles out of  his hotel in a small, dusty town, runs into a chicken and tells the rooster  he's sorry, and means it. As this mild-mannered schoolteacher from Boston, who  can't ride a horse or shoot a gun, Anthony Edwards (who was the cocky young  pilot in "Top Gun") manages a sublime stretch of acting.  </P> <P> The other star is Louis Gossett Jr., a crusty, aging gunslinger who teams up  with the greenhorn to chase down a raping, pillaging Mexican gang that has  kidnaped a faint-of-heart damsel who was the tenderfoot's student. When they  find her, she's become the sultry lover of the entitled devil (the dashing but  not at all hammy Robert Beltran).  </P> <P> The writers (Tommy Lee Wallace, John Carpenter and Bill Phillips) also dispatch  a quick point dramatizing how Western literature historically ignored the black  cowboy. In a grubby cantina, the Gossett character complains to Kid Durango, a  popular writer of pulp Westerns (a fey, wonderful performance by Joe  Pantoliano) that he never writes about cowboys being black. The author waves  off the remark by implying his stories wouldn't get printed if he did.  </P> <P> (Remember when Sidney Poitier, in the 1966 Western "Duel at Diablo," literally  introduced most of America to the black cowboy?)  </P> <P> "El Diablo," directed with jaunty irreverence by Peter Markle, is full of sly  quirks: The bespectacled hero, a clumsy rider, frequently shoots down his  horses by accident because he can't hold a gun, and Gossett, who loves his  horse, is always stuffing its ears with cotton before a gunfight because the  animal is sensitive to noise.  </P> <P> There's a lot of wholesale mayhem -- guys you like die -- and even this gives  the movie a tangy edge.  </P></p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: John Foster cuts loss to Pounds 381,000 With the inclusion of exceptional credits John Foster &amp; Son, the specialist textile group, made substantial inroads into its losses in the year to February 28. Trading conditions remained depressed, with the resultant intense competition for business. Turnover fell to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 26.6m) but the operating deficit was reduced to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.56m); taking in credits of Pounds 1.02m (debits Pounds 676,000) left the year's pre-tax loss at Pounds 381,000 (Pounds 2.24m). Losses per share were 2.3p (14p) after tax credits of Pounds 131,000 (Pounds 678,000). The dividend is again 0.5p. Mr David Allen, managing director, reported that the balance sheet was strong, new products and designs had been well received and, despite two difficult years, the group was in good shape.</p>

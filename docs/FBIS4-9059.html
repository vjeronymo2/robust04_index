			<p>BFN     [Text] Litomysl, April 15 -- President Lech Walesa said in  Litomysl, the Czech Republic, on Friday that he thought that the  united states of Europe would be created on the European  continent soon.    Lech Walesa is attending a meeting of presidents of seven  European states, including Thomas Krestil from the Republic of  Austria, Vaclav Havel from the Czech Republic, Richard von  Weizsacker from Germany, Michal Kovac from the Slovak Republic,  Milan Kucan from Slovenia and Arpad Goncz from Hungary.    The Polish president told journalists on Friday that there  was a need to overcome the division of Europe from the communist  era. In his opinion, a list of common values and European  problems should be drawn up in order to eliminate differences in  development in selected countries and regions of Europe.    The president said that Europe is searching for its place at  present and that thinking logically the continent should become  an undivided entity. "We are on the crossroads," Lech Walesa  said. He added that, in his opinion, European presidents and  politicians would be responsible for how fast our continent  would find the best road to development.    The participants in the meeting pointed out, in their  addresses, to problems stemming from bilateral relations between  the neighbouring countries.    The presidents are expected to discuss issues related to  Russia, Russia's position on Europe, Central Europe and European  integration as well as matters related to the Balkan problem.    Bilateral talks of delegations to the meeting are also to be  held. According to unofficial information, President Lech  Walesa intends to meet with presidents of Austria, the Czech  Republic, Germany and Slovenia.</p>

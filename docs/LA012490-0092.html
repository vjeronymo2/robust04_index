			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER SAD CHAPTER FOR ARMENIA;  </P> <P> ETHNIC STRIFE: FUNERAL DIRGES REPLACE MARTIAL MUSIC. YEREVAN MOURNS THOSE  KILLED IN THE FIGHTING WITH AZERBAIJANIS.  </P> <P> The nationalist music that filled the air last week when hundreds of Armenian  volunteers went off to fight Azerbaijanis has been replaced by the traditional  music of mourning as Yerevan honors its dead.  </P> <P> The deaths, along with the blockade of the railway into Armenia and the  resulting shortages, brought a quick end to the exuberance Armenians felt when  the volunteer militias marched off.  </P> <P> "Up until this point, it was like it was a play," Araik Papian, 35, said as a  funeral procession made its way past his home. "We did not understand that we  are in a real world. Now we do."  </P> <P> The people of Yerevan seem to be weeping not just for their dead but also for  themselves as a nation. They are not just learning the reality of war but are  living another chapter in their sad history.  </P> <P> Artavazd Khatchikyan, 20, a senior at Yerevan State University, told a visitor:  "I was standing in the street the other day, looking at a puddle, and I was  thinking that all my life I have heard about the horrible massacres of 1915 (a  reference to Turkey's attacks on Armenians). I always said, 'Oh, that's too  bad,' but it was so distant. Now, I feel the horror. I stand on a street and  look at that puddle and feel that I am going to be pushed right in."  </P> <P> Last week, four of Khatchikyan's friends took a bus to the Armenian-Azerbaijani  border to fight. They had one shotgun among them. Khatchikyan, who did not go  because he was sick with the flu, said he worries about his friends and wishes  he were with them. He said he is no longer able to keep his mind on his  studies.  </P> <P> The Armenia All-National Movement, which recruited heavily among university  students for its militia, appears to have enough volunteers for now.  </P> <P> On a recent afternoon, a group of students were sitting in an upstairs cafe,  watching a funeral procession for one of the fallen. His name was Yervand  Sahoumian, he was 32, and until his death the previous Friday, he was just a  man from Yerevan with nothing that set him apart from the others. But now  everyone in Yerevan knows Sahoumian's name. It is heard on the radio, and his  funeral procession was seen on television.  </P> <P> The procession was led by a truck with Sahoumian's plain wooden coffin on the  open bed. A soldier marched alongside, carrying a portrait of the dead man.  </P> <P> "There is a sad feeling for everyone," Vera Mouradian, 50, said as she walked  along a few yards behind the coffin. "It makes no difference whether he is our  son or not. He is the child of everybody."  </P> <P> At least four men from Yeraksh are believed to have been killed this week in  the fighting. In a sense, the number is small, but the psychological impact has  been substantial.  </P> <P> "It is hard to find some force in your soul just to stay young, to not become  mentally disabled like the old men here," Khatchikyan said in the cafe. "I want  to think about girls, fun, the things young men think about. But I can't just  now.  </P> <P> "This is the Armenian syndrome, a kind of feeling that everyone is against you.  It is very hard to fight it."  </P> <P> A few miles away, Zare Papian was watching television in a darkened room.  Papian, 28, is a painter. He says he is not a political man, that he prefers to  worry about colors and canvas and how to find good Georgian wine.  </P> <P> But now he spends much of the time following the news. He is out of paint, and  because of the blockade, he cannot buy any more. He says he could not paint now  anyway, that it does not seem important.  </P> <P> "I don't understand this whole situation," Papian said. "It is very difficult  for us now. We don't know what is to become of us."  </P> <P> The blockade has made it worse. There is an acute shortage of fuel, and street  lights are dimmed to the lowest level or simply turned off in order to use the  minimum of electric power. Electric signs that normally advertise restaurants  and cafes are dark. Many homes are without heat.  </P> <P> Television programming normally begins at breakfast time, but now there is no  television until 7:30 p.m. People are being discouraged from switching on  electric stoves even to heat water for tea.  </P> <P> Also, there is fear that Soviet troops might move into Yerevan as they did at  Baku, in Azerbaijan, to re-establish the central government's authority. Over  the weekend, military convoys moved through the streets of Yerevan and  helicopters could be heard landing at the airport.  </P></p>

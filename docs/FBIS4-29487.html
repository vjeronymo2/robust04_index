			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Marisa Chimprapha] </F>   [Text] Dhaka -- Bangladesh has turned down Thailand's  request to increase joint fishing ventures, saying its marine  resources were already depleted and it must conserve the  remainder as much as possible, a senior Thai Fisheries  Department official said yesterday.    Fisheries Deputy Director General Somsak Singhonka said  there  is only one joint venture fishing company. It initially had 10  Thai boats, but had been reduced to seven as three of them sank  in a storm.    Bangladesh has rejected a Thai request to replace the sunken  boats. A request for more joint fishing ventures was also  rejected, he said.    Somsak was speaking to THE NATION after attending a  three-day  meeting of the Thai-Bangladeshi Joint Commission in Dhaka which  ended yesterday.    Leading Thai officials to Bangladesh was Foreign Minister  Prasong Sunsiri, who co-chaired the meeting with his Bangladeshi  counterpart A.S.M. Mustafizur Rahman.    Prasong, meanwhile, said he understood Dhaka may be  reluctant  to allow more Thai fishing activity in the Bay of Bengal because  some Thais were caught illegally fishing in its territorial  waters.    "Bangladesh has a strong policy to conserve its marine  resource. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia has informed me  that her country wants to conserve this marine resource as much  as possible.    "She said the country is considering the Thai request (for  more joint ventures) but feels that the existing number of Thai  boats under the concession are enough," Prasong said.    A reliable source said yesterday Bangladesh had at the  last-minute gone back on an earlier agreement to set up of a  joint working group on fisheries, agreed upon during a joint  meeting of senior officials.    The Thai side had expected the proposed working group to  help  solve existing and future fisheries problems.    It was proposed that senior officials of the Thai and  Bangladeshi fisheries departments join the working group so that  they could directly talk to each other when problems occur.    Somsak confirmed that Bangladesh has changed its mind, but  said the fisheries problems between Thailand and Bangladesh are  less serious than those Thailand has with Vietnam and Burma and  the working group is not necessary for the time being.    Prasong yesterday paid a courtesy call on Bangladeshi  President Abdur Rahman Biswas and Prime Minister Zia.    During the meeting, the two parties agreed to increase  bilateral trade which has been in favour of Thailand for many  years.    Dhaka proposed that Thailand import more tea and jute  products but the Thai side said Thailand is already a major  producer of tea and jute.    The Thai delegation also offered to organize a training  programme for Bangladeshi officials, particularly in the field  of fisheries and human resource development.</p>

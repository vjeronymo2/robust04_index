			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Bank of Scotland calls for Pounds 194.4m THE BANK of Scotland took advantage of a buoyant stock market yesterday to ask its shareholders for Pounds 194.4m. The rights issue by the Edinburgh-based institution is the first from the hard-pressed UK banking sector in two and a half years. The move was seen as the beginning of the rebuilding process. Mr Bruce Pattullo, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, said he took a positive view of the prospects for the UK banking market, and he believed this was the moment to seek capital for expansion. The issue will be on the basis of three for 10 at a price of 87p. This compares with the closing price of 131p on Tuesday evening. Yesterday, the shares gained 5p to close at 136p, reflecting the market's positive view of the Scottish bank, which is ranked among the best managed. Standard Life, the Edinburgh insurance company which owns 33.3 per cent of the bank, has pledged its support for the capital-raising, which was fully underwritten by Cazenove, the stockbrokers. The rights issue announcement accompanied the Bank of Scotland's results for the year ending February 28. These showed a sharp fall in profits because of the impact of the UK recession and mounting loan losses. At the pre-tax level, the bank earned Pounds 134m, down from Pounds 193.5m the year before. This was the bank's first profits downturn in seven years. However, Mr Pattullo stressed two positive developments which justified the rights issue. One was the steady increase in market share which the Bank of Scotland was achieving through its strategy of selective expansion in England. The second was the widening of margins on lending business that was occurring as other banks pulled in their horns. 'Our whole delivery system is geared to winning market share,' he said. 'In the future, this business will have higher margins.' He emphasised that the Bank of Scotland saw itself growing organically rather than by acquisition, and he said the rights had been planned without any specific purchase in mind. The Bank of Scotland also announced yesterday that it was capitalising half its revaluation reserve through a one-for-five issue, which would add a further Pounds 38m to its core capital.

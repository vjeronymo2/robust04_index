			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Wall Street contemplates change of guard: Business is paying more attention to Clinton THE QUIET carpeted corridors of Wall Street's top brokerage houses seem a world away from the bustle and bunting of Madison Square Garden. This election year, however, Wall Street executives are playing unusually close attention to events at the Democratic party convention. Many have a sinking feeling that Governor Bill Clinton could just win the presidency in November. The reaction on Wall Street today to the Clinton/Gore ticket is absolutely clear, says Mr Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, the broker. 'It is fear, hostility and apprehension.' He has just completed an analysis of the economics of presidential elections and the omens do not look good for President George Bush. 'The message is that the public votes its pocketbook,' he says. Economic growth in the first three years of the Bush presidency has averaged a meagre 1.1 per cent a year, the worst record of any administration since the 1930s. Mr Bush's performance is far worse than that of either the second Eisenhower administration in the late 1950s or the Carter administration in the late 1970s, when growth averaged 2.5 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively. Both incumbent parties lost the presidency. The figures on personal incomes are even more depressing. Incumbent parties have invariably lost if the growth of real personal disposable income in the year preceding the election has dipped significantly below about 4 per cent, Mr Straszheim says. Under Mr Bush, the figure is likely to be just over 2 per cent, nowhere near good enough to guarantee re-election. Earlier this year, most analysts in financial markets assumed Mr Bush would win a second victory in November. Mr Straszheim is far from alone in taking the possibility of a Clinton presidency seriously. Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at The Boston Group, an economic consultancy, says: 'My working assumption is that the Clinton/Gore ticket will win.' He regards the weak economy as only one of several factors that could pull Bush down. 'The disenchantment with Washington' will count against Mr Bush as will the growing perception that the 'president is asleep at the wheel,' he adds. In failing to respond to acute domestic problems, Mr Bush appears 'almost as inept as President Carter in 1980'. Mr Clinton's shrewd selection of Senator Al Gore from Tennessee - another moderate southerner - as his running mate is also seen as significantly strengthening the Democratic ticket. On Wall Street, now largely a meritocracy, even committed Republicans feel uncomfortable defending Mr Dan Quayle, vice-president, who is widely regarded as lacking the qualifications for high office. Mr Gore's intellect and energy, on the other hand, command grudging respect. One leading Wall Street bond market commentator, who wishes to remain anonymous, is convinced Mr Clinton will win. But he says none of the above arguments is as important as the Supreme Court's recent decision narrowly to uphold abortion rights. With polls indicating that a majority of Americans are 'pro choice,' he claims this was the perfect result for Mr Clinton. It allows the Democrat to present himself as the only plausible bulwark against the one judicial appointment needed by Mr Bush to overturn Roe vs Wade, the 1973 decision that legalised abortion. At the convention, a succession of prominent female politicians, led by Governor Ann Richards of Texas, has pushed abortion to the fore, aggressively declaring themselves pro-choice. On Wall Street, predictions of a Ross Perot presidency were conspicuous by their absence. Some analysts doubt the Texan entrepreneur will actually run. The consensus is that he will press ahead but, like all previous independent candidates this century, be squeezed out by the two main political parties. In a part of Manhattan where Republican voters overwhelmingly outnumber Democrats, many executives remain quietly confident that Mr Bush will successfully relaunch his campaign in Houston next month. Mr David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities and a self-styled libertarian, says Mr Bush is likely to get the most votes despite his poor economic performance. But he worries that nobody will win a clear victory on November 3, in which case the House of Representatives makes the final decision. 'This would be the worst possible result for financial markets because it would create the maximum uncertainty.' Perhaps belatedly, Wall Street recognises that political judgments are now indispensable when making financial forecasts for 1993 and beyond. But analysts differ on the importance of politics. Mr Paul Mastroddi, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan, the New York bank, says a Clinton presidency would not alter the economic outlook all that much. People underestimate the constraints the budget deficit imposes on politicians of any party, he argues. Mr Leonard Santow, a founder of the Wall Street firm Griggs and Santow, disagrees. A Clinton presidency would make a big immediate difference because a Democratic White House, co-operating with a Democratic Congress, could actually do something. 'If Clinton wins, you would get a lot of early stimulative legislation, making up for 12 years of lost time.' Growth next year would be 3 per cent compared with 1-2 per cent if Mr Bush were returned, he argues. Financial markets are traditionally wary of Democrats. But faster growth under Mr Clinton would put upward pressure on US interest rates. In the short run at least, the dollar could thus strengthen if a Clinton victory appeared likely. Wall Street is only beginning to think through the longer-term implications of a possible changing of guard in Washington. Many analysts fear for their own pocketbooks because Mr Clinton has promised to raise taxes on the wealthy. But aspects of Mr Clinton's economic programme, which emphasises the need for investment in education, training and infrastructure, are viewed positively.</p>

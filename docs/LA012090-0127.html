			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPLEX OPENS DOORS TO ELDERLY KOREANS;  </P> <P> HOUSING: SANGNOK VILLA IS LOS ANGELES' FIRST SUBSIDIZED APARTMENT HOUSE FOR THE  AREA'S GROWING KOREAN COMMUNITY.  </P> <P> More than 120 Korean-American senior citizens joined Los Angeles housing  development officials Friday to celebrate the completion of Sangnok Villa, the  city's first subsidized housing project for the region's burgeoning Korean  community.  </P> <P> Between benedictions by a Korean minister and the singing of the U.S. and  Korean national anthems, developers and supporters of the new 60-unit apartment  house for low-income, elderly tenants marked the official opening of Sangnok,  which means "evergreen" in Korean.  </P> <P> Managers of the three-story, peach-colored complex at 732 S. Bonnie Brae St.  said they have received about 600 applications for the 60 apartment units.  Tenants will be chosen based on their income level, the cost of their current  housing and the order in which their applications were received, building  supervisor Lois Reed said.  </P> <P> One applicant, Kyung Woon Choi, 82, said that although he has lived in the  Crenshaw area for 29 years and would have to pay more rent if he moves into  Sangnok, he wants to live in the new project because he likes the house rules.  </P> <P> "The managers are looking closely at the people who have applied," he said in  Korean. "The ones who get to move in won't be the kind who smoke and drink too  much. I'd really like that," he said, pointing to a "no smoking" sign in the  lobby.  </P> <P> Although most of the prospective tenants are Korean, Choi said he appreciated  the apartment complex policy of taking all applications regardless of race. "I  like living in a place that has an open door," he said.  </P> <P> The one-bedroom units measure 580 square feet and are designed for the  handicapped and elderly. They have an emergency signaling system and grab rails  on bathroom walls and the shower. The complex also has wheelchair access.  </P> <P> To finance the building, Sangnok organizers received $3.9 million from the  city's Community Redevelopment Agency, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development and the Retirement Housing Foundation, a national nonprofit private  developer specializing in housing for the elderly.  </P> <P> Tenants, who are required to be 62 or older, will be able to move in by the end  of January, Reed said. Rents will range from $291 to $394, about 30% to 40%  below the cost for new apartments in the area, developers said.  </P> <P> More than 40,000 Korean senior citizens live in Los Angeles County, said Dr.  Eung Soo Han, director of a Pacific Palisades medical consultant group and a  board member of the senior citizen organization, the Christian Evergreen Assn.  About 10% of those elderly residents are in dire need of affordable housing,  Han said.  </P> <P> "Although it's just 60 rooms," Han said of the development, "it's a start."  </P> <P> During planning of the project, Han said, organizers learned how to get around  language limitations and difficulties in understanding how mainstream funding  sources operate.  </P> <P> "These are things that many people have to get through," he said. "The success  Koreans have had with the project shows us that there is a way."  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Prospect of collapse keeps Sorrell on top: The man at WPP's helm inspires mixed feelings WPP, the international marketing services group, gives a twist to the old adage that if you owe a bank Dollars 10, that's your problem, but owe it Dollars 1m and the problem is the bank's. If, like WPP, you owe your banks Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555m) and you have almost no assets except creative people, then it is not so much a problem, more a process of working towards mutually agreed long-term solutions. WPP is now awaiting final approval from 24 of its 28-bank syndicate for a recapitalisation plan announced on May 13. The deal is that WPP's bankers subscribe to a rights issue of Pounds 150m, to be used to eliminate roughly 25 per cent of WPP's debt. Once the banks have agreed - and only a couple with relatively small exposure may resist - shareholders will have the right to vote on the proposal. By July, the banking syndicate could own as much as 55 per cent of WPP in the planned equity-debt exchange. Some 55 per cent of a company with a net worth of less than zero hardly seems attractive. There are least two substantial puzzles to the refinancing of WPP. Why are the banks not sending in the receivers? And how has Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, held on to management control? The sympathetic view of WPP is that it is a nebulous, intangible beast, totally dependent on the creative drive and persuasive abilities of its employees. Breaking it up and selling it off would therefore fail to realise anything like the total debt. If it became known that, for example, Ogilvy &amp; Mather was up for sale, who would bid anything near the Dollars 864m which Mr Sorrell paid for it in 1989? WPP certainly is a giant with feet of clay; its market capitalisation, less than Pounds 50m, is puny, yet it is still a revenue machine - Pounds 1.2bn in 1991 - with potential for much more once the recession is over. Ms Lorna Tilbian, analyst with SG Warburg, also feels that in the present flurry 'it is easy to overlook the fact that the main companies in the group are still trading profitably, which is not the case for a lot of others in the advertising business. If it is possible to fault Martin Sorrell, then the purchase of Ogilvy &amp; Mather can be seen to have been a mistake. But the banks then fell over themselves to lend him the money.' That is part of the reason why Mr Sorrell has managed to stay at the helm. Another is that he would be a hard act to follow. According to Mr Richard Dale, analyst with Smith New Court: 'Martin Sorrell is the man who does know the company better than anyone and it would be difficult to replace him. But what is necessary and would be welcomed by institutions, and probably the banks too, would be another senior executive on the board.' There is no obvious internal candidate to replace Mr Sorrell. Mr David Ogilvy, WPP's 81-year-old non-executive chairman, spends most of his time in his chateau in France. Apart from Mr Sorrell, there are only two other executives on the board. Mr Sorrell has a reputation for devoting himself to only two things in his life: his family and WPP. Even his detractors - of whom there are many among former WPP executives - admire his dedication, first to building the WPP empire, and now to keeping it from toppling over. Still, for a man sitting on the top of a heap of 'people' businesses, Mr Sorrell has a poor reputation when it comes to handling people. An ex-WPP colleague says: 'He is a very complicated man who has trained himself in self-control; he tightly controls how he looks, what he does and says.' That made dealing with him difficult. Mr Sorrell's strongest card, in talking to the banks, may have been the argument that if he went, the edifice would quickly crumble. Senior executives within the main companies - JWT, O&amp;M and the public relations company Hill and Knowlton - would sniff the chance of management buy-out possibilities or be tempted away by rivals, once the group's moving spirit had gone. Another card in Mr Sorrell's hand has been the bleakness of the outlook for the industry as a whole. There is no sign that advertising spending will rapidly pick up this year; 2 per cent worldwide in real terms is the betting at the moment. Against this background, the banks' best chance of recovering their money is to to dig in now, in hope of selling bits of the company over the next five years. That argues against immediate management changes. When the recession ends, and advertising revenue starts rising again, the banks may scent a chance of selling for a reasonable price. At that point, the debate will re-open about whether large marketing groups add value to the activities of their subsidiaries - a question on which Mr Sorrell may find he holds markedly different views to his new majority shareholders.</p>

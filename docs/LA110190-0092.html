			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIPE RUPTURE CREATES WATERFALL IN BANK  TOWER  </P> <P> A break in an eight-inch pipe sent water cascading down a stairwell of a  16-story office building near 2nd and Figueroa streets in downtown Los Angeles  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Damage to the south structure of Imperial Bank Towers was estimated at $50,000  by Fire Department Battalion Chief Richard Jioras.  </P> <P> The break came below the roof and above the 16th floor about 10 a.m.  </P> <P> There were no reported injuries or structural damage and the tower was not  evacuated. Hardest hit was Rogers &amp; Wells, a law firm occupying the top two  stories, where the water level at the core of the building reached 3 inches.  </P> <P> Attorneys kept working in their offices at the building perimeter, but supplies  and word processors were soaked, the carpet was sodden and the ceiling still  dripped by mid-afternoon.  </P></p>

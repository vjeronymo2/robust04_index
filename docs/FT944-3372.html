			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Sweden nudges up interest rate Sweden's central bank yesterday raised short-term interest rates for the third time since August, as it sought to curb an upward trend in inflation which it fears could derail economic recovery and the government's efforts to control public finances. The Riksbank raised its 'repo', or repurchase, rate by 20 basis points to 7.60 per cent. The bank has warned repeatedly that inflation in 1995 is set to exceed its target ceiling of 3 per cent and is anxious to prevent any recurrence of the inflationary boom of the 1980s that preceded Sweden's deepest recession for 50 years. The new Social Democratic government is depending on lower interest rates to bolster the recovery, reduce 13 per cent unemployment and help cut the budget deficit, which is forecast to reach about 13 per cent of gross national product in the current fiscal year. But the Riksbank believes raising short-term rates will aid the process by reassuring financial markets that inflation will be controlled, thus easing long-term interest rates.</p>

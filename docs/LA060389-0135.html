			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEEKS SEAT ON BOARD;  </P> <P> FIDELITY NATIONAL BUYS HAMMOND CO. STAKE  </P> <P> Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine said Friday it has bought a 16.3%  stake in the Hammond Co. and will try to gain a seat on the board of the  Newport Beach-based mortgage banking firm.  </P> <P> Fidelity, a title insurance company operating in 30 states, purchased the stock  to set up a working relationship with Hammond, said Frank P. Willey, Fidelity's  executive vice president and general counsel.  </P> <P> Fidelity hopes to offer title policies to those who take home loans out through  Hammond, Willey said. But he emphasized that any such working relationship  would be strictly on a friendly basis.  </P> <P> In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fidelity said it was  purchasing the stock for investment purposes only. Willey said the company  would consider purchasing more stock but does not intend to turn its purchases  into a takeover attempt or a "hostile situation."  </P> <P> He said his colleagues plan to talk with Hammond executives soon to discuss  working together and giving Fidelity a seat on the board at the next annual  meeting of shareholders, scheduled for July 25.  </P> <P> With the purchase, Fidelity becomes Hammond's second largest shareholder and  would be entitled to one seat on the board. But Willey said his company does  not want to force its way on to the board.  </P> <P> Thomas T. Hammond, the company's chairman and president, owns 32.5% of the  stock. He and five other board members own more than 43% of the stock.  </P> <P> Hammond said he did not know if he would willingly accept any Fidelity  representatives on the board. While Fidelity's managers are "well-regarded," he  said, "I just don't know them."  </P> <P> Fidelity started buying its shares April 20 on the open market, the SEC filing  states. It picked up 77,785 shares in five transactions over the next month for  prices ranging from $3.50 a share to $5 a share. On May 24, it purchased its  biggest block, 255,500 shares, for $5 a share from Clark Estates Inc., a New  York investment manager.  </P> <P> The Hammond Co. is trying to buy back 13.5% of its stock in an effort to  enhance the stock, which executives believe is undervalued.  </P> <P> The company's stock price had been steadily declining since the spring of 1987  when it was selling for $8.75 a share. It hit a low of $2.50 a share during the  first three months this year and has been climbing since. It closed Friday at  $5 a share, unchanged from Thursday's close.  </P> <P> The company recently reported a loss of $1.1 million for the 1989 fiscal year,  ended March 31. Hammond attributed the loss to fewer new loans, lower interest  income and a $450,000 write-off related to its failed bid last fall to buy  Mission Savings &amp; Loan in Riverside.  </P></p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Campaign fails to rouse voters Ten days of hard election campaigning since the US congressional recess began has failed to reverse the disillusioned and anti-incumbent mood among US voters,according to an Associated Press poll. The poll, released yesterday, found only 35 per cent of the electorate in favour of re-electing their own congressional representatives. However, only 26 per cent thought much would change if the Republicans took control of Congress. There was good and bad news for both parties engaged in a campaign so far permeated by rancour and sleaze. Republicans were slightly more likely to vote for newcomers than Democrats, who risk losing control of the Senate and, conceivably, the House as well in the November 8 election. However, Democrats had a slight edge with 38 per cent of the voters against 37 per cent in favour of Republicans. Democratic party strategists fear the apathy and anger in the electorate is more likely to keep Democrats at home and drive Republicans to the polls. President Bill Clinton and the national Democratic party have sought to turn the anger towards the 'obstructionist' Republicans in Congress. Recent missteps by Congressman Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader in the House, have given the Democrats the opportunity to campaign with a national theme. His 'Contract With America', unveiled last month, promises a balanced budget, tax cuts and strengthening of defence - a prescription Mr Clinton is deriding as warmed-over Reaganism. Mr Gingrich has also warned that Democrats will be portrayed as 'the enemies of ordinary Americans'. This has given ammunition to Mr Clinton, whose approval rating on foreign policy has been rising.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "We Demand That Our Delegation Be Clear and </F> Frank"]    [Excerpts] Some believe that the crisis caused by the  Hebron massacre has been resolved by the dispatch of  international observers to this ill-fated town. Palestinian and  Israeli negotiators are expected to resume their talks in Cairo  on Sunday to discuss the next steps of implementing the  Gaza-Jericho First stage. Palestinian officials have said that  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat agreed to the formula  reached by Palestinian envoy Nabil Sha'th with Israeli  negotiator Amnon Shahaq after obtaining "a private Israeli  commitment" that Israel will gradually remove the settlers from  the center of Hebron. This is what reports from the Palestinian  side indicate, but Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have categorically stressed that  the evacuation of settlers from the center of Hebron is not  included in any clause of the announced Palestinian-Israeli  agreement nor are there any secret clauses. Here is the  contradiction between what has been agreed upon and how each  party interprets it!    It is certain, however, that the accord did not overcome the  Palestinian people's concern for their safety or that agreement  was reached to provide protection for them. Our people do not  feel more secure today than before. If the agreement and the  dispatch of international observers seek to deflect the anger  against negotiations, what is taking place in the Palestinian  territories reflects not only the dissatisfaction in Hebron but  that of the entire Palestinian people with any agreement that is  not preceded by the evacuation of settlers from the center of  Hebron. This ordeal proves once again that the Palestinians  faced Israeli and U.S. pressure alone, as well as that applied  by some of the Arabs, while the other Arab states sat in the  spectator's seat as if what is happening does not concern them  at all. Here, we cannot but mention the stance of Dennis Ross,  the U.S. coordinator of the peace process, in his meeting with  President 'Arafat and the methods of pressure and warning that  he used to force the Palestinians to return to the talks and  refrain from inflating the Hebron massacre, as he put it!  [passage omitted]    The Security Council tried to laugh at us with a resolution  in which there was condemnation, denunciation, and high-sounding  words. The result was that the Palestinians were forced to  accept an agreement on Hebron that fails to respond to the  minimal Palestinian aspirations for security and safety. What  is the value of the international community's condemnation if it  is not accompanied by unceasing work to implement international  legitimacy's resolutions, foremost of all that which considers  the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories  illegal and an obstacle to peace?    We are facing a grave and delicate stage. The Palestinian  orientation toward a settlement and peace does not mean that the  road will be easy. There will be many stations that will  confront our people with difficult tests, but Israel and its  allies should not regard their methods as some kind of a sport  where our people will accept what is unacceptable. The Israeli  leadership should respond to the sincere Palestinian inclination  to end the conflict so that each party will secure its rights,  security, and stability.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] Executive  Committee held a meeting today in Bratislava. After the  meeting, which ended shortly before our transmission, our  correspondent Igor Kubik asked the SDL Chairman Peter Weiss to  summarize the meeting's results.    [Begin Weiss recording] The Executive Council mainly  discussed the present internal political situation and concluded  that the way the government was ruling was damaging the country.  The Slovak Republic or, rather, its government's image abroad  is not good. The economic policy of the government is marred by  systematic improvisation and the absence of an overall plan,  which is all reflected in the social sphere, where the most  threatened are the socially weakest strata, young families with  children, and pensioners. And citizens are all the more worried  about their security. It is necessary to create such political  conditions as would change this state of affairs in a tangible  way. The SDL warned almost a year ago that an internal crisis  ought to be resolved by democratic means, by early elections.  [passage omitted]    We are of the opinion that the solution lies in creating  conditions for a government that could introduce a planned  policy to be carried out within a four-year period. It should  be a government formed by political forces intellectually  prepared to meet the challenge and, at the same time, carry out  a nonconfrontational policy and respect its partners' views and  give up the politics of pressure, blackmail, and discrimination  against political rivals. We will do everything we can to change  the way power is exercised, not to street power, but in such a  way that the decision would be made by citizens in democratic,  early parliamentary elections.

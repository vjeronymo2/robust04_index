			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, since manufacture dairy products (unlike fluid milk) compete in a national market, there is a relationship between the M&hyph;W price for Grade B milk and the price of surplus Grade A milk, which, like Grade B milk, is used to produce manufactured dairy products. The M&hyph;W price reflects a competitive free market price for raw farm milk and the explicit link between Grade B and Grade A surplus milk prices. Thus, the M&hyph;W price automatically incorporates the effects of innumerable economic factors which have an impact on both buyers and sellers including the relative price and availability of feed for dairy cows. Month-to-month changes in the unregulated free market M&hyph;W price (i.e., the price of Grade B milk) reflect changes in the overall supply and demand conditions for milk and its products nationally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concern for the need to ensure competitive equity among handlers and the existence of basic price differences between adjacent marketing areas also led to the universal adoption of the M&hyph;W price in all federal milk orders. Marketing areas which relied on the other basic pricing formulae noted above often resulted in producer prices that were too low compared to those received by Midwestern producers. This situation created a competitive disadvantage for Midwestern processors with respect to sales of such manufactured dairy products as butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese because these products, which compete on a national rather than ``local'' market, were more expensive relative to similar products manufactured elsewhere. Consequently, it became clear that a competitive pay price would most accurately indicate the basic value of milk on a national level. Use of the M&hyph;W price which, as noted above, is a competitive pay price, automatically indicates the basic value of milk and eliminates the need for making possibly inaccurate judgments concerning particular products, prices, yield factors and manufacturing allowances which otherwise would be used to calculate product price formulae.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In short, the M&hyph;W price provides automatic adjustments concerning all of the factors affecting the supply of and demand for milk and its products. Thus, the M&hyph;W price has been adopted in all federal milk orders as the ``mover'' of all Class I and Class II prices and is the Class III price (subject to certain minor adjustments). Using the M&hyph;W as the Class III price maintains price coordination between Grade B and surplus Grade A milk supplies used for manufacturing purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Price and Supplies of Feed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agricultural commodities typically follow cyclical price-quantity patterns. Given fixed levels of demand, as supplies become plentiful, price for feed trends downward. When supplies become scarce, price for feed trends upward. The market signals incorporated into the M&hyph;W price indicate price movements up and down and elicit either more or less commodity production. This coupling pattern between feed supplies and feed prices allows market analysts to focus on either factor and implicitly know what the other is doing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost of feed is a significant factor involved in milk production. Officially noticed documents that are part of the record of the administrative hearing outline cash feed expenses as they relate to the total economic costs of producing milk. (``Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector: Costs of Production, Economic Research Service'', ECIFS 3&hyph;1, 1983; ECIFS 6&hyph;1, 1986; and ECIFS 9&hyph;1, 1989.) For the period 1981 through 1989, data describing the annual average cost of producing one hundred pounds of milk were reviewed. Statistics for six individual regions plus the entire United States were examined. Information for one additional region was available for the 1987, 1988, and 1989 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual regional and total United States summary statistics for a nine-year period from 1981 through 1989 were reviewed. The review of these statistics revealed that the total cash feed expenses as a percentage of the total economic costs of production, on a per hundredweight (cwt.) basis, ranged from 30 percent to 58 percent from year-to-year. This percentage measures the relative significance of cash feed expenses for each region and the United States relative to the estimated total cost of milk production for the respective regions and the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the availability and cost of feed are primary factors involved in farm level milk production, there is a limit to how much milk output can be obtained from a given quantity of feed input. This is a physical milk production constraint. It relates to the biological limits of the cow and the economics of milk production decisions made by individual farmers. In general, given a specified level of feed costs, a dairy farmer decides to purchase and/or grow a quantity of feed and forage. This in turn determines the amount of feed that may be made available to cows for milk production and has a direct impact on the aggregate level of milk that may be produced in absence of any consideration being given to the price that can be obtained for the milk that is produced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such analysis of the availability and costs of feed provides only one dimension, albeit an important dimension, of the factors the Secretary must consider in establishing a price for milk. These important statutory pricing factors, however, are automatically embodied in the M&hyph;W price. The M&hyph;W is a superior basic price indicator for milk because it reflects all of the economic factors that affect the supply of milk as well as all of the factors that affect the demand for the products of milk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

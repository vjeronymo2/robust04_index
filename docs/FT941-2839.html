			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Hoogovens narrows its losses Hoogovens, the Dutch steel and aluminium company, narrowed its losses in 1993, with the steel division turning in a small profit but aluminium activities falling further into the red. The company's net loss was more than halved to Fl 234m (Dollars 123m) from Fl 595m in 1992, when the figures were heavily influenced by restructuring provisions of Fl 370m. The 1993 figures included slightly more than Fl 60m in extraordinary charges. Hoogovens, which raised more than Fl 360m in a rights issue in late 1993, said yesterday that it would again omit its dividend to shareholders. It also announced plans for a convertible subordinated bond issue of at least Fl 275m. Group turnover fell to Fl 7.22bn from Fl 7.72bn in 1992, reflecting an erosion in selling prices for both steel and aluminium. This external price decline offset part of Hoogovens' internal achievement in getting its costs down by Fl 450m last year. Since 1991, Hoogovens has achieved internal cost savings of Fl 900m. Despite lower demand for steel in Europe and the fall in general prices, Hoogovens' steel division managed to post a pre-tax operating profit of Fl 5m, a strong reversal of the previous year's loss of Fl 234m. However, pre-tax operating losses in aluminium widened to Fl 265m from Fl 162m. Aluminium prices have been hit by surplus stocks worldwide, exacerbated by the stream of cheaper aluminium from the former Soviet Union. For 1994, Hoogovens is forecasting that it will make a modest profit before extraordinary items.</p>

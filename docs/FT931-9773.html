			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pleiad sells office complex in Brussels PLEIAD Real Estate is selling a newly-built complex in central Brussels for SKr3bn (Dollars 415m) in what it claims is one of Europe's largest single property transactions. The buyer is the Belgian telephone company Belgacom, which will be able to gather its various operations under one roof. The complex, known as Tours Pleiad, is situated at the Gare du Nord and comprises 110,000 sq metres of office space in two 29-story buildings and one 7-storey pavilion. Mr Per Mellander, Pleiad chief executive, said: 'We're delighted at having been able to close this large deal, given today's tight real-estate market in Europe.' He said the complex's central location, with good transport links, and its 'high Scandinavian quality' had been crucial factors in clinching the sale. Pleiad was set up in 1989 by five investors, comprising the motor vehicle group Volvo and four Swedish pension and insurance groups. Its property and development project portfolio totals SKr7bn.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GULFSTREAM WORKS ON JET MUZZLE  </P> <P> Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. is developing an engine noise-reduction device that  will make older jet aircraft quieter and more fuel-efficient, company Chairman  Allen Paulson said today.  </P> <P> Paulson said he has applied for a patent on the device and production could  begin in 1 1/2 to 2 years.  </P> <P> The device is being designed not only for Gulfstream's older G-II and G-III  corporate jet aircraft but also for commercial jets, including Boeing 707s and  727s and McDonnell-Douglas DC-9s, said Paulson.  </P> <P> "It could be bigger than anything we've ever done," he said.  </P> <P> Paulson said the device will give airlines a cost-effective answer to  environmental pressures to reduce engine noise emissions. He said airports in  Van Nuys and Long Beach, Calif., have tightened jet engine noise emission  standards, and he expects others to follow.  </P></p>

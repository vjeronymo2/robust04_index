			<p>BFN     [Text] President Suharto hosted a state banquet in honor  of visiting Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh and his wife at the  National Palace in Jakarta tonight. Addressing the banquet,  President Suharto reiterated that all countries in Southeast  Asia have the common responsibility of maintaining peace and  stability in the region.    He said that all countries in the region should always  uphold  the principle of good neighborliness and mutual respect for each  others' sovereignty. He also said that Vietnam and Indonesia  have the common aspiration of turning Southeast Asia into a zone  of peace and stability, a region of high economic growth, as  well as a prosperous region that will guarantee the welfare of  its people.    In view of this, President Suharto lauded Vietnam's  cooperation with ASEAN by participating in the organization's  programs and being an observer at ASEAN meetings.    The head of state also said that it is important for  Indonesia and Vietnam to establish cordial relations and  mutually trust each other so that all issues relating to  bilateral ties can be resolved fairly.    President Suharto said that Indonesia and Vietnam, being  neighboring countries with historical ties, should be able to  settle amicably such issues as the continental shelf and the  repatriation of Vietnamese illegal immigrants in Indonesia.    The head of state said he is confident that a satisfactory  result can be achieved in efforts to settle those problems based  on the good etiquette displayed by officials from the two  countries.    Present at the banquet, among others, were vice President  and  Madame Try Sutrisno, senior government officials, and cabinet  ministers.</p>

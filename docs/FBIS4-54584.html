			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- Albanian paramilitary  units in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] were in possession of "Stinger" missiles before they were  disbanded by the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs in  November 1993.    This was revealed today by VECER, a Skopje-based daily,  which  based its story on an account given by one of the main  defendants, Hasan Agusi, former Yugoslav People's Army captain  serving in the Marshall Tito barracks in Skopje until 1991.    According to Agusi, the Albanian paramilitary headquarters,  which was based in Gostivar, paid 200,000 German marks to import  weapons from Albania through Debar. The shipment consisted of  200 Chinese-made Kalashnikovs.</p>

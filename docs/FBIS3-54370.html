The organization states this should only be  done through a general and national agreement based on a  centralized leadership decision to preserve the Palestinian  cause.    In a statement distributed in Gaza, Fatah reiterated its  demand from all organizational cadres to halt such acts because  they harm the people's interests. It called on the Palestinian  people, including all their popular organizations, to be alert  and aware, with extreme patriotism, of all the conditions around  them.</p>

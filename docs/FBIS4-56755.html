			<p>BFN     [Text] Manaus -- The Army has increased the number of  officers and noncommissioned officers who will be trained at the  CIGS [Intensive Jungle Guerrilla Warfare Training Course] in  Manaus from 150 to nearly 350. In addition to increasing by  more than 100 percent the number of personnel who will be  trained annually in antiguerrilla warfare and jungle survival,  the leading military training school in this area, which was  created in 1964, has increased the number of courses from three  to seven.    CIGS Commander Luiz Roberto Fragoso Peret Antunes is a  42-year-old lieutenant colonel. He reports that the students  are trained to fight in an area of 1,500 square kilometers of  jungle located between the municipalities of Manaus and Rio  Preto. He adds: "Instructors show them how to take advantage of  the flora and fauna of the jungle and to take precautions  against its natural dangers."    For over 30 years, CIGS has also trained 184 foreign  servicemen. Attending a course that started yesterday are two  students from Argentina, three from Ecuador, two from Paraguay,  one from Guyana, two from Uruguay, three from Mexico, and five  from France. According to Peret, they learn "only general rules  about how to operate in the jungle." Strategic information on  how to fight in the jungle is given only to Brazilians.</p>

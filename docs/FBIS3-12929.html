			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in </F> Cairo, by radio correspondents Sa'id Mu'addi and Sha'ul Menashe,  in the studio--live]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Your Excellency Minister 'Amr Musa, good  afternoon.    [Musa] You are welcome.    [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, intensive contacts  and consultations are being held under Egyptian sponsorship,  with the participation of the parties concerned, in order to  resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Are there positive  signs following the meeting between Egyptian President Husni  Mubarak and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat?    [Musa] The objective is not only to resume negotiations.  The objective is to tackle the problems that resulted from the  crime committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque. This crime, committed  by the murderer Barukh Goldstein, cannot go unnoticed. There  must be measures to prevent similar crimes and ban the  aggressions carried out by settlers, extremists, and terrorists  against the Palestinians. This is an important and major issue.    It is inconceivable that matters should proceed normally in  the wake of this crime without securing protection for the  Palestinians and without ensuring Palestinian security. This is  an important and basic issue. Negotiations can proceed normally  when agreement is reached in this regard and when such measures  are taken.    [Menashe] Your Excellency the Minister, apart from the  existing problem between the PLO and Israel, is the atmosphere  surrounding other Arab parties to the negotiations opportune to  resume talks?    [Musa] The crime committed in Hebron by the terrorist  settler and murderer Goldstein has enraged all Arabs and the  whole world. Thus, the atmosphere is now replete with wrath  regarding this crime while we await the measures that will be  taken to protect the Palestinians in the occupied territories  from people similar to this terrorist murderer.    [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, the Israeli  leadership, with all its party affiliations, denounced the  criminal act that occurred in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Despite  much sorrow and grief, the peace process should continue.  Naturally, Egypt, which is a pioneer in this regard, will  redouble its efforts to resume these negotiations. What role is  Egypt currently playing to promote the peace process?    [Musa] The Israeli Government has indeed condemned this  incident. What is important is not only to condemn or show  resentment, but also to take measures that will prevent similar  incidents. In other words, the settlers who carry arms should  be prevented from entering the Arab territories. It is now very  clear that the settlements are a serious issue and cannot go  unnoticed, and that people should not be left free to kill the  Palestinian Arabs in the manner of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.  Measures should be taken.    Naturally, we in Egypt are convinced that peace can only be  achieved through negotiations. The peace process began, and  negotiations were about to achieve their objectives. We believe  that negotiations are a positive process. However, measures  should be taken on the ground to protect the Palestinian people.  Do not forget that the Palestinians are living in territories  that are occupied and that are not Israeli territories.  Consequently, the settlers residing in the settlements should  be encircled somehow in order to protect the Palestinians. This  is because there is not just the issue of Israeli security but  also the issue of Palestinian security on equal footing. This  issue is now clear to the masses, to public opinion, and to all  of us. It has also now clear that it is the Palestinian's  security, and not only the Israeli's security, that is  threatened. We want a just and balanced solution. We do not  want any trivial thing meant only to say that we signed and  negotiated. Hence, in order for negotiations to resume, which  is important to us all, measures should be taken on the ground  to protect the Palestinian people.    [Menashe] Mr. Minister, can we have a hint as to what took  place yesterday in the meeting between Yasir 'Arafat, President  Mubarak, and your excellency? Strictly speaking, are we  proceeding toward the aspired objective despite the obstacles?    [Musa] I cannot give you a specific answer because the  measures that are being taken in the occupied territories to  protect the Palestinian people are a major issue. Everything  depends on this issue.    [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, can we expect  Foreign Minister Peres' arrival in Cairo to meet with Yasir  'Arafat, or will contacts be held to hold a meeting between His  Excellency President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin?    [Musa] Nothing has been decided yet on either meeting.    [Mu'addi] Your Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa, thank you very much.    [Musa] Thank you.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Directed by Richard Eyre, written by Ian McEwan and starring Harriet Walter, is a pretty impressive combination so The Imitation Game (BBC 2 at 9pm) demands attention. It was first broadcast in 1980 and is revived as part of the tribute season to Richard Eyre, now director of the National Theatre. Walter is a young girl, anxious to join the war effort in 1940, whose enthusiasm evaporates when confronted by male condescension. Newsreader Martyn Lewis's plea for more good news should be satisfied in QED: Gallop to Freedom (BBC 1 at 9.30pm), which follows attempts to revive the Przewalski horse. This was the horse of antiquity, immortalised in the cave paintings at Lascaux. Tight budgets do not allow much costume drama on screen, especially when it involves the recreation of battles. So a welcome for Sharpe in which Sean Bean buckles his swash as a lieutenant in Wellington's army in Spain during the Peninsula War. In this episode (ITV at 8pm) he rallies his men to recover the lost regimental colours and ideally to capture a French eagle.</p>

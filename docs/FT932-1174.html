			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (4): Scrambled eggs for players at the Games - Is the city in with a chance? How the Olympic Committee is seeking international support ALREADY, Istanbul has persuaded 32 of the 96 members of the Inter- national Olympic Committee to visit the city. Mr Sinan Erdem, president of the National Olympic Committee and vice-chairman of the bid committee, believes if just another 20 come, then Istanbul is in with a real chance. 'Not since the war have we had such a compact project,' says Mr Erdem, a former volleyball player who has worked for the Olympic movement for 26 years. The Istanbul bid committee is nominally headed by Mr Mehmet Ali Yilmaz, the minister for sport. This businessman and sports fanatic used to have a sofa big enough to seat the entire squad of Trabzonspor, the football team he owns. The bid itself is costing around Dollars 10-12m, much of it spent on preparing the bid document, a weighty package in English and French. There are also advertising expenses and the cost of a permanent staff of experts, not to mention the entertain- ment allowance for visiting IOC members. Nevertheless, for those outside sport, the mechanics of winning the Games may be difficult to comprehend. Lord Of the Rings, a book published in the run-up to the Barcelona Olympics, provided a fairly damning portrait of bribery and corruption - allegations that Mr Erdem strongly rejects. For him, the IOC members are a group of individuals. Mr Atilla Aksoy, of Young &amp; Rubicam, believes the bid will be decided on more practical considerations. 'You have to know how to get 150,000 eggs to the village every morning and then scramble them,' he says to illustrate his point. Istanbul's bid is more compact than that of Peking, although Sydney has similar advantages. Design work was done by two US firms - Stang &amp; Newdow and Copeland Hirthler, both of whom were co-ordinated by Young &amp; Rubicam. The site chosen for the Games is near the present Buyukcekmece Lake, which will be the focus for a nest of stadiums - even the sailing is not far away in the beautiful marina at Fenerbahce on the Asian side of the sea of Marmara. Mr Erdem likes to point out that the archery at the Los Angeles Games had to take place in Mexico. The Olympic village nearby will comprise some 7,000 flats, considered ample for the estimated 15,000 competitors who will attend the Games. The units have already been sold. After the Games, and a quick coat of paint, the apartments will handed over to their new owners. There will be no cost to the Olympics authorities. The telecommunications centre will be sited in the Istanbul World Trade Centre which is due to be opened in July. Turkey is already linked to its own Turksat satellite programme - beaming to central Asia and to the country's guest workers in Germany and other European countries. Given the revolution that has occurred in Turkish telecommunications over the past few years, officials are confident that Turkey can comfortably handle such a large media event. No-one - at least no-one in Istanbul - is scoffing at the bid. The budgeting for the Games is considered conservative. Moreover, the government has agreed to underwrite any shortfall in revenues. There will therefore not be any direct burden on the city. The revenue from selling the TV rights has been projected at Dollars 480m. At Barce- lona, TV deals generated more than Dollars 500m and at Atlanta the site of the next Games in 1996, the estimate is Dollars 800m. 'We didn't want to show the TV world that we were dependent on television,' says Mr Aksoy. He estimates that 40 per cent of the TV sponsorship may come from Europe. Ticket pricing has still to be finalised, although organisers say the aim is to make it as cheap as possible for the spectators. 'It shouldn't be seen as a rich man's club,' says Mr Aksoy. In another gesture to the populist ideals of the Games, Istanbul is promising to pay the travel expenses of all athletes and officials. In addition, Dollars 3m is budgeted to pay for journalists from the former Soviet Union and developing countries. Mr Aksoy says that in Barcelona they were starving. Prince Albert of Monaco, in his capacity as member of the IOC, visited Istanbul a few weeks ago. Driving through the traffic to the proposed site for the Olympic village, he tried to phone Hong Kong, then New York and then home to Monaco. Somewhat to his surprise, he got through to all three places without a hitch. Istanbul is full of surprises. For instance, visiting the Grand Bazaar, Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the IOC, must have been taken aback to find a carpet seller who could speak his native Catalan]</p>

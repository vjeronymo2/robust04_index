			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Market fall blamed on money growth Unexpectedly strong growth in German money supply during October was blamed partly for a sharp fall in the Frankfurt stock market yesterday, but economists were divided over its impact on prospects for interest rates. Provisional Bundesbank figures showed the broad M3 measure, seasonally adjusted, expanded at an annualised 6.8 per cent, unchanged from September, and still above the bank's 6.5 per cent ceiling. Stock exchange traders, concerned that further interest rate cuts may be delayed, marked down stocks. The blue-chip Dax index fell 47.37 points (2.28 per cent), to close at 2,030. Money market operators saw the rising dollar as a potential hindrance to early cuts in the Bundesbank's key discount lending rate, last reduced 0.5 to 5.75 per cent a month ago. But economists said continuing weakness in the German economy and falling inflation would encourage the central bank to stick to its established policy of cautious easing. Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, said he expected November inflation in west Germany to fall to 3.6 per cent compared with 3.9 per cent in October. Figures from the federal statistics office yesterday showed west German producer prices unchanged in October, though still 0.3 per cent down on a year earlier. Bundesbank private-sector lending rose at an annualised 9.2 per cent in the six months to the end of October, against 8.2 per cent in the same period to the end of September.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Boeing to open itself to wider global collaboration BOEING, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, is set to open itself up to greater collaboration with other international aerospace companies, Mr Philip Condit, the US company's new president, said yesterday. Although Boeing has traditionally been a 'go-it-alone' company, Mr Condit said in an interview yesterday that increased international collaboration would become an important thrust of company strategy. Mr Condit, aged 51, was elected Boeing president on Monday and is widely tipped to become chairman after Mr Frank Shrontz, the current chairman, retires in four years. Mr Condit would not elaborate on what kind of increased international collaboration Boeing was seeking but confirmed that 'we will see more collaboration with lots of people in the international field'. Boeing is already collaborating more closely with the three Japanese aerospace companies (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Fuji Heavy Industries, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) on its new 777 twin engine wide-body airliner programme managed up to now by Mr Condit. The new president also said Boeing had entered into closer collaboration in military programmes including the new US Advanced Tactical Fighter F-22 with Lockheed and General Dynamics and the Comanche helicopter with Sikorsky. Mr Condit is taking over as president at a difficult time for Boeing and the aerospace industry. The military business is under pressure from government defence cuts while Boeing is facing challenges on the commercial front including the launch of its new 777 airliner in a depressed market, increasingly aggressive competition from the European Airbus consortium, as well as the need to revamp its 737 narrow-body jet family and to press forward with studies to develop a new super jumbo large capacity airliner. But Mr Condit said the 777 programme was 'in good shape'. He also welcomed the recent US compromise with the European Commission on Airbus subsidies as 'an important step' in the dispute over commercial aircraft trade. But he added that Boeing wanted to see the European Airbus consortium operate 'on a completely privatised basis'.</p>

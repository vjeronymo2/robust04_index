Official sources said that in 1993 the province poured some  310 million yuan (about 35.6 million U.S. dollars) into the work  of flood control on the Huaihe. About 28.7 million cu m [cubic  meters] of earthworks was completed in the same year.    According to official statistics, by the end of 1992 some  637  million yuan (about 73.2 million U.S. dollars) had been used in  the work, of which 120 million yuan (about 13.8 million U.S.  dollars) was collected within the province.    Meanwhile, some 80 million cu m of earthworks had been  completed.    Officials from the provincial government said that in 1993,  100,000 workers were engaged in the task, as against 300,000 in  1990 because of the increased use of machinery.    Located on the middle reaches of the Huaihe River, the  province, most of whose land is lower than the high-water level  of the river, has suffered from flood disasters throughout  history.    In 1991, after suffering a particularly serious flood  disaster, the province formulated a set of policies for  combating the menace.    During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) China has  listed  13 projects concerning flood control work in Anhui Province as  state key projects, with a total investment of some three  billion yuan (about 345 million U.S. dollars).    In the meantime, the province plans to allocate some one  billion yuan (about 115 million U.S. dollars) to support the  projects.    In addition, the state government has earmarked some 100  million yuan (about 11.5 million U.S. dollars) since 1991 for  the construction of roads and temporary shelters in case of  further flood disasters.</p>

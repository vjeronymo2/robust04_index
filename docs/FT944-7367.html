			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Norwegian EU threat Norway's principal opponents of joining the European Union yesterday re-affirmed their threat to block accession in parliament if the referendum on Monday results in a narrow vote in favour of membership. With latest opinion polls showing the Yes side narrowing the long-standing lead held by the No campaign, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, strongly attacked anti-EU parties for their refusal to be bound by the referendum result, saying she would consider dissolving parliament if a Yes vote was blocked. Both the main parties opposed to membership, which together hold three more seats than the number required for a blocking minority, yesterday said they stood by their policy to reserve the right to vote against the referendum result. Yesterday, three opinion polls showed further gains for the Yes campaign, but they continued to show a No lead ranging from a margin of 44-40 to 47-39. A fourth poll, which eliminated undecided voters, showed a No lead of just 51-49.</p>

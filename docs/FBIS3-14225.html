According to Peres, PLO  leaders say that the PLO gap with the local population is in the  territories. We must take this argument seriously, he says, and  enable the PLO to go on representing the Palestinian peace camp.  Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports:    [Begin Peres recording] I intend to turn the agreement with  the PLO into reality. Many wonder about my support for 'Arafat.  I do not support 'Arafat because he is who he is, but because  he wants peace. I support peace, and 'Arafat today is one of  the means to attain peace. We must act rapidly and reach  conclusions. There is no sense in procrastinating since we gain  nothing from it. Human lives are destroyed and the human soul  is also ruined.    Some people ask: Do we not have the right to live in Hebron?  Well, we have the right to live in Hebron. Some say: Are Jews  not allowed to live in Hebron? Well, we can live in Hebron.  The problem is not one of rights but of blood.    When peace is attained, I have no doubt that Jews will be  able to move and live in Hebron. Today it is not a question of  moving or living there, but of confrontation and death. It is  the government's duty to lower the level of friction. In the  present situation, which is so emotionally charged, imagine that  Arab residents of Israel were to buy a plot of land near the  great synagogue in Jerusalem or near the Karmel market in Tel  Aviv. How would Israelis react? We must take a realistic look  at the situation. Attitudes must change before we decide on the  final location. [sentence as heard] [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 24 March  adds: "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres noted that hatred and  hostility keep growing in the territories, and the Army cannot  prevent it. He believes that politicians must make courageous  decisions, should not pass the buck to the military level, and  should not insist that the Army cope with an impossible, no-win  situation."]</p>

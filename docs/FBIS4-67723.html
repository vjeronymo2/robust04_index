			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Iver Hoj: "Private Hospitals in Financial </F> Squeeze"]    [Text] More and more Danes are being treated at private  hospitals. But it is not easy to make ends meet. There are too  many beds for the small market.    The operations are successful, the patients survive and are  satisfied, but the hospitals are in financial trouble.    Danish private hospitals have high medical standards and  luxurious accommodations. Nevertheless, they continue to have  big budget problems. The two largest private hospitals, as a  consequence, have altered their course in the past few months.    Most recently, Mermaid, a private hospital in Ebeltoft, has  cut its operating costs by 10 million kroner. The hospital has  also convinced its creditors to cancel half of its outstanding  debt and for a third time the hospital is out looking for new  capital, this time, 10 to 12 million kronor. At the same time,  the entire management has resigned and will be replaced in the  spring.    A total of 200 million kronor has been lost on the hilltop  above Ebeltoft since Mermaid opened its doors in 1989.    On the other hand, "Danmark" Health Insurance provides  substantial payment for care in private hospitals.  Administrative Director Preben Hentzen has a number of  explanations for why there are so many problems with the  industry:    "The number of beds in private hospitals is growing faster  than the number of patients. It takes time for Danes to get used  to paying for treatment," he stated matter-of-factly, and also  pointed to the fact that patients from one county can get a new  knee or a new hip at hospitals in another county and get  treatment faster -- for free.    There are about 200 beds in private hospitals in Denmark.  The  largest are Mermaid with 37 beds and Hamlet, a private hospital  in Frederiksberg, with 33 beds. There are a number of smaller  ones as well. An example of a successful one is Erichsen's  Clinic in Charlottenlund, which is about to expand to 22 beds  and is in good financial shape.    But an industry-watcher finds that private patients bring  the  hospitals earnings of only about 100 million kroner, when  treatments for infertility are not figured in.  <H5>  Coming In </H5>   Mermaid has a turnover of 70 to 80 million kroner. But a  quarter of this comes from infertility treatments. The hospital  has also made an agreement with Frederiksborg County to perform  a number of operations.    But it has not been enough. The debt to Realkredit Danmark  has now been reduced from 110 million kroner to 60 million. That  cuts the rent in half. The Kirkbi Corp., which owns the  hospital's equipment, has also consented to reduce the  hospital's leasing payments significantly. The staff has been  reduced from 90 to 75.    All this has given Board Chairman Frank Bottrup confidence  in  the future:    "We had 11,000 to 12,000 patients in 1993 and turnover of 70  to 80 million kroner. We are experiencing a very slight rise in  patient intake. If we maintain the same turnover, the books  could balance--for the first time," he said.    But first he must find new management. Administrative  Director Sten Christensen, the medical director, the head nurse,  and a financial officer resigned after having put together and  won approval for 10 million kroner in cutbacks.    "We have a promise of 5 to 6 million kroner of new capital.  We are now looking for a corresponding sum. I would like to have  it resolved by the end of this month. It would be  overdramatizing it, however, to call it a race against time,"  said Bottrup.    Hoj: What has gone wrong?    Bottrup: The interest is there and the competition  from the public sector is not the problem. But patients from  abroad have never come. And earlier, "Danmark" paid 85 percent  of the actual costs. Beginning in 1993, the fixed contribution  was reduced so that now patients must pay 40 percent themselves.  That brought Mermaid's turnover down to a new level.    Preben Hentzen of `Danmark' said that it was necessary to  change the regulations because there was too great a price  differential from hospital to hospital, and that now it was  working satisfactorily. But he cannot confirm that Mermaid is  getting more patients. On the contrary:    "If the intake at Mermaid is rising, the patients cannot be  members of `Danmark.' In 1993, we paid out more for care at  private hospitals than we did in 1992, but it was spread over a  number of clinics. There were fewer patients at Mermaid who  received insurance payments," said Hentzen, who felt that the  Ebeltoft location was geographically unfortunate for a hospital:    "People do not want to travel to Mols for a service they  could just as easily get in Copenhagen."  <H5>  Hamlet </H5>   Hamlet, located in Frederiksberg, opened its doors in April  of 1993 and presented new competition for Mermaid. At Hamlet  they are also saying: "Next year."    The French-English concern, GHG, withdrew from ownership at  the end of last year after a disappointing first year. The  hospital is now owned solely by Danica and Rasmussen &amp;  Schiotz.    "January was not as bad as expected. February looks  promising," said Hamlet administrative director Anne-Marie  Traberg optimistically.    She is expecting a turnover of 50-60 million kroner this  year. If this materializes, the hospital will expand next year  and move closer to a time when the figures will move from red to  black, which they will at about 70 million.    "Patients began to come in the fall and we expect about  5,000  patients this year. Danes are feeling increasingly confident  about private hospitals and are starting to regard us as a  natural part of the hospital community," she said.</p>

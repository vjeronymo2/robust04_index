			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (1): Step by cautious step to recovery - The region is reviving, with its industrial competitiveness enhanced by devaluation. The services sector has suffered a shake-out, but growth is expected to resume THE fundamental question about the West Midlands is not whether the regional economy will revive after recession. That revival, in erratic fashion, has started. Rather the question is whether the second recession in 15 years has pushed the economy towards atrophy. The difficulties of recent years, coincident with changes in government policy, the closer integration of the European Community economies and growing social pressures, especially in the urban areas, accentuate undercurrents of concern about the longer term future. The immediate prospects are for modest growth. In broad terms, the flow of orders began to revive in the early months of the year; business confidence has risen to the highest levels for three years in expectation that the pressures on profitability will be relieved. But at the same time, the downturn in the European economies has blunted the thrust of recovery which, in any case, was off a low base. Three quarters of companies are working under full capacity, according to the latest calculations of forecasters at the Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies. Economists, then, are cautious about regional growth. 'At the start of the year I forecast 1.5 per cent for 1993,' says Mr Martin Booth, chief economist at the West Midlands Enterprise Board. 'I think I want to tone that down slightly now, but I can see stronger growth next year unless the recovery is choked off.' By stronger growth, he means more than 2.0 per cent. Mr David Kern, the chief economist at National Westminster Bank, predicts in his mid-1993 forecast a 1.5 per cent growth for this year and 2.3 per cent for 1994. So he is slightly more optimistic than Mr Booth. Any sustained national rise in consumer and investment spending would translate fairly quickly into a flow of orders for the engineering industry of the region and hence into the wider economy. Manufacturing remains the economic staple. This is both a strength and a weakness. Although the West Midlands is traditionally the manufacturing heart of the UK, manufacturing as a source of employment has declined, is declining and is likely to continue to decline. The growth of employment in the services sector, until checked by the latest recession, was slower in the West Midlands than elsewhere in the UK. Considering the region as a source of wealth, however, the future may be brighter than the employment prospects suggest. The UK government has recently switched its rhetoric to stress the importance of manufacturing - after a decade of verbal indifference. Government tax policy has latterly followed lines approved by, for example, the regional Engineering Employers Federation. Whether there exists the ability to take advantage of this new place in the political and economic sun is the wider question. It bears on the suggestion of economic atrophy. Geographically the region has no particular advantage: it may be at the centre of the UK, but it is on the periphery of that arc of European vigour stretching from northern Italy, through Germany and France, to London. Yet the pattern of the region's overseas trade is now firmly cast towards continental Europe. It is in the European arena, the more closely integrated EC market, that its competitive future will evolve. This is what worries the West Midlands Regional Forum of Local Authorities (whose collective voice is more sober than the 'boosterism' of its individual members). Noting that, as a traditional industrial region, the West Midlands is expected 'to have above average vulnerability' to competition from within the EC, while remaining highly dependent on exports to other members of the EC, the Forum is anxious about the ability to compete. 'By the year 2000, it has been estimated that 70 per cent of all European jobs will require brain rather than manual skills, yet levels of academic and skill attainment are relatively low in the West Midlands. Of particular concern is that several of the older manufacturing areas appear to lack access to the higher level skills required for the modernisation of the region's industries,' the Forum says. In fact, skills shortages never wholly disappeared - even during the recession - and there have been indications in recent surveys that skills shortages have begun to return as the economy revives. Corporate training budgets were frequently pruned during the recession. The training and enterprise councils which now stimulate and oversee much of the industrial training are too recent to have made a lasting impact. There is also a social element to the question. In general, the areas which need the jobs most, because of their high unemployment, are the areas where employment opportunities have diminished. The wards with highest unemployment are those of the inner cities. But the Birmingham City Council economic development department has drawn attention to the way in which job opportunities declined in the inner city, while increasing in the outer. Between 1984 and 1991 total employment in the Birmingham outer city grew 4.2 per cent, but declined in the inner city by 7.4 per cent, largely because of the scale of change in the motor vehicle industry. Planning policy and official funding is directed towards redressing that balance throughout the Birmingham-Black Country conurbation. The effort is to renew tired and derelict inner city areas so that more employment opportunities will emerge and more people will be trained to take advantage of them. Hence the existence of two urban development corporations, in the Black Country and east Birmingham, and four City Challenge areas in Birmingham, Sandwell, Walsall and Wolverhampton. Hence the appeals to government to retain assisted area status, able to receive regional and industrial development subsidies. Hence, by contrast, the fevered publicity, asserting how marvellous is the region and the cities in it. Yet the pressures for development on the green belt, the steady flow of tenants into business parks on the edge of the conurbation and the movement of companies to greenfield sites, in areas such as Telford, testify to a drift of corporate activity away from the inner city areas of the region, rather than towards it. Working through this mix of overlapping problems - inherent skills shortages and a lack of jobs where jobs are needed most - will be of the first importance to the development of the region into the next century. But if their solution is at least partially dependent on the level of economic activity, there are encouraging factors. The competitive position of industry changed between the recessions of the 1980s and the 1990s. Generally it is now more productive, more export-oriented - at least among the large and medium-sized groups. There has been a widening of the economic base in two senses: an influx of overseas investment has stimulated the regional economy, not only through its demands for local goods and services, but also through its spread of diverse management techniques; and at the same time there has been growth in the services sector. This throws up two caveats: if overseas industry has been attracted mostly because of low domestic costs, then it can disappear as quickly as it came, while the expansion of the services sector is largely an expansion of the low wage economy. The third encouraging factor is the developing links between the universities - Aston, Birmingham, Coventry, Warwick, Wolverhampton and the rest - and industrial groups. Co-operation of this kind will stimulate the movement of companies towards higher technology and new products, bringing into play different disciplines and harnessing wider ranges of skills. Here the future of the region rests.</p>

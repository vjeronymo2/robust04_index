			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze told  parliament in Tbilisi that the return of refugees and displaced  persons to Abkhazia was the main point of the agreement signed  in Moscow. If they return, Abkhazia will effectively stay  within Georgia, he said. Even though the document was not ideal,  Tbilisi had to compromise because there was no other way to win  the lost war.    Shevardnadze said that unless the refugees returned, "a  confederation with Abkhazia will remain a dream. Any  opportunity to have the refugees return to Abkhazia should be  seized. Without this there is no point in talking about  Abkhazia's status or a political solution of this issue...They  will not have another chance to return."    Following Shevardnadze's speech the opposition withdrew its  proposal that the agreement should be denounced and that a vote  of confidence in Shevardnadze be taken. Shevardnadze himself  demanded that such a vote be taken once the government is  approved.    The Georgian parliament will resume the debate on the  government composition on April 7.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Romance at a city's heart: Grand Hotel Nicholas Lander enjoys an anniversary at London's Savoy Hotel 'HAVE A good trip,' said the hotel's personable cashier. I did not have the wit to tell her that our return trip after a night at the Savoy would be eight stops up the Northern Line on the London Underground. We had decided, using a wedding anniversary as the pretext, to explore London, our own city. Choosing the hotel was more difficult than forsaking the queues at Heathrow or on the motorways that a journey out of London would have necessitated. The elegance of the Ritz, the decorum of Claridges, the sheer professionalism of the Inn on the Park or the renaiscent Dorchester? Or, perhaps, the discreetness of one of the smaller hotels, the Connaught, the Capital or Blakes? I recalled a friend who had managed to explore all of them during a week's walking tour of London by forsaking lunch and having tea in a different hotel every afternoon. The Savoy attracted us for its history, its location and its architecture. I had, until this visit, one major reservation about the hotel and that had been the rather supercilious attitude of its staff. It seemed to me that even in the late 1980s the management had not been able to break the almost feudal system that used to be the norm in all the grand hotels and manifested itself in the older members of the staff believing, and acting, as if they owned it. Today this attitude has changed. The recession has played its part but so too has the example set by Herbert Striessnig. the hotel's general manager. Brought in as a troubleshooter by his predecessor, Striessnig patrols the Savoy as though intent on wearing out the pile carpets. As we checked in, the advice of a former general manager of another of London's grand hotels was ringing in my ears: 'Whenever you stay in one of the world's expensive hotels get full value for your money. Send the postcards, wear the dressing gowns and find a home for all the free gifts on offer.' (In the Savoy's case golden toothbrushes). We did. We ate lunch in the Upstairs Bar looking on to the Savoy's entrance, the only street in London where you drive on the right. We took tea, not on the public terrace, but in the drawing room reserved for residents and a well- guarded secret. There were pre-dinner drinks, a dry martini naturally, and excellent potato crisps in the American Bar, followed by dinner in the Savoy Grill and, finally, breakfast in the River Room where we were the only people reading newspapers in a room full of power-breakfasters. The only problem was getting out of the bedroom which was stunning. We had requested a room with a view of the Thames and on the day it seemed fully worth its Pounds 60 supplement with panoramic views; east towards St Paul's Cathedral and Canary Wharf and west towards the Houses of Parliament. And the Thames looks magnificent, regardless of the colour of the water, because the hotel stands on a bend which is much more pronounced than I had realised. The room was huge with a range of fixtures and fittings that only an hotel with a long history could offer: a clock face etched on a large mirror from the 1930s; a three-button alarm for the valet, maid or butler; and a small wall-mounted Roberts radio. The bathrooms are small, converted from balconies which, before the first world war, overlooked the Thames. Bath robes and linen sheets are of the finest quality. To make up for this extravagance our afternoon's sightseeing cost nothing. The Savoy stands near two of London's ecclesiastical gems, the Savoy Chapel and St Mary-le-Strand. Also nearby are Victoria Embankment Gardens, which offer a green walk alongside the river and, just a brisk trot along the Strand and into Trafalgar Square, is the National Gallery. Covent Garden is just across the road. Nothing could be more pleasant than dinner in the Savoy Grill, consistently busy at lunch and dinner thanks to its proximity to the city, the theatres and the opera. Nor was it possible to fault the phalanx of distinguished waiters, including a sommelier who remembered what we had drunk on our last visit three years ago and informed us of the temperature of the red wine we had chosen. Criticism, however, there could be of the wine list which, in its pricing, shows the heavy hand of an accountant and offers nothing exciting by the glass (unlike the Upstairs Bar). And criticism too, for some of chef David Sharland's more adventurous dishes - in particular a salad of scallops with spiced vegetables. But the Grill had worked its magic. And London, from our bedroom window, looked enchanting. The Savoy, The Strand, London WC2R OEU. Tel: 071-836-4343, fax: 071-240-6040. Double room from Pounds 180 per night plus VAT.</p>

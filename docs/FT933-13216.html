			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains trimmed before the close THE HIGHLY promoted debut of the UK government's remaining stake in BT gave some encouragement to the London stock market yesterday, but failed to provide the overall impetus for which equity strategists had been hoping. The improved economic statistics announced last week were overshadowed by the prospects for Thursday's important parliamentary debate on the Maastricht legislation. Both the new BT stock (BT3) and the FT-SE 100 Index closed well below the day's best and investment confidence was dented by a new round of unfavourable developments in the pharmaceuticals sector. In spite of an early and successful start for the new BT issue, the London market opened lower behind weakness in the Far East following the outcome of the elections in Japan. A loss of six points on the Footsie, which also reflected price adjustments for dividend payments, was recovered only when the stock index futures opened higher. With the BT tranche soon at a premium of 25 to the 150p partly-paid issue price, and the existing BT stock strong in sympathy, the Footsie showed a gain of 13.7 early in the session. However, the rest of the day saw the market struggling and failing to hold on to its early levels. By the close the FT-SE 100 had slipped to 2,842.9 for a rise of 9.9 on the day. The UK market was discouraged by strains in the oil market as Opec announced a meeting of its ministerial committee within a month. Equity trading volume was heavily swollen by the BT issue. Turnover of 186m shares in BT3 and of 70m in existing BT stock made up about one-third of total Seaq business for the day of 760.4m shares. Non-Footsie business remained good, providing about 63 per cent of the total in spite of the focus on the telecommunications sector. On Friday, 628.8m shares were traded through the Seaq network for a retail value of Pounds 1.44bn. Second line issues followed the general trend, bringing a loss of 6.2 to 3,211.3 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. Enthusiasm for the BT sale was somewhat muted. Several analysts pointed out that nearly every important securities house in the London market is effectively gagged for the next two months from commenting or forecasting results for the UK telecommunications group. Some houses are believed to take a cautious view of BT's profits prospects and, following the allocation of 40 per cent of the BT3 stock to them, not all UK institutions were aggressive buyers in the market yesterday. A further blow to the market came from the drugs sector. Shares in Boots responded favourably when the board announced that it was abandoning Manoplax, its heart drug, which has suffered extremely adverse research scrutiny. But there was a steep fall in Medeva stock after the board disclosed that this year's profits will be Pounds 10m below expectations because of problems in the US. This news, on top of further pressure on pharmaceuticals from the US, brought widespread losses in this blue chip sector. Meanwhile, the economic optimism rekindled by the latest data on manufacturing output, unemployment and inflation still requires confirmation in the form of improved corporate profits.</p>

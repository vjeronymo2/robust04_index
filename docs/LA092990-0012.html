			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PIRU;  </P> <P> MAN, SON TO FACE ANIMAL ABUSE TRIAL  </P> <P> A Piru man and his son were bound over for trial on charges of felony animal  abuse after a motion to suppress evidence was denied by Municipal Judge John J.  Hunter during a preliminary hearing Friday.  </P> <P> Alfred (Dale) Beem and his son Robert are scheduled to be tried in Superior  Court on Oct. 12.  </P> <P> Defense lawyers sought to eliminate testimony and pictures taken by Ventura  County Humane Society officers and a sheriff's deputy because they seized more  than 100 emaciated horses, sheep and rabbits from corrals on Piru Canyon Road  without a warrant.  </P> <P> Hunter ruled that while there was no precedent declaring animal neglect an  emergency, Deputy Todd Hawley's observations gave officers probable cause to  enter the property, and their actions were proper since "exigent circumstances"  do not require a warrant.  </P> <P> "This is a place of chaos," Hunter said as he examined pictures of the site.  "There is sufficient cause to believe the defendants may be guilty."  </P> <P> Evidence was also given by Beem's younger son Michael, who testified although  Hunter warned him that he could incriminate himself by answering questions from  Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pachowicz.  </P> <P> The younger Beem said all the animals were in fair condition when he left the  Piru Canyon residence on April 20 to care for his grandparents.  </P> <P> Veterinarian Betsy Connolly testified that the animals' deterioration from fair  to starved condition must have occurred within a few months before they were  impounded by the Humane Society May 31.

			<p>BFN     [Text] As is known, President Milan Kucan is scheduled to  depart for a visit to Zagreb at the beginning of next week. It  is supposed to be an unofficial visit even though Croatia has  tried, with the statements of its ambassador in Ljubljana,  Miljenko Zagar, to portray it as official talks between  Presidents Kucan and Tudjman.    We have learned unofficially that in a letter to Prime  Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek President Kucan warned that it would  be good if all offices responsible for Slovene foreign policy  were to reexamine the purpose of his visit to Zagreb together  with the government. In mid-May, after President Kucan received  the invitation from Zagreb, the Slovene foreign minister was  still in favor of the visit. However, since then circumstances  have changed. In the letter to Drnovsek, Kucan warned that  since October 1992, when he and Croatian President Tudjman last  met, there have been no meetings at presidential level. Despite  this, the question arises as to what the scope of Kucan's visit  to Zagreb could be, since the latest events have shown a lack of  any sign of mutual desire to resolve outstanding problems  between the two countries through consensus.    In his letter, Kucan cited the example of Secovlje and the  construction of a border crossing there in spite of the protest  by Prime Minister Drnovsek to Croatian Prime Minister Valentic.  A decision about the visit will be known in the next few days  when the government's official position becomes known.    President Kucan and Prime Minister Drnovsek discussed this  subject this afternoon.</p>

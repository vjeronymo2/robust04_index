			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] President-elect Dr. Armando Calderon Sol has pledged  to fully investigate all complaints of corruption against any of  his cabinet ministers. During an interview for the "Up-to-Date"  newscast, the ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] leader  expressed his resolve to place in court custody all individuals  found guilty of corruption.    Dr. Calderon Sol has only one goal regarding this issue: to  combat institutionalized corruption regardless of its cost to  the government. According to the president-elect, he cannot  betray the people who supported him during the past elections.  Therefore, he says, he will get to the bottom of all complaints  of corruption.    [Begin Calderon Sol recording] If there are even rumors  against any official, we will conduct a full investigation and  place that person in court custody for investigation. [end  recording]    Corruption, says the future president, will be fought at all  levels, but especially in those areas involving goods, services,  and public bids. Calderon Sol also intends to put an end to  government official's involvement in organized crime.    [Begin Calderon Sol recording] If any administration  officials are thus involved, regardless of who they may be, we  will apply the law and break this circle of organized crime.  [end recording]    Calderon Sol, who will take office in June, warned that  during his term he will manage public funds carefully and  strengthen the development of the National Civilian Police,  which emerged from the peace agreements.</p>

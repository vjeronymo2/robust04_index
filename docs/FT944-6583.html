			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Companies liable for employees' price-fixing deals - Legal Briefs The English House of Lords has overturned the Appeal Court's 1992 ruling in the Smiths' Concrete case, in which it said companies were not liable for their employees' breaches of competition law. In 1991 Smiths and three other ready-mixed concrete companies operating in Oxfordshire were fined by the Restrictive Trade Practices Court for allowing their representatives to enter into price- fixing and market-sharing arrangements. On the basis that the companies had expressly instructed employees not to participate in anti-competitive arrangements, and were therefore 'not party to the agreements', the Appeal Court allowed their appeals. The House of Lords has now overturned those decisions. The Law Lords said that to rule otherwise would allow companies to benefit from restrictive trade practices outlawed by Parliament if the arrangements were made by employees and had been forbidden by 'higher management'. An employee acting for the company within the scope of his or her employment was the company, they said. The Lords also described the fines of up to Pounds 25,000 as 'derisory'. Competition lawyers say the decision points up the need for companies to adopt effective competition compliance programmes or risk heavier penalties in future.</p>

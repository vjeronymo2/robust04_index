			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Reprieve for Swan Hunter hangs in balance THE SLIM hope that Swan Hunter might continue in business as a shipbuilder hung in the balance last night as all-day talks over the fate of the three Type 23 frigates it was fitting out when it went into receivership on Thursday ended inconclusively. After eight hours of negotiations with the Ministry of Defence in London, Mr Mark Homan, senior Price Waterhouse UK Corporate Recovery partner, said: 'It will be apparent from the fact that the receivers have been at the Ministry of Defence all day that the matter is extremely complex.' Mr Homan hoped a further statement could be made over the weekend. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is to meet Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, and Mr Nick Brown, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, next week about the plight of Swans. Labour yesterday published a list of suppliers which depend on the ship-builder for business. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that 341 companies in 184 Conservative constituencies were suppliers to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipyard which went into receivership after failing to win a vital helicopter carrier contract. The range of companies supplying Swan Hunter extended even to Huntingdon - Mr Major's constituency. Altogether, some 900 companies are thought likely to suffer lost business if the Swan Hunter yard closes down. The receivers were last night holding talks with the Department of Employment. Hope that Swan Hunter can continue as a shipbuilder hangs on whether the frigates, worth about Pounds 400m, can be kept on the Tyne for fitting out. They are due to be handed over to the Royal Navy between the end of this year and late 1994, when Swan's current order books runs out. Continuing fitting-out on the frigates would allow Swans to retain several hundred of its current 2,200 workforce into next year, enhancing its chances of winning further contracts and making the company more attractive to any potential buyer. The company yesterday sent off a clarified tender for an attack craft for the Oman government. Yesterday, as speculation continued on how the rival tenders came to be Pounds 50m apart, the MoD insisted the carrier bidding process had been fairly handled, despite claims that Swan had to increase its final bid substantially to accommodate additional features required by the ministry. Mr Robin Ashby, public relations consultant to Swan Hunter until Thursday's receivership, said the tenders for the carrier from Swan and VSEL last year were both within Pounds 5m of a target price of Pounds 170m. But, after the government confirmed in March it was to place the order and asked the rivals to 'clarify' their bids, the MoD, Mr Ashby said, asked Swan for additional features. These contributed to its tender rising to Pounds 210m. VSEL's final bid, he said, was around Pounds 160m. The MoD confirmed it had offered advice to both bidders as they prepared their best and final offers. It said this was normal practice. The MoD said both tenderers had the same specification. 'We run totally fair competition,' it said.</p>

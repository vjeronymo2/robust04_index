			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A three-man  consultation delegation from the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) arrived today in Pyongyang, capital of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Following an agreement between the DPRK and IAEA on May 21,  the delegation, headed by Demetrius Perricos, director of the  IAEA's division of operations in the department of safeguards,  had made the trip to to engage in talks on the refueling of a 5  megawatt fuel rod in a nuclear reaction center at Yongbyon.    Demetrius told reporters that the delegation, which is  scheduled to stay here till May 28, will only talk about  technical issues of replacing nuclear fuel rods.    He stressed that IAEA had not rejected DPRK's invitation to  observe the replacement of the fuel rod, but the agency expected  to carry out overall inspection on DPRK's nuclear equipment.    Since its demand had not been met, the IAEA did not deny  that  the delegation would hold negotiations with the DPRK about the  precondition of nuclear inspections, Demetrius added.    He said that there were considerable disagreements between  the IAEA and the DPRK on the issue of inspecting nuclear  equipment and he hoped that the possibility of carrying out the  program would emerge after the negotiations.</p>

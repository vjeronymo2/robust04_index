			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Four-year ride past decay in Docklands: Construction will start today on the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee line extension linking east London to the West End The gateway to the Jubilee line extension, the flagship transport project for the London Docklands, is marked by a pile of rubble in one of the capital's poorest areas. The hoarding around the site - derelict for eight years - gives no clue that by the turn of the century this will be Bermondsey Underground station, capable of handling 4,000 passengers an hour. There are no planning notices or developers' advertisements, just graffiti urging residents to 'Vote BNP'. This is the boundary between Bermondsey and the 5,000 acres controlled by the London Docklands Development Corporation. To the east, six further stations are planned - Canada Water, Canary Wharf, North Greenwich, Canning Town, West Ham and Stratford - as part of the Pounds 1.8bn project to rejuvenate the area by providing a fast link to London's West End. A journey along the route reveals that although funding has been approved for the link, enthusiasm in Thames-side communities has been tempered by the realisation that benefits will not emerge until well into the next century. In Bermondsey Mr George Dunk, councillor for the Riverside ward which includes the station site, says that beyond injecting confidence and creating work for construction workers, the best that can be hoped is that more tenants will exercise the right to buy and shopkeepers will extend their leases. But there is optimism that at the next two stations - Canada Water (the interchange planned with the East London line) and Canary Wharf - the Jubilee extension will fulfil its promise of rejuvenation. That optimism is based on expansion plans for developments such as the Surrey Quays shopping centre and the Greenland Dock residential development. At Canada Water, the LDDC is preparing to release for development 20 acres of land which had been held back pending the Jubilee line decision. At Canary Wharf, Mirror Group Newspapers and London Underground have announced plans to move in, taking total occupancy levels to 50 per cent. Any rejuvenation will not take place overnight. Mr Roger Squire, assistant chief executive at the LDDC, warns that the area still has a lot of empty office property 'so the benefits will take some time to feed through'. In residential property, 'significant price movements will not come about until the line is almost open'. According to chartered surveyors Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, there is still 5m sq ft of vacant office space in the LDDC area, enough to accommodate 25,000 workers. Mr Roger Parsons, partner at the surveyors' Docklands office, also warns that the escalating costs of the project - up almost 80 per cent since 1989  -could mean some stations might not be built. North Greenwich, the stop after Canary Wharf, is in doubt, he says. British Gas, which owns the site on the Blackwall peninsula, is still negotiating with London Underground about the estimated Pounds 30m construction costs. From Canning Town, Jubilee line trains will run on the surface next to British Rail tracks. But one local employer, who asked not to be named, says bringing Canning Town and West Ham within 20 minutes of the West End will have little effect on the area. 'We really needed help 10 years ago. It seems to me they are creating a commuter zone for the Docklands but I don't see it helping business much.' The view from West Ham station is a bleak one. Canada Tower, the showpiece of Canary Wharf, is visible across acres of derelict land punctuated only by electricity pylons and vacant industrial units. Mr Parsons expects Stratford to develop as a business location for the Docklands. 'Before the Jubilee announcement this was going to be another Croydon, a satellite with cheap accommodation,' he says. 'The extension and the revitalisation of Canary Wharf have pulled Docklands from the brink of possible obscurity. But it will take a long time.'</p>

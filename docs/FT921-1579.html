			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major attacks trade union plans MR JOHN MAJOR last night widened his assault on Labour's prospectus for the 1990s by calling the party's proposals for trade union legislation 'industrial euthanasia'. The prime minister also used his speech at a rally in Sheffield to reiterate the desire to create a 'classless society' which he expressed when he became Conservative party leader in November 1990. Labour, Mr Major said, would allow secondary strikes, prevent employers from obtaining immediate court orders to stop unlawful strikes and take away from individual union members the right not to take part in industrial action. By contrast the Tories would ensure that unions gave at least a week's notice of a strike and give the public new rights against the disruption of public services by illegal wildcat strikes. Mr Major said Mr Kinnock's party remained the same deep down despite policy changes. 'Labour are like Sunday converts. They come to church on the Sabbath, but boil the missionaries the rest of the week,' he said. Mr Major attacked remarks by Mr Neil Kinnock yesterday morning in which he committed Labour to reintroducing credit controls. The policy was, he said, a typical socialist answer. 'Form a queue. Wait for the state to tell you when you can buy a home. Wait for the state to tell you when you can sell your house to someone who wants to buy it.' Mr Major also claimed conservatism rather than socialism was the way of breaking down social barriers. He highlighted his vision of 'a country in which everyone is able to develop their talent to the full'. He said: 'Our modern Tory party is for each and every person in Britain. We want to banish for ever the artificial divisions in our society.' Mr Major brushed aside criticism that the Tories' recent campaigning on Labour's tax plans had been negative. He said: 'The knives are out for Labour . . . in recent days I'm told that Labour have been calling our campaign negative - good. That means our attacks are getting home, that means they don't like it.' Mr Major added: 'The only negative thing in this campaign are their policies for Britain.'</p>

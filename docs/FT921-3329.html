			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Markets decline further on fears of Tory defeat A FRESH wave of pre-election jitters affected the London financial markets yesterday, as investors began to face up to the possibility of Labour forming the next government. Shares, sterling and government gilt-edged securities all continued their losses of earlier in the week, amid rumours that a batch of opinion polls at the weekend would show ebbing support for the Conservatives. The FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,476.0, down 17.3, to show a fall of nearly 100 points over the past three days, while the pound dipped half a pfennig to DM2.855 and gilts lost  1/2 point for a decline of 1 1/2 points on the week. The bleak mood in the City was partly in response to Tuesday's Budget statement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, which many judged had done little to help the Conservatives' chances in the general election on April 9. The subdued mood of investors was deepened by the prospect of economic data due next week. There is particular anxiety about unemployment statistics due on Thursday, which are expected to show a further 35,000 job losses last month. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, the London investment house, said: 'A flat economy, an unexciting Budget and a lag in opinion polls - it hardly adds up to a good start for the Tories in the campaign.' The week's slide in share prices started on Tuesday night, after the market was disturbed by the detail in Mr Lamont's statement which indicated that the economy was in a worse state than had been expected, leading to the need for a large rise in government borrowing. The disquiet pushed the FT-SE index, which had risen on Monday and initially on Tuesday, to a net fall on the week of 57 points. Currency investors switched funds out of sterling, which over the week shed nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark. Against the dollar, the pound dropped just over half a cent over the week, closing last night in London at Dollars 1.7125. Its trade weighted index ended unchanged on the day at 89.7, which compares with 89.9 at the opening on Monday. In New York, sterling fell further, closing at DM2.8497 and Dollars 1.7075. On the London money market, the three-month interbank rate, which shadows base rates, was quoted yesterday at about 10 13/16 per cent, a rise of  3/16 of a percentage point on the day and  3/8 of a point on the week.</p>

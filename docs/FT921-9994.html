			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Why cheating does not pay - The taxman will catch up with you eventually THERE IS NOTHING wrong, nothing criminal and nothing illegal about opening a numbered Swiss bank account or holding investments abroad in a nominee name. Under UK tax law you are not prevented from doing anything - provided you tell the Revenue. If what you do is not taxable you have nothing to fear. For example, if you are UK resident and non-UK domiciled (ie you live in the UK but it is not your home country) with careful planning you can legally avoid income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax  - with the Revenue's full knowledge. All income and gains on which you are liable to pay tax, whether in the UK or abroad, must be notified to the Revenue within 12 months whether you are asked to make a return or not. If you do not, you could find yourself liable not only for the tax on the profits, but also interest for late payment and a penalty of an amount equal to the tax foregone. In practice, the maximum penalty is rarely imposed and depends on your co-operation with the Revenue. In spite of the fact that more money would be payable by not declaring tax than by declaring it, there are still some who take the bullish attitude that what the Revenue does not know, the Revenue cannot tax. But remember: the Revenue has access to all your tax returns from previous years and is encouraged to have its ears to the ground and its eyes everywhere. If, suddenly, there is a drop in level of investment income you declare but your circumstances stay the same, or your investment income remains the same but your circumstances improve, the Inspector could become suspicious. Inspectors are expected to read newspapers, check trade directories, scour the register of local planning applications and anything else which could indicate an unexplained change in circumstances of a taxpayer. They are also expected to have an open door to any tittle tattle, whether from scorned spouses, discarded lovers, aggrieved employees, envious colleagues or covetous neighbours. Whichever way Inspectors are tipped off, once they suspect you have not declared all your income or capital gains their powers of obtaining information are awesome. The first thing Inspectors will do is their homework. They will check whether the information given is, or could be, correct. The Revenue has a formidable array of investigative powers at its disposal. It can obtain information from banks, building societies, HM Land Registry, ship/aircraft registries, DSS and tax accountants. It can also require any person to produce any document in their possession which the Inspector may suspect contains information about the tax liability of the person it is investigating. Where the Revenue suspects that assets have been transferred abroad, it can ask not only for documents but can also ask anyone anything which could give the Inspector information relating to the taxpayer's tax liability. To prevent any complicity, there are criminal sanctions which can be levied against the adviser, confidante or friend who deliberately supplies false particulars to the Revenue. He or she can be prosecuted for 'cheating'. Not very long ago a well-known London solicitor provided false particulars to the Revenue out of compassion for a sick, elderly client - and was prosecuted for cheating and fined Pounds 10,000. A common ploy if Inspectors have reason to suspect that there are profits which have not been declared is to make an assessment on you to the best of its judgment. It is then up to you to prove that you are not liable to pay this tax. This shifts the onus of proof to you, the taxpayer. If Inspectors suspect substantial undeclared tax, or if you are not co-operating, they will usually read you the Hansard Extract (so called after an answer in Parliament given in 1944) to encourage you to co-operate  -it sets out the policy of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue in regard to instituting criminal proceedings for alleged frauds on the Revenue. You will then be asked whether your business accounts and tax returns are correct and complete. Your answers must be made in writing and signed. In addition, the Inspectors of Taxes will usually require you to list all the bank and building society accounts you have power to operate, to list all your assets, and make you certify that you have not missed out anything. If you delay in replying, or give inaccurate, misleading, negligent or fraudulent replies, at the very least you could be fined. At worst you could be sent to prison under the charge of submitting false accounts with the intention of defrauding the Revenue or, if a forgery is discovered, for forgery. So, let us assume that your German uncle dies leaving you Pounds 250,000 in a numbered Swiss bank account. You are now obliged to inform the Inspector of Taxes of the profits on your windfall. You decide, for whatever reason, not to tell the Inspector straightaway, but to tell all if ever you are asked. The years slip by, and the Inland Revenue does not ask you any leading questions. The fund grows substantially - as does the amount of tax due. Before letting this situation continue, think what could happen in the future. You could get divorced; you could require a further injection of cash into your business; your business could fail; you could upset an employee; or irritate an employer; your friends and family could turn against you - and just when you do not need any further problems, the Revenue, like a sleeping Rottweiler, awakes. You must then disclose everything to the Revenue, and pay the tax and penalties and interest. After all that, you may find that your German inheritance is substantially less than if you had declared it to the Revenue at the outset and paid tax in the normal way. Even if you manage to escape disaster and the Revenue during your lifetime, you may be storing up untold miseries for your children, who may not only have to pay inheritance tax but substantial back tax as well when they bring the money into the UK or spend it. The worst thing of all is when you die leaving money abroad but no record of where the money is or who is holding it. You may have succeeded in saving tax during your lifetime but left nothing for your family, benefiting only the Swiss banking system.

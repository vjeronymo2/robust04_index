			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Classic FM's chatty debut - Radio ON MONDAY morning, I reckoned I had stayed too long with Classic FM's debut  -there was nothing amiss with the broadcast, but it lacked variety. The trail of short classical-music extracts, mostly familiar, had no theme. Yet reflection reveals this as intrinsically an advantage, for the new classical music channel is not to be thought about, simply listened to. If I had been driving, I might have liked it; though, then I could not have entered the mini-competitions that peppered the morning. There was news hourly, on the hour, a racing tip, relatively few commercials. Henry Kelly's chatty presentation is not my cup of tea, and his announcing less informative than the BBC's. At midday he gave way to Susannah Simons, not so consciously unsophisticated. She had a brief everyday talk with Jeremy Isaacs about programming and casting at Covent Garden. Subsequent mornings have tended to follow a similar pattern; we may settle down. My main complaint is one's ignorance of what is coming, though the Radio Times gives an outline of the programmes. On Sunday, Sir Roy Strong's fiery first of four talks on Radio 4 about Ministering to the Arts recalled, among much else, how the Arts Council's missionary fervour under Keynes, and Jennie Lee as the first arts minister, subsided into later policies of official restriction rather than encouragement. The Arts Council, under a Tory squeeze nobly restrained by Lord St John of Fawsley, had to slide support over to new Regional Arts Associations, each Pounds 1 of bounty required to be matched by Pounds 1 of local authority's. Other things being equal, Sir Roy reckoned that David Mellor at the department of the national heritage might prove likely to boost the government's concern with arts welfare. Meanwhile, he still has much to tell us. Radio 3 this week marks the end of the Proms, the cricket and the drama Summer Season. The drama season included I always take long walks, that I spoke for here lately, as the better of Sunday's two plays - a monologue for a keen cricketer's wife (Judi Dench), who finds better things to do than go to his matches. I need say no more, save that Peter Tinniswood's script is as moving as it is amusing, and Dame Judi's performance beyond criticism. John Tydeman directed. I do try to enjoy Radio 5's young people's programmes, but it is not easy. On Monday, STARS, adapted by a quartet from Russell Hunter's books, deals with sixth-formers and their families. The first instalment (of 20) told us who they are and how they live. Plot was signalled at the end. Dexter Fletcher plays the lead, direction is by another quartet. Then came a reading of Anne Fine's Crummy Mummy and Me, a schoolgirl's diary of life with her slapdash Mummy and respectable Gran. Mummy's boyfriend is called Crusher Maggot, and a dispute with Gran arises when she dyes her hair royal blue - solved when rain washes the dye out. They all came back each night of the week. I did not. Young people of another kind are only in the title of Radio 4's Frenchmen Desire Good Children on Wednesday, a tour round the French quarter of New Orleans. Some folk declared it the most desirable place on earth, some thought it shabby. The Italians were taking over, complete with Mafia. Amateur female wrestling was on, and 'miracle cures' from voodoo priests. But the good French children were moving away, to Atlanta. There was no presenter, you heard what you heard, and Piers Plowright, the producer, offered no conclusions. 'We're not exactly where we started from,' said our occasional guide finally, 'but this is where it ends,' and maybe that is the conclusion. It was fun, yet I doubt if I would find my way on that side of Canal Street.</p>

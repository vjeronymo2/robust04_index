			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Iron fist in a velvet glove: Is an ex-journalist and Mandarin scholar the right man to run a UK clearing bank For a man of 41, Mr Martin Taylor has acquired a remarkable reputation in the British business community. The image is an unusual one: old Etonian, Oxford Chinese scholar, editor of the FT's Lex Column, chairman of Courtaulds Textiles. Hugely bright and hugely endowed with boyish charm. For all his success, a man without enemies. He may be about to acquire some. As the new chief executive of Barclays Bank, he will enter a politically charged and perhaps hostile environment. Clearing bankers tend to be clannish and conservative. What will they make of an ex-journalist and manufacturer being parachuted in above them? He has another problem. His appointment is the result of highly public pressure from shareholders on Barclays and its chairman, Mr Andrew Buxton, to split the roles of chairman and chief executive. In his new role, Mr Taylor will have a chairman and deputy chairman above him and three divisional managing directors below him. What exactly will his function be? How does he know he is not being put in as a sop to shareholders? 'You just decide to trust people,' he said yesterday. 'I'm absolutely sure they want someone to do the job. I think they know I'm not the sort of person who'd hang around otherwise.' The last bit is characteristically adroit: the hint of steel, charmingly expressed. It is almost an effort to recall that as head of Courtaulds Textiles, he achieved his remarkable success at least partly by ruthlessly closing factories. 'That's not a process that I relish,' he says. 'It's one of the most disagreeable things I've had to do.' He is a paradox in other respects. Financial journalists tend to be feckless folk: the better they are, the less likely they are to be able to run a whelk stall. Mr Taylor was a brilliant journalist. He has gone on to be a brilliant hands-on manager. It is no less paradoxical that in the bitchy world of journalism, he is recalled as being both very clever and very popular. He is very fast in thought and speech: at one stage as a young man he underwent speech therapy, since his attempts to express the rapidity of his thought made him at times unintelligible. But however quick he is, the size of his latest step must leave room for apprehension. Well, yes, he says. There are areas of terror. 'The main one is that there's a huge organisation here and I don't know what goes on inside it. But I've been used to managing a business with lots of people in it. When I took over at Courtaulds Textiles in 1987 it had 35,000 employees. That's not nearly as big as Barclays, but it's of a size where plainly you can't know everyone.' Of course, he concedes, there is a risk that the culture will reject him. 'If I behave stupidly, yes. There are dead certain ways of getting up people's noses, like not listening and pretending you know more than they do.' But his ignorance of banking, he argues, is not complete. 'I've been interested in banking and credit all my life. I've always been seen in the textiles industry as a City man. The irony is that now I'm here at Barclays, everyone says 'what the hell are you doing here? You're a manufacturer'. Perhaps I'm just a split personality.' He also claims another qualification, if a slightly indirect one. High street banking is a form of retailing. Nearly a third of Courtaulds Textiles' sales go to Marks and Spencer, the formidably successful retail chain. 'I've been working very closely with Marks and Spencer for 10 years,' Mr Taylor says. 'What I've learned about from Marks is the way it thinks of its customers, and the way it sees the world through their eyes. I sense the banks are starting to do the same.' Mr Taylor might also with justice argue that the jump from Courtaulds Textiles to Barclays is no bigger than the jump from the Lex Column to Courtaulds. But there is one striking difference. When he went to Courtaulds, Mr Taylor went as the protege of Sir Christopher Hogg. (Sir Christopher, now chairman of Reuters and the Courtaulds chemical empire, is to replace Mr Taylor as chairman of Courtaulds Textiles.) Age difference apart, the two men are rather similar: thoughtful and intellectual in approach, courteous in demeanour. Sir Christopher was undisputed master of Courtaulds, and could allow the young Taylor to blossom under his tuition. Indeed, Mr Taylor's move to Barclays has been materially assisted by Sir Christopher's willingness to step back into his shoes. 'There's been tremendous co-operation between the two companies,' Barclays' chairman remarked yesterday, 'with Christopher Hogg at the heart of that.' At Barclays, by contrast, Mr Taylor may be entering a more hostile world. He can doubtless rely on the support of Mr Buxton, the chairman, whose position recently has come under fire. If Mr Buxton's position were as unchallengeable as Sir Christopher's, he would not have needed Mr Taylor in the first place. As it is, Mr Taylor faces three main challenges. The first is whether he will be able to work amicably and effectively with the other senior executives. The second is whether he will be able to improve the quality of management, both within its traditional banking operations, and its BZW investment bank. The last is whether he will to agree the correct strategic decisions with Mr Buxton over the next five years. The challenge of fitting into the bank's senior management structure is considerable. Apart from Mr Buxton and Sir Peter Middleton, the deputy chairman, Mr Taylor will be trying to work with the chief executives of the three divisions: banking, BZW and the technology-related service businesses. The relationship with Sir Peter has been the subject of most speculation, since he is the one senior executive who will not report directly to Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor is at pains to downplay such talk, pointing out that Sir Peter has already offered to hand over his main area of executive responsibility within the bank as a whole, its management of risk. 'When I saw Peter last week, he said he wanted to hand it over and I said 'not yet please',' he says. He also argues that the formal structure is less important than the working relationship that will evolve. Mr Buxton makes a similar point. 'We actually wrote the job descriptions for myself and the chief executive down when we started the search, but when it comes to the crunch, you cross the lines of whose job something is all the time,' he said. Yet some observers believe the potential for Mr Buxton to seek guidance on strategy from either Sir Peter or Mr Taylor when difficult questions arise could be a source of tension. Mr Taylor's relationship with the heads of the operating divisions is crucial to his second challenge of improving management. The fact that he will be in charge of seasoned - and older - bank executives may have played some part in Mr Buxton's preference for someone from outside banking rather than a directly comparable executive. He says that the bank had to find someone who would command instant respect. 'I veered towards having a non-banker, but someone with really good management experience that could be seen in his track record,' he says. Yet the complexity of Barclays means that Mr Taylor will have to come to grips with more than one different business. At the same time, he will have to avoid offending executives such as Mr David Band and Mr Alastair Robinson, the heads of the BZW and banking divisions. Mr Taylor displays the most excitement when talking about the task of raising the standards of customer service. 'It is stupendously difficult, maybe the most difficult challenge of the job,' he says. He arrives as the bank is experimenting with new ways of delivering services such as telephone banking, and concern among senior managers that this could be upset by a new chief executive. He also faces the problem that some staff could regard his record as hatchet man at Courtaulds Textiles askance. There is also the question of whether he will interfere counter-productively. He is cautious on this. 'It may be that the banking division is already doing everything that could be done. I would be surprised,' he says. The task of managing BZW is entirely different, since the investment bank comprises many talented but temperamental dealers and advisers. Mr Taylor argues that no British bank has yet discovered the full secret of managing a securities operation. 'These are relatively new kinds of organisation, and there's no template for them,' he says. 'Some people think there's a magic ingredient called management which can be added. I am sure management has a role, but I am not sure what it is. I am looking forward to finding out.' Others are less sanguine. A senior executive at another bank says the new chief executive will have a difficult task working with Sir Peter Middleton, made worse by the fact that Sir Peter has an executive niche at BZW. Internal tensions, he claims, are being caused at Barclays by the fact that some old banking operations, including the treasury division, have been put under BZW control. 'It is getting a bigger and bigger problem,' he says. 'It is the tail wagging the dog.' These are questions which Mr Taylor will face immediately, and the answers may emerge quickly. But the crucial difficulty of judging his performance at Barclays will be that banks are inherently cyclical businesses. The bank is in the middle of an upswing in earnings which will probably last until 1996 as the bad debt problems from loans made in the late 1980s recede and operating performance picks up. Mr Taylor accepts that he can hardly claim much credit for what happens next. 'There is no way that someone coming in like me will affect profits over the next 18 months,' he admits. Yet there is little doubt that Barclays faces large strategic questions that will determine how well its profits are sustained. Lloyds' decision to divest poorly-performing business in the 1980s helped protect it in recession. Mr Buxton agrees with this. 'There are one or two strategic decisions every 10 years that can make a big difference,' he says. Barclays made a big error in the late 1980s by expanding property lending. But he says that the bank made strategic errors in growing unwisely from the 1960s and 1970s onward. 'Our UK bank has produced some pretty high returns, but they were wasted in some places overseas,' he says. Yet the division of labour mapped out between Mr Buxton and Mr Taylor lays primary responsibility for strategy with the chairman. Mr Buxton says Mr Taylor will play a far larger role. 'Strategy will be very actively worked out between us. It is not something a chairman can decide by sitting in his office, writing it on a sheet of paper and handing it out to the chief executive to implement,' he insists. So Mr Taylor faces a curious mixture of tasks over various timescales. It will keep him busy for a while: but not, one assumes, for ever. It is a curious instance of his methodical approach that he had already decided to move on from his executive role at Courtaulds Textiles before he was even approached by Barclays. At the outset, he had given himself seven years for the job, and his time there was coming to an end. So how long does he give himself at Barclays? Ten years, he says. 'One of the nice things about not being ridiculously old is being able to come to a place like this and say I've got plenty of time. Personally, that is. How much time the market will give me is another question.' And then what? Chairman of Barclays? Ruler of the world? 'Come back and ask me in the year 2004', he says. And in any case, the date is not to be taken too literally. 'Ten years,' says the ex-Mandarin scholar, 'is Chinese for a very long time.'</p>

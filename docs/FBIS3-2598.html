			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese president and  Party Chief Jiang Zemin stressed here today that all members,  especially officials, of the Communist Party, should spend more  time and effort on study.    The general secretary of the Central Committee of the  Chinese  Communist Party was speaking at a seminar of people attending a  four-day national party school working conference which ended  here today.    The seminar was presided over by Hu Jingtao, Standing  Committee member of the Political Bureau of the party Central  Committee.    Jiang said that with more efforts devoted to study, all the  party's work would go more smoothly.    The point of study, he said, was to have a good grasp of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In  addition, he said, all members of the party should make great  efforts to learn the basics of a socialist market economy and  related policies, laws and regulations.    They should also know something of modern science and  technology, and learn from the experience of Chinese history,  especially modern history, and the international history of  socialism.    Jiang noted that the Communist Party had always paid  attention to study, especially when the whole party faced a new  situation and fresh tasks. The great achievements that China  had made during the past 15 years were to a large degree the  fruits of study, he said.    "A blueprint for a new economic structure was drawn up  through the decisions made at the Third Plenary Session of the  14th Party Central Committee last year," he said. "Our reform,  covering economy, politics, culture and social life, is making a  rapid progress. The rapidly changing situation presents to us  many new problems and thorny questions and the difficulty in our  work has increased. The way out is to admit our weaknesses and  find solutions through profound studies," he said.    The general secretary reiterated at the seminar that while  studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, one should take into his heart its  essence -- mind emancipation and seeking truth from facts -- and  study hard to grasp a dialectical, historical, materialist and  scientific world outlook and methodology.    He called on all local party schools to further observe the  policy of integrating theory with practice in their teaching.  Party schools should, adjusting to the new situation, improve  their education quality to a higher level.</p>

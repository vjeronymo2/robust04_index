			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / IoD warns of tax blow to business confidence Confidence about economic prospects is rising but many business leaders are worried by the prospect of next month's tax increases, an Institute of Directors survey says today. Mr Peter Morgan, the institute director-general, said the economic upturn was continuing although 'muted'. He said business confidence could be expected to dip before the tax increases, which are likely to depress consumer spending and company order books. The poll of 302 companies in manufacturing and services indicates that sales volumes have risen since December although the rate of increase in orders and profits has fallen. According to the survey, conducted last month, 53 per cent of companies were more optimistic about the economy than six months previously. That compared with 47 per cent in the last survey in December, although it is well below the 65 per cent recorded in August. Nearly two-thirds of the companies said they were more hopeful about their own business's prospects than six months before. Only 58 per cent gave this answer in December. More than three-fifths of companies had increased sales volumes, slightly above the figure at the end of last year. The poll showed order books continuing to expand, though at a slower rate than in December, with 57 per cent of companies reporting increased orders last month compared with 58 per cent in December. Profits were rising, though more slowly than last autumn, and this was a 'cause for concern', the institute said. Just over half of the companies that responded to the poll said profits were up, compared with 55 per cent in December last year and 57 per cent in October. The proportion of company investment directed to what the institute calls the 'key areas' of research and development, machinery, training and advertising has fallen slightly since December. These declines have been offset by increases in cash spent on acquisitions, buildings and working capital, leaving overall investment levels unchanged. Cashflow remained a big problem for two out of five companies while lack of demand was rated as a serious difficulty by nearly a third. Prospects for employment were considered slightly worse with 37 per cent of companies saying they were likely to take on more workers compared with 39 per cent in the December survey. Consumers are increasing borrowing, especially for cars and other expensive items, says a report today from the Finance and Leasing Association, which represents companies providing credit to individuals and businesses. The association said its figures indicated that next month's tax increases had not sapped people's enthusiasm for taking out loans, although it was concerned about weakness in companies' investment spending.

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Food: Magnifique] The crepe - Street Food ASKED TO nominate one dish as the best example of French culinary ingenuity, it would be difficult to find anything from that enormous repertoire more versatile than the crepe. They are easy to make. All you need for the basic batter is eggs, flour, salt and milk and the patience to let it stand for two hours. The only limit on quantity is the size of your mixing bowl. They can be served both sweet and savoury; filled with ham, mushrooms or onions at the beginning of the meal, or lemon juice and sugar at the end; or as a main course stuffed with crab meat and served with a salad. Crepes have also managed to jump social strata with the greatest of ease. They can taste wonderful when bought hot from a French street corner stand where they cost between FFr12 and Ffr18, depending on the filling. You can pay five times that much for the privilege of eating crepes suzettes. These, according to Escoffier's recipe, contain tangerine juice and Curacao and are mixed - and cooked  - in the dining room. Crepes highlight the peasant, religious and regional aspects of so much of the best of French cooking. Originally, they were confined to being served on Roman Catholic holidays and were seen as symbols of happiness and good fortune. As the pancake was turned in the skillet, the family would gather round and touch the handle of the pan, coin in hand. Practically every French region has its own crepe: they are known as tantimolles in Champagne, landimolles in Picardy or sanciaux in Limousin. But the French region for crepes remains western France, particularly Brittany and the city of Quimper with its crepes dentelles (lace pancakes). It was in Brittany 26 years ago that I fell under their spell. Reluctantly, I had been sent to stay with a local family in the hope that I might pass my French O-level. As we walked the streets of Rennes, my senses were assailed and language ceased to a problem. I can still remember that first crepe. Many others followed. What surprised me was not only how good they tasted but also how readily they were available. In England, crepes/pancakes were still an annual treat, eaten on Shrove Tuesday. There was never really enough batter for us all and there was only one combination of flavours on offer - lemon juice and sugar. In France, though, any combination was possible: filled with chocolate spread, apricot or strawberry jam, cherries or almond cream. And there was even the possibility of combining one forbidden fruit with another and sprinkling Grand Marnier over the lot. No breakfast menu in America is complete without a pancake section. They are offered in all shapes, sizes and flavours - filled with blueberries, cranberries or maple syrup or with bacon, ham and sausages on the side. In London, after a walk on Hampstead Heath, you can join the queue at the stand run by La Creperie de Hampstead. But the taste of that very first crepe still lingers. Whenever I arrive in France, I look out for a stall, partly because it is such an evocative symbol of the country and partly because I would love to eat another crepe that tasted quite as good as that very first one.</p>

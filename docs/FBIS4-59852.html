			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary: "Secret Deal Between Iraq and Britain"] </F>   [Text] The committee to survey Britain's secret arms deal  with Iraq, the Scott Committee, concluded, following its formal  investigation of British Government officials. Although the  result of investigation has not been completely revealed, the  same information which have [word indistinct] proved that the  Conservative British government is involved in a big secret deal  arms with Iraq in blatant violation of law.    The attention of Judge Scott has been specially drawn to the  question as to why investigation in the trial of Matrix  Churchill company managers was stopped in November 1992 under  the government pressure. This was why the involvement of  British intelligence service, known as ME6 [as heard] had been  somehow clear. As the results of Judge Scott investigations  show ME6 organization had direct connection with Mr. Paul  Henderson, an accused manager, in the use of gathering of  informations from Iraq and that regime's arms activities.  Therefore, according to Scott committee's conclusion, the  British spying and intelligence agency could not have been  uninformed of secret arms deal between Britain and Iraq.  Furthermore, Judge Scott, in his investigations, has come to  this conclusion that the officials of the Conservative British  government, by plying with words and making use of various terms  and interpretations, have been trying to justify their act and  the breach of law.    Nevertheless, one cannot have a clear picture of the British  Government's extensive support for Iraq in the war imposed on  the Islamic Republic of Iran until the investigations of Judge  Scott are published by the end of the current year. The  Conservative British government's hostility to the Islamic  Republic of Iran was to the extend that the British Government  had agreed to be involved in illegal and secret arms deal with  Iraq. Judge Scott's investigations, which includes gathering of  200,000 documents and proofs during 400 work hours, are checked  by the British Government to prevent disclosure of secret  documents showing the government's inner corruption. But since  the Scott Committee is popular among people and there is a high  demand for the disclosure of truth, Judge Scott finds himself,  as a neutral judge, bound to respect national interest and  disclosure of truths.    For this reason at least part of the Conservative British  government's inner corruptions and the hypocritical image of its  statesmen are expected to be put to the public judgement with  the release of parts of the truth.</p>

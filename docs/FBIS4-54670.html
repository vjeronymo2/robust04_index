			<p>BFN     [Text] The political department of the Croatian Defense  Ministry has issued a statement expressing sincere regret over  an incident that took place at a Croatian Rights Party [HSP]  promotional event in Siroki Brijeg. The ministry also says it  is surprised by the insinuation, which links the ministry with  the incident. We condemn all forms of violence and firmly deny  any association with the events the HSP leadership is trying to  use to compromise the state leadership of the Republic of  Croatia and its Defense Ministry.    The short time that it took the HSP to present the incident  as an attack on the Washington agreement and to say who is to  blame -- without any evidence -- clearly shows that this media  campaign is politically motivated, aimed at presenting the  Croatian policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina as war-mongering and  duplicituous. We hope that the implementation, in the near  future, of the agreement signed between the Croat and  Bosniak-Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina will most  effectively contradict all insinuation and slanders recently  used to try to compromise the Defense Ministry and the Croatian  leadership's policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement says.    The HSP claims in a statement issued today that the  authorities in Herzegovina have banned an HSP promotional event  in Capljina. As it now expects the other scheduled events to be  banned, the HSP tour in Herzegovina is now cancelled, the  statement says among other things.</p>

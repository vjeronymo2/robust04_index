			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Observer: Prime timing Not a peep so far from Canada's Big Five banks. When US banks lift their prime lending rates, as they have this week, their Canadian counterparts aren't usually backward in coming forward. Bank economists can find any number of technical reasons, mostly to do with interest-rate spreads, why the Canadian banks won't be following suit just yet. But Observer's not fooled. The banks' year ended on October 31 and their reporting season begins next Tuesday. Several are expected to announce record profits. Royal Bank of Canada, for instance, is set to become the first Canadian bank to earn more than CDollars 1bn. Having long struggled to overcome a reputation as corporate fat cats, the last thing the banks want is to be seen, through a rise in the cost of lending, to be upsetting the small businessmen they are keen to woo. But . . . once the results season is over, the profit motive is sure to come back into its own.</p>

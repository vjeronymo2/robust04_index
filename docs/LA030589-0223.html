			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALLOUT FROM INCINERATOR PLAN  </P> <P> Bellflower City Councilman William Pendleton has proposed building a  waste-to-energy incinerator at the Puente Hills landfill. He also stated that a  lot of opinion against waste-to-energy is formed through hysteria, ignorance  and misinformation.  </P> <P> I disagree with both his proposal and his characterization.  </P> <P> Duarte has strongly opposed waste-to-energy incinerators in the Los Angeles  Basin. Among the many reasons are their contribution to air pollution and the  toxicity of their ash.  </P> <P> We have particularly opposed the incinerator previously planned for Puente  Hills. The San Gabriel Valley is already the depository of a disproportionate  share of the county's trash.  </P> <P> In the last four years, our City Council has spent literally thousands of hours  and thousands of dollars studying waste-to-energy. We have not only attended  seminars, we have sponsored them. Our experience shows that opponents of  waste-to-energy are knowledgeable, well-informed and scientifically supported.  </P> <P> While we oppose any waste-to-energy facilities in the Los Angeles Basin, we  suggest that if Pendleton really wants to build one, he build it in Bellflower.  We also urge him to use state-of-the-art technology to confine the resulting  air pollution and toxic ash to his own community.  </P> <P> JOHN E. HITT  </P> <P> Mayor of Duarte  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HOSTAGE  </P> <P> This is in response to the story of the U.S. hostages in Lebanon (Part A, March  16).  </P> <P> On the biography list of the eight hostages, there were two mistakes on Alann  Steen's background:  </P> <P> 1) He didn't meet and marry a professor from a Virginia university; he met and  married a professor named Virginia at Beirut University where he taught and was  abducted.  </P> <P> 2) Humboldt State University is not in Boston, it is in Arcata, Calif.  </P> <P> Alann Steen is my father and I would like to see The Times get the facts  straight.  </P> <P> For future articles, Steen has a 1-year-old grandson named Jordan Alann  Scardino he doesn't even know about.  </P> <P> JACKIE STEEN SCARDINO  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

Those under arrest are the brothers Felix, Jose, Livio, and  Juan Eligio Perez Garcia, as well as Juan Eligio Sanchez, whose  mistress was detained temporarily and released when she was  proven innocent of drug trafficking.    The raid took place at house No. 2 on C Street, in the Ramon  Matias Mella district.    The DNCD explained that it had received confidential  reports,  and issued instructions to one of its officers to check them  out. He remained on the trail of the subjects for two weeks,  until the purchase and detection of the nine kg, at the time of  the transaction.    While the covert agent was in view of the merchandise and  the  drug dealers selling it, a contingent suddenly invaded the  dwelling, accompanied by the assistant prosecutor.    According to the directorate, one of the brothers arrested,  Livio, was a fugitive who had been booked previously for the  same crime.    The drug traffic suppression agency claimed to have seized a  Smith &amp; Wesson pistol, a clip, and a red jeep from Sanchez.    As for the Perez Garcia brothers, it reported that a Llama  pistol with a clip was seized from Felix; a Browning with a  clip, from Jose; and a Dan Wesson and a cream-colored pickup  truck, from Livio.    The Drug Control Directorate reported that it is continuing  the investigations, in order to locate those who were acting as  contacts for those captured, noting that the latter will be  subjected to court action.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Car sales edge down in March NEW CAR sales fell to an estimated 1.34m in west Europe last month, a 1.7 per cent decline from 1.36m in March 1991. This follows three months of small year-on-year increases. According to industry estimates, new car demand in 17 west European markets in the first quarter rose 0.5 per cent to 3.69m from 3.67m a year ago, when sales were depressed by the Gulf crisis. Despite the continuing strong recovery in Spain, where sales jumped by an estimated 28.4 per cent, European demand was pulled down in March by the continuing recession in Britain. New car registrations there were 15.2 per cent lower than a year earlier, the 29th consecutive monthly year-on-year fall. Sales weakened too in Germany from last year's record levels, with an estimated 3.1 per cent fall. In the other two big volume markets, demand in Italy remains at a high level with a further increase of 1.8 per cent in March, while sales in France were virtually unchanged. Declines in several smaller markets were led by a drop of 30.6 per cent in Finland. Across west Europe March sales were lower than a year ago in 10 of the 17 markets; first quarter sales were lower in only six. The most notable gains in the first quarter were achieved by BMW, which has overhauled Mercedes-Benz, its arch domestic rival, for the first time. BMW is estimated to have increased its sales volume in the first quarter by 19.6 per cent to 118,000; Mercedes-Benz sales fell by 6.3 per cent to 116,000. BMW claimed 3.2 per cent of the market in the first quarter compared with 2.7 per cent a year ago, while Mercedes-Benz's share fell to 3.1 per cent from 3.4 per cent. Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, is losing ground dramatically and suffered a 27.2 per cent fall in sales volume in the first three months. It has been hit hard by the recession in the UK, where it continues to gain most of its sales, but even there it is drastically under-performing the depressed market. Among the big six volume carmakers, Volkswagen has opened up a record lead over its main rivals, helped by the much weaker performance of Fiat. The two French manufacturers, Renault and the Peugeot group, which includes Citroen, were the fastest growing volume carmakers in the first quarter, however, with sales increases of 8.4 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January-March 1992                               Volume   Volume    Share (%)  Share (%)                              (Units)  Change(%) Jan-Mar 92  Jan-Mar 91 TOTAL MARKET                 3,688,000   +0.5    100.0      100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen*(incl.              626,000   +3.7     17.0       16.5 Audi,SEAT&amp;Skoda) General Motors                 471,000   +1.1     12.8       12.7 (Opel/Vauxhall, US???? &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall                453,000   +1.5     12.3       12.2  -Saab**                        14,000   +1.4      0.4        0.4 Fiat (incl.

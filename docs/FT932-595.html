			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: More than one side to executives' rolling contracts story Sir, The criticism of three- year rolling term service agreements and substantial termination payments in Mr Alastair Ross Goobey's letter to chairmen of FTSE-100 companies has prompted much press comment ('The gravy train bumps along', June 22). My experience as a corporate lawyer specialising in the calculation of termination payments suggests that there is another side to this story. The starting point for calculating a payment on termination of employment is the amount that the executive would have earned during the unexpired notice period. The length of the notice period is a matter for negotiation in the same way as other benefits. Britain has a tradition of under-valuing the contribution made by the men and women responsible for generating millions of pounds of turnover and motivating thousands of employees. We are seeing many chairmen, chief executives, managing directors and finance directors being sacked for no fault of their own. In the 1980s companies needed leaders who could build businesses, integrate acquisitions and promote their companies. In the 1990s, companies need directors who can control costs, downsize sensitively and focus on core products. Many FTSE-100 companies have appreciated the importance of treating fairly those individuals who have been required to leave. There has been a well-documented shift in the control of Britain's quoted companies from private individual investors to professional fund managers. Too often such managers are judged on the basis of their short-term performance and naturally they tend to judge the companies in which they invest the same way. Time and again we are seeing institutional pressure for changes in senior management as a result of a single year's drop in profits or even a single ill-judged decision. Much nonsense is spoken on the subject of mitigation. In current economic conditions a senior executive who is required to leave a major public company in his 50s is extremely unlikely to find a comparable job. The financial and psychological impact on the executive and members of his family may be devastating. There are two sides to every story. I hope that decisions on termination payments will continue to be made in the light of all the relevant economic and legal considerations and not just on the basis of the press comments prompted by Mr Goobey's remarks.

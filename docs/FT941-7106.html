			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: Companies fear losing a shop window  -Impact on Britain / Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles now facing UK companies The Malaysian government's boycott of British goods has caused widespread alarm among UK companies. The main threat, however, seems largely confined to three industries: construction, defence and power generation. For the UK economy as a whole, the sums involved are fairly small. Malaysian government's imports of British goods total about Pounds 500m (Dollars 742.5m) a year, or less than 0.5 per cent of total UK visible exports. However, UK companies also undertake several billion pounds worth of contract work in Malaysia on projects which range from power plants to airfields. More important, some British companies argue that Malaysia is an important shop window for their activities in the fast-growing and crucially important Asia-Pacific market. Officially, the ban on British goods extends only to government orders, with the private sector left free to buy as it chooses. However, British companies with experience of the region are nervous that the private sector might follow the government's lead. Construction companies are alarmed at the prospect of being excluded from one of Britain's biggest Far East construction markets outside Hong Kong. British contractors are working on projects worth more than Pounds 1bn in Malaysia. Orders worth several times this amount are in the pipeline. The largest is the new Pounds 3bn Kuala Lumpur international airport. Other construction contracts pending include Pounds 500m of rural water projects (North West Water has already won a Pounds 1.25bn contract involving the privatisation of the country's waste water system); the Pounds 400m Sultan Salahuddin thermal power station in the south of the country; a Pounds 160m steelworks at Gunawan: and several hundred million pounds of road contracts, including some privately financed tolled motorway sections. Taylor Woodrow has previously advised on the private financing of sections of the strategic north-south highway. Costain, which has no contracts in Malaysia, said yesterday that it was bidding for a Dollars 120m section of the country's east-west highway. It was bidding for other work in the country worth Dollars 1.3bn including Dollars 500m worth of work on the new airport. Both Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House are involved in the controversial Pounds 417m Pergau contract which is being built by a consortium of Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty from the UK and Kerjayah, a Malaysian company. Trafalgar House regards Malaysia as an important base to break into other south-east Asian markets. It is in the process of establishing a steel fabrication plant in a joint venture with Edaran Otomobil Nasional to supply steel for construction to the region. The next largest construction project under way and involving a British contractor is the first phase of a privately financed light rail system linking Kuala Lumpur with surrounding areas. Finance for the first phase, which will operate under a franchise from the Malay government, has been raised by Taylor Woodrow, the UK contractor, and AEG Westinghouse of Germany. Construction began last year and the project is unlikely to be affected by the Malaysian government's ruling. UK companies involved in the Malaysian power market expressed disappointment at the Kuala Lumpur government's decision, but said they were hopeful the issue could be resolved. There was relief, too, that the new policy would not apply to private Malaysian companies. Independent power plant (IPP) projects are increasingly important in Malaysia and other Asian markets. In these, the power station is built, owned and normally operated by private companies. British Gas pointed out that the deal it signed last year in relation to a 720MW power plant joint venture near Kuala Lumpur was with a private company, Genting Sanyen Power. Rolls-Royce, which last year completed a Pounds 70m expansion and rebuild of the Connaught Bridge power station near Kuala Lumpur, said it had a long and valued association with Malaysia and was disappointed by the decision not to entertain new contracts from UK companies. Only this week, Rolls-Royce clinched a deal to form a 50-50 joint venture with EPE Power, a private Malaysian company, to meet the growing demand for power transmission equipment in Malaysia. John Brown, Trafalgar House's engineering business, has two large contracts for power stations which it is building for Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the quasi-state utility. These are apparently unaffected by the government's decision, but Trafalgar House said a big question mark had been placed over the possibility of future business. After winning a Pounds 120m contract last September for a 330MW gas turbine power station at Pasir Gudang, John Brown made clear it hoped to win further business in Malaysia, a market well suited to the fast-track, mid-sized stations in which the UK company specialises. John Laing, the UK construction group, recently acquired a 5 per cent stake in YTL Power Generation, which has been contracted to build and operate two privately financed power stations in Malaysia costing a combined MDollars 3.5bn. Laing has been appointed project manager for building and civil engineering works of the two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at Pasir Gudang and Paka. Last year British consultants worked on Malaysian construction projects worth Pounds 2.74bn representing 5 per cent of consultants' total overseas work and generating fees of Pounds 30m, according to the Association of Consulting Engineers. Among British defence contractors, British Aerospace yesterday said it was taking part in newspaper advertisements 'to demonstrate that we are supportive of Anglo-Malaysian relations and want to build up this relationship'. BAe said it did not support 'the ill-informed and tendentious reports in the UK press'. BAe has won some Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m worth of defence business in Malaysia, its third biggest defence export market after Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Last week, it delivered the first of a batch of 28 Hawk fighter/trainer aircraft to Malaysia. Under the 1988 government-to-government agreement on defence equipment, for which GEC is the prime contractor, BAe supplies the Seawolf ship to air missiles incorporated in two frigates ordered from GEC Yarrow. Mr Alan Jones, chairman of the Westland helicopter group, said: 'We consider Malaysia is a good place to do business.' We want to work with Malaysia because it has high-quality people and the economy is going very well. It is an attractive place to do business,' he added. BAA, the privatised UK airports group, has acted as a consultant on the master-planning of the Sepang international airport. BAA said: 'We were hoping that there would be future business opportunities and we felt we were in a good position to bid for future contracts.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   British industry reacts: disappointed and the press gets some blame  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 'We have been working on the AJAC Kuala Lumpur airport project for two and a half years and were expecting quite a few major contracts to follow on from our involvement.

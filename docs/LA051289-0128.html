			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> QUISENBERRY HOLDS OFF PADRES FOR FIRST NL SAVE  </P> <P> Once again, it was Quiz time.  </P> <P> Dan Quisenberry, fourth on baseball's all-time list for saves, got his first in  the National League Thursday at St. Louis by securing the Cardinals' 6-5  victory over the San Diego Padres.  </P> <P> "Any time I've got a chance to pitch with the game on the line and the lead, it  reminds me of a thousand other times," Quisenberry said.  </P> <P> Ken Dayley came on after Jose DeLeon walked Randy Ready to start the Padre  eighth. After Bip Roberts tripled to make the score 6-4, Quisenberry was  summoned to face Carmelo Martinez, who blooped a double to right field.  </P> <P> Rob Nelson grounded a single to right, but Tom Brunansky threw out Martinez at  home. Jose Oquendo then made a diving stop near second base and forced out  Nelson.  </P> <P> Quisenberry got his 239th save with a perfect ninth. The other 238 came with  the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> DeLeon (6-2) and San Diego's Eric Show (4-4) each allowed three runs in the  first inning.  </P> <P> Show walked Thompson with the bases loaded in the third to break the tie, and  Brunansky followed with a sacrifice fly. Thompson doubled home a run in the  fifth to make the score 6-3.  </P> <P> The Cardinals announced that Herzog has signed a two-year contract extension  through the 1992 season, and General Manager Dal Maxvill has signed a two-year  extension through 1991.  </P> <P> Atlanta 8, Philadelphia 3 -- Tom Glavine won his fifth game without a defeat,  and Lonnie Smith hit a home run and scored three times as the Braves ran their  winning streak to seven games by beating the Phillies at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Glavine, 7-17 last year, gave up eight hits en route to his fourth complete  game of the season.  </P> <P> Jeff Treadway led off the Atlanta sixth with a triple and scored on Ron Gant's  sacrifice fly to break a 3-3 tie. Smith followed with his fifth homer.  </P> <P> Baltimore 6, Oakland 2 -- Craig Worthington doubled home two runs to break a  1-1 tie in the fourth inning at Baltimore as the Orioles handed the Athletics'  Dave Stewart his first loss of the season.  </P> <P> Jeff Ballard (6-1) joined Stewart (6-1) as the American League's only six-game  winners by giving up nine hits in seven innings. Gregg Olson pitched the final  two innings.  </P> <P> Stewart gave up six runs and 12 hits, a career high, in 6 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Former A's catcher Mickey Tettleton drove in three runs with a home run and a  two-run single.  </P> <P> Oakland's Terry Steinbach went 0 for 3, ending his 15-game hitting streak --  which had tied him for longest in the majors this season.  </P> <P> Texas 6, Kansas City 3 -- Nolan Ryan pitched a five-hitter and struck out 11  batters, and Pete Incaviglia drove in four runs to lead the Rangers past the  Royals at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Ryan (4-2) improved his career record against the Royals to 21-10. It was the  185th time in his career and the 12th time against Kansas City that he had  fanned at least 10 batters. He leads the major leagues with 64 strikeouts.  </P> <P> Mark Gubicza (2-3) lost his fourth consecutive decision to the Rangers at  Royals Stadium.  </P> <P> Incaviglia hit a two-run triple in the second and a two-run single in the  sixth.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, June 24 (AFP)--Iran's main armed opposition  group, the People's Mujahedeen [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization,  MKO] on Friday [24 June] denied it had sent groups into Iran on  sabotage missions.    Iran's chief prosecutor, Ayatollah Abolfazl Musavi Tabrizi,  said authorities had arrested Mojahedin members "sent from Iraq  with the aim of carrying out sabotage activities."    A Mojahedin spokesman "described these lies as part of the  regime's stage-managed ploys to attribute the massacre of the  worshippers of Imam Reza's Shrine to the Mojahedin," according  to a statement faxed to AFP in Nicosia.    A bomb explosion in the northeastern city of Mashhad Monday  [20 June] left 25 people dead and 70 wounded, Iran's interior  ministry said.    Tabrizi did not say how many were arrested or if they were  linked to the bombing.    The Iranian authorities have repeatedly blamed the  Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization for cross-border attacks and  bombing incidents inside the country, including Monday's  explosion.    The rebel group has strongly denied any involvement in the  bombing.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Serbia and Croatia launch crackdowns on the press: Ultra-nationalists try to silence liberal voices THE PRESS in Croatia and Serbia has remained relatively free over the past year despite the imposition of censorship because of the civil war. But recent events suggest that a widespread crackdown on the media is taking place in both republics. The Croatian authorities yesterday stepped up their campaign against critics by prohibiting the publication of a leading opposition weekly magazine. In Serbia, the state-run media is dismissing or demoting non-Serbs from the radio and television. The moves against the media in Croatia followed the decision by Mr Vladimir Seks, the newly-appointed state prosecutor, to start proceedings against the republic's most prominent journalists and members of the opposition. They include Mr Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian Peasants' party, Mr Milorad Pupovac, leader of the Serbian Democratic Movement, and Ms Jelena Lovric, a columnist at Danas, the weekly magazine. The journalists and opposition members are being charged under article 197 of the penal code which states that anyone disseminating false information will receive prison sentences of up to five years. Yesterday, the Croatian authorities prohibited the publication of Danas, a forum for independent thinking, on the grounds that it was insolvent. But Mrs Savka Dabcevic-Kucar, leader of the opposition Croatian People's Party, said it was an attempt by the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, led by President Franjo Tudjman, to bring the small independent-minded press under its control. Slobodna Dalmacija, a daily which has consistently campaigned for press freedom, even under the former communist regime, will also be placed under state control. 'Tudjman is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Anyone who criticises him is regarded as a traitor to the Croatian state,' said Mr Mate Mestrovic, deputy head of the People's Party. He added that if the parliamentary elections go ahead as scheduled this summer, censorship in the state-run television and media will be increased even further. Unlike Serbia, there are no semi-official television or radio channels. Western diplomats and UN officials yesterday said Mr Tudjman is using the international spotlight on Serbia as an opportunity to quash the opposition. They also fear that through silencing his critics, Mr Tudjman may be preparing to launch an offensive in eastern Slavonia, east of the republic which Serb forces seized last year. Although parts of the region are now under the protection of UN peace-keeping forces, diplomats believe Mr Tudjman, and Mr Djoko Susak, the defence minister, are determined to place the region under Zagreb's control. In neighbouring Serbia, liberal-minded journalists have been demoted from Tanjug, the Belgrade-based state-run news agency. 'Non-Serbs, or those with mixed ethnic background are being dismissed,' said a former Tanjug editor. 'Those who speak out, or write the truth, are also being demoted or told to leave,' he added. Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the ultra- nationalist Serbian Radical Party recently published a list of Serb journalists whose critical reporting was singled out for 'betraying the Serbian cause'. One freelance Serb photographer had his house machine-gunned last week in Belgrade after publishing photographs of a Serb executing a Moslem at point-blank range in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Despite the clampdown in Serbia, the Belgrade-based Studio B, the semi-independent television channel, and B 92, the radio station, and Vremje, the weekly magazine, continue to break through the blanket of censorship. However, diplomats said it was only a matter of time before Serbia went the same way as Croatia by silencing the liberal voices of opposition.</p>

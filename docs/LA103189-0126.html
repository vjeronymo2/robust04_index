			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> GLOOM LIFTS AS OAKLAND CELEBRATES SERIES WIN  </P> <P> Thousands of Oakland A's fans thronged Jack London Square for a noon rally  Monday that was supposed to have been a subdued affair saluting the World  Series champions but at the same time recalling the Oct. 17 earthquake and its  grim toll in Oakland.  </P> <P> However, as if the city were saying it was time for celebrating victory and  down with gloom, the moment quickly gave way to unrestrained jubilation for the  team's four-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants.  </P> <P> "This is a great day for Oakland and the East Bay," shouted Oakland Mayor  Lionel Wilson before an estimated crowd of 8,000 fans, most wearing or waving  the green and gold of the Oakland Athletics. Some waved brooms in the air to  signify the A's series sweep, while others taped the celebration with video  cameras.  </P> <P> Such was the enthusiasm of the stirred-up fans and officials that a planned  moment of silence in remembrance of the suffering caused by the earthquake was  overlooked and never took place.  </P> <P> The rally was not wholly oblivious to the recent quake, which claimed 39 lives  in Oakland when a section of the Nimitz Freeway collapsed. Five buckets were  passed around to collect money to aid the families of victims. There was no  traditional ticker-tape parade for the team through downtown streets.  </P> <P> But clearly the champion team had center stage.  </P> <P> "I'm very proud of our team, our city and what our region has represented,"  said Oakland A's Vice President Sandy Alderson from a raised platform, with the  Oakland waterfront in the background.  </P> <P> Then came the players. Pitcher Dave Stewart, selected the World Series Most  Valuable Player, drew thunderous applause and a standing ovation from his  teammates.  </P> <P> "From the bottom of my heart," Stewart said, "to me, Oakland and the A's have a  lot in common, and that is: The cream of the crop always rises to the top." The  cheering level increased as Stewart held up the World Series championship  trophy. "This belongs to all of us," he said.  </P> <P> Teammates drew similar responses. "This is extra special because I'm from  Fremont (in the East Bay)," said relief pitcher Dennis Eckersley, who made the  final out in Game 4.  </P> <P> The Most Valuable Player in the playoffs, Ricky Henderson, called winning the  World Series the "greatest moment in my career."  </P> <P> Although there was no parade, downtown Oakland was decorated with A's banners,  while green and yellow shuttle buses provided free rides to the rally.  </P> <P> Business was good for the numerous vendors who lined Broadway, peddling such  wares as World Series shirts, pennants, caps and buttons. Some offered "The  Great Quake" T-shirts to passers-by heading for the celebration.  </P> <P> "This rally and the World Series really uplifted the citizens to get their  minds off the earthquake and to have something else to think about besides the  damage," said Penny Jenson, 30, of San Leandro. Jenson, dressed in an A's  jogging suit, is a season ticket holder who went to both the playoffs and the  World Series. "It really raised our spirits."  </P> <P> Jorgen Christiansen, 71, has lived in Oakland since 1922 and saw the first  baseball game ever played in Oakland Coliseum in 1968. He was impressed with  his team's showing on and off the field.  </P> <P> "They showed a lot of spirit despite everything that has happened,"  Christiansen said, wearing an A's jacket and cap. "They've done a lot to help  us all get our lives back to normal as soon as possible."  </P> <P> "Oakland has always been regarded as the second city in the Bay Area, second to  San Francisco," said Joe Rodriguez, 30, a student at UC Berkeley who skipped  classes to attend the rally.  </P></p>

Maintenance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index will be maintained by the Phlx. The Phlx may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect the conditions in the semiconductor industry. In accordance with Phlx rule 1009A, if it becomes necessary to replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will be replaced with a stock which the Exchange, in its discretion, believes would be compatible with the intended market character of the Index. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  In making replacement determinations, the Exchange will also take into account a security's capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement. Further, securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events, such as takeovers or mergers, that change the nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index component securities to greater than 21 or reduce the number of index component securities to fewer than 11, the proposal provides that the Phlx will submit a rule filing with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. In addition, in choosing replacement securities for the Index, the Phlx will be required to ensure that at least 90% of the weight of the Index continues to be made up of stocks that are eligible for standardized options trading. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange represents that any future replacement or added component securities will be listed and traded on either the NYSE or the Amex, or quoted on and traded through NASDAQ as NM securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) the public float must be at least 7,000,000 shares; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume in the U.S. must have been at least 2.4 million over the preceding twelve months; and (4) the U.S. market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three calendar months.

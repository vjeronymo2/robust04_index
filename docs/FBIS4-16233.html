			<p>BFN     [Text] The Partnership for Peace program is an alternative  to NATO's mechanical expansion. Participation in this program  will strengthen the CIS position in NATO, Director of the  All-European cooperation Department of the Russian Foreign  Ministry Yuriy Ushakov declared on Thursday addressing the  parliamentary hearings entitled The Partnership for Peace  Program and the future of the CIS, held in the State Duma.    Ushakov pointed out that Russia "should actively break  NATO's  claims to having a monopoly on the solution to issues related to  collective security" and it would be more efficient to do this  "from inside, by joining NATO's program." He reminded that as  many as 14 states had already signed the basic agreement on  joining NATO's program, including Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia;  Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are on the point of signing this  document.    A spokesman of Russian Defense Ministry Major General Pavel  Zolotarev, who also addressed the hearings, also spoke in favor  of Russia joining NATO's program. He stressed that the Defense  Ministry "views it as an interim stage on the way to the  creation of collective security in Europe."    Zolotarev indicated that joining the program "does not mean  any financial obligations on the part of Russia which will  itself determine the dimensions of its participation."  Zolotarev said that opponents of Russia's joining the  Partnership for Peace program fear that NATO may render active  pressure on Russia. Zolotarev believes that "mutual detente is  always more efficient via cooperation than via confrontation."    "If Russia does not join NATO's program it will appear in  self- isolation and NATO will actually receive access to Russian  borders," emphasized Zolotarev.    Four committees of the State Duma which initiated the  parliamentary hearings - the CIS affairs committee (chairman  Konstantin Zatulin, Party of Russian Unity and Concord faction),  security committee (chairman Viktor Ilyukhin, Communist Party  faction), committee on geopolitics (chairman Viktor Ustinov,  Liberal Democratic Party faction), and industry and transport  committee (chairman Vladimir Gusev, the LDPR faction) adhere to  the adverse point of view.    The working documents coordinated by these committees and  distributed at the hearings point out that Partnership for Peace  program has been practically announced as a "real alternative to  the military-strategic partnership between the former USSR  republics within the CIS, and this is a direct loss to Russia's  national security."</p>

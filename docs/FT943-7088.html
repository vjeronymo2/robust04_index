			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need publicity for existing courses, not A-level reform Sir, Your leader 'A-levels fail the test of time' (August 22) rightly identifies the over-specialisation of students at 18 as a cause for concern, but your suggestions for reform ignore the wealth of qualifications already available. At present students in England and Wales can choose between A-levels, NVQs, GNVQs, the international Baccalaureate and A/S levels. The last two admirably fulfil the function of the slimmed down A-levels you recommend. The main problem is not the nature of the courses, it is the lack of awareness of their existence. A further problem is created by universities' admissions procedures and employers' selection criteria which may lead to an inadvertent bias towards students with A-levels. The time it takes to become familiar with any of the new qualifications and the volume of applications means admissions tutors and recruiters often fall back on what they know best, the A-level. As the introduction of GNVQs and NVQs continues over the next four years, reforming the A-level system would only add complications. The important message is less time should be spent finding new solutions and more time should be spent publicising and adapting to what is available. Huw Morris, 29 Himley Road, London SW17 9AR</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan's designation in the  Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) will be changed to  "Chinese Taipei Member Committee of the PBEC," sources said  Friday [20 May].    The sources quoted Robert Lis, director of the PBEC  International Affairs Division, as saying earlier this week that  four PBEC member nations -- Taiwan, the United States, South  Korea and Australia -- will be required to change their  designation in the private regional economic cooperation  organization.    "We have asked the four to change their names in the PBEC in  accordance with their designation in the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum," Lis noted.    The move is expected to facilitate the PBEC's bid to join  APEC as an observer to increase its influence in regional  economic affairs, Lis explained.    Taiwan became a full member of the Hawaii-based organization  under the name of "Chinese Member Committee of PBEC in Taipei"  in 1983.    Lis confirmed that the PBEC has decided to admit Mainland  China, Russia and Colombia as its new members during its 1994  annual meeting scheduled to open Saturday in Kuala Lumpur,  Malaysia.    Mainland China will be called "China Member Committee of the  PBEC," Lis reported.    Jeffrey Koo, president of the Taipei PBEC Committee, said  Taiwan has not opposed Beijing's admission to the PBEC. "We  only regret that Beijing once tried to force PBEC authorities to  ask us to change our designation in the organization," Koo noted.    After long consultations, the PBEC finally decided to ask  Taiwan and the above-mentioned three other countries to  simultaneously change their designation in accordance with their  names in APEC, a 17-member governmental-level forum founded in  1989 to promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.    Koo, heading a delegation of business executives and  economists, left for Kuala Lumpur Friday to attend the May 21-25  PBEC annual meeting.    The PBEC was founded in 1968 by a group of business leaders  from the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and  Australia. It provides a forum for bankers and business  executives in Pacific basin countries to exchange views and  forge cooperative ties. It had 22 members at the end of 1993.</p>

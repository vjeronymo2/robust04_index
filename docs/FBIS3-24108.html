			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Abdudzhalil Samadov, chairman of the Council </F> of Ministers of Tajikistan, by ITAR-TASS observer Yuriy Sizov  specially for OBSHCHAYA GAZETA; place and date not given: "We  Are Condemned to Success Only Together With Russia"]    [Text] [Sizov] How did your negotiations in Moscow end up?  What prospects are there for the development of bilateral  Russian-Tajik relations?    [Samadov] We very quickly found with the Government of  Russia  an understanding of the problems that we have encountered in  1994. These problems ensue primarily from a combination of three  very complex processes: political transformations in the  Republic of Tajikistan connected with the adoption of the new  constitution; a referendum to determine the form of government;  the preparation of free elections with the participation of all  Tajiks, wherever they may be, and all Tajikistanis who  acknowledge the laws of the country. Having conducted a series  of intensive negotiations with the top leadership of the Russian  Government and with leading ministers, we leave with confidence  that the understanding that was reached will be realized in  specific mechanisms and concrete actions on both sides.    I would like to mention that our government has embarked on  the path of a broader dialogue with all structures of the  Russian state and Russian intellectuals. We are treating with  sufficient responsibility the task of realization in 1994 of the  intergovernmental agreement between Tajikistan and Russia.    A group of Russian specialists left for Tajikistan together  with me, and will help us look into the financial system, the  economy of the enterprises, and the economy of the regions.    It would seem to me that the task the government is setting,  which met with understanding at this stage, let us say, must be  accomplished. I would formulate this task as follows: the  unprecedented activity of Russian business circles, Russian  business, Russian politicians, and Russian scientists in  Tajikistan.    Tajikistan today is quite an intricate knot of very topical,  interesting problems and a fertile field of application for  foreign investments. But why should the share of Russian capital  not be more significant here? Why en route to the formation of  stock companies from the enterprises, which were once built on  the basis of Russian technology, can we not create new forms of  the organization of these works via the formation of  international stock companies?    [Sizov] You have emphasized repeatedly that a principal  cause  of the crisis situation of the national economy is the mass  exodus of highly skilled specialists from Tajikistan,  Russian-speaking specialists included. How do you intend to  resolve this problem?    [Samadov] I would like first of all to evaluate this problem  as such. Many Tajiks have left the republic also. If we are to  be objective, this has led in practice to the incapability of  many structures. Once, back in the phase of discussion of the  law on the official language in Tajikistan, I said that this  process could not be approached airily, with the emphasis on  national self-awareness and the need for its upsurge and  revival. It is impossible to enter the 21st century in isolation  from the world and without tackling such problems as, say,  information support in the sphere of new technology, research,  production, the organization of production, international  relations, and so forth. I believe that the failure to  understand many such circumstances led to this process  beginning. I believe that the political stability of Tajikistan  is the first and main condition of a return of the departed  specialists. Another problem: We need to solve in a new way and  fundamentally the question of their remuneration and the  protection of their interests in Tajikistan. And the government  is now tackling this problem.    [Sizov] Unless I am mistaken, there are now over 20 million  Tajiks in the world, and 5 million live in your republic, but  the republic is multinational. For example, over 1.5 million  Uzbeks live with you also. How are your relations shaping up  today with neighboring Uzbekistan?    [Samadov] From its first steps our government has managed to  direct these relations into the constructive channel of mutual  understanding. As far as the Tajik and Uzbek peoples are  concerned, I am sure that, considering the age-old historical  relations on the vast expanse of Central Asia, these relations  cannot be hostile, and all attempts to provoke an exacerbation  of these relations will be cut short.    [Sizov] In the course of the top-level Ashgabat meeting of  heads of state of the CIS the question of the peacekeeping  mission of Russia and Commonwealth countries on the Tajik-Afghan  border was discussed also. How might you now, two months on,  characterize the situation on the border and the role of the  peace-keeping force?    [Samadov] It is hard to exaggerate its role. It is truly a  very powerful stabilizing factor. I have to say a word of  gratitude primarily to the government, the top statesmen, and  the president of Russia for the attention they are giving a  resolution of this problem. We know that in the spring of 1994  certain forces will begin to muster on the other side for a more  large-scale penetration of the territory of Tajikistan. It is  not enough to say that we have the forces to resist. It is  essential to intensify the political dialogue, including with  representatives of the opposition who want peaceful development  in Tajikistan and a peaceful solution of the problems that have  risen to confront the republic. We need to start this as early  as possible, without waiting for some period of time and without  putting forward prior conditions, having included in this  process, of course, international organizations, primarily the  United Nations, and also, undoubtedly, Russia and the countries  of Central Asia. Our government is prepared to do everything  necessary for the start of this process.    [Sizov] Last winter, when the question of the possibility or  impossibility of dialogue with the forces of the opposition was  raised, the leadership of Tajikistan adopted a guarded attitude  toward this and held back even from such negotiations in the  long term. Do you believe that time is dictating different  conditions, and is a dialogue with those who truly are for the  democratic path of Tajikistan's development possible?    [Samadov] The last phrase is the key. The government is  prepared to negotiate with those who are for a democratic path  of the development of Tajikistan. These forces today call  themselves the opposition. Opposition to what? Some  personalities in the government? Their own state? The policy of  the government or the path for which this government is opting?  Here is a subject for negotiations. I repeat that we need  without any prior conditions to agree to facilitate by joint  efforts the complex political, economic, and social processes of  integration that are already occurring in Tajikistan in 1994.    [Sizov] As we all know, there is a major uranium deposit in  the north of Tajikistan, which enabled us formerly to create the  "nuclear shield." There have come to be reports in the news  media that Tajikistan would possibly be prepared to sell the  uranium raw material to countries of the Arab world, Iran has  been cited also. Do you not think that some people are pushing  Tajikistan into playing the "uranium card"?    [Samadov] There are no people in our government or in  today's  leadership of the republic of Tajikistan, I believe, who suffer  from such a disease. I am convinced that the process of the sale  of the uranium, which is monitored by the appropriate  international organizations, produced on the territory of the  republic will be precisely as it has been thus far. I state that  all attempts to link Tajikistan with countries aspiring to  include it in the development of their uranium programs, other  than the countries with which we have a stable relationship in  this sphere, primarily Russia, are groundless. These attempts  have no political prospects.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 31 (XINHUA) -- The visit to three  West European countries by Qiao Shi, chairman of China's  National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, was very  successful and has achieved anticipated results, a senior NPC  official said.    Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee,  told reporters today that during his official goodwill visit to  Germany, Switzerland and Austria on January 16-30, Qiao was  given very warm and friendly receptions by the leaders of  parliaments and governments of the three countries.    The visit has given an impetus to the further growth of  relations between China and the three countries, he added.    Cao quoted Qiao as saying that China has always attached  great importance to developing friendly ties and cooperation  with West European countries, including Germany, Switzerland and  Austria.    Qiao said that China also hopes that such relationship will  be developed in a durable and stable way by adopting by all  sides a policy of mutual respect, seeking common ground while  reserving differences, non-interference in each other's internal  affairs, equality, and mutual benefit.    Cao said the leaders of the three countries said that they  place great importance on developing ties with China, which they  think is exerting an important influence in the world political  and economic fields.    German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel reaffirmed their support for China's peaceful  reunification, and the resumption of China's signatory's status  within the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade.    Otto Stich, president of the Swiss Confederation, said  Switzerland wants to further expand cooperation with China in  all fields. The Austrian leaders stressed that Austria will pay  more attention to developing ties with Asian countries,  especially with China.    Cao said Qiao's visit will also promote China's economic  relations and trade with Germany, Switzerland and Austria.    During the visit, he said, Qiao briefed the parliament and  government leaders of the three countries on China's economic  growth and reform, as well as opening to the outside world.    The leaders and industrial enterpreneurs of the three  countries agree that the achievements China has made in its  economic development have been great in the past 15 years.    All of them expressed confidence in the future of China's  reform, and showed great enthusiasm about furthering their  economic and trade ties with China.    They also expressed the hope for investing in China,  expanding their economic cooperation and trade relations, and  extending the cooperative areas to culture,  scientific-technological research and education, Cao said.    He said Qiao's visit has enhanced the exchanges and  cooperation between the China's parliament and those of the  three countries.    Qiao pointed out during the visit that the NPC was facing  the  task of making laws for the growing socialist market economy of  China.    "We will initially form a frame structure of the legal  system  which will conform to the needs of the market economy, and also  draw on legislative experiences and fruits of other countries,"  he said.    "This requires us to strengthen exchanges and cooperation  between the NPC and the parliaments of countries all over the  world," he added.    The leaders of the parliaments of the three European  countries spoke highly of the existing friendly ties and  cooperation with China, and intended to further develop  relations with the NPC and to expand mutual exchanges and  cooperation.    Cao said that Qiao also exchanged views with the leaders of  the three countries on major international issues in a frank and  sincere way, thus enhancing mutual understanding and reaching  more common views on a wide range of issues.</p>

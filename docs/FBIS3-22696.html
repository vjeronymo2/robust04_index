Only  half these cases were reported last year (104), compared to  (211) the previous year. Sexual transmission of AIDS accounted  for almost 80 per cent (2,435) of cases, and transmission from  mother to child accounted for 16 per cent (481) of cases. Blood  transfusions and blood products were the mode of transmission in  1.5 per cent of cases. The mode of transmission was not stated  in 3.5 per cent of AIDS reports, the statement said. To date  only two patients have been reported who contracted the HIV  virus through intravenous drug abuse." (Johannesburg SAPA in  English 1336 GMT 11 Mar 94)</p>

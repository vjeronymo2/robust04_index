			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S.  officials wrapped up their latest round of "framework" trade  negotiations on Tuesday [11 January] without narrowing  differences on any major issues during two days of talks.    The two sides agreed to meet again, but officials predicted  there will likely be no real progress until the "final hours"  before a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on February 11.    "It is like any negotiation -- you get right up to the final  edge and most of that will probably be worked out in the final  hours," said State Department Counselor Tim Wirth.    The talks at the U.S. Trade Representative Office centered  on  the Japanese insurance market, one of three market sectors  designated as priority areas in the Japan-U.S. framework  negotiation process.    Mid-level officials from the Japanese Finance Ministry and  the U.S. Trade Representative Office are trying to put together  a draft that incorporates both agreement and disagreement for  further negotiation on a more senior level, Japanese sources  said.    Apart from the huge 300 billion dollar Japanese insurance  market, the U.S. also wants to increase sales in the Japanese  automobile market and hike its share of Japanese Government  purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment.    Under a schedule worked out between U.S. and Japanese  officials, deputy ministers from the two countries will try to  seek common ground in two more rounds of talks, the first set  for January 25 to 26 in Washington and the other February 3 to 5  in Tokyo.    So far, one chief difference is over the type of so-called  "objective criteria" -- a requirement prescribed in the  framework accord -- for assessing progress of import penetration  in Japanese markets.    Washington has insisted on using the level of imports in  other group of seven industrial nations as "the norm" for Japan  to follow.    Japanese officials have called the U.S. position  "unacceptable," saying such measures would amount to setting  aside a specific market share for foreign goods and services.    "In a market economy, the government has no such power,"  said  a Japanese official who briefed reporters on the latest round of  framework talks.    Japanese officials also expressed dissatisfaction about a  U.S. refusal to negotiate market access issues in the United  States, particularly with respect to the U.S. insurance market.    Japanese officials insisted that Tokyo has the right to  raise  such issues under terms of the framework accord.    The agreement, reached last July between Clinton and then  Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, calls for  "consultations...under the basic principle of two-way dialogue."    "They say that is merely a promise to hold talks, to  consult,  but not to negotiate," said a Japanese official, who requested  that he not be identified.    "This is clearly sophistry," he said.    Such rhetoric marked an escalation in the war of words  between Japanese and U.S. Government bureaucrats involved in the  tenuous trade negotiations between the two trading partners.    Last week, Under Secretary of State Joan Spero called  Japanese trade officials "quite rigid" and accused them of  spreading "disinformation" on U.S. objectives regarding access  to Japanese markets.    Japanese officials have expressed dismay about what they  view  as a U.S. attempt to discredit Japanese bureaucrats.    "We are clearly not happy about it, and we told them so," a  Japanese official said.</p>

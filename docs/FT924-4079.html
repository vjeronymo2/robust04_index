			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Challenge to Craxi splits party THE Italian Socialist party has suffered a damaging split following an abortive attempt to topple Mr Bettino Craxi from the party leadership by his one time protege, Mr Claudio Mar telli, the justice minister. The split threatens to deepen as Mr Martelli, who made his challenge at a special party assembly last week, has no intention of dropping his leadership challenge. Mr Craxi insists he is staying on. He appears to believe he is the person most suited to renovating the party no matter how discredited he has become as a result of the Milan municipal corruption scandal. Mr Martelli mustered a surprisingly large 33 per cent of the assembly vote against Mr Craxi. This formalised a split between what might be called the official and opposition wings of the Socialists. Before the corruption scandal broke in Mr Craxi's fiefdom of Milan in February, such opposition was unthinkable. He was the unquestioned leader who had pushed factionalism to the sidelines over the previous decade.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Mikhaylovich Zhebrovskiy, founder </F> of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, LPDR; Aleksandr  Dmitriyevich Vengerovskiy, head of the LPDR's  intelligence-security service; and Vsevold Gaplyn, head of the  Department of Foreign Church Affairs of Aleksey II, patriarch of  the Russian Christian Orthodox Church, by Vlado Vurusic in  Moscow; date not given: "The Two-Headed Russian Eagle Will Soon  Spread Its Wings Over the Balkans!"]    [Text] Not far from the center of Moscow, at No. 1  Ribnjikova Lane, amid digging and mud, in the attic above the  hard-rock shop where, behind its protective iron bars, you can  buy black leather jackets, black T-shirts, and all the things  the hard rock and heavy metal fans desire, there are the offices  of the winners of the recent elections in Russia, that is, the  representatives of the LPDR, led by the controversial and  politically unpredictable Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy.    A man sits among sheets of paper scattered all around the  table and shabby couch in a narrow room with a view of a  fire-devastated building. He is a close confidant and personal  friend of Zhirinovskiy's, one of the founders of the party, the  editor of the party bulletin, which has a bizarre name:  "Zhirinovskiy's Justice" (and the minister of finances of the  party's shadow cabinet. Zhirinovskiy has already proposed to  Chernomyrdin, current Russian prime minister, that he take this  man into his cabinet and give him the same portfolio.) The man  we are talking about is Stanislav Mikhaylovich Zhebrovskiy!    A large map of the former Soviet Union hangs on the wall,  with white-blue party flags designating the places where  Zhirinovskiy won.    It is conspicuous that the most convincing victories were  deep in the Russian provinces, in smaller industrial townships,  in which the political economic giants used to prosper in the  communist era, while now most of them are going to rack and ruin  or are overwhelmed by losses.    The newspapers that support the democratic parties in Russia  claim that, like Zhirinovskiy, Zhebrovskiy is of Jewish origin,  although he is a greater Russian nationalist.    [Vurusic] Mr. Zhebrovskiy, although it seemed that you were  the one who won the elections, some papers have reported that in  the new parliament, that is in the Federation Council and Duma,  the greatest number of seats will be occupied by the pro-Yeltsin  Russia's Choice.    [Zhebrovsky] It is all nonsense, and the futile expectations  of our so-called democrats. These elections were for party  lists and individuals. Our party list won the greatest number  of votes. And it did so quite convincingly, indeed! The Russian  people did not want to vote for the repulsive and detestable  Russia's Choice. As far as I know, only 8 percent of the  electorate voted for that party list. However, Russia's Choice  played a trick on the voters in the case of some lists,  representing its candidates as independents. If it had been  known that they were the candidates of Russia's Choice, the  Russian people would have rejected them with loathing. For our  people, it is like waving a red rag in front of a bull when you  mention Russia's Choice. I witnessed an incident in Podolsk,  when the people almost beat up the Russia's Choice candidate at  its campaign rally. That is the real state of affairs.    [Vurusic] Foreign policy issues are an important part of  your platform. You have put forward some new proposals for  settling the crisis in former Yugoslavia, but it seems you  support the Serbian side, in fact.    [Zhebrovsky] We support the Slav side!    [Vurusic] Croats are Slavs, too.    [Zhebrovskiy] All right, but you have Muslims there as well.  In the region of former Yugoslavia we support the Slav,  Christian-Orthodox side in the war, that is the Serbs. We are  paying great attention, with a great deal of concern and anxiety  indeed, to the way the Muslim ideology is breaking into Europe.  They have been trying to conquer Europe for a long time and in  various ways. For that reason one has to be extremely cautious.  In our opinion, religion plays the most important role in that  war. Muslims are the greatest danger to Europe. They are using  you to establish their domination. Christianity must not allow  that!    [Vurusic] Although the official election results have not  come in yet, you have already received Vojislav Seselj's  telegram from Belgrade congratulating you on your victory, while  the representatives of your party also visited him in  Belgrade....    [Zhebrovskiy] I have not seen that telegram yet, and there  is nothing I can tell you about it. Still, Zhirinovskiy was in  Belgrade, and, as far as I know, he did meet Seselj....    [Vurusic] Your party is called a pro-fascist party, and some  people claim you are maintaining contact with your European  counterparts. You said yourself that you had contacts with  Seselj's Radical Party, which is openly pro-fascist....    [Zhebrovskiy] Come on, what kind of fascists are we? You  have swallowed the propaganda bait of our so-called democrats,  who are nothing but neo-bolsheviks. They are ready to do  anything to stay in power. They are in a panic that they might  lose it. They have brought such a powerful country as Russia to  its knees, and now they are allowing the Americans to exploit it  for miserable amounts of money in return. We want to see Russia  on its feet again, in all its grandeur and beauty. Therefore  they are afraid of us, and are trying to blacken us by calling  us fascists, chauvinists, racists, and anti-Semites. They are  even ready to trigger a civil war! Do you know how far they are  going? They are even lying to our President Boris Yeltsin, and  blocking his actions. They are constantly misinforming him,  because the television is in their hands, and they prevent  anyone telling President Yeltsin what the real state of affairs  is. They are now in a terrible panic, because they are afraid  of Yeltsin's personally meeting someone who will tell him the  truth straight to his face, without reluctance. That man is  Zhirinovskiy!    [Vurusic] To return to the subject of former Yugoslavia, and  your attitude toward the international initiatives to end the  war....    [Zhebrovskiy] We are against that war, and I think that  Yugoslavia is the first drill-ground where the method of  crushing and partitioning a state organized according to the  national-territorial principle has been tested. We are against  such a state organization. The best way to organize a state is  on the territorial principle, not the national principle.  Cultural autonomy -- yes, but no state should allow  national-territorial autonomy! There cannot exist several  states in one state. For instance, we support the idea that in  Russia the question of national affiliation should be completely  abolished. We do not ask our members about their national  affiliation. Foreign journalists are always surprised when we  say that we are not able to throw light on the national  structure of the Liberal Democratic Party, because we simply do  not ask anybody about it. What some people want to see  happening on the larger scale, in Russia, is already happening  in Yugoslavia, on a smaller scale. We also have Christian and  Muslim factors here, and those people want to make them collide.    [Vurusic] Still, it seems that you see the greatest danger  in the Muslims....    [Zhebrovskiy] Look at what is happening near Russia, on its  southern borders. Turkey claims millions of square kilometers  of regions which were under Russian jurisdiction for many  centuries and which have become independent states by some  treacherous miracle. Turkish expansionism wants Azerbaijan,  Armenia, the greatest part of our Central Asian regions.  Turkish expansionism also involves the region of former  Yugoslavia, however, and the bells may soon toll for Bulgaria as  well. We think that such a young religion as Islam -- which is  radical and impatient -- is the greatest danger. A young  religion is just like a young man: ungovernable and assertive.  Christianity is like a mature man: wise and restrained. We are  divided by 700 years. Just remember early Christianity: wars,  crusades, inquisition.... Such things do not exist any more.  Therefore the Muslims are sending their followers to wage  wars....    [Vurusic] How do you view the Muslim state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina today?    [Zhebrovskiy] It must not be allowed. Your Muslims are  largely assisted by the Arab and other Islamic countries with  weapons and oil, while those countries even represent  Bosnia-Herzegovina in various international forums. If there  were no such and similar aid, there would be far fewer problems  in the region, and they would be easily solved.    [Vurusic] Quite probably, because there would be nothing  the Muslims could fight with.    [Zhebrovskiy] It seems as though you did not understand what  the Muslims want. I also find the behavior of the West quite  incomprehensible. Look what the greatest Western cities are  turning into! Mosques are mushrooming in all the cities where  the Western Christian culture was conceived. There is the smell  of roast mutton everywhere on the streets. Just look at Munich,  Berlin, Amsterdam. By the turn of the century the number of  Muslims in Paris will have exceeded the number of Frenchmen.  Where is this leading? One should look at the future. I ask  you: Who will then be considered a foreigner by whom? A  Frenchman by an Arab, or an Arab by a Frenchman? The West does  not understand what is happening in former Yugoslavia. The  Western culture is absolutely different from the Eastern culture.    [Vurusic] Then, are you still in favor or the Serbs'  retaining the occupied territories in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia?    [Zhebrovskiy] The most important thing is that peace is  established there, and that blood is no longer shed. In order  to accomplish that, however, perhaps one will have to implement  some violent measures. It is better to destroy the source of  evil now than let it spread and develop.    [Vurusic] Who and what do you think is that evil you are  talking about?    [Zhebrovskiy] I will not discuss the details. It is  politics we are discussing now! It is not pursued by giving  interviews. It involves lengthy negotiations, compromises,  persuasion, interests. We should go for peace, for cooperation.  Not all the people are able to understand everything that can  happen. And in large part it is already happening in former  Yugoslavia. When two cultures meet, the later one starts to  feel stronger, or at least capable of imposing itself on the  other. If that problem is not settled, the war will last at  least another 30 years: You have a lot of mountains there, the  peoples are bellicose, and weapons will be coming in.    [Vurusic] Are you an anti-Muslim racist, in view of what you  have just said?    [Zhebrovskiy] Of course I am not! I am just warning of the  danger, but I am not calling for a war against them. Besides,  until recently I did not even know that our party has many  Muslim members. When public opinion started denouncing us,  alleging that we are anti-Muslim racists, our Muslim members  felt the need to say publicly that it was not true.    [Vurusic] In a recent interview for Radio Hamburg,  Zhirinovskiy said that there could be another Hiroshima and  Nagasaki in Japan, but this time Russia would drop the bombs.  How does that fit in with the appeals for peace and cooperation  you called for after the elections?    [Zhebrovskiy] I was not present when that interview was  given, so I am not able to explain what the statement actually  means. I have been present during many of Zhirinovskiy's  appearances, but I have never heard him say anything like that.  However, we first have to see the context in which that  statement was made. Perhaps it was taken out of context.  Perhaps he was asked what he would do if Japan attacked us. We  have to check what was said before and after that statement.  Nevertheless, in this case I dare say it is a pure lie.    [Vurusic] It is said that your party is sending volunteers  to Iraq, to help Saddam Husayn, as well as to Serbia....    [Zhebrovskiy] That is yet another piece of misinformation.  No member of ours has ever been sent by our party to volunteer  there.    [Vurusic] Still, there are Russians fighting on the side of  the Serbs....    [Zhebrovskiy] We have never sent anybody there.    [Vurusic] Would you send the Russian Army to intervene in  former Yugoslavia?    [Zhebrovskiy] Zhirinovskiy's statement is clear: Not a  single Russian soldier will fight in a foreign country any  longer. We shall withdraw our army from all the countries  where its troops have been stationed.    [Vurusic] How do you assess the fact that most of the  Russian soldiers serving with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in  Croatia voted for your party?    [Zhebrovskiy] They have understood that our party will help  to make it possible for them to leave that region as soon as  possible.    [Vurusic] Does that mean that you will officially demand  that Russia withdraw its UNPROFOR troops from Croatia?    [Zhebrovskiy] We shall make public our attitude in that  respect very soon, and propose it to all the major states in the  world. One has to make radical changes in the approach to the  Yugoslav crisis. One ought finally to tell the truth about what  is happening there!    [Vurusic] What is the truth?    [Zhebrovskiy] The nationalistic games, plundering of assets,  and geopolitical games of Germany, America, and Arabia. Many  people will feel quite uncomfortable when we put forward our  proposal, both in the East and the West. You can expect our  proposal to come soon.  <H5>  Vengerovskiy: When We Won, Panic Broke Out in the World! </H5>   [Vurusic] I am sitting in the foyer of the office usually  occupied by Zhirinovskiy. After his celebratory news conference  he took a vacation and left Moscow, refusing interviews and  public appearances, and surrendering a part of his unexpected  fame to his closest aides and veterans, who are ironically  referred to by Moscow's democratic circles as "veterans of  Moscow's stinking beer-cellars," an allusion to Munich's  beer-cellars from where Adolph Hitler set out into the world of  politics.    I am waiting to be received by the second most important man  of the party, Aleksandr Dmitriyevich Vengerovskiy, head of the  party's intelligence-security service, whom Zhirinovskiy intends  to propose to President Yeltsin as prime minister of the Russian  Government.    On the wall behind Vengerovskiy, right above his head, hangs  the map of Russia as conceived by Zhirinovskiy: From Finland to  Alaska, while the prominent detail on the map is an eagle,  holding in his beak a banner reading Freedom and Law, which is,  according to Vengerovskiy, the goal of the party's policy.  Right at the beginning of the interview he feels it necessary  to say that the war in former Yugoslavia is not the most  important thing in the world. Russian citizens have many severe  problems, and their greatest priority now is to solve them.  Besides, he says, he does not conceal his former membership in  the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and, unlike many other  people, he neither kept his membership card hidden nor did he  burn it. Therefore the first question is whether he feels sorry  that the Soviet Union has ceased to exist.    [Vengerovskiy] I feel sorry that Soviet Union disintegrated.  We were the only party in Russia that condemned that act. I  think that from that moment on Russia has been going downhill,  and given our success in the elections, Russia and the Russian  people have been given a chance to change the situation.    [Vurusic] Do you think that Russia today does not occupy the  place it deserves on the international political stage?    [Vengerovskiy] Of course I do! What was the Soviet Union  before? An important political factor, a superpower, while now  it is a giant on its knees. Because of the policy that has been  pursued so far Russia has become a state of second-rate  importance. In Russia the death rate is higher than the birth  rate! We are a state without international borders. Our  historical borders are now thousands of kilometers away from  Russia, although borders, according to the Helsinki document,  are irrevocable.    [Vurusic] Do you understand the former Soviet Union as  Russia?    [Vengerovskiy] And what do you think it was? The Soviet  Union was founded on the territory of the Russian Empire, some  peoples were given national autonomy, and look now -- they are  independent states! Russia has been left without access to sea,  without large harbors. We have slid back into medieval Russia.  Do you think that is normal? Of course it is not! Therefore  we want to restore dignity and esteem to our fatherland, and to  make it take the place again that belongs to it in the world.    [Vurusic] Does this mean you want the Russia represented by  the map above your armchair, including Finland, Poland, and  Alaska?    [Vengerovskiy] That is Russia in its best and most famous  days. We are in favor of having neighborly relations with all  countries, but we shall demand the revocation of aid and the  privileged status in the sphere of economic relations that was  bestowed on those former Soviet republics whose policy we find  unsatisfactory. Of course, we shall elaborate the program of  aid and privileges for other countries, as well as regulations  the disregarding of which might lead to revocation of those  privileges. This means that our attitude toward those republics  will depend on their behavior. These are normal relations in  international foreign policy.    [Vurusic] What will your contribution to Russian foreign  policy be?    [Vengerovskiy] It will be as large as possible! Earlier,  Russia's word used to count, its opinion was important, and it  was fully taken into account in international relations. We  shall do all we can to make things like that again. You see, as  soon as we won, journalists from all over the world flocked to  Moscow, because panic broke out in the world. That panic means  that from now on the world will be paying more attention to  Russia's opinion. Let me paraphrase Earnest Hemingway: "When  the bell tolls, perhaps it tolls for you!"    [Vurusic] I have to ask you a question regarding the war in  Yugoslavia, particularly because you support the Serbian side....    [Vengerovskiy] We usually find out what has been happening  in former Yugoslavia from our members who have been there.  Personally, I have been best informed by the author Edward  Lymonov. You know from history that our Slav brothers, Serbs  and Montenegrins, have always been close to us! We are bound  together historically. We also know that Croats are Slavs as  well. But the Serbs are much closer to us, because they are  Christian-Orthodox. We have defended them many times. What is  happening in former Yugoslavia right now is absolutely abnormal!  It is a religious war! Let us say "No!" to all your nation  states! We do not want Russia to be founded on the national  principle. Let Yugoslavia be founded, as was Russia before, or  as the United States is now, on the principle of states  [gubernija].  <H3>  Vsevold Gaplyn: In the Russian Christian-Orthodox Church We  Have Monarchists, and Even Communists! </H3>   [Vurusic] In the last few years, after decades of the Soviet  authorities, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church has started  to reassume the place it had for many centuries. Many churches  were demolished, most of the clergy were expelled, and believers  were imprisoned. Even the very top of the Russian Christian  Orthodox Church was controlled by the almighty KGB.    On the eve of the recent bloody events in the Russian  Parliament, the Russian Christian Orthodox Church and its  patriarch, Aleksey II, were mediators in the negotiations  between the conflicting factions.    The mediating mission failed, which, as is said, was taken  quite badly among church officials. They even consider that the  church has missed a chance to win the political and religious  place in Russian society it had at the time of the empire, when  Orthodoxy was recognized as the official state religion.    Although church officials deny it, the Russian Christian  Orthodox Church exerts significant influence on the politics of  other Christian Orthodox churches, so that after the outbreak of  war in former Yugoslavia, several meetings took place between  Pavle, patriarch of the Serbian Christian-Orthodox Church, and  Patriarch Aleksey II.    In Danilovskiy monastery, which dates from the 13th century  and is now the home of the Department of Foreign Church Affairs  of the Patriarch of Russian Christian Orthodox Church, we are  talking with father Vsevold Gaplyn, head of inter-church  cooperation and relations with international organizations.    Danilovskiy monastery was nationalized right after the  revolution in 1917, and until 1983, when it was given back to  the church, it had been a prison for the children of political  prisoners.    What is the role of the Russian Christian Orthodox Church  today, given the changed political conditions?    [Gaplyn] The church wants to act in a pacifying way, and our  main task is the salvation of human souls. If people are  suffering, the church has to protect them and take care of them.  If people are living well, and in compliance with the laws of  God, then church-state relations will also be good. You are  aware of the recent tragic events, caused by the political  crisis in society and in the relations between the former  parliament and President Yeltsin. In that situation we tried to  play a peacekeeping role, and at one moment it appeared to us  that our mission would be successful, but unfortunately, human  malice and mutual intolerance, as well as destructive and  murderous instincts were stronge, and brought about tragic  events. Regardless of such an outcome, however, the Russian  Christian Orthodox Church will always support peace, and strive  for it. Our authority in society is great and indisputable, and  for that reason we are becoming a desirable ally of many  political forces. The church, however, is above politics, it is  above political conflicts. It cannot be otherwise, because the  church itself involves monarchists, and even communists.    [Vurusic] Regarding the war that is going on in Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina, many people maintain, even some in  Russia, that it is a religious war, because its warring factions  are Catholic, Muslim, and Christian Orthodox....    [Gaplyn] As far as I know, the highest officials of the  Serbian Christian Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church reject  any notion that a religious war is being waged in former  Yugoslavia. In their letters and addresses to believers both  Cardinal Kuharic and Patriarch Pavle are interceding for peace.  We in the Russian Orthodox Church also think that the roots and  reasons for that terrible war in former Yugoslavia are of  political origin, rather than religious. As for the relations  between the Russian and Serbian Orthodox Churches, I have to  underline that they are very close and brotherly, because the  language of our service is the same. The Russian church  completely supports the Serbian church in this war. We are very  happy to see that the representatives of the Serbian church are  cooperating and making efforts to find the path of peace  together with the officials of the Catholic Church in Croatia!    [Vurusic] The Serbs often boast about their Orthodox  brotherhood with Russians and Russia, considering it their great  protector, no matter what they do. Do you think that such  boasting might sometimes damage the Russian Orthodox Church's  reputation?    [Gaplyn] Our relationship with the Serbian people is  brotherly. We understand their hopes and expectations. Still,  that brotherhood must not be understood as support for conduct  that opposes Christian morality and peace efforts.    [Vurusic] The Serbian church happens to be in the center of  yet another problem. That is the demand that the Macedonian and  Montenegrin Orthodox Churches be independent, and have their own  patriarch....    [Gaplyn] From the point of view of ordinary Christian  Orthodoxy, there is no such thing as an autocephalous Macedonian  Orthodox Church! No such thing is recognized by any of the  existing orthodox churches in the world. In that point the  Russian church supports its Serbian counterpart. I think that  the question of the independence of a particular church  structure cannot be solved by overthrowing the economic  structure of the church, as has happened in Macedonia, or in  Ukraine. As for the Montenegrin situation, I see no reason for  the Montenegrins to have church independence at all!    [Vurusic] A considerable number of orthodox believers live  in Croatia, so there are even suggestions that a sort of  Croatian orthodox church should be founded. What would be the  Russian Orthodox Church's reaction to that?    [Gaplyn] I am not familiar with such suggestions.  Nevertheless, it would be the following: There are church  parishes, and they are administratively connected. Since  certain Croatian parishes are economically linked to the Serbian  church and Patriarch Pavle, it is logical that the Serbian  church's opinion should be taken into account. Only with its  permission could a part of its territorial property be given a  certain degree of independence.    [Vurusic] Do you have any contact with Cardinal Kuharic, and  the representatives of the Captol [site of cathedral] in Zagreb?    [Gaplyn] No, we do not, but we would like to have contact  with Cardinal Kuharic, and the Zagreb Captol, so that we could  obtain more information. Some time ago I met the  representatives of the Croatian Protestant Church in Barcelona.  It was a very instructive and interesting conversation. We  found a common language also in our desire to see peace in your  country as soon as possible.    [Vurusic] What are your relations with the Vatican today?    [Gaplyn] Somehow in 1988 and 1989 relations with the Vatican  worsened. At that time Catholic evangelism started in Russia,  and the missionaries did not always behave properly. As we see  it, they did not always act in compliance with our mutual  vocation on earth, they did not always behave in accordance with  their laws. They did not take account of our Russian pride, our  tradition and culture, but just this year it appears that  relations with the Vatican have started to improve.</p>

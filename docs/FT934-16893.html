			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Lord Chief Justice backs curbs on right to silence CONTROVERSIAL government proposals to curb a suspect's so-called right to silence have won the backing of Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice. The proposals are among tough measures to be announced by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, on Wednesday at the Conservative Party conference. Under the government's plans, trial judges would be able to comment to the jury on a defendant's failure to answer reasonable questions put to him at a police station. At present, judges have to tell juries that a defendant's refusal to answer police questions should not be a factor in deciding guilt or innocence. The move would necessitate a change in the police caution to suspects. The police would have to say that although a suspect is not obliged to answer questions, failure to do so might be the subject of adverse comments by the judge at the trial. Speaking at the bar's annual conference in London at the weekend, Lord Taylor said he supported change. 'I feel there are circumstances in which it should be open to a judge to comment on the defendant's failure to respond to questions.' It was important he said that it be left to the judge to decide in each case whether comment should be made. Lord Taylor confirmed his opposition to abolition of the defendant's right to a jury trial in cases that can be tried by magistrates or at the Crown Court. That was the most controversial of the 352 recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in July. Criminal justice, Page 8</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudi oil minister fails to turn up at Opec summit MR HISHAM NAZER, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, yesterday failed to turn up at the ministerial summit of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna. Other delegations were surprised and disconcerted, but the Saudis said it signalled no change in the kingdom's oil policy. A Saudi delegate said Mr Nazer was simply 'a little bit exhausted' after an intensive series of overseas meetings. Some oil analysts suggested that Mr Nazer's absence, his first from an Opec meeting since he replaced Sheikh Yamani as the kingdom's oil minister in 1987, could be interpreted as a 'slight' towards delegations favouring a higher-price Opec policy. However, diplomats in Riyadh who met Mr Nazer yesterday said they believed he was genuinely overtired. The diplomats said that there was no indication that Mr Nazer's post as oil minister was threatened, or that his absence indicated a shift in oil policy by Riyadh. Mr Nazer's place at the summit was taken by Mr Fayez Badr, a minister of state with responsibility for the Saudi Ports Authority and a man with no obvious oil expertise. Saudi Arabia has widely flagged before the Opec summit, which begins in earnest today, that it would be seeking a 1m barrels a day rise in the cartel's production ceiling for the third quarter from the 22.98m b/d agreed for the second quarter in February. Iran, among several other delegations, opposes such a move and would prefer to see Opec restrain output to force prices towards the cartel's formal reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel. Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, told reporters curtly yesterday: 'I want a cut in the ceiling.' Saudi Arabia estimates the call on Opec crude to reach 24.2m b/d for the third quarter, but actual production for the second has neared 23.5m b/d rather than the nominal February figure, largely because of Kuwait's accelerated output and a Saudi refusal to cut production below 8m b/d - as it was notionally allocated.</p>

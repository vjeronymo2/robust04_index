			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, June 13, IRNA -- Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali  Akbar Velayati delivered to Germany Chancellor Helmut Kohl here  today a message from President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    The meeting, which took place immediately after Velayati's  arrival in Germany, saw exchange of views on bilateral ties in  the political, and economic and industrial spheres.    The two also discussed regional and international  developments, with Velayati expressing hope that joint economic  ventures between the two countries would further promote  Tehran-Bonn relations.    Cooperation between the two sides, said Velayati, could  serve  as a example for other European countries.    Kohl thanking for Rafsanjani's message praised Iran as an  important and influential country in the region.    He agreed that joint economic ventures to be pursued by Iran  and Germany would hopefully start by the end of the current year.    Velayati arrived here today on an invitation from his German  counterpart Klaus Kinkel.</p>

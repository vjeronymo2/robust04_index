Nearly 40 kinds of tonics and medicines of 400 categories  and  new rational technical proposals have been produced by  pharmaceutists.    Noteworthy among them are Chinju pills for cleansing the  brain, and medicines which are made of Koryo elongatum maxim,  and chlorophyll isolated from silkworms' discharge.    Chlorophyll is highly popular as a natural tonic. It is  specially effective for arteriosclerosis, hypertension, gastric  ulcer, diabetes, neuralgia, hemorrhage, etc. It is used also in  making tooth paste and coloring matters in the daily necessities  and foodstuff industries. An absorbent from silkworm's  discharge has over 65 percent absorption rate. It is very  effective for purifying the blood and eliminating poison by  medicaments, harmful gas and toxic materials.    Tea, honey and extracts from Koryo elongatum maxim which  grows in the area of Mt.

They prove especially effective  for neurasthenia and physical weakness and increase sexual  functions of the old. Medical workers of the hospital of the  Pyongyang University of medicine have developed over 50 kinds of  curative and preventive medicines and reagents, while giving  medical assistance to working people.

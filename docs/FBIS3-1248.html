			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Big Defence Force Call-Up -- Johannesburg THE STAR in  English  on 23 March in a page-20 editorial says "the country's situation  before, during and immediately after the election seems destined  to become more volatile, not less; so there is a strong argument  for the authorities to tap all available security manpower in  the form of a big Defence Force call-up. In deciding on this  step, the SADF [South African Defense Force] top brass will have  been encouraged by the discipline and efficiency of their troops  in the Bophuthatswana crisis."    De Klerk, NP `Main Casualties' in Goldstone Report Fallout  --  In an article on the same page, Patrick Laurence writes that  President de Klerk and his National Party "are likely to be the  main casualties in the fall-out" from Justice Richard  Goldstone's interim report implicating top police generals in  politically motivated violence. "De Klerk's immediate reaction  has been to place all the policemen named in the report on  compulsory leave and to declare himself in favour of an  investigation into the allegations by an international team of  policemen, assisted by one of South Africa's four  attorney-generals and an eminent jurist from outside South  Africa. But De Klerk's actions may paradoxically be not enough  and too much: not enough to allay suspicions in the black  community that he has lost control of his security forces and  too much for the police generals and white conservatives to  stomach." The failure of the De Klerk government to prosecute  military officers in 1993 "works against it on both flanks.  Black radicals see it as evidence of his unwillingness to take  decisive action; white conservatives interpret it as evidence of  his willingness to sacrifice innocent men to appease the ANC  [African National Congress]."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Call For Policemen Indemnity -- "Unpleasant as it may seem,  the way to the truth about police and the `third force' is  probably through offering indemnity to policemen who may have  inside knowledge," declares a page-10 editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 23 March. The priority must be "to  find out what happened." "If policemen committed or encouraged  political murders, it is important to know on whose orders they  acted. What matters now is accountability, whether of senior  officers or senior politicians. Name the killers, but blame  those who sent them, failed to stop them or pretended they did  not exist."</p>

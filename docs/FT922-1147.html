			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Brussels may cede some central powers THE European Commission is for the first time seriously considering the return to EC states of some powers that have been taken over by Brussels. The Commission is seeking to deflect criticism that its bureaucratic red tape has snared governments and citizens in an over-centralised Community. Its new stress on 'subsidiarity' - making laws and rules at the lowest appropriate level - comes too late to influence Danish voters who earlier this month rejected the Maastricht union treaty. However, its change of emphasis is in time for this week's EC summit in Lisbon, where a lively debate on subsidiarity is expected. The Commission will today prepare its view on subsidiarity on the basis of a paper which seeks to ward off 'the accusations of bureaucracy and technocracy'. Real centralisation is beyond the means of EC administrators whose money and staff 'will not in any manner be comparable to those of a federal state', it says. The paper, prepared for the Commission by the office of its president, Mr Jacques Delors, makes no precise proposals about which powers might be returned to governments. Officials predicted yesterday that today's discussion in the 17-member Commission board would result in an instruction to the Commission's 23 directorates to search for examples of subsidiarity in their areas. The Commission's preliminary paper suggests that EC legislation can be justified in dealing with clear cross-frontier problems, such as the depletion of the ozone layer, or where there is an obvious need to mobilise maximum financial and technical resources, as in EC research programmes. But it also suggests that Brussels should weigh 'the cost of (EC) inaction'. In the sensitive area of trade infringement, it raises the questions: 'Is it necessary to remove every distortion (to competition)? If not, at what point should the Community intervene to prevent a distortion, and in what sectors?' EC officials rule out any idea that Brussels is about to let member countries control state aid, such as the case of the French government's injection of capital into its computer company, Bull, which the Commission is due to discuss next week. However, they suggest that, in cases where one company complains that another is abusing a dominant position within a single national market, there should be more recourse to national courts, rather than directly to Brussels. As an alternative to EC legislation, the paper says the Commission should consider encouraging private parties - such as employers and trades unions - or public authorities to regulate themselves. Brussels might even provide financial incentives for private action. Where self-regulation is not appropriate, the Commission - under the Treaty of Rome the sole proposer of EC laws - should wherever possible confine itself to setting minimum EC-wide standards. This practice, which Brussels is already increasingly using, allows member states to make further refinements in technical norms, provided these are 'mutually recognised'. Mr Delors said to EC foreign ministers he saw a paradox between the way the Twelve were developing the single market on the basis of 'mutual trust', and how EC structural aid controls French clear hurdle, Page 2 PM firm on EC, Page 11</p>

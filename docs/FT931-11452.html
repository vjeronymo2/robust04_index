			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Selling wave hits Chicago wheat prices CHICAGO WHEAT futures tumbled in active trading as export prospects dimmed and professional traders, seeing little good news on the horizon, liquidated their wheat futures holdings. Soft red winter wheat for March delivery was down more than 8 cents, at Dollars 3.71 per bushel at midsession. Analysts said managed futures funds sold wheat after March futures fell below a chart support point of Dollars 3.75. News that Russia had recently received French credits to purchase 2.4m tonnes of European Community wheat and that the Republic of Kazakhstan has sold Russia 3.2m tonnes of wheat would limit Russia's appetite for US wheat, even if its credit problems were resolved, analysts said. The Australian Wheat Board boosted its crop estimate to 15.3m tonnes, from 14.6m, but US traders said the upward revision had been expected and was not a major feature in the sell off.</p>

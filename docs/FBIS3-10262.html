To the people of Mexico, the peoples and governments of the  world, the national and international press, and our brothers:    The Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General  Command of the EZLN addresses you all respectfully and honorably  to make a statement.    First: The EZLN came to this bargaining table with the real  intention of stating its views and explaining all the reasons  that forced us to take up arms in order to avoid dying  dishonorably. We came here to hold a dialogue, that is we came  to talk and listen. We spoke to the supreme government and all  the good and honest people in the world. We also spoke to the  bad people so they will listen to the truth. Some heard our  word; others followed the path of despise against our voice and  our race.    Second: We met heedful ears ready to listen to the truth  coming from our lips. The San Cristobal dialogue was truthful.  There were no ill intentions or lies, nothing was concealed  from our hearts and the people of reason and kindness. There  was no sale or purchase of dignities. There was equality when  speaking and listening. There was a good and truthful dialogue.    Third: We now have answers that reflect the real interest of  the peace commissioner to find peace. We now have the  obligation to reflect on what his words say. We must now speak  to the collective heart that commands us. We must listen to its  voice to be able to walk again. From it, from our people, from  the Indians in the mountains and the creeks will come the next  signal to take the following step on this path, whose goal will  be peace with justice and dignity or it will not be.    Fourth: We have found in the commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas a man who is willing to listen to our  reasonings and demands. Not only did he listen to us and  understand our position, but he also sought possible solutions  to our problems. We salute the attitude assumed by Peace  Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.    Fifth: We have seen in Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, the  national mediation commissioner, a real and permanent interest  in eliminating all the obstacles that could get in the way of  peace. Along with him, good men and women worked day and night  to make sure nothing interrupted the dialogue. Sacrificing  their personal safety, well-being, and health, the mediators  fulfilled their mission by negotiating not between peace or war  but between two voices that are still trying to reach a peace  agreement. These men and women received us because they want  peace. If peace is achieved in this region, it will be thanks  first of all to their peace efforts. We recognize the sacrifice  and dedication of the National Mediation Commission,  particularly that of Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia.    Sixth: This phase of the dialogue is over now, and we are on  the right path. Let us eliminate all obstacles and continue  moving forward.    Freedom!    Justice!    Democracy!    Respectfully,    [Signed ] Subcommander Marcos    [Issued] From southeastern Mexico by the Indian  Revolutionary Clandestine Committee-General Command of the  Zapatist National Liberation Army -- Mexico, March 1994.</p>

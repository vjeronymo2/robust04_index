			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Editors to widen complaints body NEWSPAPER editors yesterday signalled they were prepared to respond to criticism of the Press Complaints Commission by changing its composition to guarantee a majority of members from outside the industry. A statement by the Newspaper Publishers Association said a meeting of 21 editors unanimously rejected the proposal in the Calcutt report on press freedom for statutory regulation. But they agreed that wider membership of the commission should be accompanied by changes to its code of practice to safeguard against eavesdropping and bugging. The editors agreed also to consider a proposal from some newspapers that appointments to the commission might be made by a body independent of the industry.</p>

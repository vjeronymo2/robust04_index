			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pirelli still in red at halftime PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, remained firmly in the red in the first six months of this year, in spite of continuing efforts to lower its break-even point by cutting costs. Net losses amounted to L62.7bn (Dollars 40m) against net earnings of L77bn last year. However, comparisons are clouded by extraordinary factors. Although Pirelli said it had only remained in profit for the first six months of 1992 because of extraordinary items and asset sales, this year's result was also boosted by a L72bn extraordinary gain. The gain represents part of the proceeds from the sale of Pirelli's shares and options in Continental, the bigger German rival it tried to take over in 1990-91. At the operating level, Pirelli claimed that this year's first-half net losses of L23bn were in line with last year's figure. Sales rose by 9 per cent to L4,640bn, largely because of the lower value of the lira, which inflated foreign earnings in lira terms. Group indebtedness remained little changed, while interest charges fell slightly and should continue to decline in the second half, the company said. Pirelli warned that the outlook for the rest of the year remains gloomy, meaning that trading in the second half is unlikely to show any improvement on the trend reported in the January-June period. Net results would continue to be affected by extraordinary factors, the company said, in particular, continuing heavy restructuring costs and write-downs.</p>

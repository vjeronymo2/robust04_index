			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Arts: Football? kick it around - Opera in Britain In 1994, as in the year past, acres of Carmen, Tosca, Fledermaus, Figaro and Magic Flute revivals are set to bulk out the schedules of the main British opera companies - in other words, long runs of the easy-to-mount popular favourites, forced on most of them as a means of survival in hard times. If you look hard enough, though, there are genuinely exciting things in prospect, tucked away in the midst of those schedules. Among these I would instance the Royal Opera's first-ever account of Rossini's Mose in Egitto (opening May 23) - that is to say, Rossini's Moses opera in its shorter, more consistent original (1818) Neapolitan form, rather than in its more familiar, looser-limbed later (1827) Parisian one. At Covent Garden this marvellous work, at once neo-Classical and early-Romantic in tone, is promised the fine cast - Anna Caterina Antonacci, Ann Murray, Bruce Ford, and Ruggero Raimondi in the title role - which all rare Rossini works need to persuade the unconvinced of their great merit. At the English National Opera the latest opera premiere is likely to be of special interest: Blond Eckbart (opening April 20), the third opera by Judith Weir. Her previous two - A Night at the Chinese Opera and The Vanishing Bridegroom - each gained a popular success unknown to the general run of new opera, and with just cause: Weir's is not just an original view of the musico-dramatic medium, but a captivating, commanding, utterly fresh and personal one, capable of creating in each dramatic work a whole new world and transporting even the most 'innocent', unlettered opera-goer into it. Another new opera that whets the appetite, this time from Opera North, is being touted as the first-ever 'football opera' - Benedict Mason's Playing Away (Leeds, from May 31), on a libretto by playwright Howard Brenton. Already Mason, a young English composer, has shown in a series of concert-works a quirky, madcap sense of humour that augurs well for his first venture into the opera house; and, even for those with no interest whatever in the subject, the hints of Faustian bargains-with-the-devil that are said to underlie the conception will surely add to the fascination. 1994 is, of course, the year that the new Glyndebourne Theatre opens its doors. It has 300 seats more than the old, and enlarged stage and audience facilities; but, in spite of that increased seating provision, for non-festival-members there is already probably small hope of getting seats (the festival repertory is made up of Figaro, The Rake's Progress, Peter Grimes, and new productions of Don Giovanni and Onegin), except by the usual stratagems of haunting the box office for returns. As times in Britain get ever harder for mounting fully fledged opera stagings, the attractions of concert performances are likely to increase for promoters. In London alone, in the first few months of the year, there is an unusual amount on exceptional fare offer. The BBC Symphony promises concert performances of Berg's Lulu (conducted by Andrew Davis) and, as part of a Luciano Berio festival, the first British outing of Berio's second opera, La vera storia. Verdi's Ernani comes on at the Festival Hall in March, given by the group Opera in Concert. Perhaps most welcome news of all, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra plans to continue its recently-forged, outstandingly successful link with the St Petersburg Kirov Opera and that company's remarkable chief, the conductor Valery Gergiev. Concert performances of two Rimsky-Korsakov rarities - Kashchey the Immortal and The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh - are in prospect next May, and impatiently awaited.</p>

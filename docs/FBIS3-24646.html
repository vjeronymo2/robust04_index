			<p>Although     Western media reported that Russian Liberal Democratic  Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was warmly received by large  numbers of Serbs at gatherings in eastern Bosnia and Montenegro, the  Belgrade media gave short shrift to his 27 January-4 February visit  to former Yugoslavia.  Tanjug and Belgrade radio devoted a moderate  amount of coverage to the visit, but Belgrade television, which  appears to be strictly controlled by Serbian President Slobodan  Milosevic, broadcast only scant reports of Zhirinovskiy's  activities.  After showing only brief glimpses of the Russian during  the first days of his visit, when he visited Serbian Orthodox  Patriarch Pavle for a closed-door meeting on the last day, Belgrade  television news merely mentioned the fact of the meeting over a  still photograph of the Belgrade cathedral (Belgrade TV, 2  February).  On the eve of Zhirinovskiy's visit to Belgrade, the  independent Belgrade daily Vecernje Novosti, which strongly supports  Serbian nationalism and Milosevic, published an interview that  appeared to be intended to poke fun at the Russian even if his  statements were quoted accurately.  In the interview, Zhirinovskiy  rambled and made statements that made him appear ignorant about  Yugoslav politics.  For example, he professed not to know that  Yugoslavia had a Federal president, Zoran Lilic, who is, in strictly  constitutional terms, superior in the political hierarchy to  Milosevic (Vecernje Novosti, 28 January).     Milosevic had reason to be wary of Zhirinovskiy's visit.  The  Serbian president most probably did not want to antagonize Russian  President Boris Yeltsin or Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who are  both actively engaged in seeking a solution to the crisis in former  Yugoslavia.  Moreover, Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj,  now a bitter opponent of Milosevic, served as Zhirinovskiy's host  while in Belgrade (Tanjug, 2 February).  Belgrade television rarely  reports on Seselj's activities and was unlikely to give much  coverage to any foreign visitor who embraced him, especially since  he is now causing Milosevic considerable difficulty in the Serbian  parliament. At the same time, in an apparent attempt to hold on to  the support of the radical Serbian nationalists without stirring  international ire, Milosevic ally Zeljko Raznjatovic-Arkan announced  at a 4 February press conference reported on by Belgrade radio, but  not Belgrade television, that his Party of Serbian Unity and  Zhirinovskiy's party had signed an agreement on "cooperation"  (Belgrade radio, 4 February).

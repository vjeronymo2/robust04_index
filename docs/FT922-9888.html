			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Observer: Treasury's new sinner 'It's a funny old world.' The famous words of the deposed Margaret Thatcher must be running through the head of top civil servant Robin Mountfield as he starts his new job this morning after 19 years at the Department of Trade and Industry An irrepressible inter- ventionist, he began his time at the DTI with such pleasures as taking the aerospace sector into state ownership. Then came the Thatcher era's privatisation of BL etc, which reduced him to grinning and bearing it. So imagine his delight on hearing that Mr Intervention himself, Michael Heseltine, was to take over as trade and industry secretary. Alas the news was almost immediately followed by the 52-year-old Mountfield's sideways transfer to the Treasury where state involvement with industry is viewed as a sin. There may nevertheless be compensations. After all, the Treasury job he is going to  - deputy secretary in charge of industry  - might well be done all the better for being filled with someone who can tell a milling machine from a coffee grinder. True, the last two incum- bents, Etonian Nick Monck and the deceptively languid Richard Wilson, were first-rate civil servants. But they failed to impress industrialists.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Switzerland heads for big deficit SWITZERLAND'S public sector will run up a deficit of over 3 per cent of gross domestic product this year, the finance ministry forecast yesterday. 'We must recognise that Switzerland is in danger of losing its reputation as an island of stability in public finance,' the ministry said in a statement supporting plans to cut spending and raise taxes. The federal deficit alone, originally forecast at SFr3.5bn (Dollars 2.44bn) this year, was expected to surpass SFr6bn and rise to SFr7.1bn next year. Revenues have slumped and social security spending soared during the three-year-long recession, but roughly half of the deficit was attributable to structural factors and would not disappear with a recovery. The government hoped to boost revenues with the introduction of a modest 6.5 per cent value added tax in 1995.</p>

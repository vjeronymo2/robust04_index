			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Growth predictions reduced for industrialised countries THE International Monetary Fund has again scaled back its forecasts of economic growth in industrialised countries, but expects much stronger activity in the developing world to serve as a locomotive for the world economy. IMF forecasts to be published this week project world economic growth in 1993 at 2.2 per cent, the same rate as in its last economic outlook in April. But the growth forecast for industrialised countries has been revised down to 1.1 per cent, compared with the 1.7 per cent the IMF expected in April, and 2.9 per cent a year ago. The forecast for the developing world, however, has improved to 6.1 per cent, against 5.1 per cent. 'It shows you where the locomotives now are in the world,' a senior IMF official said, noting developing countries' imports have been growing at a rate of 9 to 10 per cent a year for four years in a row. IMF officials recognise that their economic forecasts have in recent years proved wildly off target, failing to take adequate account of elements such as the bursting of the 1980s asset bubble in Japan and the US or the structural dimension of unemployment in Europe. While they believe that the world economy is now not far away from the upswing which at the start of the year they thought would come in the summer, they warn that nations must draw the lessons of the current recession in order to be better prepared for the next downturn.</p>

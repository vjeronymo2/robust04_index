			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ASB alters rules for debt repurchase NEW RULES on the tax treatment to be adopted when a company repurchases its own debt were issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board. The change prompted Scottish Power to announce a net charge of Pounds 10.4m in its most recent set of accounts. The rules contained in an ASB abstract follow work by the Urgent Issues Task Force, a unit designed to clamp down quickly on ambiguities or abuses in existing standards. They require any premium or discount incurred in repurchase of debt to be written off in the year in which it is incurred, rather than amortising any premium or discount over the period of the original life of the debt. The only exceptions are when replacement borrowing gives the same economic result as the original borrowing and there has been no change of substance in the debt. Companies are not required to implement the changes until accounting years ending on or after June 22 1993, but Scottish Power opted to take the charge in its 1992-93 accounts. The company repurchased Pounds 142m of government debt in November 1992. There was a 'significant cost saving for the company in using cash to replace expensive, long term debt bearing interest at 11.856 per cent per year,' explained Mr Duncan Whyte, finance director.</p>

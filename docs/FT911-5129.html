			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: US Home files for Chapter 11 protection US HOME Corporation, the troubled Houston-based housebuilder, yesterday filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - after months of negotiations with its bankers failed to achieve a debt restructuring. During recent months, Home, one of the largest housebuilders in the US, has been trying to win the agreement of 17 banks for a restructuring of a Dollars 156m unsecured revolving credit facility. Discussions have been under way for almost one year. Yesterday, US Home said the necessary unanimous agreement among the banks could not be attained, and it considered that 'an acceptable debt restructuring could best be achieved' through Chapter 11. It declined to say how close it came to agreement with the banking group, or where the obstacles lay. The Houston housebuilder has secured an additional Dollars 65m-plus of funds, through debtor-in-possession financing. This is often made available when a company files for Chapter 11, with the new lenders ranking well to the front of the repayment queue. This, according to Home, 'will provide additional funding for the homebuilding operations during the time needed for the restructuring'. Home built about 4,800 units last year, and ranks within the top 10 US housebuilding groups. In recent years, the company has been attempting to cut costs, but its figures have still been affected by write-offs and litigation over houses built more than a decade ago. In 1990, the company saw sales of Dollars 610m, but made a net loss of Dollars 101m after write-offs.</p>

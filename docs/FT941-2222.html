			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tesco plans Pounds 12m investment in Hungary Tesco is to become the first UK food retailer to invest in eastern Europe. It is negotiating a Pounds 12m investment in Global, a regional food retailer in Hungary. It will be Tesco's second move into continental Europe after buying the Catteau chain in northern France for Pounds 175m last year. The company said in January that it was looking at new business opportunities both in the UK and overseas when it announced it was cutting back its UK expansion programme. Tesco plans to buy a 45 per cent stake in Global when it raises capital and floats on the Budapest stock exchange next month, as part of the government's privatisation programme. The company said it had been watching eastern Europe for several years and had chosen Hungary as it 'appears to have developed furthest towards a market economy'. Two continental European retailers, Austria's Julius Meinl and Germany's Tengelmann, already have operations in Hungary, but food retailing is dominated by small regional chains, many state-owned. Global made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 25m last year, from 43 stores totalling 100,000 sq ft. 'This is small beer for us - less than the cost of building one UK superstore - but it gives us a window on what is going on there,' Tesco said.</p>

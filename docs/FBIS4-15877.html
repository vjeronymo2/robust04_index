			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 9 TASS -- Now that almost eight years  have passed since the Chernobyl catastrophe, mortality rate has  exceeded birth rate in Central European part of Russia.    Situation in the Bryansk region mirrors that in other  regions, which were exposed to the Chernobyl fallout, said Petr  Kuzmin, head of the radiological medicine department of the  public health board under the Bryansk regional administration.  Almost 500,000 inhabitants of the Bryansk region live in the  territory polluted with radionuclides. Since 1990, mortality  rate has exceeded birth rate by six persons per 1,000 (in some  districts, by 10 persons per 1,000). General morbidity has  grown markedly over the years - a fact related to undermined  immune systems.    Complications registered at pregnancy and childbirth have  increased threefold, and the number of congenital anomalies and  malignant tumors have doubled over the past five years. The  incidence of the thyroid gland cancer has increased fivefold.  Before 1987, there had not been a single case of a child  suffering from the disease on record in the region, whereas at  present local endocrinologists and oncologists are dealing with  20 such cases. In expert opinion, the incidence of oncological  and hereditary diseases will continue to grow over the next  10-15 years.</p>

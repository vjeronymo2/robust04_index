			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Phelps Dodge drops to Dollars 76.9m PHELPS DODGE, the largest US copper producer, saw operating income for its mining operations drop in the first quarter to Dollars 76.9m from Dollars 113m a year ago, Reuter reports. The group, which manufactures truck wheels and rims and is a leading producer of carbon black, reported first-quarter net income down to Dollars 53.6m or Dollars 1.53 per share, compared with Dollars 77.3m or Dollars 2.23 a year ago. It said first-quarter earnings were satisfactory in spite of continued slow economies in many of its markets. Group revenues for the quarter declined to Dollars 590.5m from Dollars 601.8m, while Phelps Dodge Mining saw its revenues slip to Dollars 301.5m, compared with Dollars 314m a year ago. Phelps cited lower copper prices and the closure of concentrator operations at its Tyrone, New Mexico mine for the reduction in mining profits. It added that reduced worldwide demand caused first-quarter copper prices to average about 11 cents less than a year ago. Phelps Dodge Industries reported an improvement in operating income, to Dollars 20.3m from Dollars 16.8m a year ago. The company said its share of copper production from worldwide operations was 123,100 tons in the first quarter, compared with 130,400 tons a year ago. Copper sales from mine production were 127,700 tons, down from 138,500 tons a year ago.</p>

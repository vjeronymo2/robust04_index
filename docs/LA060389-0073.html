			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> FLORIDA STATE, WICHITA STATE WIN IN FIRST ROUND  </P> <P> With seven of the nation's 10 winningest pitchers present, this year's College  World Series has been billed as "A Call to Arms."  </P> <P> And as the eight-team tournament got under way Friday in warm, muggy weather,  pitchers dominated as expected.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Florida State defeated North Carolina, 4-2, and Wichita State beat  Arkansas, 3-1, before a crowd of 14,039 at Rosenblatt Stadium, where slugfests  have been common.  </P> <P> For the second year, the eight-team field is broken into East and West brackets  that will be played with a double-elimination format. Winners of each bracket  will advance to a one-game final June 10.  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach (50-13) will play Texas (51-17), and Miami (48-16) will  play Louisiana State (53-15) today in the first round of West Bracket games.  </P> <P> Florida State (53-16) will play Wichita State (64-15), and North Carolina  (41-17-1) will play Arkansas (50-15) in East Bracket games Sunday.  </P> <P> Wichita State Coach Gene Stephenson predicted that the hitting will intensify  as the tournament progresses.  </P> <P> "First-day jitters affect hitters more than pitchers," Stephenson said.  </P> <P> However, unlike the regional playoffs, which feature consecutive-day playing  schedules and doubleheaders that can drain a pitching staff, the World Series  uses an every-other-day format that should keep top pitchers available.  </P> <P> Florida State and Miami both have staff earned-run averages of under 3.00.  Texas, at 4.26, is the only team with a staff ERA higher than 4.00.  </P> <P> Because of his team's pitching depth, Florida State Coach Mike Martin was able  to rest staff ace Clyde Keller (12-0, 2.63 ERA) and go instead with Gar  Finnvold against the Tar Heels.  </P> <P> Finnvold, a junior right-hander, gave up four hits and struck out five in 7 1/3  innings to improve to 10-3.  </P> <P> Finnvold gave up two hits and a run in the first, then yielded only one hit  over the next six innings.  </P> <P> "My slider was working real well," Finnvold said. "Once you get the slider  over, that's a real confidence-builder. From then on I was able to spot my  fastball."  </P> <P> Florida State led, 4-1, when Finnvold gave way to Ricky Kimball with one out  and runners at second and third in the eighth.  </P> <P> Kimball walked Tom Nevin to load the bases and Brad Woodall hit a sacrifice fly  to center to make the score 4-2. Kimball then hit Ron Maurer to load the bases  but North Carolina catcher Jesse Levis flied out to left, ending the threat.  </P> <P> Kimball retired the side in order in the ninth to earn his ninth save.  </P> <P> North Carolina pitcher John Thoden (12-1) gave up six hits in 7 1/3 innings,  including a second-inning home run by Florida State designated hitter Buddy  Cribb that tied the score, 1-1.  </P> <P> Florida State went ahead, 3-1, in the third on Bob Reboin's single that scored  Rocky Rau, who had singled to lead off the inning and moved to third on a  double by Pedro Grifol. Brian Gilliland then grounded into a double play,  enabling Grifol to score.  </P> <P> The Seminoles scored their final run in the seventh when Rob Bargas scored from  third on an errant pick-off throw by Levis.  </P> <P> In the second game, Wichita State starter Greg Brummett (16-2), a senior  All-American right-hander, gave up only four hits in 7 1/3 innings before  giving way to Jim Newlin, who earned his nation-leading 16th save.  </P> <P> "My fastball kept me in the game," said Brummett, who lasted only 1 1/3 innings  against Arkansas in February in the Shockers' season-opener. "I moved it in on  them, making them pound it into the ground."  </P> <P> The Shockers scored first, in the fourth inning when Jim Audley hit a two-run  homer off starter Mark Swope (7-1), who gave up five hits and struck out five  in six innings.  </P> <P> Arkansas scored its only run in the sixth when Greg D'Alexander hit a Brummett  slider over the left-field wall.  </P> <P> Pat Meares scored Wichita State's final run, in the eighth, when he came home  from third on a wild pitch by reliever Mike Oquist.  </P> <P> College World Series Notes  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach Coach Dave Snow was selected as coach of the year by the  newspaper Collegiate Baseball. Snow led Long Beach to a 50-13 record and its  first berth in the College World Series after last season's 14-45 finish. . . .  Snow is the fourth head coach to bring two different teams to the World Series.  In 1986, Snow led Loyola Marymount to Omaha. . . . Andy Croghan (12-0, 3.09  ERA), a freshman right-hander from Yorba Linda, will start tonight for Long  Beach against Texas. Sophomore right-hander Kirk Dressendorfer (16-2, 2.46)  will start for the Longhorns. . . . Junior left-hander Kyle Abbott (15-2, 2.37)  will start for Long Beach on Monday against either Miami or Louisiana State,  who play each other tonight.  </P></p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd claims victory on Europe MR DOUGLAS HURD yesterday claimed victory over the Tory opponents of closer European integration as he sketched out Britain's post-Maastricht agenda for the future of the European Community. With the government confident of victory in the crucial third-reading vote on the Maastricht bill in the Commons next Thursday  - assuming that the Danes vote Yes in their second referendum next Tuesday  - Mr Hurd said the Tory party should look back on the wrangling as a 'bad dream'. He said that the opponents of Maastricht were 'genuinely haunted'. But, he added, 'in the light of day things look different'. Representatives at the Scottish Conservative conference voted overwhelmingly for a motion supporting Mr Hurd's stance on Europe, in spite of a stinging attack on the Maastricht treaty by Mr Bill Walker, the Tory MP for Tayside North. Underlining the determination of the Foreign Office to ensure that Britain has a leading role in shaping the next intergovernmental conference in 1996, Mr Hurd dismissed the idea that transformation in Europe wrought by the ending of the cold war would reduce the role of the Community. He said: 'In the new Europe the role of the Community as a political anchor and an economic motor has become more, not less, important.' In a phrase calculated to emphasise his personal commitment to European co-operation, the foreign secretary added: 'In terms of the history of Europe the Community is still in its infancy.' Mr Hurd said that the enlargement of the Community, first to 16 nations and eventually to 20 or more, meant that it could not work on the same basis as one of 12. But that should not weaken the existing core policies. Direct co-operation between national governments  - as in existing frameworks for foreign and crime policies  - would allow new areas of joint action. But there would also be scope for groups of states to choose to work together on different subjects. Former Tory foreign secretary Lord Howe last night accused former prime minister Lady Thatcher of doing everything in her power to undermine the government's policy on Maastricht. Lord Howe said that what she, Lord Tebbit and other anti-Maastricht campaigners were doing was 'contrary to the interests of the country and of Europe'.</p>

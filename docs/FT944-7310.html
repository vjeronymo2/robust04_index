			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / MP's bill to target proceeds of crime Sir John Hannam, Conservative MP for Exeter, is expected to introduce a bill giving the courts powers to confiscate assets built up through criminal activities - after coming third in the annual ballot for private members' bills. Speaking after the ballot yesterday, Sir John said he was 'minded' to adopt what will be widely regarded as an off-the-peg bill provided by the Home Office. If he goes ahead with the measure there is little doubt that it will secure widespread support. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has already promised that his department will provide 'every help' in drafting the measure. The bill would ensure that when people have engaged in a series of crimes, the courts will be able to assume that all the property that has passed through the criminal's hands in the previous six years came from crime. They will be empowered to confiscate its value. The bill will also prevent the defendant from frustrating a confiscation order by serving a term of imprisonment in default. Mrs Diana Maddock, Liberal Democrat MP for Christchurch, who came first in the ballot, may introduce an energy conservation bill targeted at domestic premises. Mr David Jamieson, Labour MP for Devonport, who came second, plans to introduce a measure imposing more stringent safety standards on outdoor adventure centres which provide canoeing and other sporting activities for schools.</p>

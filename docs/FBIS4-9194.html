			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of the Serb  Republic Radovan Karadzic today sent an open letter to the  leaders of Russia, the United States, China, France, and the UK  saying that an opportunity has now arisen to reach a final  solution to the crisis in Bosnia.    In his letter to Presidents Yeltsin, Clinton, Jiang Zemin,  Mitterrand, and Prime Minister John Major, a copy of which has  been forwarded to TANJUG, the president of the Serb Republic  said that Serbs unilaterally proclaimed a cease-fire, but  Muslims did not want it.    "Both sides, not only one, must support peace and end this  war," Karadzic said. "In its effort to attain a balance of power  on the ground, the international community is only prolonging  the war. At the same time sanctions and threats against Serbs  are encouraging Muslims to remain on the war path."    In his letter to the five statesmen, Karadzic says Western  countries keep repeating that their approach to the conflict was  a mistake, even that some mistakes were repeated, some of them  being even more serious.    "The latest American initiative was a fatal mistake, because  the starting point was a presupposition that the Sarajevo model  of pacification could be applied to all safe areas. However,  this is not possible because of geographical and other reasons.  The American initiative could create a situation of 'neither  war nor peace'; it would lengthen rathen than end the conflict."    "We believe the only way of achieving instant peace would be  to proclaim the entire territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina a  safe area, taking into consideration two realities -- one is the  Muslim- Croat federation and the other is the Serb Republic,"  said Karadzic.    The Serb proposal, stressed Karadzic, aims to establish a  general cessation of hostilities. This means, he adds in the  letter, an instant cease-fire and the cessation of all military  actions, followed by the separation of forces and by  negotiations.    "The end of the war is only possible through a political  agreement," Karadzic said, adding that the agreement could only  be possible if the fighting stopped.    "The general cessation of hostilities is therefore the only  solution," said Karadzic in his letter to the five statesmen  whose countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council.</p>

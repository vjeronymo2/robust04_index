			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya, Vladimir Todres report in the "North </F> Caucasus" column: "Chechnya Welcomes Its Hero"]    [Excerpt] On 11 March the State Duma will discuss the  situation in Chechnya. Sergey Shakhray is expected to make a  report. His position is well known: Chechnya can be de facto  brought back into the Russian Federation by concluding a treaty  with it based on the Russian-Tatarstan agreement. An obligatory  condition for the start of negotiations, however, must be free  elections in Chechnya -- with the participation of the  anti-Dudayev opposition.    At present, according to the minister, "not a single  political force controls the situation in the republic" and  therefore there is simply no one to come to terms with. Yet  even if elections are held, this will hardly make things easier  for Russia: according to local observers, none of the local  politicians can match Dzhokhar Dudayev's authority. No one --  except Ruslan Khasbulatov, who has returned to his mother's home.    In spite of the fact that on 15 September 1991 Ruslan  Khasbulatov, who was then chairman of the Russian Supreme  Soviet, blessed Dzhokhar Dudayev to lead the Chechen Republic,  now the ungrateful Chechen leader is in no hurry to meet him.  As Chechnya Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev told INTERFAX,  no official meetings have been planned with the former speaker  of the Russian parliament, but if Mr. Khasbulatov insists, such  meetings could be arranged. Furthermore the vice president was  rather skeptical over the prospect of Ruslan Khasbulatov's  working in Chechnya as an economist: "He has never dealt with  economics. It is another matter that he has studied the  political economy of the West, but these are quite different  things." In his opinion, the former Russian Federation Supreme  Soviet speaker will not engage in politics, let alone join the  Chechen opposition. [passage omitted]</p>

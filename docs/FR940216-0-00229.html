			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (10) Specify in the product transfer documentation for the RBOB each oxygenate type or types and amount or range of amounts which is consistent with the designation of the RBOB as any-oxygenate, or ether-only, and which, if blended with the RBOB will result in reformulated gasoline which:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Has VOC, toxics, or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions reduction percentages which are no lower than the percentages that formed the basis for the refiner's or importer's compliance determination for these parameters;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Has a benzene content and RVP level which are no higher than the values for these characteristics that formed the basis for the refiner's or importer's compliance determinations for these parameters; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Will not cause the reformulated gasoline to violate any standard specified in &sect;80.41.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements for oxygenate blenders. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For all RBOB received by any oxygenate blender, the oxygenate blender shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Add oxygenate of the type(s) and amount (or within the range of amounts) specified in the product transfer documents for the RBOB;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Designate each batch of the resulting reformulated gasoline as meeting the oxygen standard per-gallon or on average;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Meet the standard requirements specified in &sect;80.65(c) and &sect;80.67(e), the record keeping requirements specified in &sect;80.74, and the reporting requirements specified in &sect;80.75; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In the case of each batch of reformulated gasoline which is designated for compliance with the oxygen standard on average:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Determine the volume and the weight percent oxygen of the batch using the testing methodology specified in &sect;80.46;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Assign a number to the batch (the ``batch number''), beginning with the number one for the first batch produced each calendar year and each subsequent batch during the calendar year being assigned the next sequential number, and such numbers to be preceded by the oxygenate blender's registration number, the facility number, and the second two digits of the year in which the batch was produced (e.g., 4321&hyph;4321&hyph;95&hyph;001, 4321&hyph;4321&hyph;95&hyph;002, etc.); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Meet the compliance audit requirements specified in &sect;80.65(h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional requirements for terminal storage tank blending. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any oxygenate blender who produces reformulated gasoline by blending any oxygenate with any RBOB in any gasoline storage tank, other than a truck used for delivering gasoline to retail outlets or wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities, shall, for each batch of reformulated gasoline so produced determine the oxygen content and volume of this gasoline prior to the gasoline leaving the oxygenate blending facility, using the methodology specified in &sect;80.46.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional requirements for distributors dispensing RBOB into trucks for blending. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any distributor who dispenses any RBOB into any truck which delivers gasoline to retail outlets or wholesale purchaser-consumer facilities, shall for such RBOB so dispensed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Transfer the RBOB only to an oxygenate blender who has registered with the Administrator of EPA as such;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Transfer any RBOB designated as ether-only RBOB only if the distributor has a reasonable basis for knowing the oxygenate blender will blend an oxygenate other than ethanol with the RBOB; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Obtain from the oxygenate blender the oxygenate blender's EPA registration number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional requirements for oxygenate blenders who blend oxygenate in trucks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any oxygenate blender who obtains any RBOB in any gasoline delivery truck shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) On each occasion it obtains RBOB from a distributor, supply the distributor with the oxygenate blender's EPA registration number;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Conduct a quality assurance sampling and testing program to determine whether the proper type and amount of oxygenate is added to RBOB. The program shall be conducted as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) All samples shall be collected subsequent to the addition of oxygenate, and either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Prior combining the resulting gasoline with any other gasoline; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Subsequent to the delivery of the gasoline to a retail outlet or wholesale purchaser-consumer facility provided that the three most recent deliveries to the retail outlet or wholesale purchaser facility were of gasoline that was produced by that oxygenate blender and that had the same oxygenate requirements, and provided that any discrepancy in oxygenate type or amount found through the retail outlet or wholesale purchaser facility sampling is followed-up with measures reasonably designed to discover the cause of the discrepancy;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Sampling and testing shall be at one of the following rates:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) In the case computer-controlled in-line blending is used, a rate of not less than one sample per each five hundred occasions RBOB and oxygenate are loaded into a truck by that oxygenate blender, or one sample every three months, whichever is more frequent; or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

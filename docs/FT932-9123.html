			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Yeltsin hails 'breakthrough' in CIS meeting BORIS Yeltsin, the Russian president, claimed a 'breakthrough' in the development of the Commonwealth of Independent States after meeting his fellow heads of state in Moscow yesterday, John Lloyd reports. Mr Yeltsin claimed that all but one of the members of the CIS - the gas-rich Central Asian state of Turkmenistan - had agreed to the creation of an economic union. However, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president who has continued to take a sceptical view of the CIS, said after the meeting: 'We have only signed a declaration. We have not created an economic union yet'. Mr Yeltsin said that an Inter-Republican Bank would be set up from October 1, while a customs and currency union would be set up to work in parallel with it. The RIA news agency said last night that it was expected that a consultative and co-ordinating commission, together with an executive secretariat, would also be created to service the new economic union.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Letter: Perfection and emotion of Kodo Drummers Sir, I must question whether Anthony Thorncroft actually attended the performance of Kodo Drummers (Arts, May 12) or whether his article was compiled from reference to the programme only. Perfection and emotion permeate the entire performance, and the solos that use 'traditional instruments' such as flute and shamisen only serve to highlight the truly musical qualities of the drums. I appreciate that two hours of Japanese influenced rhythms may not appeal to everyone, yet despite the power of the drums, which at times seemed to re-regulate your heartbeat, none of the other members of the audience, including a number of children, seemed to be remotely disturbed. Reviews should be objective, but to intimate that this performance would only be enjoyed by 'anyone interested in drumming' is insulting to the cultural open-mindedness of the west. Some may find it boring, but I doubt many will. If you are, you can always leave. James McAuley, VAG (United Kingdom), 14 Abbey Road, Bradwell Village, Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire MK13 9AL</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Arts: Davidson's 'Sinderella' - Pantomime Sinderella, Jim Davidson's adult pantomime, does not mess about. Within the first minute happy panto words like 'fairy' and 'ball' are given the broadest possible meaning. Anyone looking for subtlety and wit is in for a bumpy ride. There is a good argument for taking the soppiness out of panto, standing what has become a sanitised, politically correct, institution, on its head. Unfortunately this is not a good argument, but a perverse rant, a dive behind the infant school lavatory rather than a voyage of sophisticated innuendo: 'innuendo' being an Italian suppository in Jim-speak. But if you stick it out there are some glimmers of gold in the vulgarity. Roger Kitter and Dave Lee give some meat to the Ugly Sisters, who in most pantos these days are reduced to ridiculous clothes horses. Occasionally they get high on ad libs, building up to ever more barbed insults, mainly directed at 1960s heart throb Jess Conrad's Prince Charming, who is cruelly asked to sing a 'medley of your hit'. There is also simple pleasure to be had in adding up the ages of the cast. Jim Davidson must be running a charity for indigent actors. As well as Conrad, who manages to keep his smile in place despite the inconvenience of a giant dildo in his tights, there is Dianne Lee, relict of Peters and Lee, who simpers gamely as Cinders, even when Davidson reminisces about being taken by his mother to see her sing. Most remarkable of all, Charlie Drake has been wheeled out of obscurity as Baron Hardon. 'A test pilot for Johnny Walker' according to Jim, Charlie is supposed to be in a state of senile bewilderment, mixing his 'Chippendales' with his 'Chipperfields', and the object of easy laughter. I fear many of the gags are planted and Drake's detached sneer was often an apt comment on the shenanigans. The sets and costumes are lavish; the plot faithfully followed, down to a terminally unfunny haunted house sketch and the flattest ballet scene in pantomime history. And if you want your mind stretched by watching three naked men hide their embarrassment behind leaky balloons this is your show. There was no free press access. Perhaps it only seemed so sad and brutal because the tickets are expensive. The audience, including many theatrical virgins, were shocked into submission. They probably thought it was a normal night in the West End rather than one man's curious ego trip. At the Cambridge Theatre</p>

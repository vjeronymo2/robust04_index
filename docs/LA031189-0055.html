			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAMSTERS, JUSTICE DEPT. PLAN FINAL EFFORT TO SETTLE SUIT  </P> <P> Lawyers for the Teamsters and the Justice Department will hold last-ditch  negotiations this weekend aimed at settling the government's massive  racketeering case against the 1.6-million-member union, according to  knowledgeable sources.  </P> <P> On Friday, a substantial majority of the Teamsters executive board condemned a  separate settlement made by three board members earlier this week.  </P> <P> The board resolution, passed in Washington, states that the three members'  settlement "interfered with and impeded" the Teamsters in the union's defense  against a racketeering suit filed by the Justice Department seeking to impose a  federal trusteeship over the union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Censures 3 Members  </P> <P> The resolution, in effect, censures Teamster Secretary-Treasurer Weldon L.  Mathis, the second-highest official in the union, and Vice Presidents Edward  Lawson of Vancouver, B.C., and Donald L. West of Birmingham, Ala., for  "self-serving actions." They were the only three members of the 19-member board  who voted against the resolution, according to sources who attended the  meeting.  </P> <P> No member of the executive board was available for comment. However, Barry  Feinstein, president of a large New York City Teamster local and director of  the union's public employee division, decried the actions of Mathis and the  others.  </P> <P> "The union is in a fight for its life," Feinstein said in a telephone  interview. "We expect that the executive board will be together, rally 'round  the flag, like Democrats and Republicans would do if we had an invasion from a  foreign country."  </P> <P> Feinstein, a 32-year veteran of the union, said he could remember no prior  occasion where the union's executive board had publicly chastised some of its  members in this way.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the executive board declined to take any disciplinary action  against the three men for fear of being held in contempt by U.S. District Judge  David N. Edelstein. On Wednesday, Edelstein had ordered the board to call him  by 1 p.m. Friday and inform him whether it had taken any action against the  three men, prior to his granting formal approval to the settlement the three  men arranged with the Justice Department. He approved the agreement later  Friday.  </P> <P> Another source close to the board said "the mood in the board meeting was that  they (Mathis, West and Lawson) had undercut the other defendants and weakened  them in their negotiations (with the government) by not staying together."  </P> <P> The agreements the three men signed call for reforms in the union's election  procedures and, if the government prevails in its case, the creation of an  ethical practices committee to combat corruption in the union. The three union  officials also agreed not to knowingly associate with the Mafia or any other  criminal group.  </P> <P> None of the three men had to give up their union posts as a condition of  settlement. Nor did they agree to testify for the government at trial. In fact,  Mathis said he would testify for the union if union lawyers asked him.  </P> <P> In late January, three elderly Teamster vice presidents -- Robert H. Holmes of  Detroit, Maurice R. Schurr of Philadelphia and John Cleveland of Washington --  settled with the Justice Department and agreed to resign from the union. They  were not criticized by their fellow board members. A source close to the board  said the difference in reaction to the two groups of men was accounted for by  the fact that Mathis, West and Lawson plan to stay active in the union.  </P> <P> Unless agreement is reached this weekend, a bevy of lawyers for the union and  the Justice Department will meet at the courthouse in New York's Foley Square  on Monday.  </P> <P> The Justice Department suit, filed last June under the Racketeer-Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations Act, asserts that the Teamsters are dominated by  organized criminal elements and seeks court supervision of the union until new  officers can be chosen in a "free and fair election."  </P></p>

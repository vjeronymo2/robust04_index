			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Era of low retail margins forecast RETAILERS will have to restructure their businesses to cope with a permanent era of low margins, according to a report from the Verdict retail consultancy. The report sees weak demand and overcapacity continuing to depress the sector's profitability for the foreseeable future. It says the pound's devaluation will not spur an immediate rise in retail price inflation for three reasons: Retailers can ill afford to pass on price rises when consumer demand is so weak. Many retailers have bought forward their goods for several months ahead and will only slowly feel an inflationary squeeze. Retailers will review their sourcing arrangements and increasingly switch to buying UK-manufactured goods. The report says that companies such as Marks and Spencer, which buys more than 80 per cent of its products in its home market, will be better able to resist inflationary pressures. The report predicts inflation in shop prices remaining steady at about 4 per cent for the next year, rising to just over 5 per cent by 1996. In the food retailing sector, the report predicts that J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway will increasingly dominate the superstore market. Verdict on Retailing 1996. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London. WC1V 6JS. Pounds 950.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Construction output rising in Europe A modest and fragile recovery has begun in western European construction markets but output is unlikely to approach previous high levels, according to forecasts from 15 countries. Euro-Construct, a federation of European Construction Research Agencies and Economic Forecasting bodies say that output in the region is likely to fall by just 0.1 per cent this year before rising by 1.9 per cent next year.* It will be the first overall rise reported since 1990, although individual countries such as Germany have increased construction output during the period. The value of western European construction output next year, forecast at Ecu657.5bn (Pounds 506bn), would still be almost 3 per cent lower than 1990 output. Output in West Germany by comparison is forecast to be 11 per cent higher next year than at the beginning of the decade. The growth in eastern German construction activity, since the country was unified, is even more striking and is forecast by Euro-Construct to increase by a further 16 per cent this year and by 12.5 per cent next year. The boom in activity is being led by construction and renovation of flats and houses and is forecast to rise by almost a third in eastern Germany this year and a further fifth in 1995. Residential construction in western Germany is forecast to rise by 7.6 per cent over the next two years as the region seeks to house large numbers of immigrants, mostly from eastern Europe. Other European countries, which saw a sharp fall in construction activity in the early 1990s, are expected to enjoy a small recovery over the next 18 months as housing markets in particular benefit from lower interest rates. Governments in France, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Portugal and Switzerland have raised subsidies or introduced tax or other measures to encourage building and renovation of homes, which generates large numbers of jobs as well as improving the housing stock, says Euro-Construct. Sweden, conversely, is seeking to reduce the high cost of its housing subsidies. Residential construction, down 29.9 per cent last year, is forecast to fall a further 59.3 per cent this year and 6 per cent in 1995. High unemployment will also put a brake on the pace of housing recovery, with 17.4m people estimated to be still out of work in the 15 countries. Euro-Construct expects construction output to rise as economies recover with housing and repair, maintenance and improvement work the early beneficiaries. Public spending however is likely to remain under pressure. Private non-residential construction output, of offices, shops, factories and warehouses, is forecast to fall by a further 8 per cent this year across the region but rise by 2.5 per cent next year as the large amounts of empty office space start to be occupied. *European Construction Trends 1994-95; from Construction Forecasting and Research, Princes House, 39 Kingsway WC2B 6TP; Pounds 390.  ----------------------------------------------------------------               PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF TOTAL CONSTRUCTION                  OUTPUT IN WEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Country           1991   1991   1992    1993     1994/95*  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Austria            4.4    5.2    1.7     2.4        2.2 Belgium            3.0    4.8   -4.0     1.5        3.5 Denmark           -9.1   -0.8   -4.6     5.5        2.2 Finland            -14    -17    -16      -3         -7 France             0.3     -3     -6    -1.3        2.1 Germany**            -      -    3.1     4.0        4.0 Ireland             -2    0.2    0.1     6.9        6.0 Italy              1.6    0.8   -5.7    -2.0        1.0 Norway            -4.8    n/c   -3.1     3.2        3.0 Portugal           4.5    2.5    n/c     1.0        6.5 Spain              4.0   -6.0   -8.1     1.0        1.5 Sweden            -3.3   -5.7   -9.5    -8.0        0.4 Switzerland       -5.6   -2.3   -4.6    -0.1        2.5 Netherlands       -2.0    3.0   -4.0     n/c        2.0 United Kingdom    -6.9   -3.7   -1.9     0.5        1.3 Total              n/c   -0.3   -4.1    -0.1        1.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------- * 1994/95 figures are projections. **1991 and 1992 figures omitted as for west Germany only.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source EuroConstruct.  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

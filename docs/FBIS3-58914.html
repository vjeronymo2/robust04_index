"The reactions of  Muslims, Croats and Serbs have left little room for optimism"  Italy's diplomatic chief said here during a debate on the  ex-Yugoslavia, adding how they seem more "prone to military  confrontations" than accepting the European plan for  three-republic confederation.    The Muslims, he added, appear to have now also adopted the  negotiations as a tool to buy time to re-conquer lost territory,  and gaining influence among them were "external" forces and  local "fundamentalist tendencies."    Also taking part in the debate, organized by the Rome  vicariate, was Cardinal Roger Etchegaray who underscored how a  peace based on land swapping could not be a long lasting one.    In Geneva, the self-proclaimed Serb and Croat republics in  Bosnia-Herzegovina announced how they had hammered out an  agreement to "sign a long-lasting peace" and establish "official  relations...in the interest of promoting economic and political  ties" adding how "no bilateral problems exist which cannot be  resolved through peace means."    The official negotiations in Geneva on Bosnia, mediated by  the European Union and the United Nations, were postponed today  until February 10, with the European Union's chief mediator,  David Owen, underscoring how "the situation is very dangerous  and serious" and that negotiation must continue.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Second quarter results revive Mexican equities - But the market could remain vulnerable until the US presidential race is over Mexico's stock market has finally received the good news it needed. Second quarter results were better than analysts' expectations, and the market index reached 1,551 by yesterday's close, 5.7 per cent up from Monday's low. The results themselves were uneven, and judged good mainly by those who had feared the worst. Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), the telephone monopoly that accounts for about 30 per cent of the index, reported net profits of Dollars 1.16bn in the first half, a 5.4 per cent increase on the same period last year. If the non-recurring losses are excluded, however, net profits would have risen by 18 per cent, according to the company's finance director. Fears that Telmex was going to report very heavy foreign exchange losses turned out to be unfounded. In the event, the group lost just Dollars 70m in the second quarter on foreign exchange. Many favourite companies of foreign investors repaid the faith shown in them. Televisa, ICA, and Grupo Carso announced rapid earnings growth that appears to justify the above-average multiples on which they trade. And although the large industrial conglomerates - Alfa, Vitro and Cydsa - produced flat or reduced earnings, the bad news was already discounted, and in most cases their share prices rose after the results were published. The past days' relative calm contrasts sharply with last week, when the market fell 9 per cent. While June's 15.5 per cent drop was triggered by the then prevailing popularity of Mr Ross Perot in the US presidential stakes, an over-supply of new issues and rising interest rates, July's fall was related more to concern about specific companies. The market was knocked off balance by Cemex's acquisition of Spain's largest cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson, announced during the first two weeks of the month. Many foreign investors felt cheated, as Cemex failed to mention such plans when selling Dollars 608m of new equity earlier in the year. Investors had bought Cemex because its earnings were geared to Mexico's fast-growing economy, so they sold as soon as it became clear that some 40 per cent of sales were going to come from Spain. Cemex's share price had fallen more than 25 per cent this month, until the recent rally. Rumours that newly formed financial groups had suffered losses on government bonds they had bought added to the jitters. Early reports put losses at more than Dollars 1bn, and some feared that brokerages would sell equity holdings to make up losses. In the event the government put the accounting losses at Dollars 235m for banks and brokerages, about half what many analysts had expected. With first-half results out of the way, some analysts are predicting another surge in prices. The stock market is cheap compared to a few months ago, with Telmex selling at 8.5 times this year's earnings, according to Mr Jorge Suarez, head of Latin American equity research at Nomura Research. The government appears to be winning against inflation, which could pave the way for lower interest rates. Inflation was just 0.3 per cent in the first two weeks of July. Negotiations on the North American free trade agreement are likely to be concluded soon, perhaps early next week, giving a further fillip to the market. Equities, however, are not out of the woods yet. For all the optimism over second quarter results, consumer goods companies - such as VideoVisa, Femsa, Maseca, and Kimberly Clark - fared rather poorly, reflecting the slow growth in personal incomes, says Mr Pablo Riberoll at Baring Research. Above all, the political and economic situation in the US is likely to hang over the market until the US presidential election. 'Now more than ever,' warns one cautious broker, 'it is important to select companies rather than broad themes.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office is concerned. The  United States is definitely not sending evidence on drug  traffickers to Colombian authorities. Although there was no  official announcement, the truth is that, in practice, the  sanction is being applied. The Prosecutor General's Office has  not received a single piece of evidence against Colombian drug  traffickers from the United States for the past two months. The  last evidence received was against Julio Fabio Dinol and Miguel  Rodriguez Orejuela for drug trafficking.    According to Francisco Jose Cintura, the acting prosecutor,  the refusal to send information on drug traffickers is worrisome  because the evidence sent by the United States has been  overwhelming and has served to convict 17 individuals.    [Begin Cintura recording] The cooperation of the U.S.  Justice  Department has been important in consolidating several cases,  including those of the Ochoa brothers, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, and  17 individuals whose extradition was pending when the National  Constitutional Assembly banned extraditions. The U.S. Government  should carefully examine the decision because such a negative  decision can only benefit drug traffickers. [end recording]    Particularly in the cases against the Ochoa brothers, the  United States sent accusations of cocaine trafficking and the  testimony of U.S. drug traffickers who incriminated them. In  addition, it sent recordings of telephone conversations  intercepted by the DEA as evidence against certain Cali Cartel  members.    Although there is concern over the announcement by DEA  Investigations Director Robert Nieves to suspend the exchange of  evidence to Colombia, the Prosecutor General's Office not only  cooperates with the United States but also exchanges evidence  with Russia, Italy, Mexico, and Peru.</p>

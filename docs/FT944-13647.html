			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Insurer restricts business with Saudi Arabia Short-term export credit insurance for companies doing business in Saudi Arabia is being restricted by a leading international insurer. NCM Credit Insurance, the Dutch-controlled company which provides 80 per cent of short-term export credit cover in the UK, told customers it was taking the step because of the kingdom's 'very grave' financial situation and payments delays. Meanwhile, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said yesterday that Saudi Arabia was facing some 'credit problems', but added that the kingdom did not have any serious financial difficulties. Mr Bentsen, who visited Saudi Arabia earlier this month, said that the government was taking steps to bring down the budget deficit. NCM Credit Insurance told UK customers it was cancelling open account credit limit approvals and would only reinstate them if strict criteria were met. This means that cover to regular exporters will no longer be automatically available. The company added: 'We recognise the seriousness of these measures and their likely impact on the business of many of our customers. 'However, the situation in Saudi is very grave and continues to deteriorate. It is therefore vital that we take action to protect not only our own position but, in the final analysis, that of our customers.' International concern about Saudi Arabia's financial health has increased since the 1991 Gulf war, which cost the kingdom about Dollars 60bn, and because of the continuing weakness in the price of oil. In an effort to answer International Monetary Fund concerns over the size of the budget deficit, the Saudi government announced at the start of the year that it would cut spending by 20 per cent. A western diplomat in Riyadh conceded yesterday that many Saudi businessmen were pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook, but stressed that Saudi Arabia's ability to pump 8m barrels of oil a day for the next century guaranteed its long-term economic viability. NCM warned more than two months ago of its concern over lengthening payments delays and said amounts outstanding were 'significant'. It added that the payments delays were affecting all areas of the economy, and affecting Saudi buyers' ability to meet commitments to overseas suppliers. Since then, NCM said: 'The position has steadily deteriorated and the impact on the market has become ever more apparent.' It added: 'Repeated promises of payment from senior Saudi officials, including promises made directly to UK trade ministers, have not been fulfilled and there is no suggestion of an early improvement in the situation.'</p>

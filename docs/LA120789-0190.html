			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> CITY LISTS CHOICES FOR FEDERAL GRANTS  </P> <P> The City of La Habra will recommend that $321,000 in federal Community  Development Block Grant funds be allocated for local projects during the  1990-91 fiscal year.  </P> <P> Proposed projects include reconstruction of a portion of Hazel Street between  1st Avenue to a point just north of Erna Avenue; partial funding for the La  Habra Community Resources Care Center, Neighborhood Housing Services of La  Habra, the Gary Center, La Habra Local Development Co., and Neighborhood  Housing Services of La Habra; and funding for improvements to alleys near the  bus yard at the La Habra City School District office.  </P> <P> City Manager Lee Risner explained that as a city with fewer than 50,000  residents, La Habra is subject to decisions made by county officials regarding  the use of the federal money.  </P> <P> "If we were (a larger) city we could count on getting about twice what we're  getting now," he said.  </P> <P> Although the county has awarded funds which did not follow the city's  recommendations, Risner noted that "we've gone over and argued with them and  have been reasonably successful in our arguments."

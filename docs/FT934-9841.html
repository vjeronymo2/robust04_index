			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Going solo with business advice A damn good idea, but one that has been slow to get off the ground, is how Geoff Smith, chairman of the Keighley Business Forum in West Yorkshire, describes the government's 'one-stop shop' initiative. So, he says, with northern candour: 'We decided we would just get on with our own version.' One-stop shops, recently given the brand name Business Link by the government, seek to bring together under one umbrella the array of local business advice organisations. They are generally set up by Training and Enterprise Councils in partnership with local bodies such as chambers of commerce. Birmingham and Leicester are among 11 shops which have so far received formal approval, but Keighley is not one of them. History might have been different if nearby Bradford Tec and its chamber of commerce had been able to unite the local partners last year in time to make a bid. It was then that the Keighley Business Forum decided to go it alone. An important consideration was that many services and information sources available 12 miles away in Bradford were not accessible in Keighley. Bolstered by a report into the economic requirements of the town, the forum established the centre, which opened last month, using contributions totalling Pounds 30,000 from its 85 member companies and Pounds 48,000 from Bradford Tec. Full-time director Iain Copping, who used to work for Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries, can direct callers to the relevant experts in the chamber of commerce, Bradford Tec, the local Asian business forum or the local authority's Economic Development Unit. The ambition of the forum extends beyond providing advice in a centre. 'We want to persuade those companies considering leaving Keighley to stay and persuade companies thinking of relocation to consider us,' says Copping. Not having much spare cash the forum's members have done a lot of unpaid footwork. A small delegation recently visited the South African embassy to discuss possible joint ventures and trade opportunities between the two. Keighley's is a brave effort, but public funding is unlikely until the forum can demonstrate to the Department of Trade and Industry that there is an equal partnership with the other players, such as Bradford Tec and the chamber of commerce.</p>

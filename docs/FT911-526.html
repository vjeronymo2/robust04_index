			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Sideways with a vengeance FT-SE Index: 2,524.3 (-17.5) On the face of it, if the UK equity market was going to visit new territory, it should have happened yesterday - Wall Street up 40 points, another interest rate cut discounted in the money markets. Instead, after a brief upward flurry, the FT-SE faded back almost to where it started the week. No one wants to buy, so the market is going sideways with a vengeance. From a different angle, the market is remarkably steady. Institutions appear sanguine about political risk, believing that the downside is limited to perhaps 7 per cent or 2,400 on the FT-SE: no great reason to sell. The last time the FT-SE index failed to break through 2,550 was nearly a month ago. Then it was received wisdom that the corporate reporting season had been remarkable for its lack of bad news; the market was hitting new highs in daily customer turnover of more than Pounds 1bn. After the government's local election setbacks and this week's string of bearish corporate trading statements to shareholders' meetings, the picture looks somewhat different. Queasy investors are no doubt asking themselves how much the profits warnings are already in the price. In practice, the warnings only help a little to guess the timing of the profits cycle; next Tuesday's producer price figures will be a better guide to progress. More worrying for the market should be the sudden decline in turnover. Nomura estimates that the average level of daily customer business so far this month is Pounds 787m, against Pounds 916m since 1987. It would break a long-standing pattern if the market were to continue its rise on below-average volumes. A mark-down or sell-off seems eminently predictable. New money will go into bonds. Such bearishness would be confounded if corporate profitability turned out better than the current consensus. If evidence strengthens that companies have much higher operational gearing than in previous cycles, and the upturn looks like arriving on schedule, then investors might be tempted to break the seasonal habit of a lifetime and buy in May. It remains a big if, just the same.</p>

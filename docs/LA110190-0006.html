			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURES;  </P> <P> PROP. B WOULD PAY FOR PARK PROJECTS IN SOUTH BAY CITIES  </P> <P> It's a ballot title long enough to take a voter's breath away: The Safer  Neighborhood Parks, Tree-Planting, Gang Prevention, Senior Recreation, Beaches  and Wildlife Bond Act.  </P> <P> Proposition B on Tuesday's election ballot has such a long name because it  offers something for everyone, supporters say. In the South Bay alone, the  $817-million county bond measure would preserve open space in Rancho Palos  Verdes, help rebuild the Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach piers, renovate the  waterfront in Avalon and develop a Harbor Walkway in San Pedro.  </P> <P> The measure would also distribute $140 million to the county's 86 cities and  unincorporated areas, based on their population, for park and recreation  projects. Torrance, for example, would receive $2.3 million, Inglewood $1.7  million, Carson $1.4 million, Redondo Beach more than $1 million, Gardena  $824,000 and Hermosa Beach $320,000.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles, with a population of 3.4 million, would get more than  $55 million.  </P> <P> Detractors, including city officials in Palos Verdes Estates, say the measure  is too expensive and unnecessarily raises property taxes. They derisively call  it "park barrel" politics.  </P> <P> If Proposition B is approved by two-thirds of the voters, the county would  finance the improvements by selling bonds, to be repaid over 20 years by  property owners. The repayment would add about $20 a year -- or $404 over 20  years -- to the tax bill of a home assessed at $250,000, county officials said.  </P> <P> Opponents have also criticized the genesis of the measure, saying it was  written primarily to benefit the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. The state  agency would receive $76.5 million from the measure to preserve natural  mountain lands.  </P> <P> The "No on B" ballot argument calls the proposition's supporters "a group of  self-serving individuals whose primary interest is to get the public to buy  private land in the Santa Monica Mountains. They enticed others to support this  bond measure by promising financing for their pet projects."  </P> <P> Esther Feldman, who conceived Proposition B, said the measure was designed from  its inception to include a wide range of projects around the county. "It was  always my concept and idea to provide for all (of the county's) open-space  needs and parks," Feldman said.  </P> <P> Feldman, campaign director for Proposition B, conceded that she first proposed  the county bond measure while working for an agency -- the Mountains Recreation  and Conservation Authority -- that represents the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy and two Ventura County park districts. But she said her  affiliations should not be an issue in the Proposition B campaign.  </P> <P> She suggested that voters simply decide whether the proposed projects,  including preservation of Santa Monica Mountains wild lands, are worth the  extra tax cost.  </P> <P> Proposition B would raise $50 million for county beaches, including improving  lifeguard towers and restrooms. It would pay $121 million to rehabilitate the  Hollywood Bowl, Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Observatory, the County Museum of  Natural History, the County Museum of Art and the California Museum of Science  and Industry.  </P> <P> It would raise another $60 million for countywide programs to build trails,  plant trees, clean up graffiti, improve natural rivers and rehabilitate  historic sites.  </P> <P> Officials in tiny Palos Verdes Estates have been among the most vocal opponents  of the measure, claiming that only nine of the county's 86 cities would receive  more in benefits than they would pay in taxes.  </P> <P> City Manager Jim Hendrickson estimated that if Proposition B passes, Palos  Verdes Estates residents would pay $3.5 million in higher taxes but receive  only $243,000 to spend on parks and recreation.  </P> <P> City officials had suggested other projects that could be added to the bond  measure, such as establishment of a Bluff Cove Park or refurbishment of  Roessler Pool, but Feldman said the projects would not serve a wide enough area  and so were rejected, Hendrickson said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the measure calls for the neighboring city of Rancho Palos Verdes to  receive $15 million to develop Point Vicente Regional Park and to acquire  natural lands and wildlife habitats. Additionally, the city would receive  $744,000 for general park programs.  </P> <P> Hendrickson said Proposition B might have been more palatable to Palos Verdes  Estates officials if the city had been slated for more money. But he said the  main reason for the city's opposition is that the measure is poorly planned,  tacking a grab bag of improvements onto what is essentially an appropriation  for the distant Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.  </P> <P> Proposition B supporters dispute that contention, saying the vast bulk of the  money goes to regional projects that will serve residents from all over the  county.  </P> <P> Feldman argued, for example, that Palos Verdes Estates residents will benefit  from improvements at county beaches and museums and would have to drive just a  short distance to enjoy open space that will be preserved in Rancho Palos  Verdes.  </P> <P> "All these projects," Feldman said, "have significance for a much broader  area."  </P> <P> </P> <P> COUNTY SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS ACT  </P> <P> Here is a list of projects in the South Bay that would be funded by Proposition  B, an $817-million county bond proposal on Tuesday's ballot.  </P> <P> AVALON: waterfront.

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / International Company News: SCA lifts forecast after strong nine months SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, has raised its 1994 profits forecast after doubling profits to SKr1.59bn (Dollars 217m) in the first nine months. The improvement came in spite of a much weaker performance from Molnlycke, SCA's hygiene division, which has been hit by competition in the European nappies market. The company has had to cut nappy prices and lift marketing costs since the US group Kimberley Clark entered the market, adding to the competitive pressures imposed by Procter &amp; Gamble. It has maintained market share but says competition in France is getting tougher. Excluding one-off items, SCA's profits after financial items rose to SKr1.42bn from SKr788m on a 5 per cent rise in underlying sales to SKr24.7bn. The result was driven by higher volumes and prices in SCA's traditional forest industry businesses and lower financial costs. Earnings from the group's graphic paper division tripled to SKr228m from SKr76m, while the forest and timber unit doubled profits to SKr559m from SKr267m. Packaging operations improved slightly to SKr531m from SKr526m. Molnlycke's operating profit fell 19 per cent to SKr663m. The unit, which did much to sustain SCA during the downturn in the pulp and paper cycle, has become its main source of concern and a savings programme is planned. The difficulties are entirely related to the nappies segment. The full-year profit forecast has been re-estimated at SKr2.1bn to SKr2.3bn against an earlier SKr1.9bn to SKr2.3bn prediction. The company says the improving European business climate is helping price increases feed deeper into the paper product range, spreading from 'raw material sectors' to 'more refined products'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Greek and Albanian Public  Order Ministries will meet very soon in Ioannina to examine the  recent incident which led to tension in their bilateral  relations. In a statement today, Government Spokesman Evangelos  Venizelos said that Greece rejects the idea of an international  or CSCE committee on the issue. The government spokesman noted  that Albania must prove on a day-to-day basis that it respects  the rule of law, something which Greece proves every day.  Venizelos said an example of Greek policy is that our country  accepts Albanian illegal immigrants, even beyond its limits.</p>

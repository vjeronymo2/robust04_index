			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Hachette 'on course to meet profits forecast' in spite of first-half loss HACHETTE, the French media group, stayed in the red during the first half of this year, but forecasts a return to profit for the full financial year. Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, the chairman of Hachette who is orchestrating its merger with Matra, the defence electronics concern that also forms part of his family's business interests, told shareholders that Hachette was on course to meet its forecast of net profits of between FFr100m and FFr200m ((Dollars 20.92m-Dollars 41.84m) this year. Hachette, which has extensive interests in magazine and book publishing, made a net loss of FFr39.3m in the first half against a loss of FFr30.4m in the same period of last year on turnover which fell by 2.4 per cent to FFr14.5bn. It said the losses were due to 'seasonal factors' and would not prevent it from producing a profit for the full year. The group is expected to disclose full details of the Matra merger after the Paris commercial court has ruled on the bankruptcy of La Cinq, the television company, late next month. Hachette, which was the managing shareholder of La Cinq before its demise, earlier this week indicated that the merger was likely to involve it absorbing Matra. Last week, Hachette's shares fluctuated on the Paris stock market on speculation about the merger package and on rumours (later denied) of stake-building by Havas, another force in French media. The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market watchdog, is investigating the share price movements.</p>

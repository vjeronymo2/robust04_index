			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was asked a few  minutes ago to comment on his proposal to Syria to engage in  talks on more than one track and on the Syrian rejection of this  proposal. Peres said there is no indication that Syria has  softened its demands from Israel. Peres seems quite pessimistic  concerning the prospects of advancing the negotiations with  Syria. He said their acceptance of his suggestion to expand the  Syrian-Israeli negotiations to several tracks would have  indicated that they seriously meant to promote the peace  process. For Peres, their rejection of his proposal was another  unfavorable sign of Syria's intentions.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 13 February  cites Peres as saying that "Israel prefers a confederation  between the Palestinian entity and Jordan. If such a  confederation is not established, conflicts may arise between  Jordan and the Palestinian entity, entangling Israel."]</p>

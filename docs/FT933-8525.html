			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Property: If it's good, it sells - Cadogan's Place A SUMMER drought of confidence has inhibited the green shoots of spring. Buyers are there - determined not to pay over the odds - but vendors are still hiding in hopes of a better price if they wait. That is not so certain. And with little sign that Britain will enjoy political calm in the autumn, house price increases are more likely next year than this. David Kern, chief economist at the National Westminster Bank, predicts an 8.5 per cent rise by the end of 1994. That depends on a fluid market, which has yet to happen. When it does, we may see a flood of instructions, with the result that buyers will stay in the stronger position and vendors will not obtain the prices they are waiting for. In the meantime, good properties sell well. Recently, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley offered Tennyson's Grade I-listed Victorian Gothic Aldworth House near Haslemere in Surrey at over Pounds 600,000, attracting many visits and more than 10 possible purchasers. The agent decided on informal tendering of 'best and final' offers but no bids 'subject to survey.' Seven bids arrived and contracts were exchanged within hours at more than Pounds 1m. Similarly, in London, the Taylor Woodrow/Mitsui Kensetsu development of apartments, penthouses and town houses at Kensington Green, on the old St Mary Abbots Hospital site, is selling fast. The latest release is the Walnut Court block of flats, with a fine view from the penthouse across Kensington. Inquiries to 071-938 3350. * * * FOR TRAIN buffs: the British Rail Property Board (021-654 4426) is offering the Grade II station-master's house at Cromford, in the Derbyshire Dales, for rent at around Pounds 375 a month. It is a stone, late-19th century building, with prominent gables and chimneys, that looks as if it should be in Scotland or France. The only access is by the footbridge over the line between Matlock and Derby. In Devon, the old station at East Anstey, on the edge of Exmoor, is on sale for Pounds 110,000 (from Stags: 0398-23 174), as is Brunel's air pumping house at Starcross near Exeter: Pounds 85,000 (Fulfords: 0392-52 666). In 1845, the great engineer devised a vacuum pipe system for a railway between Exeter and Plymouth. It did not work and was given up in 1855, but it is now thought worth a Grade I listing. * * * IN WILTSHIRE: Savills (0722-320 422) is selling the most handsome of Elizabethan houses. Stockton House, also Grade I, is in the Wylye valley between Salisbury and Warminster, two miles off the A303. John Topp, who made his money from cloth at the same time as the Spencers of Warwickshire and Northamptonshire were making theirs from wool, built the house in the 1580s in smart black and white alternating bands of knapped flint and stone. Its alterations are sympathetic: a 17th century chapel, an 1802 main stairs by Wyatville, and more rooms and a stable block in the same banded pattern from the late 19th century. Inside are well-lit rooms with elaborate, carved stone chimney pieces (one showing the three men of the Old Testament in the fiery furnace), oak panelling, and superb plaster ceilings and friezes. In the main room upstairs, a riot of plasterwork parades a bestiary with a camel, lion, unicorn and elephant with a large insect on its back - an idealised Elizabethan zoo. Offers over Pounds 1m are invited. It is a pity that the land with the house is only 40 acres, as this denies it an economic base within the local community. But it is a glorious place and would be easy to do over. * * * PEPER HAROW is a Grade I house with 43.5 acres on the A3 near Godalming, Surrey, and 35 miles from London. The house is mostly the work of Chambers in the 18th century (plaster ceilings, marble chimney pieces, and a Palladian gate to the walled garden), with additions by Cockerell and Pugin in the 19th. Restored after a fire in 1989, it was used to house disturbed children until recently but is more likely now to become a conference centre, nursing home, hotel or company headquarters. The price for the whole estate is over Pounds 4m, or Pounds 2.25m for the main lot. Joint agents are Lane Fox (071-499 4785) and Savills (071-499 8644). For something cheaper, around Pounds 50,000 would secure a two-bedroomed cottage at Tegfan, six miles from Lampeter in mid-Wales. It would suit twitchers, as you can see the rare red kite there. The agent is Morgan &amp; Davies (0570-423 623).</p>

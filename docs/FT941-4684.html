			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / People: Brady lends weight to UK funds Nicholas Brady, the former US treasury secretary and designer of the Latin American debt reduction process, is lending his weight to two UK funds investing heavily in the region. He is to become non-executive chairman of both Templeton Emerging Markets investment trust, which has large holdings in Latin America, and the newly-launched Templeton Latin American investment trust. Brady was appointed to the US treasury by Ronald Reagan, and continued to serve under George Bush. His name became linked to Latin America when he came up with a mechanism for lifting the region's burden of debt by exchanging reduced debt for bonds. Before joining the treasury, Brady's career was in investment banking, with Dillon, Read &amp; Co. He left office in January 1993 when Clinton took over. Brady recently became head of Darby Overseas Investments, a Washington-based company also investing in Latin America. Daniel Marx, the managing director of Darby, is to become a non-executive director of Templeton's Latin American trust. Marx was formerly a debt negotiator for Argentina, and until recently the under-secretary of finance there. He has taken an active role in the Argentinian privatisation process; about 20 companies are due to be privatised within two years.</p>

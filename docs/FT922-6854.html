			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Rare fine art finds healthy market: Saleroom THE WORLD'S fine art markets are in overdrive this week, with important sales in London, New York, Geneva and Madrid. The results have been generally encouraging, with collectors competing for rare and exceptional works of art. At Christie's in London yesterday, The Camerarius Florilegium, an exceptionally rare manuscript, sold for Pounds 638,000 - comfortably above its high estimate of Pounds 500,000. The manuscript depicts 473 ornamental plants and 194 leaves that were in the garden of the German botanist Joachim Camerarius in the late 16th century. It is the only known surviving record of the contents of a garden of this period. The buyer was the Oxford dealer Rosenthal, bidding on behalf of a continental European - presumably German - institution. In New York, Christie's sold the late Mr Bill McCarty-Cooper's collection of tribal art. Mr McCarty-Cooper had been adopted at the age of 36 by Mr Douglas Cooper, who possessed one of the finest collections of 20th century French art. Under his influence, Mr McCarty-Cooper assembled an excellent collection of tribal art, which raised Dollars 3.27m (Pounds 1.8m) on Tuesday, with 11 per cent unsold. A Fang male reliquary figure, 19 3/4 in high, carved about a century ago in what is now Gabon in Equatorial Africa, sold for Dollars 550,000, at the bottom of its estimate. A rarer Fang female reliquary figure beat its target at Dollars 440,000. Pacific art was the most sought-after sector and a Fijian headrest, estimated at up to Dollars 20,000, sold for Dollars 77,000. Sotheby's noticed Colombian bidders for the first time at its auction of Latin American art in New York. This has been a strong market for the past two years, but on Tuesday some of the leading artists, including Botero, Matta and Lam, were out of favour. The Mexican Diego Rivera remains popular, though, and his Mujer con Alcatraces, depicting a peasant clutching a vast bunch of lilies, sold for Dollars 2.8m (Pounds 1.5m), the second-highest auction price paid for Rivera, indeed for any Latin American painting. The sale totalled Dollars 7.5m (Pounds 4.1m) but was 34 per cent unsold. Edmund Peel in Madrid had mixed success with his auction of Spanish Old Masters. A Goya portrait was unsold at Pounds 1.15m - although there were hopes of a deal after the auction - but a still life of flowers by Juan de Arellano made a record Pounds 673,000. A Gainsborough drawing owned by the late Lord Clark is to be sold at Christie's on July 14. A Peasant Family Going to Market is estimated at up to Pounds 400,000, but may approach the record Pounds 616,000, which Christie's set for a Gainsborough drawing last year.</p>

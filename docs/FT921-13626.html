			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Haiti army's fears scuttle deal for Aristide's return: What lies behind the failure of a compromise to resolve the exiled president's status? A FEW days after it appeared that there had been a breakthrough in efforts to agree conditions for the return to the Haitian presidency of Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ambitious members of the country's interim government and an intransigent military have again shut the door on him. They have rejected a political compromise brokered by the Organisation of American States which was intended to pave the way for the return of Mr Aristide, who was overthrown at the end of September and sent into exile. Some Haitian legislators who have attempted to act independently of the army and seek a negotiated settlement, have been brought into line. A resolution was thought likely in a meeting which was planned for the weekend, after an agreement between Mr Aristide and a group of Haitian legislators on an interim prime minister who would head the government on the president's return. But the selection of Mr Rene Theodore, head of Haiti's small communist party, is being rejected by most legislators, and by the leadership of the army which is in effective control of the Caribbean state of 7m people. Once the legislators accept Mr Theodore as prime minister, they will have in effect agreed to Mr Aristide's return. Senior officers of the army fear they will suffer at the hands of Mr Aristide and his supporters if the president is allowed to return. Mr Aristide, who has been living in Caracas, Venezuela, since the coup, has said that while enlisted men were following orders and would be pardoned, the army's leaders would be either tried or exiled for their part in the coup. Behind all this are clear signs of a stalemate. Haiti has been subject to an economic embargo imposed by the OAS, and several European countries, and aimed at having the military and the government it appointed accept the return of Mr Aristide. The Haitians, however, are asking for the embargo to be lifted before they agree to the return of Mr Aristide. The OAS members say Mr Theodore's appointment should be ratified first. The recent return to Haiti of the legislators who negotiated with Mr Aristide in Caracas, and who settled on Mr Theodore as prime minister, was met by a statement from the Haitian foreign ministry that foreigners should not try to pressure the country. Although the embargo has brought commercial life to a halt, crippled Haiti's small industrial sector and left the country with very limited supplies of electricity, the military has been emboldened by the sporadic arrival of shipments of fuel products. Three shipments since the imposition of the embargo (one of which was a clear violation of the sanctions) have offered the administration some relief. Haitian politicians themselves appear to be divided, and some at odds with the military, in determining how best to resolve the crisis. In the seven months of Mr Aristide's government, following a handsome win in the country's first elections in 30 years, he was frequently criticised by parliamentarians for being too heavy handed. They wanted government responsibilities to be given to elected officials and not those appointed by the president. The selection of an interim prime minister, such as Mr Theodore who has been an Aristide critic, was intended to create a buffer between the president and the legislature. It appears, however, that such a compromise will not move those who fear the president's return. The fear is genuine among Haiti's elite. It is not only the army and the legislators, but Haiti's prosperous business community which fears the president's return. Mr Aristide's supporters, from among Haiti's majority poor, are likely to take revenge on those who were responsible for and supported the coup. Business leaders have said publicly that they do not want the president back. Blood-letting appears inevitable. But while the army, legislators and the OAS are involved in a game of political chess in Port-au-Prince, the capital, the old political order is reasserting itself in the provinces. Anarchy prevails with provincial politicians, supported by the military, establishing virtual fiefdoms, exacting taxes and violently punishing all opposition. Many of the leaders are known members of the tontons macoute, the feared praetorian guard of the Duvalier dictatorship which was overthrown by a wave of popular unrest six years ago.</p>

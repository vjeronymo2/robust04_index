			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO VOTERS TO PUT SALINAS' REFORMS TO TEST  </P> <P> She is a new-era candidate with an old-style political campaign.  </P> <P> An accomplished woman with a corruption-free record, Margarita Ortega Villa,  38, was President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's handpicked choice for the next  governor of Baja California.  </P> <P> After proclaiming her dedication to Salinas' program of political reform and  "modernization" last week, Ortega hauled out the pork barrel for a  business-as-usual rally.  </P> <P> "I am here to deliver the gifts that President Salinas sends to you through  me," Ortega told 300 members of a farmers' union affiliated with the ruling  Institutional Revolutionary Party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Giveaways, Health Checks  </P> <P> The gifts included irrigation works, a new U.S.-Mexico border crossing, a  freeze on state electricity rates and land titles to 42 lots. Outside the union  hall, meanwhile, party doctors offered free blood-pressure tests and wrote  prescriptions that could be filled from a stock of free medicines in a pickup  truck. A party social worker handed out bags of food, and a party barber  offered haircuts.  </P> <P> Ortega's campaign illustrates the conflict that the ruling party, known as the  PRI, faces in the new era of competitive politics that Salinas embraced last  year after opposition charges that his own election was rigged. There are  elections in five states today, but the close races in Baja California,  Michoacan and Chihuahua are seen as a measure of just how far the party is  willing to go in its perestroika-style reforms.  </P> <P> In these three key states, as well as in Campeche and Zacatecas, voters will  pick new state legislatures. In Baja and Chihuahua, voters also will elect new  mayors, but the only gubernatorial election will take place in Baja. The PRI  has never lost a governorship during its 60 years in power, and it does not  want to start now.  </P> <P> Salinas, however, lost Baja California last year to leftist presidential  candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and the gubernatorial race has been warmly  contested. The three leading candidates are strong and very different  personalities with divergent programs.  </P> <P> Polls show Ortega running neck and neck with National Action Party candidate  Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the scrappy former mayor of Ensenada, who was born in the  United States and worked for many years as a fisherman for a joint U.S.-Mexican  seafood processing company.  </P> <P> Although his party, known by its Spanish acronym PAN, represents the right wing  of Mexican politics, the charismatic Ruffo has presented himself as the  populist choice -- a kind of "everyman" alternative to the corrupt PRI  leadership.  </P> <P> Running a distant third is Martha Maldonado, the candidate for Cardenas' new  Democratic Revolutionary Party. The daughter of Baja California's first  governor, Maldonado has traveled a singular political route: She studied in the  Soviet Union before enlisting in an urban guerrilla unit in the 1960s. She says  she then worked illegally in the United States as a maid and seamstress in the  1970s and returned home in the 1980s to work for the PRI. In 1987, she left the  ruling party to work for the Cardenas movement.  </P> <P> Maldonado's poor showing in the polls is surprising after Cardenas' win here  last year, but political observers say that is because the race for governor is  based on personalities rather than ideology. The state that voted leftist in  1988 could conceivably vote for the rightist PAN this year.  </P> <P> The campaigns have been remarkably polite given the division in the state and  the distrust among the leading parties: Ruffo, like his party, believes  Cardenas is a PRI ruse to divide the opposition; Maldonado believes the PRI and  PAN offer the same conservative economic program and have teamed up to beat the  Cardenas reform movement.  </P> <P> But even the opposition concedes that their candidates have had more access to  government-controlled media than ever before.  </P> <P> Political observers are closely monitoring today's elections to see if the PRI  can win these races fairly and, if not, whether the government will concede  defeat honestly. Michoacan is home to Salinas' rival, Cardenas, while Chihuahua  and Baja California are strategically important, given their location on the  U.S. border. Although Baja is home to fewer than 3 million residents, the  state's tourism and assembly-plant industries are vital to the national  economy.  </P> <P> Either way, some observers say the elections put the PRI in a no-win  predicament. If the ruling party wins Baja, the opposition no doubt will cry  fraud and question Ortega's legitimacy. But if the PRI loses, analysts are apt  to see the defeat as evidence of the party's decline and to ask whether it  signals success or failure for the Salinas modernization program.  </P> <P> Ortega bristles at such suggestions. In the course of her tireless campaign in  recent months, observers say she has been transformed from a tentative presence  on the stump to an accomplished, hard-charging -- and, some say, arrogant --  proponent of the new PRI strategy.  </P> <P> "It is infantile to condition the existence of democracy on the very improbable  defeat of the PRI," she said in an interview aboard her campaign van. "Baja  California has had experience with democratic processes."  </P> <P> Indeed, Ruffo was an opposition mayor of Ensenada following on the heels of  another opposition mayor. But the PRI has long been accused of stealing tight  elections, including the 1983 race for mayor of Mexicali, which PAN claims it  won.  </P> <P> "The culture of fraud was created by the PRI," Ruffo said last week in his  campaign office in a Tijuana shopping center. "The people don't believe the  PRI."  </P> <P> While few people question Ortega's integrity, some observers wonder if she can  control a party long accustomed to resorting to electoral fraud to pile up huge  majorities. Already, opposition politicians and newspapers have uncovered  several voting irregularities.  </P> <P> In the Tijuana squatter neighborhood of Camino Verde, a PRI stronghold,  opposition parties reported that voter registration rolls tripled from 8,769 to  29,741 during April, the last month for registration. Among the prospective  voters: Pablo Picasso and Juan Sebastian Bach. In addition, the weekly  newspaper Zeta published copies of the death certificates of two other  registered voters.  </P> <P> Last month, officials announced that the statewide voter registration list had  mushroomed by 86,000 names between 1988 and 1989, compared to an increase of  545 registered voters from 1986 to 1988. At the same time, the number of voting  stations declined by 173. The opposition cried fraud.  </P> <P> Ortega says the irregularities were discovered as part of the government's  review of the registration list and that they have been corrected. The  registration list came down by about 21,000 names, to 883,900, but no booths  were added.  </P> <P> "The opposition always cries fraud when they predict they are going to lose,"  Ortega said with a clear edge in her voice. "For us, the success of  modernization is a clean, democratic fight, independent of which party wins.  Modernization was imposed with my candidacy."  </P> <P> Even without fraud, the race illustrates how difficult it is for an opposition  candidate to defeat PRI nominees: The ruling party outspent the opposition by  many times, investing large sums in advertising, giveaways and computerized  polling. PRI officials say they can't estimate how much has been spent.  </P> <P> Ortega has served as a state and federal deputy and currently is one of Baja's  two federal senators. Before her candidacy was unveiled, she was considered a  dark horse in the race to represent the ruling party, but Salinas picked her  apparently for her clean record and lack of political liabilities.  </P> <P> In Mexico's heavily centralized political system, the governors are considered  the president's personal representatives -- like colonial viceroys -- and  customarily the president picks the PRI's gubernatorial candidates.  </P> <P> If she wins, Ortega would be the first woman governor of Baja and only the  third woman governor in the history of Mexico. The scarcity of women in  politics here caused some observers to speculate that Ortega would be a  "sacrificial lamb" and lose the election in the name of modernization.  </P> <P> Ortega brushes off that view as sexist and notes that Salinas has vowed to  promote women.  </P> <P> Despite the backing of the president, Ortega has been running against the  checkered legacy of her own party. Not only is the PRI blamed nationally for  the country's weak economy, but in Baja California, the former PRI governor,  Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, was widely viewed as mean, corrupt and incompetent  -- a personification of the PRI's liabilities.  </P> <P> Shortly after taking office, Salinas sent Leyva Mortera into political exile  and replaced him with an interim governor. The move was regarded as essential  here if the PRI hoped to win the governor's race.  </P> <P> One of Leyva Mortera's most damaging acts as governor may have been to make a  hero out of PAN's Ruffo. Leyva Mortera put the squeeze on the Ensenada mayor's  budget, so Ruffo took to the streets with a broom, saying he didn't have the  money to pay city sweepers. When word spread of the confrontation between Ruffo  and the governor, residents turned out to help the mayor clean up their port  city, leading to a nationwide publicity coup.  </P> <P> The governor's message, however, was not lost on voters in this election.  </P> <P> "If we have an opposition governor, we'll never get another thing for this  state from the federal government," said a taxi driver who said he would vote  for the PRI today. "We can't have an opposition governor until we have an  opposition president."  </P> <P> Adela Zaragoza, 65, agreed. A homemaker who voted for Cardenas last year, she  said she too would vote PRI this time: "Maybe this new governor will be better.  Maybe she'll think differently from a man."  </P></p>

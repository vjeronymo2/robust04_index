			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: DESPITE WARTS, DEMOCRACY IN DEMAND  </P> <P> "The worst thing that a totalitarian government can do is to give its people a  little democracy," Wabash of the Political Dynamics Institute said. "It's like  making them a little pregnant."  </P> <P> I was in his office and we were following uprisings all over the world on his  shortwave radio. He pointed to Soviet Georgia on a map. "Every time Gorbachev  loosens up and offers his people a bunch of grapes, they want the whole  vineyard. All of the republics are demanding either autonomy or complete  freedom from the mother country. It proves that if you are a dictator and allow  just a small amount of light into your country, nobody is going to say 'thank  you.' "  </P> <P> "Why would anybody want to live in a democracy when you can't get tickets to  'Phantom of the Opera'?" I asked.  </P> <P> Wabash answered, "The dilemma is how to reform the old system when people want  a new one. I'm not Red-baiting when I say that communism doesn't work.  Gorbachev is offering Marxism with freedom, and it is a contradiction in  terms."  </P> <P> I agreed. "I think that the Russians should back off and take a serious look at  what they are demonstrating for. We are a society of pizzas and Big Macs. We  depend on Japan for our TV sets, and South Korea and Malaysia for our clothes.  The New York Times crossword puzzle is much more difficult today than it was 10  years ago."  </P> <P> Wabash said, "We are not only seeing an internal revolution but an external one  as well. All the Soviet Bloc countries are demanding their freedom. Every  country behind the Iron Curtain is poised for true democratic reform, including  elections and multiple-party voting."  </P> <P> "They must be stopped," I declared. "If they all adopt the capitalist system,  there won't be an empty parking place in the whole wide world."  </P> <P> "The political storm clouds are not only blowing over Eastern Europe but over  China as well," Wabash explained. "We are watching Chinese students demanding  the same democratic privileges that we have."  </P> <P> "Don't they know if that happens, they will have to read the National Enquirer  every week and watch Morton Downey and Geraldo Rivera on television?"  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter. They want our way of life, even if it means that students  in China will be wearing Ralph Lauren clothes to demonstrations. You can't stop  the people once they have taken to the streets."  </P> <P> "Do the Estonian people have any idea what it's like to be ruled by  (Washington) Mayor (Marion) Barry?" I asked.  </P> <P> "They don't care. They are willing to take Barry over some crooked Soviet  bureaucrat who is telling them how to live. The world is a different place now  from what it was 12 months ago. No one is demonstrating for communism or  fascism. They're all yelling for their right to phone in to a radio talk-show  host and make a fortune in the lottery.  </P> <P> "Someone has to tell them before it's too late that democracy has many holes in  it. It's a messy system because no one agrees with anybody else. A totalitarian  government speaks with a single voice -- a democracy talks with a million.  Besides, under communism, you don't have savings-and-loans banks failing every  day."  </P> <P> Wabash said, "I'm afraid that you can't put the genie back in the bottle.  Whatever the Russian people wind up with, it isn't going to look anything like  Lenin's dream."  </P> <P> "Maybe when the Soviets find out what it costs to stay in an American hospital,  they'll reject any ideas they ever had of being like us," I suggested.  </P> <P> Wabash shook his head. "They're buying our system, warts and all. Even the KGB  is trying to get prayers back into the schools."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The second provincial power installations  protection work conference was recently convened by the  provincial public security department and the electric power  industry bureau.    Thanks to faster hydropower resource exploitation, the  province's electric power industry has witnessed an  unprecedentedly fast growth, resulting in the construction of  more power installations across the province in the past year.  Thus, protecting power installations has become a pressing  issue confronting the province's electric power and public  security departments.    The conference revealed: In 1993, a total of 121 cases of  stealing or sabotaging electric power installations occurred, 49  of which were major and serious cases, inflicting direct  economic losses of about 400,000 yuan. A growing number of  similar cases occurred in the first quarter of this year  compared with the same period of last year, some posing a real  threat to the province's normal production.    The conference participants unanimously held: At present, it  is imperative to conduct exhaustive education on the importance  and urgency of protecting power installations by proceeding from  the overall interests of social stability; properly solve such  problems as power supply disputes between adjacent counties and  between adjacent villages; properly handle, by seeking  government assistance, such incidents as besieging power plants,  beating and abusing power plant staff and workers, and other  similar incidents; step up investigations as well as crackdowns  on such criminal activities as theft or sabotaging power  installations and other similar activities; and make redoubled  efforts to rectify the salvage market with an eye on blocking  the source of income of the criminals.    The conference urged public security organs at all levels  across the province to assist security departments of the  electric power organs in strengthening safety management of  large power plants, large power stations, large transformer  substations, and key power supply lines; rectify and maintain  social order in adjacent villages; and take full precautions  against the outbreak of similar incidents in the future.</p>

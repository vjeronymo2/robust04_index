			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ORGANIST MARY PRESTON OPENS BAROQUE FEST  </P> <P> Solid music making mixed with a few flawed moments marked the opening of the  ninth annual Corona del Mar Baroque Music Festival on Sunday night at St.  Michael and All Angels Church.  </P> <P> Organist Mary Preston was on hand in an evening of works from various  historical periods for solo organ and for organ and strings.  </P> <P> Most uncommon were performances of two recently discovered Baroque English  organ concertos, one by John Stanley and the other by a composer known only as  Mr. Edwards. The scores were discovered last year in London by Burton Karson,  the artistic director for the festival and conductor of the festival orchestra.  </P> <P> Edwards' concerto proved a simple composition with occasional moments of  interest. Undoubtedly influenced by Handel -- a very young Handel -- the work  is not ambitious and certainly not a masterpiece, but worth the attentive  performance it received.  </P> <P> Stanley's concerto, on the other hand, was a dull, academic exercise. Most of  the time, the organ part simply doubled what was going on in the orchestra,  offering little variation or musical ideas that were particularly memorable.  </P> <P> Karson deftly conducted his ensemble, demonstrating restraint and preparedness.  The orchestra responded appropriately, yielding an accurate, spirited  performance.  </P> <P> Preston played the small 24-rank organ with power and varied, tasteful  registrations. Occasionally, there were lapses and mistakes that may have been  the result of unfamiliarity with the mechanics of the instrument.  </P> <P> Yet her prowess as an organist was aptly displayed in her selection of solo  works, which included a confident, moving performance of Mozart's Fantasia in F  minor. Franck's Prelude, Fugue and Variation equally shared the spotlight, as  Preston utilized a sturdy technique and deep understanding of the intricacies  of the Romantic style.  </P> <P> The biggest disappointment of the evening was a tentative, lackluster  performance of Poulenc's Concerto in G minor, an often bombastic work for  organ, orchestra and timpani. Karson's forces suffered intonation problems  throughout as Preston struggled to project some energy out of the muddy  harmonies and sforzando chords.  </P></p>

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Bangkok motorway opens in spite of dispute THE Thai government yesterday opened a Dollars 1bn elevated toll road in Bangkok, despite complaints by the Japanese-led consortium which built it that a dispute over the contract was unresolved. Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, declined to open the 28km road himself, apparently aware that foreign investors and bankers are concerned about the way the government has summarily overruled the objections of the Bangkok Expressway Company (BECL) consortium. His place was taken by Mr Chaowas Sudlabha, deputy interior minister, who maintained that the state-owned Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA) had 'fully followed' the contract. The government's critics, however, claim that the ETA has opened the road hastily in an attempt to win public acclaim for the authorities by alleviating Bangkok's increasingly nightmarish traffic jams. The ETA this week won a court order for the immediate opening of the completed stretch of motorway after warning of possible violence by frustrated drivers. Many Bangkok residents were delighted but investors and bankers were enraged by what they regard as bullying tactics and said international financing for some Dollars 30bn of planned Thai infrastructure projects would be jeopardised. BECL, led by Kumagai Gumi, has accused the ETA of breaching the contract on several counts. Yesterday it described the opening of the road, known as the second-stage expressway, as premature and said there was 'a real danger to public safety' because construction work has not been completed. In a statement, BECL's management said the company and the project had been left 'in an extremely uncertain and precarious position'.</p>

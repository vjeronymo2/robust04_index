			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITIONS 136, 137  </P> <P> I am questioning the legality of Prop. 136. How can a measure that can pass  with as little as 50% plus one vote require a 66.7% vote to overturn it? Since  Prop. 13 passed, there have been many measures to raise money that received a  far greater percentage than Prop. 13 but fell short of two-thirds and thus were  defeated.  </P> <P> Is that right?  </P> <P> If Prop. 136 passes and is not struck down as unconstitutional, we'll probably  see every future proposition with the same two-thirds clause. Try to imagine  the chaos the initiative process would be dealing with.  </P> <P> MICHAEL LORRAINE, Simi Valley  </P></p>

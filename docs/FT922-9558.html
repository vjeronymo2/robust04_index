			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: New listing rules to put listing ship on even keel - The efforts of private managers to give weight to the Jakarta exchange First impressions of the Jakarta stock exchange do not inspire confidence. Surly lobby attendants sit on battered chairs, their feet planted on desks, and a hand-written paper sign is taped to the wall outside the office of Bursa Efek Jakarta (BEJ), the private managers who took over the running of the exchange from the government last month. BEJ's adjoining offices are a building site, indicating that some kind of transformation is under way. Indeed, the aim of Mr Hasan Zein Mahmud, the BEJ president, is to inject life and confidence back into the stock market. Jakarta attracted the attention of international investors in 1990 when the official index rose 70 per cent in the first three months to peak at 638.8. It subsequently suffered a severe fall, as a series of accounting scandals tarnished the market's image, and is now trading just below 290. Mr Mahmud faces a big challenge in overhauling the stock exchange. The biggest problem is the lack of liquidity. As one foreign broker comments: 'Try and buy a reasonable stake in some companies and you could double their share price.' Domestic investors, such as the state pension funds, have opted to place money on deposit or invest in property rather than in shares. Deposit rates have peaked at 20 per cent, pushed up by the government's tight monetary policy imposed after bank credit grew by more than 50 per cent in 1990. The central bank has recently eased controls on money supply, but there will be some delay before commercial bank rates fall. Lending rates of 26 per cent, coupled with an economic downturn in export markets, have squeezed company profits and further depressed share values and trading volume. The value of daily transactions last year averaged Rp24.9bn (Dollars 12.4m). This increased to Rp29.6bn in January and Rp39.5bn in February but fell back to Rp25.3bn in March. BEJ has tightened the listing requirements in an effort to improve investor confidence and liquidity. From June 18, the qualifications for a listing are: an operating profit for two consecutive years; minimum assets of Rp20bn; equity capital of at least Rp7.5bn and paid-up capital of more than Rp2bn; at least 200 public shareholders; and a free-float of at least 1m shares. Companies may be struck off if: they record losses for three consecutive years; their shares are not traded for more than six months; they cannot produce scheduled financial reports; or accounting standards are not met. Brokers had estimated that up to 40 companies of the 141 currently listed were liable to be struck off. But last week BEJ said the new requirements would only apply to companies entering the exchange. Brokers now expect fewer than five companies, which have failed to produce annual reports, to be delisted. The tighter listing procedures have been welcomed by brokers, except for the threat to remove loss-making companies. 'The temptation for loss-makers will be to falsify accounts, a problem BEJ should be deterring,' explains a local broker. Mr Mahmud, however, says the main purpose is to provide an early warning system to the investor. Furthermore, the removal of loss-making companies will not be automatic but at BEJ's discretion. Brokers complain that there are too many of them - 189 domestic brokerages and 26 joint ventures - for the size of the stock market. Mr Mahmud reckons 75 to 100 firms would be sufficient, but denies that BEJ will limit numbers: 'I do not like the idea of directly intervening in the market.' BEJ has a paid-up capital of Rp12.3bn, owned equally by 205 stockbroking firms. The venture will be financed by a 0.1 per cent commission on every share transaction, and an annual listing fee for listed companies of 0.1 per cent of the face value of their shares. Under new rules, local stockbroking firms must have a paid-up capital of Rp500m, or Rp5bn if they want to act as underwriters. The requirement is double for joint ventures, in which foreign companies can hold up to 85 per cent. BEJ also intends to streamline clearance and settlement, which currently takes five days or more, but there are no immediate plans to computerise the exchange.</p>

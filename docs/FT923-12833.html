			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cost control helps Denmans rise 43% Mainly as a result of stringent control of costs and working capital, Denmans Electrical lifted interim pre-tax profit by 43 per cent, from Pounds 574,000 to Pounds 823,000. However, directors of this USM-traded group stressed that results were becoming more seasonally biased, and the percentage increase should not necessarily be expected to be held over the full year. They reported that all sections of the business were trading profitably even though the results were affected by bad debt provisions 'well above historic levels.' The group was developing its manufacturing and importing businesses and, consequently, lighting was becoming an increasingly important part of turnover. For the half year ended March 31 1992 sales rose to Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 17.8m). Interest charges were cut to Pounds 97,000 (Pounds 152,000). Earnings per share worked through at 12.7p (8.8p) and the interim dividend is raised from 1.65p to 1.8p.</p>

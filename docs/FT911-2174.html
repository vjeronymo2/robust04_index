			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Rate cut follows Bush's pressure and poor figures: Fed sees no clear sign of end to recession THE Federal Reserve's  1/2 -point cut in the discount rate to 5 1/2 per cent looks like a consolation prize for President George Bush. Mr Bush failed this weekend to persuade the finance ministers of other leading industrial countries to sanction interest rate cuts. But his influence at home is rather greater. Yesterday he pointedly praised Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, for his 'strong leadership role' in cutting interest rates. The move, said Mr Bush, would strengthen the world economy as well as ease the domestic recession. The Fed cuts the discount rate when it wants to signal changes in monetary policy. Yesterday's cut - the third   1/2 -point reduction since December - paved the way for an immediate quarter-point cut in the Federal funds rate to 5.75 per cent. The Fed funds rate - the cost of bank reserves in the inter-bank market - is the key determinant of short-term interest rates in the economy. The discount rate, the rate the Fed charges on direct loans to commercial banks, is largely of symbolic importance. The easing of policy follows a vigorous debate within the Fed about the conduct of monetary policy. In recent weeks, 'doves' among the governors and regional presidents reportedly favoured easing, but were restrained by 'hawks' who feared that inflation was still not fully under control. The timing of the cut yesterday surprised many analysts because the debate was thought to have resulted in a decision to keep policy unchanged for the time being. The apparent change of heart probably reflects a combination of intensified pressure from the White House and growing concern about the recession's failure to bottom out. In a statement justifying the cut, the Fed said it was particularly concerned by adverse trends in industrial and capital goods sectors. Yesterday the Commerce Department reported a 2.8 per cent fall in March for orders for manufactured goods, the fifth successive monthly decline. Orders for durable goods fell 6 per cent in March. There was also discouraging news on the demand side of the economy. The momentum of a sharp rise in consumer confidence in March was not sustained in April. The New York-based forecasting group Conference Board yesterday said its overall measure of consumer confidence fell nearly two points to 79.2 last month, having climbed 22 points immediately after the Gulf war. The Fed's decision to 'buy insurance' against a deeper recession also reflects broader economic trends. Figures last week showed that real gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the first quarter, compared with 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year. In January the White House had claimed that the worst of the recession was over and predicted a fall of GNP at an annual rate of 1.3 per cent in the first quarter. Non-farm employment has contracted by 1.3m since last September - in line with falls in previous severe recessions. Industrial production is already down nearly 5 per cent from its peak last autumn. Neither indicator shows any sign of recovery. Such blunt signals from the industrial economy have undermined confidence generated by a tentative revival in the housing market, faster monetary growth and a big rise in share prices. The Fed's decision was made easier by signs of a decline in the 'core' rate of inflation. The consumer price index excluding food and energy rose by only 0.1 per cent in March after large increases earlier this year. With wage inflation subdued and the dollar if anything too strong for domestic comfort, the risk that an easing of monetary policy will spark a resurgence of inflation looks negligible. How quickly commercial banks will respond to the Fed's move is unclear. In the past year, banks have been seeking to rebuild profit ratios and have been reluctant to pass on the benefits of interest rate cuts. Yesterday, Southwest Bank, a small St Louis bank that often leads industry-wide moves, cut its prime rate a quarter point to 8 3/4 per cent. The White House will be hoping that the big money centre banks quickly follow suit.</p>

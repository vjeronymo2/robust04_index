			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading A clumsily-executed sell order combined with a slide in US markets undermined stock index futures pulling the near month Footsie contract lower, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,006. A firm rally appeared to be on the way when early buyers quickly pushed September to 3,010. But this turned out to be the high of the day. A mid-morning US seller of around a 1000 lots triggered a wave of selling activity reversing September's earlier gains. It fell to a low of 2,945 over lunch before the announcement of US producer prices data brought about an adavance in US bonds. Dealers in London used this as an opportunity for bargain hunting, helping the contract reduce earlier losses. However ,the renewed buying proved short lived and the slide in US bonds once again saw sellers gain the upper hand It closed at 2,970, down 27 on its previous finish and 3 above its fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Volume at 19,972 was healthy. Traded options were also busy and volume jumped to 46,986 lots of which 22,037 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,930 in the Euro-FT-SE option. British Steel was the busiest stock option following a 'roll over' trade. It saw business of 6,432 lots.</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENDA FOR CLEANING UP OUR DIRTY AIR  </P> <P> I have visited Los Angeles on business many times and have always enjoyed the  many attractions this area has to offer. I have never before been here when  there was no smog. I arrived here Memorial Day in the afternoon to get an early  start on Tuesday installing a new computer system at one of my company's  locations here. At first I thought what luck to see Los Angeles without smog.  This did not sit well, however, because I have a bachelor of science degree in  biology. I am not a great believer in luck.  </P> <P> After a lot of thought it occurred to me that this was not luck, it was  obvious: Mother Nature had three days of vacation from commuter traffic to  flush out the atmosphere and let the natural systems handle the air pollutants.  If the powers that be here declared Monday as an environmental holiday and  forced into place three-day weekends and four-day work weeks it would end your  smog problem. It would cut your commuter traffic 20% immediately.  </P> <P> Los Angeles is truly a beautiful place to see when you can see more than a  hundred yards!  </P> <P> ED LYDEN  </P> <P> Houston  </P></p>

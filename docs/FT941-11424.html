			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Management: Death by a thousand new-fangled buzzwords Three ideas, concepts or models - call them what you will depending on your need for embellishment - are currently floating about in the management world. One is empowerment, an ugly transatlantic neologism which suggests that ordinary workers want, enjoy and benefit from being empowered. Of course, with power comes responsibility, and it is not clear that workers who warm to the former are equally happy about the latter. Also, the empowerment of one group usually means the disempowerment of another group, frequently the former's bosses. The next idea is delayering, which is a simple, but enormously consequential, structural issue. For all sorts of reasons, including obvious ones such as a set span of control, many organisations are very tall with many ranks, levels or layers. Models such as the Catholic church are held up, which despite its size has only three or four levels under its CEO, the Bishop of Rome. So the preferred solution, and one which can be done with a stroke of the pen on the organisational chart, is to take out one, two or more levels of management. The next idea, borrowed from the tough, masculine, no-nonsense world of heavy industry is re-engineering. Though, as in all of these concepts, there is some disagreement as to the precise meaning of the term, it implies that organisations are structurally and functionally redesigned. Just as the old, complicated, steam engine was re-engineered into the sleek bullet train, so elaborate, traditional organisations can be streamlined. What these three new ideas have in common is that they usually lead to a similar result. Bluntly, these new-fangled ideas usually mean the sacking of middle management. Is this culling a good idea? Are most middle managers Peter-principled, disengaged and therefore really pretty redundant? If so, why did that situation arise in the first place? What is the role of someone between the front-line supervisor and the directors? In some organisations, middle managers will not be missed because senior or top managers were performing their jobs. The owners directed, the directors managed, the managers supervised, the supervisors worked. The job of directors and top managers is predominantly planning, forward looking and 'visionary'. The job of the supervisor is primarily operational, day-to-day management. About 70 per cent of the time of the former is for thinking ahead and doing work that cannot be delegated, while about the same amount of the time of the latter is working with and through people at the coalface. The middle manager - the departmental head, the divisional chief and the co-ordinator - supposedly did some planning, some man-management and even practised some of the skill for which they had been trained. Some were simply bureaucrats, some against any change which threatened their stability, and some simply incompetent. Perhaps most organisations simply had too many middle managers and a bit of judicious pruning was rather a good idea. But to remove a whole level, or layer, or generation, may be exceptionally foolhardy, at least until its function is fully understood.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yoshihito Horie] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Jun -- According to a Chinese diplomatic  source, Premier Li Peng may visit three West European countries,  including Germany and France, as early as July. This will be  the first time that Li Peng -- the person responsible for the  suppression of the democratic movement during the Tiananmen  incident in 1989 -- will have visited the advanced industrial  countries since the incident.    As the United States has decided to renew  most-favored-nation  treatment for China, and to discontinue linking renewal to human  rights issues, the visit is meant to demonstrate China's  complete rehabilitation in the international community five  years after Tiananmen. Backed by rapid economic growth, the PRC  is expected to engage in active, omnidirectional diplomacy from  now on.    Advanced Western nations have had an aversion to visits by  top Chinese leaders, especially Li Peng, who is particularly  loathed by pro-democracy forces, since sanctions were imposed on  the PRC following the Tiananmen incident. It was Li who  declared martial law in Beijing.    Li's trip will return the visits made to Beijing by German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in November 1993, and French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur in April. He is expected to propose  further expansion of cooperative relations, particularly in  economics and trade.    Japan also invited Li Peng to visit when former Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was in China in March.    Factors contributing to China's rehabilitation in the  international community include its good record in economic  development, compared to Western economies which have suffered  from a recession, an improvement in the PRC's position as a  major power in Asia and the Pacific region, and chaos in  democratized Russia and eastern Europe.    The Chinese source said: "Helped by a favorable atmosphere,  the wounds left by the incident have been healed over five  years."    One of the outstanding characteristics of China's recent  diplomatic strategy is that it gives central importance to  establishing friendly ties with neighboring countries. China,  which became isolated following the Tiananmen incident, first  tried to cement relations with Japan and other neighboring  countries, and subsequently started to move toward improving  relations with the advanced nations.    In the case of the United States, China applied pressure by  actively improving relations with its economic rival, Japan, and  its political archenemy, Russia.    China calls its strategy "yuanjiao jinhe [close ties with  faraway countries and peace with neighboring countries]," taking  and adapting a leaf from the Warring States period [475-221  B.C.] strategy of "yuanjiao jingong [close ties with faraway  countries; invade nearby countries]." Furthermore, it tries to  play the advanced nations one against another as they attempt to  make economic inroads into China.    Among China's neighbors, the PRC places emphasis on Japan,  Russia and ASEAN. China is sending Foreign Minister Qian Qichen  to the regional forum scheduled to be held in Bangkok in July  because it attaches great importance to this first opportunity  for China to discuss politics and security in Asia and the  Pacific.    Southeast Asia has lingering fears of China caused by its  military modernization efforts, the territorial dispute over the  Spratlys, and its economic successes. The PRC will explain its  position candidly at the forum and attempt to seek the  understanding of Southeast Asia to make the gathering a  "conference at which anxieties are removed" in volatile  post-Cold War Asia.</p>

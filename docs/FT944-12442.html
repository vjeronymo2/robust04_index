			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (6): Wheel of misfortune - Nikki Tait studies the rise of the gambling dens If the growth in visitors to Australia is a pretty sight, the development of the country's casino industry - a key factor in the tourism equation - looks increasingly ugly. It has been estimated that revenues from Australian casinos could double over the next five years, to around ADollars 1.25bn per annum, as new properties in Cairns, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney come on stream. This will be the third phase of the industry's development. While casinos have been operating in Tasmania and the Northern Territory for several decades, these have always been small-scale operations, with aggregate annual revenues of less than ADollars 50m. It was only when the Burswood casino got going outside Perth in 1985, followed by Jupiters on Queensland's Gold Coast, that the dollar signs started to clock up. Burswood has around 116 tables, and Jupiters almost as many. The other seven casinos sprinkled across Australia are only in double-digits, and Alice Springs' has fewer than 20 tables. Burswood alone accounted for 40 per cent of the industry's ADollars 657m revenues in 1992-3. Today, there are two principal reasons why other big states, such as Victoria and New South Wales, are clambering on to the same bandwagon. The first is an acute desire to attract the Asian tourist dollar - or, at the very least, not to lose out to competing cities and states. According to projections from the NSW Casino Control Authority, the number of international visitors to the Sydney property could top the million-mark by the year 2000, compared with 1.1-2.2m domestic visitors and 6-7.5m local visitors or day-trippers. Secondly, state treasurers, eager to relieve their budgetary pressures, see tax revenues from gaming dollars as a fairly efficient means of raising new funds. Consultants say that the substitution effect - the drop in racing-related revenues, for example, as punters adjust their activities - is relatively modest. But as the stakes are raised, the disquiet is growing. In Melbourne, where a temporary casino opened early this year, there have been reports of a proliferation of 'gambling problems'. Pawnshops are said to be seeing a surge in business, and financial difficulties, notably within the city's large Asian community, are rife. Meanwhile, the Sydney casino development has degenerated into a dirty brawl between the business interests of Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman who already has a significant stake in the Melbourne operation, and a consortium of Showboat, the US casino group, and Leighton Holdings, the Australian building company. Leighton-Showboat appeared to win the right to build and operate the Sydney property earlier this year, outbidding the Packer consortium, which also included the US's Circus Circus, by offering an upfront payment of ADollars 376m. But since then, the Packer camp has unleased a barrage of accusations about Showboat's probity. Mr Bob Carr, the NSW Labor opposition leader, has levelled some of the more detailed allegations, which hang on fairly tenuous links between Showboat and a Louisiana mob figure and seem to baffle US analysts. Confidential US police reports have been leaked; public relations advisers and lawyers spurred into action. The CCC, having assured everyone that extensive probity checks had been carried out before the Leighton-Showboat choice was made, has set up an inquiry to look into the allegations. Sydney residents, meanwhile, tend to view the whole business with a mixture of contempt and cynicism. Two previous attempts to award a Sydney casino licence - in 1986 and 1987 - went awry when individuals or companies involved in the winning bids ran into controversy. It is now a question of whether the third time is any more lucky.</p>

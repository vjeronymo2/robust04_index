			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Savoy to sell its Lancaster hotel in Paris The Savoy group is looking for a buyer for the Lancaster hotel in Paris. The group is believed to have asked London estate agents DE &amp; J. Levy to sound out prospective buyers of the hotel, which is on the rue de Berri, just off the Champs-Elysees. The Lancaster is believed to have been trading reasonably well, but has been hit by the downturn in the French economy. Savoy is thought to have decided it would like to concentrate on its UK interests and will sell the Paris hotel if it can get what it regards as the right price. Savoy, which also owns the Savoy, Berkeley and Claridge's in London and the Lygon Arms in Worcestershire, recorded a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.75m in the six months to June 30 last year. The Lancaster, which has 60 rooms, was originally built in 1899 as a family home. It was purchased in 1925 by Mr Emile Wolf who converted it into a hotel. With an eye to the English market, he named it the Lancaster. Mr Wolf filled the Lancaster's rooms with 18th century furniture, clocks, tapestries and works of art. The hotel was a favourite of Noel Coward, Greta Garbo and Clark Gable. Mr Wolf sold the hotel to Savoy in 1970, saying he felt its character would be safe in the group's hands.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / City divided on how to plug tide of price-sensitive leaks THE Stock Exchange's public censure last Friday of London International Group, the condoms to photo processing company, for leaking information was well-timed. In Saturday's papers, alongside news of the censure, were detailed reports that British Airways will today launch a rights issue. The BA leak, if true, will embarrass the company because of its timing. But it also suggests that the selective passing of price-sensitive information from companies or their advisers to the market remains widespread. LIG was censured after it separately told 13 analysts and four institutions that profits forecasts for the company were too high. The exchange said this type of information should have been released simultaneously to all investors via an official announcement. Most in the City would probably agree with the exchange in this case, and concur that LIG's profit warning overstepped the rules. There is, however, little agreement about how to deal with leaks generally. Mr David Barclay, deputy head of corporate finance at County NatWest, said: 'We would welcome a tightening up of the application of equality of information principle. But it is a grey area - this has always been a difficult area.' Another merchant banker, who did not want to be identified, said: 'It happens all the time. You need to feed out little titbits, because if you don't then you have a false market.' The LIG case has focused attention on when leaks are price-sensitive and therefore only disclosable through an official announcement. With the government proposing tighter laws against insider trading it also raises the question of whether companies should review the way they release information to analysts and the press. The exchange is reluctant to lay down guidelines for what is and is not price-sensitive, saying it believes companies and their financial advisers are better placed to judge. A decision by J Sainsbury to open two new stores is less significant than a similar move by a much smaller company. Equally, J Sainsbury's decision to expand is more significant than a similar move by a company in an industry with long lead times, in process engineering for example. Companies and advisers talk of a 'grey area' of disclosure, which may have been built up over years of practice. For example, hotel companies often reveal publicly and privately their occupancy levels even though, especially with smaller companies, these figures can be very price-sensitive. In general, the exchange points to the 'Yellow Book' of listing rules, requiring the immediate release of information which 'might reasonably be expected to have a material effect' on a share price or trading volume. If in doubt, according to the exchange, consult your financial adviser. The relationship between companies and analysts is also likely to be reviewed after the LIG ruling. In the past some companies have 'steered' analysts to profit or loss figures. Some analysts admit that without this help, profit forecasts soon become little better than guesswork. The exchange said it agreed companies needed to have close relations with analysts. But at private briefings no new material information should be released, nor should precise profit or loss figures be revealed. Information should not be sufficiently precise for analysts to work out exact figures. Companies had probably already started tightening up in this area after the conviction earlier this year of an Edinburgh fund manager for insider dealing after he had been given a profits warning by a company in advance of its publication. According to the finance director of a FT-SE 100 company: 'These are important developments and we need to make sure we are up with best practice. We will have to be a little more careful.' With pressure on companies and their advisers to stop leaking, official announcements are likely to become more frequent and, perhaps, more thorough. Many companies use announcements to communicate the outline of a development or change in strategy. Detailed questions from analysts and journalists are then dealt with at meetings or by telephone. When the news is bad, companies have been reluctant to issue official announcements, mainly because the market can overreact. As with LIG, many have preferred to use leaking. Mr John Makinson, of investor relations company Makinson Cowell, said that if companies made more routine announcements through the exchange, there would be less of a stigma attached to releasing bad news.</p>

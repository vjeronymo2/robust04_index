Suggestions of that sort are  exactly what the leaders of the movement are looking for; they  put the movement into the headlines on the front pages of the  newspapers, and at the top of the daily news bulletins and  roundups.    The Kach movement, now as always, has a developed sense of  publicity. Even in cases where Kach and its offshoots have had  no tie to an attack against Arabs or a pogrom against their  property--Kach spokesmen have hurried to take responsibility for  the incident, or at least to announce it in the papers.    An outstanding example of this happened after Rabbi Avraham  Toledano--a former leader of Kach--was arrested at Ben Gurion  airport a few weeks ago, thanks to the alertness of an airport  customs officer. Kach hurried to spread the news among the  reporters that settlers from the extreme right were stockpiling  weapons and explosives, partly smuggled from Russia and  Czechoslovakia, and partly stolen from IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] camps. "We are not doing it," the Kach members hastened  to say, "but we know about cases of weapons hoarding, about  smuggling in dismantled Kalashnikov rifles, about explosives in  suitcases, and information pamphlets on how to prepare  bombs--things from Red Army surplus."    Kach's knack for public relations is proven daily, both  through the exploits, real or imaginary, of the "Committee for  Safety on the Roads," considered the "military arm" of the Kach  movement. Every time an attack against the Arabs is reported,  the newspapers receive a notice over the beeper from an unknown  person who calls himself "Ronen" and takes responsibility for  the action in the name of the Committee for Safety on the Roads.  Up until last Friday, his announcements always arrived after the  attack on the Arabs had already been reported over the media.    Thus, for instance, the committee claimed responsibility for  the murder of the Arab in Thurmosaiah near Shiloh, last week.  But, as everyone knows, the suspect the police arrested in that  attack was a young man from Shilo who is not known at all as a  Kach activist or a member of the committee. We should say,  though, that Ronen's announcements usually are--reliable.  Investigation shows that the announcements he has turned in have  usually had a basis in fact.    So it was, too, with the murder of the three Arabs last  Friday. Except that this time, Ronen's announcement to the  newspapers arrived over the beepers even before the murder was  reported over the radio. This would seem in itself to prove that  this time Ronen did not hitch a ride on the actions of others,  and that the anonymous announcer knew about the murder from  sources of his own. These things, at any rate, should certainly  start the security officers investigating the case thinking.    Is Kach really as dangerous is it seems? Are its activists  stockpiling illegal weapons, in addition to the legal weapons  they have in their hands? Did members of the Committee for  Safety on the Roads really carry out the murder of the three  Arab workers in Tarkomiah?    The police and General Security Service expend great energy  following the trail of the activists of Kach and its offshoots.  Kach leaders and activists are constantly brought in for  questioning, under suspicion of various things. But it usually  turns out that the security forces and the law cannot find the  proof they need to get them convicted of anything more  substantial crimes than disturbing the peace, rioting, or  aggressive behavior.    The movement's members and leaders are almost always freed  on  bail the same day. Sometimes they have to spend a few days in  jail--and then are freed in court. Only very occasionally are  members of Kach found guilty of crimes that require them to be  locked up for periods of a few months or more.    Members of Kach customarily explain this phenomenon as  "political persecution" and as "the Bolshevik methods" of the  government and its representatives--which are always blocked in  the courtroom. But the real explanation apparently lies in the  fact that the leaders of Kach are much more sophisticated about  treading right on the edge of legality than they seem. It is  very hard to catch one of them "in the act" committing a crime.  Thus it also was when members of the "Committee for Safety on  the Roads" put on their "nightly show" before a TV team a few  months ago in the alleys of Hebron. Except for the game of  "Hasamba" which is not illegal, the only crime photographed was  breaking a street light....    So far, for example, nobody has been arrested in the case  where a number of hand grenades were found in the courtyard of a  Kach branch several weeks ago. Nor was anyone arrested for  murder, or for inciting others to murder, because even in what  they say to the press, the movement's spokesmen are always  careful to emphasize that although they "understand" the  phenomenon of murder of Arabs--they are not doing it.    Since Rabbi Meir Kahane was murdered in November 1990, Kach  has been led by a triangle of leaders. That triangle already  served as the operative arm of the movement when Rabbi Kahane  still served as spiritual and ideological leader of the movement.    At the top of this trio stands Baruch Marzel (34), chosen to  be the leader of Kach after a short period of several months  when Rabbi Avraham Toledano took Rabbi Meir Kahane's place. When  Rabbi Kahane was still alive, Marzel served as secretary of the  Kach faction in the Knesset, as spokesman for the movement, and  as the Rabbi's right-hand man.    Marzel, who lives with his large family in a caravan at Tel  Romeida in Hebron, is an artist at media and public relations.  He knows all the "shticks" and "tricks"--and at the same time is  careful of what he says and does. So far, he has proved that he  knows exactly how to get his messages across without falling  into legal traps. Still, he has been convicted for violence,  rioting, and disturbing the peace, and sentenced a number of  times to spend several months in jail.    Another quality that helped him to be chosen to head the  pyramid was his organizational ability. Thus, for example,  Barukh Marzel was one of the main organizers of the mass funeral  of Mordehai and Shalom Lapid, which began at Yeshivat Ponevitch  in Bnai Barak and finished in Hebron. Marzel is very accepted in  "Gush Emunim" circles, and takes part in councils of the joint  leadership of the right.    The two other points in the trio are Noam Federman, the  movement's spokesman; and Tiran Pollak, chairman of the  Committee for Safety on the Roads, and Kach candidate for the  Jerusalem city council.    Federman joined Kach when he was just 14. Since then, he has  managed to chalk up a long list of criminal arrests and  convictions for rioting, damaging property, and acts of  aggression. Thus, for example, he was found guilty several years  ago of setting fire to the church of St. Paul and of damaging  the property of Arabs and leftists--among them former Shalom  Ahshav spokesman Amiram Goldbloom--and also sentenced to 20  months imprisonment.    Tiran Pollack also has a very long criminal record of  similar  offenses, but has spent less time than the others have in jail.  Among other things, he has been under suspicion at various times  of spraying Arab vineyards outside Hilhul with poison, setting  the door of Jerusalem leftist activist Reuven Kaminer's house on  fire, and organizing the big revenge crusades in Jerusalem after  the murder of Yeshiva student Eliyahu 'Amadi in 1986. He joined  Kach for tragic reasons, after losing his two sisters, Nurit and  Esther, when Bus No. 18 was blown up on Herzl Boulevard in  Jerusalem on 6 December 1983.    The High Court of Justice ruled in 1988 to outlaw Kach as a  racist movement, and forbade it to participate in elections.  Now, Knesset members are demanding that its members be banned  from the territories of Judaea and Samaria and the Gaza Strip.  There are about 200 active members in the movement today, and it  is very possible that in many of them will find themselves  facing a wave of administrative arrests and forcible removals in  the near future.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cupid falls into red and omits dividend TOUGH TRADING in the marriage market and high costs pushed Cupid, the USM-quoted bridal wear company, into losses in the year to end-March. The dividend has been passed. The pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.48m compared with profits of Pounds 867,000. Last year the group paid a dividend of 3.25p. Cupid, which grew rapidly through acquisition in the 1990s and has suffered from high costs and heavy borrowings, yesterday expressed optimism for the current year. The company said: 'Trading in the first month of the current year has been in line with the new management's expectations. The benefits of cost cutting are becoming evident and the board remains confident of a satisfactory outcome in the current year.' Cupid's shares closed down 1p to 27p yesterday. The stock, which traded as high as 143p in July 1989, had slumped after a profits warning in December 1992 which was accompanied by the resig-nation of the company's founders, Mr Michael Murray and his wife, Sue. In February a Pounds 600,000 net share subscription, organised by the company's new chairman, Mr Richard Shaw, reduced gearing from more than 100 per cent to 74 per cent. Gearing fell further, to 42 per cent, with the Pounds 1.2m net proceeds of a rights issue, the third in little more than two years, received in early April. Turnover improved to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 14.7m) reflecting the first full-year contribution of the Youngs mens wear chain, acquired in January last year. The company, which has adopted the new FRS 3 accounting standard, took exceptional charges of Pounds 663,000 (Pounds 115,000) including Pounds 188,000 in compensation for four directors' loss of office, and a reorganisation of its nursery and retail divisions. Interest and similar charges amounted to Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 364,000). Losses per share were 10.5p (earnings 7.4p).</p>

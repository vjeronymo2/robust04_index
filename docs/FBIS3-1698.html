			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 28 (XINHUA) -- The Bulgarian  Government said Monday [28 February] that it is deeply concerned  over the violation of the no-fly zone imposed over Bosnia by the  United Nations.    It was reported earlier today that two NATO F-16 fighters  shot down four alleged Bosnian Serb aircraft over Banja Luka in  Bosnia.    A statement issued by Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry about the  action carried out by NATO said the UN resolutions enforcing a  no-fly zone, numbers 781 and 816, were part of the efforts made  by the international community to find a peaceful settlement to  the Bosnia crisis.    It appealed for a strict compliance of these resolutions and  hoped that the incident will not jeopardize the on-going peace  process for an end to the military conflict in Bosnia.</p>

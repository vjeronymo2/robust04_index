			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Today,  Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central Political Bureau and vice  premier of the State Council, said that overseas exchanges  should serve the central task of economic construction and serve  China's foreign relations and China's reunification.    Qian Qichen said this in a speech to the Second Plenary  Meeting of the Executive Council of the Overseas Exchanges  Association of China.    Qian Qichen said: "In the four years since the founding of  the Overseas Exchange Association of China, it has played a  positive role in giving publicity to China's achievements in its  reform, opening, and economic construction, in promoting unity  and friendship with Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of  Chinese descent, and in developing cooperation and exchanges  with overseas Chinese communities and foreign citizens of  Chinese origin. I hope that the association will continue to  play a better role in these aspects in the future."    Qian Qichen held: The new situation requires further  expansion of China's overseas exchanges so that China may better  understand the world and the world may also better understand  China. This will thus set higher requirements for the work of  the Overseas Exchange Association of China and will also create  a broader scope of activity for the association.    When talking about the concrete hopes pinned on the Overseas  Exchange Association, Qian Qichen said: Economic construction  is the central task of the CPC and the Chinese Government. Our  work in all trades should be closely tied to this central task.  The work of the Overseas Exchange Association and its local  branches at all levels should also be conducted closely around  the central task. Only thus will they play an effective role as  they should. After analyzing China's economic situation in the  last two years, he said: When the world economy remained in a  recession, there was sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development in China. The 1.2 billion Chinese people display  broad market prospects, which have aroused interest and  attention from more and more countries in the world and are  greatly attractive to overseas investors and entrepreneurs,  including overseas Chinese investors and entrepreneurs. This  provides a favorable environment for the Overseas Exchange  Association to conduct its work in order to serve our country's  economic construction.    Qian Qichen said: In the development of foreign relations,  mass organizations involved in foreign activities constitute an  indispensable force, and their role should be brought into full  play. Such organizations may have different characters and  perform different functions, but they share one common point.  That is, they are doing the work of making friends, building up  friendship, promoting communication, increasing exchanges, and  seeking common ground. The Overseas Exchange Association is  oriented to Overseas Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese  origin. It has a large number of contacts among overseas  Chinese in various social strata and has built up a rather  profound friendship with some of them. Being mass organizations  in some specific communities, the local branches of the Overseas  Exchanges Association at all levels keep natural blood relations  and fellow countryman fraternity with overseas Chinese and  foreign citizens of Chinese origin. With these favorable  conditions, they may more naturally and more flexibly make  friends in a broad scope.    At the same time, Qian Qichen also hoped that overseas  Chinese and foreign citizens of Chinese origin will settle down  and take root in the foreign countries where they are living,  and will get along in good terms with local people and make  contributions to local economic development.    When talking about the role of the Overseas Exchanges  Association of China in promoting the motherland's peaceful  reunification, Qian Qichen said: To resume the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao and to realize "peaceful  reunification" between the two sides of the straits, we not only  need cooperation between the Chinese and British Governments and  between the Chinese and Portuguese Governments and pin hopes on  the Taiwan authorities, but also need to rely on an increasing  patriotic and reunification-upholding force among the  compatriots in all social strata in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan  and rely on the joint efforts of all Chinese people and people  of Chinese origin at home and abroad who support China's  reunification. Because the local branches of the Overseas  Exchange Association have broad and close connections with  overseas Chinese, foreign citizens of Chinese origin, and the  business communities and people in all social strata of Hong  Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, they should actively give publicity to  the policy of "one country, two systems" and other guidelines,  principles, and policies for realizing China's peaceful  reunification through their connections among Overseas Chinese  and foreign citizens of Chinese origin. This will certainly be  conducive to increasing exchanges, understanding, and common  ground between the mainland on the one side and Hong Kong,  Macao, and Taiwan on the other side, thus promoting the smooth  return of Hong Kong and Macao and speeding up the process of  peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait.    Today's plenary meeting of the Second Executive Council of  the Overseas Exchange Association of China was chaired by Qian  Weichang, chairman of the association. Liao Hui, vice chairman  of the association, delivered a work report in which he reviewed  the association's work in 1993 and outlined the 1994 work plan.    At today's meeting, 46 new members headed by Chen Ziying  were  added to the Executive Council, and 16 new members were added to  the Standing Committee of the Executive Council. Zhu Youjun,  director of ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, was appointed to be new  secretary general for the association.</p>

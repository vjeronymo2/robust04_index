			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cui Yachao [1508 0068 6389]: ``Supertwist </F> [Nematic] Liquid Crystal Displays Developed: Breaks Foreign  Technology Blockade'']    [Editorial Report] Additional details on the CAS Changchun  Institute of Physics' development of supertwist-nematic liquid  crystal displays (STN-LCDs) not already supplied in an earlier  report [see JPRS-CST-94-001, 24 Jan 94 p 31] are as follows:  with this achievement, Chinese technologists have broken the  blockade on STN-LCD product development software technology  directly imposed by foreign nations on China. The domestically  made 4-inch, 64-inch STN-LCDs come in yellow, blue, and B&amp;W  modes. In addition to the STN-LCD modules themselves, the CAS  institute researchers independently developed the appropriate  software technology, certified by a CAS-organized technical  expert committee at the end of 1993. This software includes  computer simulation and design routines and device fabrication  programs.</p>

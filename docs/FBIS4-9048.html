			<p>BFN     [Text] Dunajska Streda, West Slovakia April 18 (CTK) --  "Relations between the Slovak Republic and Hungary must be  deideologised and relieved of the unnecessary historic burden,"  Peter Weiss, chairman of the coalition Democratic Left Party  (SDL), said today after his talks with Gyula Horn, chairman of  the Hungarian Socialist Party.    Weiss said both countries accepted the idea of concluding a  general agreement which would also enshrine the unchangeability  of the border.    Horn said that before the agreement is signed, Slovakia must  comply with the recommendations from the Council of Europe (CE)  and solve the problems of bilingual names of communities and the  way of writing Hungarian names. But he added that "the status  of ethnic minorities in Slovakia is still better than in  neighbour countries."    Turning to the controversial Gabcikovo-Nagymaros  hydroproject  on the Danube, Weiss said he supported the completion of  Nagymaros. He voiced the hope that a technical solution  beneficial to both countries would be found.    Weiss said he was convinced that the problem would be solved  so that neither side "lose face."    Horn said that the problem of Gabcikovo, the Slovak part of  the hydroproject completed in 1993, must be depoliticised and  that a commission composed of independent experts from both  countries should be set up to propose a solution.    Hungary has been strongly criticising Gabcikovo, complaining  that it has diverted water from its territory.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEAN BEACHES;  </P> <P> POLICE WATCH WARILY AS GROWING NUMBERS OF GANG MEMBERS FLOCK TO SHORELINE  </P> <P> This summer, as stifling heat has driven huge crowds to the beaches and kept  them there long into the night, their ranks have included growing numbers of  gang members and, watching warily, newly strengthened police patrols.  </P> <P> Already a familiar presence at Santa Monica Pier, Venice Beach and Dockweiler  State Beach, gang members have been showing up in unprecedented numbers at  beaches from Malibu to San Pedro, according to police and lifeguards.  </P> <P> "Normally, it is something you read about as a problem in someone else's  community. But today, this year, now, it is something we are seeing on the  beach," said Randy DeGregori, assistant chief lifeguard for the Los Angeles  County Department of Beaches and Harbors.  </P> <P> So far this summer, authorities say, there have been few violent outbursts by  gangs at the beach. But as the growing numbers of gang members increase the  chances of confrontations, police have moved quickly to prevent friction from  escalating into violence.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police have added five officers to their Pacific Division beach  patrols and extended patrol hours to 10:30 p.m. Los Angeles County sheriff's  deputies have added similar patrols on Malibu Beach. Santa Monica police are  now enforcing a 10 p.m. curfew to force juveniles away from the city's pier.  Even the county's 700 lifeguards are for the first time being trained to  recognize gang members and deal with incidents they may cause in beach areas.  </P> <P> The gang members usually loiter in beach parking lots, drinking and carousing,  but rarely venturing onto the sand, authorities say.  </P> <P> Early last Friday morning, police said, a 29-year-old Hollywood woman was  allegedly gang-raped in a beach parking lot north of the Santa Monica Pier.  Although details are sketchy, Santa Monica police said they are investigating  reports that the six suspects were gang members.  </P> <P> Just hours before that incident, after a dance concert ended on the pier, six  gang members from Santa Monica milled about in the middle of the pier. As the  10 p.m. curfew passed, they remained at the pier, eyed by four other young gang  members who stood nearby, leaning against a railing.  </P> <P> Dressed all in black, the four gang members began to saunter away when a  reporter approached them. But one of the youths, who wore a Los Angeles Raiders  cap cocked askew on his head, said: "We're not from down here" -- a response  that police say indicates that they were gang members from some other area.  </P> <P> "They're coming here from East L.A. and the Valley, from San Gabriel and  Wilmington and West Covina," said Oscar, 18, a professed gang member who was  one of the other six youths on the pier. "Why? They want to party over here.  It's boring over there, wherever they're from."  </P> <P> Oscar and his fellow gang members claim that shootings are not uncommon near  the beaches, but that few show up in crime reports. Police find out, they said,  only if someone is killed or seriously hurt, but not when the bullets miss or  cause minor injuries.  </P> <P> Police keep few statistics on gang-related incidents at state and local  beaches. And those who do rarely break them down into areas as small as  individual beaches. There have been a few incidents in which gang members have  intimidated, robbed or assaulted beach-goers, police say. But more often, gangs  clash with each other in fistfights and taunts that usually go unreported.  </P> <P> "We are not seeing such a high incidence that . . . is alarming or  overwhelming," DeGregori said.  </P> <P> On Saturdays and Sundays, as many as 400 gang members hang out in the parking  lots at Venice and Dockweiler, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Patrick Froehle,  who supervises Pacific Division units from the Santa Monica city line to El  Segundo.  </P> <P> Priscilla Thiry, who lives a block from Venice Beach, said gang members descend  on her neighborhood "intensively," causing trouble and leaving graffiti. Thiry  said she has complained to seven different police watch commanders and patrol  officers.  </P> <P> Like other teen-agers on summer break, gang members head for the shore to  socialize and have a good time. But by "flying their colors" -- flaunting their  gang ties with tattoos, baggy pants, jewelry and other gang-related clothing --  they can easily turn a routine outing into a confrontation with a rival gang,  authorities say.  </P> <P> The mere act of wearing their colors is enough to get some gang members ejected  from beach areas. "If you're going to go there to fly your colors," said  Detective Bill Humphry of the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang  Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums unit, "you'll be asked to leave  because all you're doing is provoking a confrontation."  </P> <P> On July 15, Humphry said, police ordered one gang member to leave Venice Beach  for wearing his colors. He ignored officers' orders and then kicked one  officer, Humphry said. The man was then arrested on charges of battery against  a police officer.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, during pre-dawn July 4 fireworks at the pier, two men were  shot by suspected gang members who were later arrested, said Detective Erroll  Southers of that city's gang unit. Gang violence forced the city to move its  fireworks show from night to early morning several years ago.  </P> <P> According to Southers, the Santa Monica Pier is among the most popular gang  hangouts in the area. "It's open all night, it's cool, you can come here with  your homeboys or your girlfriend and hang out and play . . . ," Southers said.  </P> <P> He added that most beach-goers are safe "unless it is a crime of opportunity. .  . . If John Doe is getting into his Porsche and no one's around, they'll try to  take it. But that is unusual, even if there's 50 of them (gang members)."  </P> <P> But locals like Juan Gonzales, a cashier at the Beachcomber gift shop on the  pier, disagree. "When the gangbangers from East L.A. or the Valley come down on  the weekend now, there's always problems," he said.  </P> <P> "The young ones, they're pretty crazy," Gonzales said. "They want to prove  themselves, and they're dangerous. If they want money, they'll get it any way  they can."  </P></p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Greycoat move expected SPECULATION that institutional investors in Greycoat are close to a new deal to save the stricken property company sent its securities climbing sharply yesterday. The ordinary shares jumped 6 to 27p with over 3m traded, while the preference shares added 4 3/4 to 56 1/2 p. In late trading, talk that a statement was coming this morning fuelled expectations that new restructuring talks were well advanced. Greycoat announced two days ago that several approaches had been made and the market was yesterday attempting to put flesh on the bones of any proposed deal. All the major stakeholders figured in the latest speculation, with UK Active Value Fund, advised by corporate financiers Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger, and controlling 18 per cent of Greycoat's ordinary shares, prominent. One source close to the talks said that the terms being drafted would address the requirements of the preference holders by offering a conversion into the ordinary's. A rights issue is likely to be included, although speculation that this would involve a Pounds 60m issue at 2 shares for one was dismissed as 'wide of the mark' by a Greycoat source.</p>

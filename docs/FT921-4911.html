			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Insurance 'key to boost investment' INVESTMENT insurance could provide an important bridge between the needs of many developing countries to improve their infrastructure and the reduced willingness of banks and rich-country governments to provide credit. This is a central conclusion of a report published today by the Helsinki-based World Institute for Development Economics Research of the UN University*. The study, whose authors include Sir Kenneth Berrill, former chairman of Britain's Security and Investment Board and Mr Frank Vibert, deputy director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, draws attention to the growing desire of developing country governments and those in eastern Europe to use private sector capital to develop infrastructure. A lack of credit from banks and export credit agencies has hit investment in indebted developing countries. 'Traditional financial flows to developing countries have been hit for six, and it's important other types of flows are stimulated,' Sir Kenneth said yesterday. Private insurance is currently obtainable against risk that investments may be confiscated, expropriated or nationalised, against 'creeping expropriation' - discriminatory measures by a government that make it impossible in practice to carry on a business. However, most private insurance is available only for a maximum 3 years and excludes war risk. Official bilateral insurance, provided by 20 rich country governments, offers long-term cover up to 15 years and against the three traditional classes of political risk: war, expropriation and government curbs on remittance transfers. Such insurance has so far been used modestly: while officially insured export credits to the developing world total Dollars 240bn, officially insured investment totals about Dollars 18bn. Existing investments are not covered and there are often quantitative limits and gaps in geographical coverage. In theory private and official insurance supplement one another, but in practice there is 'no neat dovetailing'. It suggests a pooling of private sector and government sources of investment insurance. Furthermore: 'The regional development banks, particularly in east Europe, Latin America and Africa, might wish to set aside a part of their capital to provide new capacity in the market probably through offering a supplementary insurance facility.' One drawback of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency - an investment guarantee organisation linked to the World Bank - is its inability to provide guarantees for existing investments. *Private Investment in Infrastructure: The Mobilisation of Equity Capital.

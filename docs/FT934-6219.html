			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Guerrilla ministers ruled out in Cambodia Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Cambodia's first prime minister, yesterday rejected as unconstitutional a suggestion by King Norodom Sihanouk, his father, that the Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction could be offered ministerial roles in government, Reuter reports from Dey Eith, Cambodia. 'The constitution prevents us appointing any people not members of the parties which have members in parliament,' Prince Ranariddh told Khmer Rouge defectors being inducted into the army. By failing to respond to government peace offers, the guerrillas ran the risk of disappearing. But the guerrillas might be offered a role as special envoys to report on the sovereignty of Cambodia's common borders with Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, he added. King Sihanouk earlier proposed to offer 'acceptable' Khmer Rouge officials positions as co-ministers, co-deputy ministers, co-secretaries of state and advisers in the new coalition government led by Prince Ranariddh. The Cambodian constitution forbids appointment of non-elected people to parliament. The Khmer Rouge, held responsible for the deaths of 1m Cambodians during the 1975-79 'killing fields' years, have sought an advisory role in government.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mariya Kara, "The Death of the </F> Interregional Reform Bloc (MBR)"]    [Text] The "historic" and "fateful" parliamentary  elections ended by reinforcing the parliamentary corps with the  implacable champions of "internationalism" and social justice in  the East and the no less aggressive fighters for "nationalism"  and social justice in the West. Although there is no shortage of  both sets of "champions, and we are guaranteed more futile  verbal battles between them and the continuation of the endless  Ukrainian serial of "A Madman at the Microphone," that is not  the point. A diverse and motley centrism has entered the arena  of Ukrainian politics, the most controversial current of which  is represented by the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc, popularly known as  the Interregional Reform Bloc [MBR]. The fate of this entity is  very important for Ukraine.    The original version of the political orientation of the MBR  was quite simple. In economic terms, this meant "moderate"  reforms modeled on Chernomyrdin's the the Civic Union's -- a  script for building an amorphous state capitalism for the  "parties of moneybags" controlling the cleaned-up Communist  Party treasury and for "unaccountable owners" --the nomenklatura  and the corps of directors. In the sphere of statehood, the MBR  was openly heading towards federation and crawling to Moscow,  back to the familiar system of ideas and concepts. These were  the declared principles. But reality has taken a different turn.  The MBR set out on the election marathon armed with such popular  slogans in the East as Russian as an official language,  federation, ties with the CIS and, above all, Russia, and  economic reforms. This enabled it to effortlessly "beat" all the  national-democrats. However, having been put together in haste,  haphazardly, and without much thought, the Hrynyov-Kuchma team  that was elected to parliament proved to be unusually  heterogeneous. The seed of discord was already present in the  leaders. L. Kuchma, ex-party organizer, ex-director, and  ex-prime minister, relied on the only support available to him  -- the directorial structures of the defense industry that he  himself comes from. He was, is, and will be the spokesman for  their interests, expressed by a formula as simple as  H[.sub]2[/]O: state paternalism, a vertical structure, a  state feeding trough, no worries, and a single [economic] space  with the maternal teat of the Russian defense industry and the  industry of polluting smokestacks and eternal nonliquidity.    On the other hand, Hrynyov and his team represent the money  of the Party nomenklatura that has been laundered through mixed  ventures [MP], joint ventures [SP], limited liability companies  [LTD], etc.; they specialize in castles in the air and rosy  clouds. This group is interested in eternal chaos and fears a  strong government, which could put an end to their boisterous  activity. The only common denominator between the two groups is  their orientation towards Moscow. In addition, both these  "leaders" have huge ambitions and a minimum of political culture.    The election results did not improve the situation. The MBR  leaders in Dnipropetrovsk, Balashov and Co., suffered a  devastating defeat because of unanimous opposition to Kuchma by  practically the entire monolith of local directors and the party  of power, headed by Pustovoytenko, whose favorite financial  corns Mr. Kuchma had trimmed in the fight for the "market." They  opposed Balashov as Kuchma's protege, even though essentially he  is closer to Hrynyov's branch of the MBR than Kuchma's. As a  result, the "disaffected" are inclined to blame Leonid  Danylovych personally for this outcome. Things went even more  badly in Zaporizhzhya and Kremenchuk, where the directors will  not forgive Kuchma "until their dying day" for the case  involving oil, the raids by law enforcement organs, and the  formal terror they were subjected to during the MBR leader's  tenure as prime minister.    Things were very difficult in the South, especially in  Odessa, where Kuchma encountered something he had not  anticipated -- he was forced to support Hurwits and his team  because the local Russian-speaking niche is firmly occupied by  Forum, which is both anti-Hrynyov and anti-Kuchma. And so he put  together an absolutely incongruous hotchpotch made up of  Hurvits, the Communist Bodelan, and Rychahov, the vociferous  Russian chauvinist from the Social-Democratic Party of Ukraine  [SDPU]. Included on this same quasi-MBR slate were Mr. Shyshkin  (the former procurator) and Mr. Yevdokymov (Union of Lawyers).  In other regions, they took what they could, as long as they  were Russian-speaking and not from Kravchuk's party of power.  These two qualifications were decisive. They did not stop to  think that these two categories cover a political spectrum as  wide as the Black Sea.    As a result, a very heterogenous bunch of people rode into  parliament on the shoulders of the MBR. Most of this crowd is of  the already fairly well established species of regional business  leader and much more rarely administrative and scientific  origin. Their worldview is based on pure pragmatism. Building  the state means building the economy. Most are young people  without any ideological complexes, whose ideal is to live as the  West lives. For this camp, Moscow is a point to push away from  rather than a point of attraction. This youthful,  Russian-speaking crowd fosters liberalism in sensu  stricto [i.e., in a narrow sense]. They are very far from  Kuchma's economic and Hrynyov's geopolitical orientations,  because in their defense of "their earthly interests and the  native Ukrainian feeding trough" they will prove even more  aggressive supporters of statehood than all the  national-democrats put together. The political membrane that  separates them from the Party of Democratic Rebirth of Ukraine  [PDVU], Rukh, and the Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] is very  thin and will give way in two or three months' time. They will  consolidate not in the direction of the MBR, but in the  direction of the spectrum named above. This camp's  disillusionment with Kuchma was already in evidence at the  congress of the USPP [Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs].    Meanwhile, twenty-four hours later, an event took place in a  cosy and comfortable hall near the Ministry of Justice that  defined the process quite clearly: the founding congress of the  thirty-third party to register --the Human Rights Party [partiya  "Prav lyudyny"]. To sum up this event very briefly, this was a  very small and harmless meeting of liberal-democratic lawyers,  headed by Mr. Onopenko, the minister of justice. The views of  this esteemed company were one hundred percent identical to the  views of businessmen and economists of similar orientation, only  focused on legal issues -- balancing the rights of the  individual and the state, limiting state paternalism, "inherent  rights," and other such liberal European classic concepts.    Among the founders of this new party are Shyshkin, Musiyaka  (Kharkiv), and Sherepil (Sevastopol). As late as the eve of the  congress, two of them were counted as members of the MBR. Taking  into account that Shyshkin nd the other lawyers from the South  ran as a united front, it is not difficult to predict that they  will group together in parliament. On the other hand, there is  no hope whatsoever that this moderate centrist team comprised of  national-democrats, the more sober segment of the party of  power, and liberals will support Mr. Kuchma or Mr. Hrynyov in  their "revolutionary plans." The Human Rights party will foster  a market economy "like theirs" with the same enthusiasm as the  liberal economists and work to evolve a legal system based on  Western models.    In the heat of battle, the MBR rashly pulled through the  remnants of the PDVU under its banners, losing Volodymyr  Filenko, the politician most loyal to Hrynyov in this party,  along the way. In contrast, most of those from this party who  won seats cannot imagine themselves in the same team with  Hrynyov in their worst nightmares. Thus, in parliament, a large  segment of the MBR will wander over towards the party of power  and the national-democrats.    There will also be a flight to the left. The reddish  spectrum, which Kuchma gathered together across the land under  the single slogan of "Down with Kravchuk!", will not long remain  under this partocrat's control. And so, such figures as Bodelan  and Rychahov and Co., whom Kuchma supported, will move to take  their place under the banners of familiar color and join the  more congenial company of Petro Symonenko and Oleksandr Moroz.  Others will head for the party of power, which they left for the  duration of the elections for purely tactical reasons.    The prognosis regarding the fate of the MBR is evident from  what has been said above. This heterogeneous group will unravel,  causing the groups to which it gives political voice to do the  same.    The liberal-democrats will unite with the more sober circles  of national-democrats and will most likely abandon Kuchma. The  Reds and reddish elements will support any leader from the ranks  of the CPU, who has rid himself of all semicapitalist fancies.  Consequentely, they, too, will no longer need Kuchma. Hrynyov's  moneybags will continue pursuing their own goals and will remain  a separate group that has clashed with Kuchma's group. And the  corps of directors and their party of power in the central  industrial region will fight Kuchma as an enemy of their lobby  interests.    In these circumstances, Leonid Danylovych may end up with  very few supporters and lose a significant portion of the  electorate in the South and East. Even now, their number is not  very large in Right-Bank Ukraine. Thus the parliamentary faction  of the MBR may become a political myth.</p>

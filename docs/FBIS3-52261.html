			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Dec. 30 (INA)--Secretary-General of the  Works and Housing Administration in the Iraqi Kurdistan Autonomy  Region Ghandi Muhammad Daza'i has asserted that the agent groups  there have stolen during the past two years all engineering  equipment and machines and vehicles of the state and smuggled  them to neighbouring countries and deposited their prices at  foreign banks.    He has made it clear that these thefts led to sabotaging all  roads and bridges of the area because of the lack of maintenance  and the region changed into a scene of only the phenomena of  sabotage, ruin and destruction.    He made it clear that the Kurdish citizen was now holding  comparison between the state of construction the region had been  seeing for twenty years under the July 17 revolution and the  state of devastation and destruction to which the region had  been exposed in two years at the hands of the agents and  mercenaries.    Secretary-General of Works and Housing in the Autonomy  Region  called on the citizens there to shoulder their responsibility  and to stand up to the agent groups that were trying to destroy  the Iraqi Kurds gains.</p>

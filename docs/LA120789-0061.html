			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: HELP WANTED  </P> <P> Blake's Own Business: Robert Blake, of TV's "Baretta" fame, is scouring the  city for three people he met at the Arriba Restaurant in Pasadena on a Friday  night about two weeks ago. He wants to find them so badly, he took out a  4x4-inch ad in the Pasadena Star News with a smiling picture of himself. "A  simple request, from actor Robert Blake, please help make my holiday season  special," reads the ad. It seems that one of the three people who chatted with  Blake at the restaurant mentioned knowing Blake's niece. "It would mean a great  deal to me if any one of these three people would call me," says the ad. When  contacted by The Times, Blake said he would rather let the whole thing rest and  would give no details. "What's going on here is a personal bit of strangeness,  that's all," he said.

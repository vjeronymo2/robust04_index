			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: No wonder he was smiling Sir, In the FT feature, 'The future of Auschwitz' (February 5/6), I read that a smile is a Japanese way of showing discomfort. On Monday, on the people page (Monday Interview), I read that BMW brings a broad smile to the wrinkled face of Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the president of Honda. Is it any wonder?

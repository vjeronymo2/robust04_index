			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jakovcic, chairman of the Istrian </F> Democratic Assembly, by Edi Jurkovic; place and date not given:  "Istria Is Indeed for Croatia, but...."]    [Text] There are many reasons for talking with Ivan  Jakovcic, chairman of the Istrian Democratic Assembly [IDS].  The course of events lately has unsettled relations between  Zagreb and Istria. It began in mid-April with the foundation of  the Council for Istria, that did not include the IDS  representatives who had won the elections in Istria.  Furthermore, the Statute of the Istrian County was annulled.  In a very tense situation, with the media scrutinizing the  situation through its magnifying glass, in late April the IDS  organized an extraordinary convention of the party in Rovinj, at  which heretical demands for a special, autonomous status for  Istria were stated again.    [Jurkovic] How do you assess the new tension between Zagreb  and Istria?    [Jakovcic] There are no changes in relations between  official Zagreb and Istria. That is, the consistent policy of  President Franjo Tudjman is proven to be so only by the example  of Istria. From the 1990 electoral campaign up to now we have  had a situation of continuous depreciation of the Istrian  authorities -- represented by the Social Democratic Party  before, and now by the IDS -- and the rejection of any  initiative coming from Istria.    [Jurkovic] A different interpretation is also possible, that  you are looking for bad blood beforehand. You condemned the  foundation of the Council for Istria from the outset.    [Jakovcic] It is solely official Zagreb that is to blame for  such relations between the central administration and Istria. I  can prove this quite simply. In the referendum for independent  and sovereign Croatia a great majority of the Istrian people had  voted for it, just as they voted for the IDS in the elections.  Which is to say, Istria is indeed for Croatia, but for a  democratic Croatia, rather than for one ruled by the Croatian  Democratic Community [HDZ].    We have to give careful consideration to any initiative made  by the state leadership, because any initiative by official  Zagreb in these four years has been aimed at crushing the  authorities in Istria, and causing disorder. It is not a  coincidence that as many as three messages came from Zagreb --  first, there was the establishment of the Council for Istria,  which I commented very cautiously, though it is not true that I  rejected a priori the establishment of that council. I just  wanted to have some latitude in order to see what it was all  about. Immediately thereafter the Statute was annulled --  actually it happened on the same day. And thirdly, we received  at the same time the message from the parliament's highest  officials that the problem of Istria may as well be settled by  the police, the army, or the executive boards. Of course, such  an attitude already verges upon totalitarian methods, which we  have to condemn.    [Jurkovic] How would you comment the assessment, which I  personally hold to be true, that the HDZ and IDS work according  to the principle of two vessels linked together, so that  pressure applied by HDZ strengthens the IDS, and vice versa. In  concrete terms, does the IDS have any use for the actions taken  by the HDZ?    [Jakovcic] Neither Istria nor the IDS can make any use of  the attacks by the HDZ, or steps taken by President Tudjman,  because any straining of relations between Istria and official  Zagreb in no way benefits Istria, nor, therefore, Croatia as a  whole. The suspension of democracy that is being announced  means "good night" to Croatia. The HDZ, which is thus making  internal enemies, follows the logic: Divide et impera [divide  and rule]. It wants to divide the citizens of Croatia in order  to be able to control them more easily. Of course, Istria will  resist this, because we want to be fully present in the Croatian  political life with our principles. That is the problem that  our dispute is about.    [Jurkovic] Will the IDS agree to take part in the activities  of the Council for Istria after all that has been said these  days?    [Jakovcic] In view of the current circumstances I do not see  any possibility of the IDS representatives' taking part in the  Council's work. Still, I cannot foresee what the County  Assembly will decide.    To say that the Council will be engaged in economic,  cultural, or similar matters means to suspend the county's  leadership, and indirectly the Croatian government, because that  is a job of the executive bodies. After all, I may well feel  that the Council is an attempt to create parallelism and  overthrow the authorities, but what I really want to feel is  that it is a council that would make suggestions to the  president to reconsider an appropriate status for Istria, in  view of all the events, the election results, the mood among the  citizens, and Istria's surroundings. That would be a positive  advance, and we might possibly discuss our joining the Council.    [Jurkovic] In addition to the Council the relations are  tensed also because of the annulment of the Statute of the  Istrian county, for which you said recently that it was the  minimum of what Istria wanted.  <H5>  We Are Defending Our Country's Reputation </H5>   [Jakovcic] Firstly, the Statute is in compliance with the  Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, and we shall prove this  at the Constitutional Court, and show that Istria absolutely  observes Croatia's legislation. Of course, the Statute is not  an expression of the political will of Istria's citizens, for  neither the country's system, nor the legislation are an  expression of the will of Istria's citizens. You remember how  we struggled in the parliament to change the bill on the  territorial organization of the Republic of Croatia, so that the  territory could be organized according to the historic regions,  but our efforts failed. The Statute is not an expression of the  political attitudes of the IDS, because we demand that Croatia  be regionalized in such a way that the regional assemblies are  given the legislative and governing authority. We see modern  Croatia as a country of regions founded on the tradition of  Stjepan Radic's [Croatian politician, assassinated in 1926  because he supported independent Croatia] constitution that  read, let me quote: "Counties must adopt regulations, of a  quality equal to that of laws." Another buttress of our  regionalism is the European standard of organizing regions.  That is a condition sine qua non [necessary condition] of the  IDS activities.    [Jurkovic] It is precisely your advocating Europe that is  disputable. For instance, you are being reproached for having  taken a copy of the bill on the constitutional law on Istria  with you to Geneva without the knowledge of the Foreign  Ministry. How did that happen, and why?    [Jakovcic] Firstly, the IDS defends the Croatian reputation  in the world wherever it goes, and this we can rightfully prove  by documents, deeds, our struggle for minorities' rights, for  the freedom of media, for private ownership, for individual  freedom. Since we are an eminent regional party, we are quite  respected in Europe, so we were invited to the European  Parliament and the Council of Europe. The delegation of the  Council of Europe will visit Croatia soon, including us as well.  The IDS has a right to be politically active on the European  political stage in its own way. As for your question, it should  be said that no move has been made without previously having  informed the Croatian authorities of our demands, because we do  nothing behind their back, before we inform either the president  or the Government of our intentions. We discuss everything in  the Assembly, while the fact that some eminent European  politicians, being familiar with the power structure in Croatia,  show interest in talking directly with the IDS is something else.    [Jurkovic] Let us further discuss the disputed bill. As  early as in September 1993 the bill was discussed for the first  time, while at the party convention in Rovinj it was brought  into the focus of attention again. What is the document about?    [Jakovcic] The bill was worked out following the experience  and practice of European regionalism, which means that the  County Assembly is to be given legislative and governing  authority. It involves also the apportionment of revenue,  where, if it were organized as we have envisaged, one-third  would suffice for the state, while two-thirds of the revenue  would remain in the region.    [Jurkovic] Ivan Herak has recently stated that President  Tudjman, when he learned about the program, agreed to the  possibility that two-thirds of the revenue should remain in the  region, as a pilot-program for economic autonomy, but he did not  want to hear about the county's having legislative authority.  Can you confirm this, since you have talked with the president  yourself?    [Jakovcic] Either Mr. Herak is lying, or Tudjman has  really changed his stance. I am not familiar with such an  assessment, but I would really be glad if the situation were so.  I believe that many relations would be different if such a  political will, in favor of apportioning the revenue, existed.  Still, it seems to me that Herak improvised [as published] the  statement, because such an apportionment means consequently the  apportionment of authority. We cannot expect the government to  get smaller, and to pay for everything else. Therefore it is  clear that his statement is not true.  <H5>  Fear of Totalitarianism </H5>   [Jurkovic] All right then, but would you still explain why  the constitutional law is again being insisted upon?    [Jakovcic] Because it is natural that the Croatian Assembly  should adopt the bill on the regional organization of Croatia,  or at least adopt it with regard to certain regions. It is also  natural that our current status cannot be as the IDS would wish  it to be, because no corresponding constitutional law exists,  and therefore the Bill has been worked out in compliance with  the existing regulations. Constitutional law is a normal  legislative form in the industrialized democratic states, by  which certain regions are given their own authorities and  statuses within a particular state.    [Jurkovic] Does it mean that you shall propose the same to  the Assembly?    [Jakovcic] Yes, when we decide that it is necessary.    [Jurkovic] Still, it is unrealistic that the proposal would  pass in the Assembly, so would you explain what a participant at  the IDS convention meant when he speculated what would happen if  the proposal was rejected in the Assembly?    [Jakovcic] Any policy, if it is wise, brings about actions  that benefit the citizens it represents. I believe that our  party will be taking such actions, so that it will propose the  constitutional law at the moment when we estimate it could win  the majority of votes. However, in order for a referendum to be  announced some really dramatic moments should occur.    [Jurkovic] What dramatic moments?    [Jakovcic] I refer to a possible deviation of official  Croatian policy toward totalitarianism. Then the IDS would  decide to follow a quixotic path, doomed in advance to fail in  the Assembly, but then that would be an ultimate expression of  our political stance, that the will of the Istrian voters is to  be respected. If Croatia diverts to dictatorship, which is  mentioned as a possibility also by some former aides of the  president, the question is what methods the IDS will go for.  They will be democratic in any case, while the referendum is  the most democratic method.    [Jurkovic] A new dimension to Istria's political position  has been brought about by the general elections in Italy. The  statements by the winners that the Osimo agreements [made in the  1970's, by which relations between Italy and the Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the fields of politics,  economics, minority rights, and so forth, were defined] ought to  be revised, have brought about much apprehension in Croatia.  How would you comment on all that?    [Jakovcic] The Italian political scene has been overwhelmed  by statements, some of which were not at all serious, but I  would not say that they are dangerous for the Croatian  sovereignty, because neither Istria nor Dalmatia accept any  revision of the state borders. I have to say that it is normal  that in any state there are those who dream about greater Italy,  greater Serbia, or greater Croatia. Fortunately enough, such  people are marginal. I am deeply convinced of Italy's  democratic orientation and I believe that the new Italian  government will also be one of the pillars of democratic Europe,  following the principles of the Helsinki and the Maastricht  convention.    The Lega Nord, being the leading Italian party, was first to  dissociate itself from the statements by neofascists. The  relations between the IDS and the Lega Nord are quite correct,  and we intend to cultivate them further. The Lega Nord was the  first party in Italy to state clearly and vociferously as early  as in 1991 their support for the independence of Croatia, and to  visit, I think, minister Separovic. By the agency of Lega Nord  we shall insist that Croatia and Slovenia be admitted to the  European institutions as soon as possible, and we believe that  in such terms the IDS can considerably help Croatian foreign  policy. Whether our Foreign Ministry will be wise and make good  use of us, I do not know, but that would be quite a prudent  thing to do.    [Jurcevic] In your relations with Italy the most disputed  matter are the Osimo agreements, their revision. What is your  attitude in that regard?    [Jakovcic] The Osimo agreements are a complex matter,  regulating many things, but what is important is that they  closed the history book in this region by definitely fixing the  boundaries, and this is irrevocable. However, the agreements  deal with many other things as well, for instance, with the  property of refugees (esula), the protection of the Italian  ethnic minority, economic cooperation, the traffic of goods and  people, and those are clauses that require amendments, because  they have not been implemented. It is only that part where we  can talk about a revision of the agreement, of course in the way  that friendly neighbors would do it.  <H5>  Istrianism Is Reality </H5>   [Jurcevic] In addition to that there is a fear that some  people's declaring themselves as Istrians benefits the  Italianization of Istria. Generally, that designation is  disputed, yet Istrianism is protected also by the Statute of the  County.    [Jakovcic] Today, Istrianism is very much an explicit  reality in Istria, and it is impossible to estimate in which way  it would manifest itself further. Nobody can ignore the fact  that in the 1991 census some 40,000 people declared themselves  as Istrians. That has nothing to do with the Italianization of  Istria, but rather with the awakened regional identity among the  people who have suppressed their national being, and accepted a  geo-ethnic relation they have with the region they are living  in, so they feel that Istria is their micro-fatherland.    [Jurcevic] Do you think that the Istrians are a people in  their own right?    [Jakovcic] They are what each of them feels to be. A  people, or a deception -- you can understand it whichever way  you will. It is too early now to assess that phenomenon. It  should be analyzed by serious, competent people, while  politicians would only bring in too much passion, so I would not  like to interpret what happened in the past census without an  expert analysis, which will have to be made anyway.    [Jurcevic] An extraordinary convention of the IDS was held  recently in Rovinj. How do you assess it?    [Jakovcic] We have adopted four declarations that give  operative strength to the party's platform, and precisely  determine attitudes regarding the democratization and  regionalization of Croatia, the autonomy of the Istrian county,  and Istria as a European region. These are documents that  clearly show to all those who expected us to subvert Croatian  sovereignty, that they have ended up with the short end of the  stick. What I, personally, find particularly bothersome is that  some distinguished Croatian politicians speculated about the  convention in Rovinj, thinking out various scenarios of how it  would eventually end up.  <H5>  A Right of Herak and Martincic </H5>   [Jurcevic] It is interesting that your declarations have  been severely attacked even by the colleagues in the regional  RIDS [extension not known], that heads the Association of  Regional Parties of Croatia [ARSH]. They say that your  declarations are preposterous, improper, a sheer provocation....    [Jakovcic] The colleagues in RIDS have many times made very  strange assessments on the IDS attitudes, and I have to add that  when we had the most difficult time, the most difficult problems  to deal with, they deliberately sided with those who wanted to  crush our party for personal reasons. Whether the RIDS wanted  to stamp out the ARSH will be shown in the course of time, but I  have to tell you that I am less and less bewildered by their  reactions. Although I am a great supporter of talks, I think  that the room for cooperation with them is getting narrower and  narrower.    [Jurcevic] Does that attitude of yours call into question  the ARSH as well?    [Jakovcic] I think that the ARSH may become well established  in the Croatian political space, if democratic processes prevail  in it in such a way that each party acts autonomously, rather  than -- as was the case -- to let RIDS impose its attitudes  regarding the resolution of the situation in our party. I think  that the RIDS has to take serious care of what is to be done  further.    [Jurcevic] With respect to your party's convention, and  the turbulence that occurred within the party not so long ago,  how do you explain the legalization of factions within the party?    [Jakovcic] As for the functioning of the IDS in factions,  that was my idea from the very day when the problems in personal  relations broke out in the party. However, those who wanted to  overthrow Delbianco and me did not want to accept the idea.  Debeljuh's initiative to allow factions has come about somewhat  late, but nevertheless, it is a constructive and well-meant  initiative, so we shall set up criteria for the factional  organization of the party. In that way we shall increase the  degree of democracy. I have immediately asked Debeljuh to take  part in The Parties' Club on Croatian television, because he is  entitled to that, representing, as he does, a future faction.    [Jurkovic] Finally, I would like you to comment on the  announcement of the foundation of Istria's new party by former  IDS members, namely Herak and Elio Martincic.    [Jakovcic] To found a new party is their democratic right.  One should pay attention to their platform and what they offer  to the voters. For the time being the attitude of the IDS is  neutral.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the second respondent's comment, REA considers the shrinkback test for loose and tight tube buffers to be a completed cable performance test because the shrinkback test provides REA with one means of assuring that the buffer tubes can withstand the rigors of the field cable splicing operation. Since REA considers the performance of the buffer tubes to be a critical requirement of the field cable splicing operation, REA will not eliminate the shrinkback test from the specification as recommended by the respondent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent recommended that the cold bend test for loose and tight tube buffers be eliminated from the specification because they consider this test to be a cable component test and not a completed cable performance test. The same respondent also recommended that if REA maintained the cold bend test that the mandrel diameter be changed from 5 times the tube diameter to 10 times the tube diameter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> REA considers the cold bend test for loose and tight tube buffers to be a completed cable performance test because the cold bend test provides REA with one means of assuring that the buffer tubes can withstand the rigors of the field cable splicing operation. Since REA considers the performance of the buffer tubes to be a critical requirement of the field cable splicing operation, REA will not eliminate the cold bend test from the specification as recommended by the respondent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the commenter's recommendation for changing the size of the test mandrel diameter, REA would like to point out that mandrel diameter of 5 times the buffer tube diameter is the same mandrel diameter as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90. Since manufacturers have been performing the cold bend test using the mandrel diameter of 5 times the buffer tube diameter as specified in REA Bulletin 345&hyph;90 for more than seven years without any reported problems, REA will not change the mandrel diameter for the cold bend test specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the mandrel diameter recommended by the commenter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three respondents recommended that reference in paragraph (d)(2) of the specification for defining the color limits of the colored optical fibers be changed from EIA&hyph;359&hyph;A&hyph;1984 to EIA/TIA&hyph;598. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reason that REA referenced the EIA&hyph;359&hyph;A&hyph;1984 copper cable standard for defining the color limits of the colored optical fibers except for rose and aqua colors in 7 CFR 1755.900 is because at the time of its writing no EIA standard existed for defining the color limits for fiber optic cables. Since EIA has now published a color coding standard solely for fiber optic cables which includes the rose color, REA will change the reference in paragraph (d)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 from EIA&hyph;359&hyph;A&hyph;1984 to EIA/TIA&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 598. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Five respondents recommended that the color limits specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the specification for rose be eliminated and the aqua limits be changed to the proposed EIA limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reason for specifying the rose and aqua color limits in 7 CFR 1755.900 was because the EIA&hyph;359&hyph;A&hyph;1984 standard did not contain limits for these colors. Since the EIA/TIA&hyph;598 Standard specifies the rose color limits, REA will eliminate the rose color limits from paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 7 CFR 1755.900. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding the aqua color limit, EIA/TIA&hyph;598 contains a color limit for aqua but the fiber optic cable industry is dissatisfied with the limits of the EIA/TIA standard. In fact EIA/TIA is revising the current standard to reflect the new aqua limits being proposed by the industry. Therefore to assure that the aqua color limits of 7 CFR 1755.900 will coincide with the proposed aqua limits of the revised EIA/TIA&hyph;598 Standard, REA will change the aqua limits currently specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the aqua color limits proposed for incorporation into the revised EIA/TIA&hyph;598 Color Standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One respondent commented that paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the specification which states that REA will not accept alternative coloring schemes which deviate from the color coding scheme specified in paragraph (d)(1) of 7 CFR 1755.900 be eliminated from the specification. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reason for this requirement is to provide REA borrowers with one color coding standard for identification of buffer tubes and optical fibers to facilitate the splicing of fiber optic cables in the field. If REA allowed alternative coloring schemes for identification of buffer tubes and optical fibers as recommended by the commenter, REA would be doing a disservice to our borrowers by negating the requirement's intended purpose of facilitating field splicing of fiber optic cables by REA borrowers. Since this requirement will facilitate the splicing of fiber optic cables in the field by REA borrowers, REA will not eliminate paragraph (d)(2)(ii) from the specification as recommended by the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

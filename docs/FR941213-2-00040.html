The petition proposes that the food additive regulations in &sect;180.25  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Mannitol <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (21 CFR 180.25) be amended to permit the manufacture of mannitol by fermentation of sugars or sugar alcohols such as glucose, sucrose, fructose, or sorbitol by the action of the yeast  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Zygosaccharomyces rouxii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of FDA's comprehensive safety review of substances on the list of substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS), the safety of mannitol as a food ingredient was evaluated in 1972 by the Select Committee on GRAS Substances (SCOGS) from the Life Sciences Research Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). SCOGS concluded that mannitol was safe when used in food at current or reasonably expected future levels. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 26, 1973 (38 FR 20046), FDA proposed to affirm the GRAS status of mannitol that was manufactured by the process then known to the agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the proposal, the agency received a comment stating that mannitol was also commonly manufactured by a process different from that set out in the proposed GRAS affirmation. The agency also received information raising questions about the safety of mannitol. Data from studies on mannitol demonstrated a significant (but not dose related) incidence of benign thymomas, and an abnormal growth of thymus gland tissue, in female rats fed mannitol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of these findings, the agency concluded that additional data were necessary to evaluate the safety of mannitol. Thus, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of September 23, 1974 (39 FR 34178), the agency declined to affirm the use of mannitol as GRAS and, instead, established an interim food additive regulation for use of mannitol at existing levels. The interim regulation, &sect;121.4005 (21 CFR 121.4005) (redesignated as &sect;180.25 (21 CFR 180.25)) required that mannitol be manufactured by either the process FDA had proposed to affirm as GRAS or the process described in the comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the publication of the interim food additive regulation, the agency received data that showed an increased combined incidence of medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma of the adrenal glands in Fischer rats fed a diet of 10 percent mannitol. No such mannitol-treatment effect, however, was observed in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1985, FASEB, under contract with FDA, established an ad hoc Expert Panel on Sugar Alcohols and Lactose to study certain effects that had been observed in animal experiments in which the test animals were fed sugar alcohols and lactose. In a report submitted to FDA in 1986, ``Health Aspects of Sugar Alcohols and Lactose,'' FASEB concluded that there was a statistically significant increased incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma in rats fed high levels of sugar alcohols, including mannitol. The report further concluded that the existing data provided no satisfactory mechanistic explanations of these adrenal medullary lesions, which are commonly found in aged rats maintained on standard laboratory diets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is continuing to evaluate the FASEB report on sugar alcohols, including mannitol, as well as other data from animal studies of these substances to determine whether any regulatory action is appropriate for any or all of the sugar alcohols. During this period of continuing evaluation, mannitol continues to be listed, on an interim basis, for food use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Roquette America's petition to amend the interim food additive regulation on mannitol, if granted, would not change the allowed uses of mannitol; it would simply permit a new method of manufacture of the additive. The subject regulation on mannitol specifies manufacturing procedures that do not include the fermentation process used in Roquette's production of mannitol. To permit a new manufacturing method, Roquette's petition proposes to amend the interim food additive regulation (&sect;180.25) to provide for the use of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Zygosaccharomyces rouxii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the fermentation process of producing mannitol from sugars and sugar alcohols. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before January 12, 1995, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's environmental assessment without further announcement in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 28, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Alan M.

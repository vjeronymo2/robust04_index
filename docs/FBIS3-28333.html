			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- A senior trade ministry  official Monday [7 February] indirectly defended the  controversial new 7 percent national welfare tax proposed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last week.    The idea of replacing the current 3 percent consumption tax  with the welfare tax in April 1997 was not conceived "abruptly"  as widely reported, Hideaki Kumano, vice international trade and  industry minister, told a regular press conference.    The idea resulted from full-fledged discussion on reform of  the tax system that was launched by the government's tax  commission last September, Kumano said.    Creation of the best tax system to meet the needs of the  graying society was one of the aims Hosokawa mentioned in a new  year speech and the Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring,  an advisory body to the premier, called for a system suitable on  a long-term basis toward the next century.    The Social Democratic Party, the largest party in the ruling  coalition, dismissed the welfare tax as having been announced  without proper procedures being followed among parties concerned.    Apparently in response to strong criticism of the new tax  from both the SDP and the public, Hosokawa retracted the  original proposal a day after announcing it.    At present, views are being coordinated to form a new  consensus among the seven parties in Hosokawa's coalition.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is waiting  for "a political decision" to settle the matter, Kumano said.</p>

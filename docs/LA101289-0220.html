			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POPE WATCHES E. TIMOR YOUTHS FIGHT POLICE  </P> <P> Banner-waving youths opposed to Indonesian rule of East Timor fought  baton-wielding police today in front of the altar where Pope John Paul II was  finishing his blessing to a crowd of 100,000 in the capital of East Timor.  </P> <P> Four women were reported hospitalized with injuries suffered after being  crushed in the surging crowd during the melee.  </P> <P> Hurling chairs and shouting "Viva independence!" and "Viva Papa!" about 20  youths unfurled a banner in front of the altar.  </P> <P> As the Pope looked on, plainclothes police hit the youths with canes. Much of  the crowd scattered, but about 100 people came to the aid of the youths,  hurling chairs at the police.  </P> <P> The protesters were supporters of Fretilin, the pro-independence movement that  has been fighting Indonesian troops since the Portuguese left the former colony  in 1975 and it was annexed by Indonesia.  </P> <P> They got to within 100 feet of the steps to the high altar where the Pope stood  watching. The Pope did not seem directly threatened.  </P> <P> Police confiscated the film of some photographers after the fighting ended  about 15 minutes later.  </P> <P> No arrests were reported.  </P> <P> White-cassocked priests and seminarians moved quickly to calm the crowd and the  Pope was escorted to his car, surrounded by Vatican and Indonesian security  men. John Paul is on a 10-day tour of South Korea, Indonesia and Mauritius.  </P> <P> A non-Indonesian priest said it was clear that the protesters respected the  Pope because they did not act until the Mass was over.  </P> <P> During four days in Indonesia, the pontiff has urged the government of the  world's most populous Muslim nation to protect human rights in East Timor. The  local Roman Catholic Church and the human rights group Amnesty International  say violations include mass arrests, torture and "disappearances."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS CHEER  </P> <P> Young patients at County-USC Medical Center got a special dose of the holiday  spirit this week, courtesy of Dr. Herman C. Epstein. More than 500 children  received an asortment of toys personally delivered by Santa Claus (Epstein's  son, Norman), and provided through contributions from the doctor's family and  friends. Dr. Epstein, 83, began playing Santa in 1945 while a resident at the  hospital, and the party on Monday marked the 44th he has given for  disadvantaged children in the hospital.  </P></p>

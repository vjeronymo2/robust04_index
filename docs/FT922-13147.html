			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Rossini on the South Bank Rossini the comic opera composer gets at least a measure of his due in Britain; Rossini the creator of a treasure trove of serious operas is still a largely unknown figure here. In particular, the nine that he wrote to honour an eight-year attachment (1815-22) to the San Carlo theatre in Naples represent terra incognita for our opera houses. In them, he experimented with combinations of ornate vocal style and formal adventurousness that brought increasingly powerful results. Just how powerful was revealed during Friday's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert performance (broadcast live on Radio 3) of Ermione by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. Dating from (1819), this formed the mid-point of the Neapolitan series. In Rossini's own day it was unsuccessful, never revised or revived; until a 1977 Siena concert performance it had counted as a lost work. On Friday it burst over a packed QEH with the force of a thunderclap; noisy cheering greeted several of the numbers and ovations the finale. It was, indeed, an extremely exciting performance - played and sung with biting attack and limpid phrasing by the OAE and New Company Chorus, and conducted with dazzling skill and fervent sympathy by Mark Elder. But beyond all the individual pleasures it was the work itself that provided the feeling of revelation: a high-wire mixture, perfectly balanced, of Classical forms and Romantic passions that keeps the drama unfolding at fever pitch. The raw material was Racine's Andromaque, from which the composer's regular collaborator Tottola achieved an economical operatic text. Four principal characters - the captive Trojan Andromache (mezzo), the king Pyrrhus (tenor), his scorned fiancee Hermione (soprano) and her besotted admirer Orestes (tenor) - weave a taut fabric of unrequited passion, fury, despair, intrigue and treachery. The tone of high drama is set in the overture, into which male choral voices burst with bleak insistence. All the music blazes with controlled fury - Gluckian in directness of declamation, Cherubinian in rhythmic drive, yet purely Rossinian in its musical richness. Surprising strokes of design, colouring and vocal com bination mark every number; it is a long-ish work that on Friday felt short because of its untamed urgency. The characters each emerge in the round, above all the wildly unstable titular role (written for Rossini's muse Colbran); she is not a lovable heroine - nor is this exactly a sweetly consoling work - but she leaps into three-dimensional vividness. That was certainly the impression left by the young Italian soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci, making her British debut. She is an arresting figure even on the concert platform, Magnani-like in darkly handsome profile and in the mercurial change of facial expression. There were occasional rough patches and raw details in her singing, but the overwhelming truthfulness and intensity of the delivery tended to diminish their importance, and in the finale Miss Antonacci's fusion of tone and word unleashed thrill upon thrill. The two high tenors, the electrifyingly trumpet-toned Bruce Ford (Orestes) and the suavely stylish Keith Lewis (Pyrrhus), were excellently contrasted; in the opera's few tender moments Judith Forst (Andromache) made skilful use of her less compelling vocal means. All the smaller parts are important, and here all were aptly taken; Jacek Laszczkowski (Pylades, another high tenor) and Peter Sidhom (Phoenix, bass) particularly made their mark. I hope the rumours of a Glyndebourne Ermione in the near future are well-founded. * More Rossini at the Festival Hall on Sunday evening: the Stabat mater, given by the Philharmonia and its chorus (both splendid) under Giuseppe Sinopoli. Much more familiar Rossini, of course, but no less welcome: indeed, in the wake of the coursing drama of Ermione, few works could be better revived to show off the depth and seriousness of Rossini's final compositional period. It is a work Sinopoli conducts admirably. He captures both the chaste marble contours and the sweetly ornate vocal details; his avoidance of interpretative self-indulgence is refreshing. The soloists - Maria Bayo (replacing June Anderson) Cecilia Bartoli, Justin Lavender, Alastair Miles (replacing Simon Estes) - were all musicianly Rossinians, not ideal in blend. The glorious Miss Bartoli sounded a mite under form; the bright-edged tones of the Spanish soprano gave an interesting lift to the 'Inflammatus'. As concert-opener Sinopoli proposed a different sort of Italian music entirely: Bruno Maderna's Quadrivium (1969), a linked series of glittering modern-music mobiles for large, spatially disposed, percussion-dominated orchestra. It is a composition of wit, brilliance and energy; Sinopoli risked the ire of the large Sunday-night audience in programming it. All praise to him]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office has just issued a  communique explaining why Prosecutor General de Greiff has sent  the judge who is investigating Dandeny Munoz Mosquera, alias La  Quica, a letter stating there are no charges against him in the  case of the Avianca plane.    The communique states that the letter has been  misinterpreted  and specifies that all de Greiff did was send the information,  which was requested by La Quica's defense attorney, to the  United States. Second, the communique notes that by  constitutional mandate, the Prosecutor General's Office must  investigate the pros and cons involved in any case. Third, it  points out that it was the Prosecutor General's Office that sent  the evidence to the United States that allowed La Quica to be  condemned in the United States for forgery.    De Greiff's controversial letter could change the course of  La Quica's case, but the judge will not decide until this  afternoon whether the letter will be accepted.</p>

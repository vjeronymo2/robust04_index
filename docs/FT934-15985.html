			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rowland pressure forces delay to Lonrho plans THE APPOINTMENT of Lonrho's first non-executive directors for 20 years was yesterday postponed for 12 days, as a result of pressure from Mr Tiny Rowland, the international trading company's joint chief executive. Mr Dieter Bock, the other joint chief executive who at the beginning of the year acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in the company, had been hoping that yesterday's board meeting would approve the appointment as non-executive directors of Mr Steven Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, the food group, and Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson. Mr Bock had recruited them as part of his campaign to transform Lonrho into a more open and conventional company, in the hope that this would rebuild the confidence of institutional investors in its shares. However, the meeting refused to ratify the appointments. One of Mr Bock's advisers said that Mr Rowland had insisted that all the executive directors should meet Mr Walls and Mr Harper before the decision is taken. 'He (Mr Bock) was shocked', the adviser said. 'But the outcome should not be seen as victory for Tiny. It was a draw'. Mr Rowland has been opposed to non-executive appointments since the 'straight eight' directors tried unsuccessfully to remove him in 1973. Lonrho's current board consists of 12 executives. Lonrho put out a terse one sentence statement after the meeting, which lasted all morning, saying that 'the board resolved to announce the appointment of two non-executive independent directors by October 19'. Though the statement does not name either Mr Walls or Mr Harper, Mr Bock remains confident they will be appointed. He is planning to push through other radical changes in the coming months, including a reduction in the number of executives on the board, the appointment of one or two further non-executives and a cut in head office staff. Mr Rowland is expected to resist some of these changes.</p>

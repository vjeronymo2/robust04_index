			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEZBOLLAH HINTS AT NEW ATTACKS ON U.S. TARGETS  </P> <P> The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah on Saturday accused the United States, France  and Pope John Paul II of favoring Lebanese Christians over Muslims and hinted  that new attacks may be mounted on U.S. targets.  </P> <P> Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's main Lebanese ally, ordered a general  mobilization in his 200,000-member Druze community to prepare for a major  battle against the Christians, Muslim sources said. The Druze are an offshoot  sect of Islam.  </P> <P> Police said two people were killed and nine were wounded in clashes between  Syrian troops and Christian forces along Beirut's Christian-Muslim dividing  line and three other fronts in the central Lebanese mountains and in the north.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Death Toll Now at 781  </P> <P> The new casualties raised the overall toll to 781 killed and 2,118 wounded  since fighting broke out March 8 between Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly  Christian army units and Syrian troops backed by Jumblatt's Progressive  Socialist Party.  </P> <P> Sporadic exchanges have broken a general lull prevailing since the U.N.  Security Council appealed Tuesday for a cease-fire.  </P> <P> In its statement published by Beirut newspapers, Hezbollah, or Party of God,  accused France, the United States and the Pope of favoring Lebanese Christians  in the 14-year-old civil war with Muslims.  </P> <P> "The French naval buildup in the Mediterranean, the Pope's fanatic and biased  stands, and America's moves at the (U.N.) Security Council are part of the  arrogant campaign aimed at taming the Muslims," it said.  </P> <P> "This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of the Crusaders'  invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit of martyrdom that forced  the (U.S.) Marines and the French to retreat in 1983," it said.  </P> <P> That was a reference to the twin suicide truck bomb attacks on Oct. 23, 1983,  against the U.S. Marine base and the headquarters of French paratroopers in  Beirut. The bombings killed 241 American servicemen and 58 French soldiers and  led to withdrawal of an international peace force.  </P> <P> Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for terrorists holding 14 Western  hostages, including eight Americans, in Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> French Warships Dispatched  </P> <P> France dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch, the destroyer Cassard, and the  destroyer Duquesne to the Mediterranean in recent days while its envoy, Alain  Decaux, discussed the crisis with Lebanese officials.  </P> <P> Aoun, who serves as army commander and leader of a Christian Cabinet, was  quoted Saturday as saying that he would like to see French forces get involved.  </P> <P> "I would like a French military intervention, but I don't want to compromise  France with a Lebanese request. Up until now, we have exhausted much of our  human and material resources, and we need help to continue the resistance,"  Aoun was quoted in an interview in the Paris weekly Journal du Dimanche.  </P> <P> French officials say the movement of their forces in the Mediterranean was  designed to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French citizens if necessary.  They say Paris has no intention of intervening militarily.  </P></p>

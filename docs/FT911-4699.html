			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: db Leben signs up DM4bn in first year THE LIFE insurance subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, db Leben, signed up DM4bn (Dollars 2.4bn) of new business in its first full year of operation, incurring a loss of DM14.9m in the process. The new venture, started in September 1989, completed 71,000 contracts, and collected gross premium income amounting to DM143.5m during 1990. By the end of March this year, the value of principal sums assured reached DM6.1bn on a total of 108,000 contracts. New business across the sector in Germany last year amounted to DM282bn, giving Deutsche no more than a 1.4 per cent share of the market. However, db Leben pointed out that it was offering only a very restricted range of products - with the aim of broadening its selection this year. New lines will play heavily on classical banking products - thus including life products linked to credit packages and to investment products. In the latter area, db Leben is keen to play on the fiscal advantage, where it can offer a yield of 6 per cent free of tax. Deutsche's decision to branch out independently into the insurance world caused a furore at the time from the biggest established insurers, one of which suggested that such a venture would take 10 years to turn a profit. db Leben maintains it will be in the black 'considerably sooner'. It says its network of 1,400 domestic branches has made a decisive contribution to reaching new customers. This year's loss is covered by a special fund set up by Deutsche Bank to meet start-up costs.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN GUILTY OF FRAUD TOLD TO PAY $10,000 TO EX-WIFE, 81  </P> <P> A Hollywood man was ordered Friday to pay $10,000 in restitution to an  81-year-old Tujunga woman whom authorities said he married so he could take her  money and property.  </P> <P> Melvin Steiner, 51, pleaded guilty in December to misdemeanor charges of grand  theft and real estate fraud.  </P> <P> Steiner began working as a gardener for Frances Hirsch in June, married her in  September and persuaded her to go with him to Guadalajara, said Deputy Dist.  Atty. Daniel M. Greller.  </P> <P> Steiner also persuaded Hirsch to make him a joint owner of her house, but her  relatives became suspicious and hired an attorney, who had the marriage  annulled, Greller said.  </P> <P> In November, after the annulment and after his name had legally been removed  from the deed to Hirsch's house, Steiner accepted an offer of $147,000 in a  fraudulent sale of the house, Greller said.  </P> <P> "There's no question that this marriage was a sham," Greller said. "His intent  all along was to defraud her."  </P> <P> Hirsch's family managed to stop the illegal sale of her house and notified Los  Angeles police, who arrested Steiner on Nov. 12.  </P> <P> Steiner originally was charged with felony counts of making false statements to  a notary public -- the real estate agent -- and of unlawfully agreeing to sell  Hirsch's house.  </P> <P> After Steiner pleaded guilty to the reduced misdemeanor charges, San Fernando  Municipal Judge Gregg Marcus sentenced him to three years probation. He was  also sentenced to 100 hours of community service, a $500 fine and 31 days  already served in jail.  </P> <P> On Friday, Marcus ordered Steiner to pay $10,000 in restitution to Hirsch at a  rate of $277 a month for three years.  </P> <P> Although Hirsch did not lose her house, the $10,000 is to cover money she lost  after Steiner used her bank funds to buy furniture, a new van and an older  model pickup truck, according to a document filed by Hirsch's attorney, Herbert  R. Seiden.  </P> <P> The vehicles were resold but at far less than what Steiner paid for them,  according to the document. The restitution will also cover Hirsch's legal  costs, the document said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participating plans are paid a capitated amount based on 95 percent of each county's average Medicare fee-for-service expenditures. However, Medicare managed care enrollees' utilization and related expenditure patterns differ from those with fee-for-service coverage. Managed care enrollees use fewer hospital days and more ambulatory care. The dissimilarities between the two populations in service use and related spending may not be captured in the current payment method. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, payments based on county-level fee-for-service expenditures are even less representative of the average spending in areas where managed care enrollment is high. Medicare's policies, therefore, may penalize managed care plans in counties where they have already helped to slow the growth in fee-for-service spending. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The risk-based, managed care program also has been criticized for failing to make adequate risk adjustments in plan payment amounts. Medicare uses a limited number of demographic variables to adjust payments for enrollee characteristics (age, sex, Medicaid status, and institutional status), but these measures are poor predictors of actual expenditures. Better measures are being investigated that incorporate utilization data for hospital and ambulatory care, prescription drug use, and other factors directly related to health care use and spending. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA is reviewing ways to improve the payment methods for Medicare's risk-based, managed care contracts. The Commission recommends that HCFA continue these efforts to strengthen this component of the Medicare program. Providing more equitable payments could encourage greater plan participation, thereby giving more beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care. Further, evaluations of spending under Medicare managed care should be based on longitudinal comparisons of beneficiary experience. Medicare's managed care option could become even more important under many of the health care reform proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Payment Updates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is mandated by law to report to the Congress each year on an appropriate update to the inpatient hospital payment rates under PPS. ProPAC considers several factors in developing its annual update recommendation: the hospital market basket index (which reflects the prices of resources used by hospitals in providing inpatient care), scientific and technological advances, hospital productivity, case-mix change, and the quality and long-term cost-effectiveness of health care. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consider the Commission's recommendation in developing her update recommendation. The actual update historically has been legislated by the Congress in the budget reconciliation process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, the PPS operating update was established for each fiscal year through 1997. For fiscal year 1995, the update for hospitals in large urban areas (areas with populations over one million) and other urban areas is set equal to the change in the hospital market basket index minus 2.5 percentage points. The update for rural hospitals is the amount necessary to bring the rural standardized amount to the same level as the other urban standardized amount. Even though the fiscal year 1995 update has been set by law, the Commission has continued its traditional approach of examining the individual factors that together determine the appropriate update to the PPS payment rates. ProPAC believes this approach results in a payment increase that is sufficient, in the context of the current health care financing system, to maintain Medicare beneficiaries' access to quality care while encouraging hospital efficiency in providing that care. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the update to the PPS payment rates, the Commission recommends an update for the Federal capital payment rate. ProPAC also recommends an update for rates derived from hospital base-year costs, which may be used in place of the PPS rates for sole community hospitals. Finally, the Commission considers the update for facilities currently excluded from PPS. ProPAC's recommendation for an update to the composite payment rate for dialysis services is also presented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 9: Update Factor for Operating Payments to PPS Hospitals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For fiscal year 1995, the PPS standardized payment amounts should be updated to account for the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

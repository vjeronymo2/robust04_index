			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSSIBLE SALE OF CHIP FIRM STIRS HIGH-TECH POLICY DEBATE  </P> <P> The potential sale of a key American electronics operation to a Japanese  competitor is sparking renewed debate over whether the United States needs a  policy to protect and nurture critical technologies.  </P> <P> A report that Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s semiconductor manufacturing equipment  division might be acquired by Japanese rival Nikon Corp. also raises new  questions as to whether American business is too shortsighted to invest in  firms offering a lot of promise but only slim immediate profits.  </P> <P> A sale of the division to Nikon, an event widely speculated upon by industry  insiders, will come only because a willing U.S. buyer couldn't be found,  analysts said. The big negative: the division's lackluster profits.  </P> <P> To be sure, this wouldn't put an end to the American presence in semiconductor  manufacturing equipment. Perkin-Elmer ranks only fifth among U.S. makers of  such machinery, behind Applied Materials in Santa Clara, General Signal of  Stamford, Conn., Varian Associates in Palo Alto and Eaton Corp. in Cleveland.  </P> <P> Still, the loss of the Perkin-Elmer unit to the Japanese would be significant  because the firm has some important technologies that other U.S. companies  lack. And while the division is not very profitable now, it could be in the  future, analysts said.  </P> <P> "Clearly the Japanese value technology more than we do in the U.S. That's the  heart of the issue," says Dan Hitchinson, president of VSLI Research, a San  Jose market analysis company. "The Japanese view technology as a source of  future wealth, and clearly we do not."  </P> <P> When Norwalk, Conn.-based Perkin-Elmer announced that it wanted to sell its  semiconductor equipment unit last April, its stock shot up $2.25 per share. On  Monday, following news of the potential Nikon deal, the stock jumped $1.125 to  close at $23.375 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Although neither company will discuss the possible deal, analysts said industry  insiders have known for months that Nikon was extremely interested in buying  the last of three divisions Perkin-Elmer put on the auction block.  </P> <P> The lure to Nikon, the well-known Japanese camera maker that has quietly and  steadily become the world's No. 1 maker of semiconductor manufacturing  equipment, is not size or immediate profits. The Perkin-Elmer unit, once the  world's top semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker, had pretax earnings of  just $3.2 million on sales of $200 million in its 1988 fiscal year, a small  fraction of Nikon' sales of $1.9 billion last year.  </P> <P> Instead, the attraction is Perkin-Elmer's advanced technology for etching  patterns of computer chips on silicon wafers. Perkin-Elmer is one of the few  companies in the world to make machinery that photographically reproduces  circuit patterns -- whose lines are less than one-tenth the width of a strand  of hair -- on the wafers.  </P> <P> Canon, the other Japanese camera giant that has become a force in semiconductor  manufacturing equipment, has the technology. Nikon is said to want it to  protect its market dominance.  </P> <P> But industry analysts and others argue that if the Japanese control the market  for machines that make semiconductors, just as they do the actual semiconductor  market, they will have an even greater lock on the overall market for  high-technology products.  </P> <P> "If you own the technology, you have a 4- to 5-year head start on knowing how  to apply that technology," VSLI Research's Hutchinson said. "You know what  products are possible."  </P> <P> Perkin-Elmer officials -- including Chairman Horace G. McDonnell, a former  president of the American Electronics Assn. -- had repeatedly said they prefer  to sell the unit to a U.S. company to keep its technology in domestic  ownership. And, according to analysts, several domestic concerns expressed  interest.  </P> <P> However, analysts said, the potential U.S. buyers concluded -- just as  Perkin-Elmer did months before -- that they couldn't make enough money  operating the unit.  </P> <P> The pullout of potential U.S. buyers left Nikon the sole bidder, and because  Perkin-Elmer is trying to complete the deal before year-end, analysts said  Nikon appears to have won what it wanted.  </P> <P> Even if a deal is reached between the two companies, it could be subject to  review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a  14-year-old federal agency whose powers have recently been expanded and  strengthened.  </P> <P> The agency can study the proposed sale for up to 75 days and send it to  President Bush for his personal approval.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Sematech, the consortium formed to bolster the semiconductor  industry, said the group opposes the potential deal with Nikon, but will not  formally challenge it.  </P> <P> "This is a development we deplore. It bodes ill for the future of the country,"  says a spokesman for the consortium. "If we don't start preserving our  manufacturing and materials industry immediately, they'll be nothing left."  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp., the world's leading chip maker, also  said Monday it hopes American investors will keep the division under U.S.  control.  </P></p>

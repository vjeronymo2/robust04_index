			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bristol Channel Ship launches Pounds 19m rights - Proceeds to fund acquisitions from Ugland family BRISTOL CHANNEL Ship Repairers is to launch a rights issue to fund three acquisitions from the Norwegian shipping family that took control earlier this year after an acrimonious struggle. The issue is expected to raise almost Pounds 19m net of expenses. The company will pay a total of Pounds 16.1m for Ugland Brothers, a ship management business, UB Shipping, which owns nine general cargo vessels, and a deep sea car carrying vessel. Mr Andreas Ugland, chairman designate of BCSR, and his family interests hold almost 30 per cent of the shares. The Ugland group of companies are taking up their full entitlement of the rights. BCSR shareholders will vote on the proposals, including a name change to Ugland International, at an extraordinary meeting on November 15. Mr Ugland plans to concentrate on managing and developing the company. The board argues that the combination of BCSR's updated repair operations in Swansea with the Ugland businesses will 'provide the foundations for a significant intergrated international shipping group.' BCSR's shares were suspended in August at 8p pending the reorganisation. The 80m existing 10p shares will be consolidated into 4m ordinary shares, with a nominal value of 20p and an effective worth of 160p. The company is offering a further 19.96m ordinary shares at 100p each. After the rights the share capital will consist of 23.96m ordinary 20p shares. The balance of the rights issue after the Ugland take-up is underwritten by Nomura International. Joint stockbrokers to the issue are Kleinwort Benson in the UK and Fondsfinans in Norway. The cancellation of the 10p shares and commencement of dealings in the 20p shares is expected on November 18.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets: Clients who face a life sentence - Serious Money Life insurance companies are inured to criticism. This is fortunate, for the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has just put in the boot again. It is already common knowledge that if you cash in a life insurance policy early, you will probably get back less than the premiums you have paid over. In some cases, you get nothing back for the first couple of years. Yesterday's OFT report on surrender values - what you get back if you cash in a life insurance policy early - makes a few commendably simple points: The higher the proportion of policyholders surrendering early, the more money some companies make. There is a suspiciously close correlation between companies with a high proportion of policyholders surrendering early, and those with miserly surrender values. If you average out policyholders' returns (to include both those who surrender early and those who stay the full term), returns from some companies are negligible or negative. No wonder the OFT is moved to question 'the extent to which (certain companies) are likely to be working in the interests of their customers'. A second major cause of concern is the wide variations in surrender values between different companies. These are most dramatic in the early years. But even after five years, pay-outs can vary by more than 50 per cent. How many ordinary customers know which companies are likely to impose the biggest penalties? The OFT also highlights the close connection between surrender penalties and charges. Surrender penalties are really charges under a different name. When the explicit charges fail to cover the initial costs of getting the customer on their books in the early years, surrender penalties plug the gap. So, when your friendly insurance salesman spells out the policy charges, do not forget the sting in his tail. Our series of articles on investment charges (page VIII this week) shows how hard it is for investors to work out the true costs of investing. We reviewed only the most popular types of equity-based investments: unit and investment trusts, shares, personal equity plans, life insurance and pension plans. All have several different charges, and the charges vary from one type of investment to another. It is hard enough to make meaningful cost comparisons even between investments of the same type; virtually impossible to do so for different types of investment. How much does this matter? Costs are pretty tedious and conventional wisdom insists, rightly, that performance matters more than costs. True. But although low charges cannot turn a bad investment performance into a good one, high charges can damage a good performance seriously. How about this as an irresistible offer? 'Give us Pounds 10,000 now and we guarantee to give you back Pounds 8,500 over the next five and a half years: ie, you will get no interest and lose 15 per cent of your original capital.' Not tempted? Try this one. 'If the FT-SE 100 index doubles over the five and a half year period, we will give you back Pounds 16,000: ie, your original capital of Pounds 10,000 plus Pounds 6,000.' Better, but still not very alluring. If you invest in the FT-SE 100 itself, and it doubles, you will get back a total of Pounds 20,000 plus more than Pounds 2,000 in income. Enough of such titillation. The product we are talking about is called Millennium Monthly Bond, and its message to investors in advertisements is rather different: '10% pa paid monthly free of basic-rate tax,' says the front page of its leaflet. The figure 10 is more than 2in high. Further down the leaflet, in smaller type, come the details about minimum and maximum total returns which we quoted at the beginning. The deal is fairly simple. Your 10 per cent monthly income rolls in come hell or high water, and totals Pounds 5,500 over the whole period. What you need to keep your eye on is the return of your original capital. The basic guarantee is that you will get back 30 per cent of it. If the FT-SE rises by between 4.99 per cent and 9.99 per cent, you will get back 100 per cent. Your maximum possible capital return is 105 per cent, which you get if the index rises by 10 per cent or more. General Portfolio, the insurance company which sells the bond, points out that stock market growth for similar periods of time has averaged 9.3 per cent. What it does not point out is that its chosen reference period includes two of the biggest bull markets of modern times. Many pundits argue that these returns were exceptional, and are predicting much lower ones in the 1990s. But the more important point is that it is possible to get a guaranteed return in the upper half of the Millennium range with absolutely no risk. A conventional five-year guaranteed income bond, which repays all your original capital, offers up to 8 per cent annual interest or nearly 7 per cent if you insist on monthly income. So, for an extra two percentage points on your income, you are risking 70 per cent of your capital if you opt for Millennium. (Millennium: period of good government, great happiness and prosperity - OED. Oh really?).</p>

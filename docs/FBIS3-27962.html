In the reply message, President Kim Il-song said that the  full solidarity of the Palestinians with the DPRK's efforts to  denuclearise the Korean peninsula and reunify the country in the  form of confederation is a great encouragement to the Korean  people.    Expressing the belief that the friendly relations between  the  two peoples would grow stronger and develop, President Kim  Il-song heartily wished the Palestinian president and people  greater success in their struggle to restore their legitimate  national rights and completely solve the Palestinian issue.</p>

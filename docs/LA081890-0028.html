			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING UP THE KINGS NOT A SOUND DECISION  </P> <P> I can't believe the Kings are breaking up the best announcing team in Los  Angeles. By demoting Nick Nickson to radio only and replacing him with former  player and rookie broadcaster Jim Fox, King fans come up big losers. With Bob  Miller and Nick you were always sure to get an accurate and honest call of the  game, with no cheerleading.  </P> <P> BILL NOYES  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P></p>

Kozyrev on 3 </F> November at the Foreign Policy Council under the MFA of the  Russian Federation]    [Text] I will make a couple of introductory comments and  share our concerns and what we would like to consult with you  about; naturally, this will not be an exhaustive presentation--I  will only outline a list of topics.    Unlike many of the USSR's allies in the "Third World," East  Europe remains, and, I think, will remain our priority. They are  unlikely to provide material or political support for our, as we  call it, "red-and-brown" opposition.    Our ties with East Europe and the incident with  ratification--or, to be precise, failure to ratify--a treaty  with Hungary is very indicative in this respect. In essence, not  only East Europe but also the administration of the Russian  Federation president and the government of Russia found  themselves in a position of hostage in a political  score-settling. After a number of attempts, the treaty with  Hungary was never ratified only because the preamble formalizes  the universally known and long-obvious fact that the  interference in Hungarian affairs in 1956 was impermissible,  albeit in a form that does not impose any legal or other  obligations on Russia. I think this was a manifestation of the  still-lingering syndrome that has its roots in the old  ideological approaches when one not only could not write but  even was not supposed to know the truth about the events in East  European countries.    We should have drawn certain conclusions from this "ostrich"  position. I remember a situation in this very Collegium  Conference Hall--at the time of the USSR MFA--when the meeting  chairman said, flabbergasted and, I would say, indignant, that  our embassies did not maintain contacts with precisely such  forces, such persons, although they were known to the entire  world--for instance, Lech Walesa or Vaclav Havel--apparently  counting up to the very last moment on a sort of emulation of  "perestroyka" occurring instead of an all-out anticommunist  revolution taking place in these countries.    Meanwhile, the problems encountered by young leaders and new  elites in the East European countries were in essence our  problems, too. These include reform of the bureaucratic  apparatus--whether economic, of the Gosplan [State Planning  Committee] type, enforcement structures, or the foreign policy  agencies. I say this with a degree of criticism at ourselves.  The difficulties of privatization and commercialization. And  finally, aggressive nationalism, a mix of envy and arrogance in  relation to the outside world stemming from the inferiority  complex that society feels to a certain extent. As a result,  Russian diplomacy in East Europe had to start in many respects  not just from ground zero but from a negative point, and all  this in an environment of disruption of economic ties.    Today we can say that we have completed the first stage--the  stage of establishing new relations between the new Russia and  the revitalized states of East Europe, keeping in mind, of  course, all the difficulties. The highlight of this stage was  clearing the debris of the socialist camp era and creating in  general a new foundation of political--and on this basis,  mutually beneficial economic--ties. This encompasses first and  foremost the political-legal base. Although, of course, the real  mechanisms still leave a lot to be desired, but this apparently  will constitute the core of the next stage, that is, realization  of all the political opportunities that have opened as a result  of the first stage.    High-level visits by the president of Russia to practically  all the East European countries and his meetings with the  leaders of these states have resulted in the signing of a new  generation of treaties and agreements. Troop withdrawal from  Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary has been accomplished in a  civilized way. The pages related to the interventions of 1956  and 1968 have been turned for good. The final chapter has been  written in the Katyn affair; a number of other "blank"--or, to  be precise, "black"--pages in history have been brought to light.    It is important both for us and for East Europeans to first  look into the future; second, to orientate ourselves at those  things that bring us closer: the communality of democratic and  free market aspirations, the desire to live in a stable Europe,  and the need for mutually beneficial economic ties. It is in the  interests of Russia to have East Europe as a bridge rather than  barrier to West Europe--without dismissing, of course, the  inherent value of ties with East and Central European countries  per se.    Both we and these countries have actually set for ourselves  the same strategic task: to take our proper place in the "club"  of developed democratic states. The question is how to deal with  this task through cooperation rather than elbowing one another  aside. It is clear that we cannot forbid anyone to join NATO.  The time of "Brezhnev doctrine" diktat has been consigned to  oblivion together with the Soviet system in our country. I think  our friends in East and Central Europe should move from  fostering suspicions regarding some sort of new designs on the  part of Russia toward a joint search together with us for  answers to complex issues of modern times.    Yes, we do not like expansion of NATO without Russian  participation, even if it is not aimed against us. In this we  are achieving understanding. Evidence of that is the American  concept "Partnership for Peace," supported by many NATO  countries. We can count on new relations with the West  withstanding the trial by Central and East Europe in the sense  of their membership of NATO. This will be further proof of  political shortsightedness on the part of those who try to  juxtapose partnership with the West and that with the East. One  is hardly realistic without the other. I will be even more  blunt: Without timely and persistent orientation toward alliance  with the West, it is unlikely that Russia would have been able  to avert the expansion of old and formation of new exclusive  political blocs not only along the perimeter of CIS countries  but possibly also closer to the external borders of the Russian  Federation. Only a partnership with the West, the special  relations established with leading NATO countries, make it  possible to withstand the "trial by East and Central Europe"--I  use this term again today, with all possible reservations, in  the sense of joining the North Atlantic bloc.    This is the real worth of the clamorous accusations of  Westernism coming from the position of so-called patriotism. It  is also clear, however, that we can only keep up with East  Europeans if we ourselves move decisively along the road of  domestic reforms and open foreign policy. We must, in  particular, engage more actively in giving content to such ideas  as "Partnership for Peace" or the "Balladur Plan," including  from the angle of our relations with East Europe.    We welcome fresh ideas and initiatives that would help us  all  together to reinforce the trust between Russia and the countries  of Central and East Europe, including through joint actions,  especially in peacekeeping. The relations between East European  countries by themselves combine both the elements of competition  and rivalry and the desire for integration. To a certain extent  we will be able to use such subregional cooperation structures  as the "Vicegrad Four" and the "Central European Initiative" in  order to solve problems of interest both to us and to the  countries of East and Central Europe. Which are: combating  aggressive nationalism, protection of the rights of national  minorities while preserving the integrity of the state, and so  on.    Our diplomatic efforts in the East European direction will  be  academic unless they are reinforced by the development of  economic cooperation. So far we clearly have not utilized to a  full extent the favorable conditions we have created at the  political level, especially considering that East European  countries also have an objective interest in restoring economic  ties. I must say that now that the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations has a new leadership it will be possible to deal with  these tasks with much greater success than was the case with  their predecessors.    In this area we are working in several directions. First, it  is time to implement already existing bilateral agreements;  second, we need to search for new forms of cooperation on the  level of entrepreneurial structures. The question is how to give  a boost to the restoration of civilized ties which in the end  will displace the barbaric, mafiosi forms on one hand, and on  the other, will not lead to a situation whereby in order to  implement the agreements signed by the governments we would have  to resort to old administrative methods. Third, the possibility  of trilateral cooperation is of interest: West Europe--East  Europe--Russia, with the participation, of course, of other CIS  countries. All this, however, on condition that this will be a  partnership of equals rather than attempts to solve one's  problems, for instance, at the expense of Russia by receiving  financial infusions from the West and dumping on Russia goods  that are not quite competitive otherwise.    An important special feature of the Soviet Union's relations  with countries of East and Central Europe, with all their  ideological shackles, was that contacts between people,  particularly between scientific organizations and cultural  institutions, were quite extensive. Today much of this is in  jeopardy. We have to try not to lose, try to preserve cultural  and spiritual ties. The scientific and cultural intelligentsia  could play an important role in this. We will support  inter-church ties in every way possible. This is the spiritual  background of contacts with a number of countries of East and  Central Europe.    We need to encourage and find new forms of cooperation at  the  Russian regional level, including through such  structures--created with MFA participation--as the Organization  for Cooperation of Baltic and Black Sea Basin Countries.    In all these matters we count on the active participation of  the new democratic parliament. I must say that we are longing  for a parliament that will legislatively regulate our  activities, direct them with the help of laws, and oversee both  us and other state agencies, including those working with East  and Central Europe. There are many other problems--especially in  the CIS zone--where the legislative base and parliament's  oversight functions are especially needed, even though foreign  policy and activities have been and will remain the president's  prerogative. By the way, none of the countries of East and  Central Europe--and the scale of their problems fades in  comparison with ours--attempted to experiment with an annual  vote of confidence in a popularly elected president or early  elections of the president. The experience of a two-year  parliamentary term in one of the countries also proved less than  satisfactory. In our country, in my opinion, instead of  painstaking work, such experiments bear the mark of  irresponsibility and a Bolshevik penchant for extremism.    I would like to call on all of you to use all the tools at  our disposal. We have a democratically elected president; we  will have a democratically elected parliament. Let us use these  institutions as a base and work normally for four or five years,  including in the area of East and Central Europe. Otherwise  everybody will indeed abandon us and turn to NATO.    The significance of East and Central Europe for Russia is so  great that the development of relations with East European  countries should be not so much the business of the diplomatic  community as of our entire state organism and society as a whole.    I hope that today's discussion will offer both criticism and  analysis, and most importantly, will be fruitful and enrich us  with new ideas.</p>

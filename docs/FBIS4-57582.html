			<p>BFN     [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has sent a complimentary note  to NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY employees on the 20th anniversary of its  founding. He also presided over the plenum of the National  Committee of the Armed Forces Civilian Workers Union.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] With a heated  opening, the meeting was a surprise to everyone from the very  beginning. Jose Roque, Secretary General of the FAR civilian  workers union, began by saying: Let us begin by talking about  the beans. Debates on the principal difficulties followed.    The leader of the Che Guevara Military Industrial Company  workers union assessed the losses in agriculture and promoted  further discussions.    [Unidentified union leader] This loss situation must be  solved, the farm must be closed, or we must ask for the  resignation of the comrades involved in this activity.    [Reporter] The Che Guevara Company director outlined the  agricultural goals for 1994:    [Director] I believe that concerning our agriculture,  notwithstanding the costs that move us to work resolutely at the  level of the industry and other activities, we can say that we  are meeting the company's main needs, but that now we have to  resolve current inefficiency.    [Reporter] Moreover, General Ulises Rosales del Toro  stressed  the idea of producing at the lowest cost possible.    [Rosales] You who have received the banner of our system  must  also be awarded in this line of production. The minister's  guideline is that we cannot produce at any cost, and this must  also be extended to agriculture. The idea is not only to  guarantee 30 percent of production, but to produce in a  reasonable manner to prevent unnecessary expenditures that will  neutralize our productivity [words indistinct].    [Reporter] The FAR civilian workers union includes 85,000  workers, and at the plenum held in the presence of union leaders  and representatives of the FAR, they discussed the basic  activities in which the Armed Forces are engaged, for their own  experience and for the good of the fatherland. The objective is  to make the Armed Forces self-sufficient in foodstuffs in 1995  and continue their contributions to the people.    This year, the FAR budget was reduced 50 percent. The  structural reorganization improvement program, which began seven  years ago, has become a generalized experience so far as  profitability and suitability are concerned, and also concerning  the use of human and material resources and the political work  that support these goals.    [Rosales] What we are doing today in production, what we are  doing in the fields, what we are doing in everything we are  discussing here is showing the role we play. But this requires  awareness, capacity, and efficiency, and this also requires  appropriate training and guidance.    [Reporter] For example, a citrus fruit production farm in  Hawaii Grande in 1993 harvested 70,000 quintals. The Youth Labor  Army in January 1994 collected 73,000 quintals of citrus fruits  from this same FAR. The FAR members and their civilian workers  also played an important role in the latest potato and tomato  harvests.    [Ross Leal] For all these achievements, which are also  reflected in figures and good results, the national CTC [Cuban  Workers Federation] decided to award the FAR the banner of labor  deeds. [applause]    [Raul Castro] In a recent FAR military council, I called the  work carried out and the results achieved over the past three  years by the FAR, colossal. Thanks to these achievements, the  special period has not been able to reduce our capacity or our  fighting readiness.    The sudden severance of the Soviet supply and the drastic  reduction in resources stemming from the national economy have  not intimidated us and have not made us conform.    [Reporter] The FAR minister also referred to the  participation of the civilian workers in the Armed Forces'  achievements. He said self-supply of goods, profitability, and  maintenance of defensive capacity are the basic pillars of work.  He said the sixth congress of civilian workers will be held in  1995.    [Raul Castro] The congress will be held in 1995, a century  after the time when the fatherland had a new rebirth, with the  armed uprising that achieved liberty; a century after Jose Marti  fell in action, after the epic event of the invasion from east  to west under Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomes.    Fidel has taught us how to commemorate the centennial  anniversary of the fatherland. A hundred years after the birth  of the apostle, he organized and led us in an attack on the  Moncada Garrison. Let us pay a worthy tribute to the centennial  anniversary, to those historical, sacred, and exalted moments of  the fatherland with an exemplary congress of the civilian  workers of the glorious Revolutionary Armed Forces. I will see  you in the sixth congress, and perhaps long before that as well.  Thank you. [applause]</p>

There were bitter arguments over the decision to  change the Communist Refoundation Party into a force for  government. Guido Dell'Acquila reports:    [Dell'Acquila] The change in the Refoundation Party has been  achieved. The manifesto proposed by the United Left group,  which faced the thorny issue of governing the country, obtained  70 percent of the delegates' votes. In other words the  majority, led by Cossutta, Magri, and Bertinotti, saw their  manifesto win approval by a wide margin. However, the margin  does not conceal the deep splits and the anxiety which this  choice provoked.    The results of the vote to elect a new executive will not be  known for a few more hours. It is already known, however, that  Bertinotti will be the new party secretary. He replaces  Garavini, who resigned six months ago. In the meantime Cossutta  has been reelected to the post of party chairman. After four  days of debate this congress for change is coming to an end.  The Refoundation Party, which is more used to being in  opposition, is looking at the new political set-up with a  mixture of hope and regret.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Creditanstalt helped by hidden reserves CREDITANSTALT Bankverein, Austria's second-largest bank, avoided a large loss last year only by realising more than Sch4bn (Dollars 347.5m) of hidden reserves to help cover provisions for bad loans. Net income at Sch1.25bn was, nevertheless, 22 per cent lower than the previous year, which itself had been propped up by Sch2.17bn from realisations of hidden reserves. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman, said provisions for bad loans soared 76 per cent to Sch5.66bn last year, mainly because of the slump in the Austrian economy. In December, the bank revealed it would cut its dividend to Sch6 from Sch15 a share and cancel staff annual bonuses. It then forecast that provisions would reach Sch5bn, but the directors later decided to make an additional Sch600m general provision in anticipation of more problems this year. Mr Schmidt-Chiari said yesterday provisions would be high in 1993, but he hoped not to have to resort again to hidden reserves to cover them. The bank's hidden reserves were 'still substantial'. He was hopeful that earnings would improve, and held out the prospect of at least a partially restored dividend. The Austrian government holds 49 per cent of the shares and 70.5 per cent of the voting power in Creditanstalt, but is committed to full privatisation. In November, it was revealed that General Electric of the US had been in discussions about taking a 20 per cent stake. Mr Schmidt-Chiari said yesterday he anticipated the government's stake would be dispersed among portfolio investors rather than with strategic investors. Creditanstalt's earning power remained strong last year, with operating profits up 19.5 per cent to Sch3.43bn. Total assets grew 6.2 per cent to Sch517.9bn at year-end. The capital ratio, under BIS guidelines, eased from 8.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT COUNCIL TO VOTE ON LAND DEAL CLEARING LIBRARY  </P> <P> City Council members and Irvine Co. representatives are expected to finalize a  land swap next week that would allow design work to begin on a $7-million  central library for the city.  </P> <P> The firm would give the city four acres of land northeast of the intersection  of East Coast Highway and Avocado Avenue on which to build the library, said  David Dmohowski, the vice president of entitlement for the Irvine Co.  </P> <P> The city would grant the two acres of land it owns in Newport Center to the  company to make a total of five acres owned by the firm.  </P> <P> The city would then grant office development rights to the company for all five  acres in Newport Center, Dmohowski said. The firm could build a total of 67,000  square feet of office space.  </P> <P> The City Council will vote Monday on whether to finalize the swap and also be  asked to approve a contract for design of the 50,000-square-foot library.  </P> <P> The votes will culminate almost three years of talks toward establishing a new  central library for the city. City Librarian LaDonna Kienitz said the city has  more than outgrown the four branch libraries that now make up the system.  </P> <P> The new library is expected to have more than 200,000 volumes and seating for  200 people.  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: A bond designed for pensioners - A look at the pros and cons of the latest National Savings product designed specifically for the over-65s The Far Side cartoon advertising the Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond from National Savings shows animals waiting in pairs to go into the ark to escape the flood, and has a caption promising a guaranteed income, come rain or shine. What looks appealing as storm clouds gather can, however, seem rather less so if the weather changes. At present, the bond's combination of features seems attractive. The 7 per cent gross interest rate, fixed for five years and paid monthly on a minimum of only Pounds 500 is a mix not available elsewhere in the market. The maximum investment is Pounds 20,000. The government announced the bond in the Budget specifically in order to help pensioners of 65 and over because so many had seen incomes drop as a result of falling interest rates. At the same time, it did not want to lock investors irreversibly into an interest rate that might be generous now but could trap them if rates rose sharply. The solution is the two-month withdrawal period. Investors can withdraw money from the bond, provided they give 60-days notice and suffer the loss of 60 days interest. Launching the bond, Anthony Nelson, Treasury economic secretary, said that he believed this feature was as important as the interest rate itself. It would enable people to move if they wanted to do so, but would not unfairly give them 'a one-way bet'. Knowing that you will not inevitably be left behind if the market moves on clearly makes the prospect more tempting. The drawback is that to make the most of this flexibility requires quite sophisticated judgments about the speed and scale of interest rate movements. For those who use the monthly interest to supplement their incomes - some of those in mind when the bond was designed - the loss of two months' payments may also be a significant disincentive to shifting their investment, even if interest rates have risen. All investors will automatically be paid their interest gross (on the 19th of the month) and so people who do not pay tax will not have to go through the process of reclaiming it. If an investor dies before the five-year term is completed, there is no financial penalty. The bond can either be transferred to someone else of eligible age, or can be realised. Other products available do, however, match or better individual aspects of the bond, and are not restricted to a particular age range. The National Savings capital bond series H, for example, offers 7.25 per cent compound interest guaranteed for five years from a minimum of Pounds 100. Like the Pensioners bond, interest is taxable but is paid gross. However, the interest is only paid on maturity and no interest at all is available if the bond is repaid within the first year. Some banks and building societies offer monthly interest on fixed-rate five year bonds, but none of these starts as low as Pounds 500, and none offers as much as 7 per cent gross. The range is broadly between 5-6 per cent. National &amp; Provincial building society's escalator bond, which guarantees that the rate will rise over the term, does have a minimum of just Pounds 500. For that minimum, the rate rises from 4 per cent in the first year to 6 per cent in the fifth year if interest is paid monthly, and is 0.5 percentage points higher throughout if the interest is paid yearly. But the penalty for early repayment is loss of 180 days' interest. Another product comparable with the pensioners' bond are Tessas (tax exempt special savings accounts). Most pay interest annually but some will do so on a monthly basis. According to Moneyfacts, Coventry building society offers a monthly income Tessa at 6.75 per cent on Pounds 1 upwards, while Stroud &amp; Swindon building society offers the same rate on a minimum of Pounds 3,000. Both offer 7 per cent if interest is paid annually. These interest rates are variable, but the fact that the products are tax-free could mean that for some people they offer a better real rate of return, at least for the moment. The pensioners' bond went on sale yesterday. People can call for a prospectus and application form using a free 24-hour a day telephone line (0500-500000) or can fill in the coupon attached to the advertisement in the press. If you apply using the coupon, you have a 28-day cooling off period in which to change your mind. Application forms will be available in post offices from 10 February.</p>

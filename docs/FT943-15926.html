			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Mandela tries to re-establish confidence President Nelson Mandela yesterday sought to re-establish confidence in South Africa's economic management following the sudden resignation of Mr Derek Keys as finance minister on Tuesday. He stressed that Mr Christo Liebenberg, named as Mr Keys's successor, would follow the government's existing commitments on economic and fiscal policy. 'There is no necessity for concern that the policies followed by Derek Keys will be abandoned,' he said, after a meeting with the Japanese ambassador about a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 866m) financial aid package Japan is pledging to South Africa. Mr Mandela also emphasised that Mr Liebenberg's mandate would be to pursue macroeconomic stability and strive to reduce the budget deficit while promoting the government's reconstruction and development programme. Further reassurance came from Mr Alec Erwin, deputy finance minister, who said the move would not result in a change of policy and that Mr Liebenberg would shortly be brought into finance ministry decisions.

In a statement to be published in today's edition of the Johannesburg newspaper Business Day, Mr Erwin sought to reinforce the notion that a cautious fiscal policy was central to the ANC's economic strategy.

There was also widespread criticism of the manner and handling of the move, which leaked out on Tuesday ahead of the formal announcement. Business and union leaders insisted on a more comprehensive government explanation of the 'personal reasons' which lay behind Mr Keys' decision. Markets remained jittery, and the overall stock exchange index finished down 47 points at 5,404. Bond yields rose further, although the currency market was relatively stable. 'Until we know the full reason for the move, new rumours will keep flying around, destabilising the market,' said one disgruntled dealer. Mr Mandela said that the government had consulted business leaders on Mr Keys' resignation before selecting Mr Liebenberg as a successor. 'In everything we do we keep very close to business,' he said. 'We made it a point to call on the captains of business.'</p>

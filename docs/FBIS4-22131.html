			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, April 25 (A.A.) -- Unidentified men  hurled Molotov cocktails at seven bank offices in various  districts of Istanbul on Sunday, causing material damage.    The Haznedar, Fatih, Sofular, Maslak, and Gaziosmanpasa  branches of Yapi ve Kredi Bank, the Tarabya branch of Akbank,  and the Cennet Mahallesi branch of Pamukbank were targets. No  one was injured in the raids, but the offices were damaged.    A person calling the newspapers said that the actions were  carried out by illegal TKP-ML-TIKKO [Turkish Communist Party--  Marxist-Leninist--Turkish Worker Peasant Liberation Army]  organization.    "Today is the 22nd anniversary of our organization and  therefore we carried out these actions," the caller said.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Alexander Spitzer -- The Times reported incorrectly Monday that Inglewood  lender Alexander Spitzer controls several industrial loan companies. The  appropriate term for Spitzer's firms is not industrial loan companies, but  finance companies. Finance companies, or "hard-money lenders," are less  regulated than thrift and loans, which take deposits from the public in the  form of investment certificates. Both are licensed by the state.  </P></p>

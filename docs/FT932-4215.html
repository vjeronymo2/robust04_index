			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Observer: Asian Swan hunt? Could ownership of Newcastle shipbuilders Swan Hunter soon be embarking for the Far East? After all, Indonesia has bought most of the East German navy - 39 ships at a knockdown Dollars 12.7m - so a shipyard used to men o'war would be a useful back-up. Anyone who still thinks the idea outlandish might care to consider the size of the advertisements Swan Hunter's receivers have been placing in the newspapers in Malaysia and Singapore. Investors in the region are invited to take over Swan Hunter lock, stock and barrel, including outstanding MOD contracts for three frigates. Moreover, the idea of flogging assorted bits of Britain's industrial rustbelt to far easterners seems to be catching on. A joint Malaysian/Indonesian group, for example, is in the final stages of negotiating the purchase of the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland. What might strike some speculators as a more interesting deal, however, is apparently in the offing at the Milan bourse which is soon to move back into its lavishly restored Palazzo Mezzanotte. Its idea is that countries ambitious to set up their own stock exchanges might want to buy the six-year-old transportable building used in the meantime - although whether the Italian bourse officials are included in the deal is not specified.</p>

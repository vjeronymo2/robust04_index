			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, March 30 (XINHUA) -- New Zealand [NZ]  Prime Minister Jim Bolger said this afternoon New Zealand and  China can enhance their cooperation in many fields, particularly  in the area of environment.    He made the remarks when meeting a Chinese delegation led by  Deng Nan, vice chairman of the Chinese State Science and  Technology Commission.    He said as China has one-fifth of the world population, a  better environment in China will contribute to the improvement  of world environment.    Deng Nan said both China and New Zealand are countries of  the  Asia-Pacific region and they can promote their cooperation in  various fields to their mutual benefits.    Deng Nan and her party arrived in the northern New Zealand  city of Auckland on March 28 and arrived here this morning.    This afternoon, NZ Deputy Prime Minister Don McKinnon and  Minister of Environment, Research, Science and Technology Simon  Upton also met the delegation on separate occasions.    Shortly after its arrival this morning, the delegation held  a  round-table meeting with New Zealand scientists to exchange  views on the reform in the field of science and technology in  their respective countries.    The Chinese delegation will leave here tomorrow morning for  visits in the south island of New Zealand, and will leave for  home on April 1.</p>

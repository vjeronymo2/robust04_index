On the contrary, the population of  Vladivostok sighed with relief, he told Interfax on Thursday.    "The public welcomed with applause the news that the mayor's  duties will be performed by Konstantin Tolstoshein," he said.    Viktor Cherepkov was removed from office on Wednesday on  charges of bribe-taking.    According to Interfax sources, the police had to use force  to  oust Cherepkov from his office. To quote Lebedintsev, policemen  virtually carried him out of city hall.    Legal action was started against the city administration  more  than a month ago. The investigators believe that they have  collected enough evidence for accusing Cherepkov of bribe-taking.    The Maritime Territorial Administration has appointed  Konstantin Tolstoshein, the former head of the Pervorechensk  Regional Administration (the Vladivostok Region) to the post of  acting mayor of Vladivostok.    For health reasons Cherepkov has not been questioned yet as  a  defendant.</p>

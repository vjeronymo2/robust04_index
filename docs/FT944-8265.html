			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Pace of economic growth may trigger rates rise, warns Bank Interest rates must be raised if the UK economy continues to expand at the current speed, Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, said yesterday. His warning follows publication of figures last week that showed much faster growth than expected. The figures had fuelled City speculation that Mr George will press for an interest rate rise soon. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is to speak on the economy in the House of Commons on Wednesday, is likely to be reluctant to raise rates before Christmas if, as expected, his November 29 Budget includes tighter fiscal measures. With last week's figures indicating gross domestic product 4.2 per cent higher in the third quarter than in the same quarter last year, Bank of England officials believe growth is now unsustainably high. In Dubai, where he was attending an international banking conference, Mr George told Reuters, the news agency: 'We have the economy growing very strongly . . . unless it begins to slow down of its own accord, there is no doubt we will have to help it slow down through tighter monetary policy.' At Mr George's last monetary meeting with the chancellor, the two men apparently agreed to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.75 per cent. Mr Clarke's next monthly meeting with Mr George is scheduled for December 7. City economists are divided about the likelihood of an interest rate rise on that date. However, Mr Clarke is likely to face protests from within his own Conservative party against a rates rise before Christmas if he introduces tighter tax measures in the Budget next week that could further depress consumer confidence. Although manufacturing is growing steadily, boosted by a pick-up in exports, last week's figures suggested that trading conditions will be tough for retailers in the pre-Christmas period. Meanwhile, as both the chancellor and governor have stressed in recent weeks, UK inflationary pressures remain subdued. The underlying rate of retail price inflation is running at 2 per cent, its lowest for 27 years.</p>

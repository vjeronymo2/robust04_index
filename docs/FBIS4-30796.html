			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Novi Sad, 29 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the Srpska republic, spoke in Novi Sad today in the  capacity of president of the Serb Democratic Party of Serb  lands. He said that the Serb side would not condition the talks  on the end of hostilities on the lifting of the sanctions  against the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia].    We would like to see peace, even for four months, in order  to  save the lives of many young Serb and Muslim men, said Karadzic  at a news conference.    We will not set any conditions for the talks on the end of  hostilities, but the conference cannot start until the Serb side  is guaranteed an equal status, which implies that something  should be done about the sanctions and that the pressure and  threats of the international community should cease, stressed  Karadzic. These are the minimum conditions that should show  whether the international community wants peace or not.    Karadzic said that some circles in the United States would  prefer the sanctions to peace and that some circles in the  United States maintain "pro-Iranian positions" waging this war  via a mediator.    We believe that the talks about percentages of Bosnian  territory should be abandoned because they do not reflect the  structure and quality of these territories. We could accept 49  percent of former Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory, but in that  case they [Bosnian Croats and Muslims] should give us Tuzla and  Sarajevo, said Karadzic.    Given that two states are being created in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, one must take into account the fact that  they should be capable of functioning with enough resources, a  good infrastructure and communications, believes Karadzic.    We are prepared in this respect to honor the rights of  Croats  and Muslims and those of their federation, but we demand the  same in return -- that our borders can be defended in case we  become enemies again, and that our territories are compact,  stressed Karadzic. [passage omitted]    It is quite clear, said Karadzic, that the international  community accepted the fact that the Srpska republic already  existed in former Bosnia-Herzegovina's territory and that it  will be recognized, while the remaining territory will be one  state -- a federation of Muslims and Croats -- or possibly two  states if the federation fails.    In Karadzic's opinion, this is the greatest achievement of  the four-month political struggle of the Serb people and he  believes that it would have been better both for  Bosnia-Herzegovina and for The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia to have remained in Yugoslavia. If the international  community fails to stop the Muslim offensive, the Serb army  will, at a given moment, launch a counteroffensive, warned  Karadzic.    If our enemies decide that the conflict should be resolved  by  military means they must realize that they will get as many  territories as they succeed in taking -- which means almost  nothing. If however, they opt for a political solution then we  Serbs will have to cede some of the territory, but in this case  the war must stop at once, said Karadzic categorically.  [passage omitted]</p>

To date, we have 2,959,100 registered unemployed. This means  that, in January, employment offices registered in excess of  69,500 unemployed people more than during the previous month.  Is it a seasonal phenomenon? According to Jerzy Szreter, labor  and social policy vice minister, it is difficult to formulate an  unequivocal hypothesis on the basis of the data available to us  at the moment.    The increase in the number of unemployed was registered in  virtually every voivodship in the country, with the highest  increment in Chelm (6.3 percent) and Krakow (5.3 percent)  Voivodships.    Things were bad enough before, but they are getting even  worse now. The proportion of unemployed women is on the  increase (51.6 percent), as is that of people who are not  eligible for unemployment benefits. Of the newly registered  unemployed, more than 64,500 are not entitled to receive  unemployment benefits (compared with 48,500 in December). This  is still the largest group among the total population of  registered unemployed.    The only optimistic accent in this situation is that there  are a few more job vacancies on the labor market (in January  there were 41,171 vacancies, compared to 28,000 in December).  At the same time, there is still a tremendous differentiation  in this index between different regions of the country. For  example, the largest number of unemployed per job vacancy was  recorded in the following voivodships: Ostroleka (953), Biala  Podlaska (914), and Kielce (814). The best situation in the  local labor market was reported in Warsaw (16 applicants per  vacancy), Gdansk (37 applicants per vacancy), and Krakow  Voivodships.    More than 53,000 jobless were employed in various emergency  operations and more than 15,600 in a range of public works. In  addition, more than 13,600 people were being trained or  retrained for new jobs.    Close observation of the changes that took place in the  labor  market last year could lead us to expect that a further increase  in unemployment figures is again possible in February, while  March should see a stemming of the tide, and April should bring  a stop to the seasonal surge in unemployment. However, all of  these estimates are still based on speculation.    The official announcement of a proposed introduction of a  number of new legislative moves brought further confusion into  the scene. For example, the announcement that the period of  eligibility for unemployment benefits will be extended for  people with dependent children in full-time education. A surge  in unemployment registrations for a certain social  group--namely, sole family breadwinners--has already been noted  in employment offices in Lodz.    What are the needs of the national labor market? To begin  with, several hundred billion zlotys [Z] for regions under  particular threat of unemployment, Z800 billion to finance  restructuring projects for the regions of Lodz and Walbrzych,  and Z2 trillion for intensification of projects promoting active  forms of combating unemployment.    "There is enough money in the kitty for unemployment  benefits now, and there will be enough for the future," Minister  Szreter assures us. "There is no direct danger that we will run  out of funds. Even so, should the situation on the labor market  continue to deteriorate sharply and result in an unexpectedly  large increase in unemployment figures, we will have one other  solution left: simply to curtail expenditure on schemes  promoting active forms of combating unemployment (we are not, in  any case, statutorily obliged to run them)."    For the time being, the ministry has no available data that  would enable experts to establish whether privatization causes  increased unemployment. On the one hand, privatization  certainly promotes rationalization of employment, and that means  reduction in the numbers of work positions. On the other hand,  it often poses a dilemma: Should the employer choose to salvage  at least half of the existing work positions through  privatization, or should he let them all go, thus throwing all  employees out onto the streets?    There are more mass layoffs in the state sector, although  the  time when the private sector forever employed new people and  never laid them off is long gone. It is true that many new firms  are being created all the time, but just as many are  simultaneously collapsing and going bankrupt.    Unfortunately, all attempts to press Minister Szreter to  reveal whether the forecasts claiming that by the end of this  year we would have, at most, 3.05 million unemployed were at all  realistic, met with no success. He failed to answer the  question clearly and unequivocally; indeed, he could not have  done so because no one can know the answer. All too frequently,  unemployment has made it plain that it is an elementary force  that can easily defeat all attempts to control it....</p>

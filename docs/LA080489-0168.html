			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RULING PUTS NUNN-BRADLEY BOUT SET FOR RENO ON HOLD  </P> <P> A judge has granted a temporary restraining order to halt plans for the  scheduled Aug. 14 middleweight fight between Iran Barkley and Michael Nunn,  which was to have been broadcast on Home Box Office.  </P> <P> State District Judge Jack O'Neill granted the order Thursday; it had been  sought by lawyers for Al Boulden, Barkley's trainer until June 21.  </P> <P> Nunn, who lives and trains in North Hollywood, is champion of the International  Boxing Federation, and Barkley, who lives in the Houston area, is the former  World Boxing Council middleweight title holder.  </P> <P> Boulden is seeking about $47,000 he claims he is owed for past fights and  $50,000 he said he would have earned for the Nunn bout. In the suit, Boulden  claims that he was preparing Barkley for the fight at the time he was  terminated.  </P> <P> The judge will hold a hearing Thursday to determine if he will issue a  temporary injunction sought by Boulden. Barkley and his manager, John Henry  Reetz, are named as defendants in the suit.  </P> <P> Reetz told the Houston Post from his training camp in Reno, where the fight is  scheduled to be held, that there never was a contract with Boulden.  </P> <P> "I think at best it is a doghouse beef, so we are not very concerned with it,"  Reetz said. "As far as a restraining order and injunction against the fight, I  don't think the attorney general of the state of Nevada will allow that."  </P> <P> Boulden contends in the suit that he is responsible for Barkley's "rejuvenated  career."  </P> <P> Boulden also claims that he did not receive his full 10% share of Barkley's  prize money from fights.  </P> <P> He asked in court that Barkley and Reetz be restrained from preparing for the  fight and from appearing on any HBO broadcast relating to the bout.  </P></p>

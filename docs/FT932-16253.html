			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Outraged Andreotti nurses his wounds GIULIO Andreotti picks up a single sheet of paper from the top of his cluttered desk. 'Yes, this is my avviso di garanzia,' he says with faint distaste. The avviso is the notice that this veteran Christian Democrat politician, seven times prime minister of Italy, is under investigation by Milan magistrates for alleged illicit financing of a political party. The notice was served on Monday. 'I heard the news first from television and only received the avviso from the magistrates myself later in the afternoon,' he adds. Mr Andreotti, aged 74 and a life senator, is alleged to have asked his old friend, Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, owner of Roma football team and prominent financier, to provide L250m (Pounds 114,000) to help the Social Democrat party (PSDI) in last April's general elections. The small PSDI has long been one of the two junior partners in the Christian Democrat-led coalition governments and these funds were not registered in the party's balance sheet. 'I don't know. I'll have to check,' he says when asked about the incident, adding vaguely.' I can't remember. It was election time. During elections you make a lot of telephone calls.' If Mr Andreotti appears to treat this brush with Milan magistrates as an irritation, he admits to have been deeply wounded by Palermo magistrates, who want to have his parliamentary immunity waived to answer the more serious charge of alleged collusion with the Mafia. 'I feel morally hurt. . . for more then 10 years I have been fighting the Mafia, adopting tough measures, putting my life at risk.' Mr Andreotti nevertheless recognises the damage to Italy's international image as a result of him being linked allegedly to organised crime. The Palermo magistrates allege that Mr Andreotti, through his close associate Mr Salvatore Lima, the Sicilian Euro-MP murdered in March 1992, was the Mafia's point of 'reference' in Rome. The evidence is based on confessions from pentiti - former Mafiosi co-operating with the judicial system under plea bargaining programmes. 'None of the pentiti says anything directly against me. Everything is based on hearsay. No one says Andreotti helped do this and was found to do that,' he says. Although Mr Andreotti denies any personal guilt, he is nevertheless willing to concede for the first time that the political establishment which he has dominated for so long has a responsibility for failing to tackle earlier the question of illicit party financing. This was allowed to get out of hand. But he adds that the cases of personal enrichment through such illicit funding have been limited. 'Look I live here and not on the moon and the vast majority of the people I know have the same lifestyles now as before they entered politics.' For a man who has seen nearly all his close political and business allies from the north of Italy and right through Rome and Naples to Sicily caught up in the corruption scandals, he retains a remarkable posture of normality in public. 'If I have done something seriously wrong then I am willing to face the consequences. But I don't believe that to be the case,' he says. The next step in what is turning into a political trial will be to see how many friends he has in parliament willing to defend his immunity. The issue has already created a deep rift inside the party he helped found.</p>

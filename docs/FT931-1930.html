			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Why Europe's hands are tied: The Commission is taking a back seat at a time of political and economic crisis Early in the new year, Mr Jacques Delors chaired the first meeting of the European Commission. Turning to his new team, he asked whether they were content to follow their member states' instructions and lie low until ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European Union. The answer was a resounding yes. Mr Delors concurred, reluctantly. One week later, he again asked whether it was wise for the Commission to take a back seat. Once again, a clear majority favoured a low profile. With hindsight, Mr Delors believes he made a mistake. At the very moment of political and economic crisis in the European Community, the Commission has forfeited its authority as arbiter between the 12 member states. A power vacuum has arisen in the EC. 'We have been put in a (Trappist) monastery,' says one EC official. Another senior EC official is blunter. He argues that the EC has degenerated into a standing inter-governmental conference, led by a weak Danish presidency which cannot see beyond May 18, the date of a second referendum on Maastricht. Europe appears doomed to play a waiting game which - bar upsets - may end with final ratification in the UK in early autumn. Mr Delors, meanwhile, has taken to travel: a leisurely trip to Morocco, and a tour of Latin America, ending in a 55-minute meeting with US President Bill Clinton in Washington. Yet the impression of inactivity may be misleading. Whatever the outcome in Denmark and the UK, EC leaders face choices which will determine whether the Community moves forward, stagnates, or slips into genteel decline. The first challenge is trade. Hard-pressed companies are pushing for protection from cheap imports from eastern Europe and high-technology competition in Asia. The call for special treatment covers steel, semiconductors, cereals, fish and many other recession-hit industries. Protectionist pressures may subside after the French parliamentary elections, the first round of which ended Sunday; but Brussels diplomats predict that the new right-wing government in Paris would adopt an even tougher line on trade than its Socialist predecessor. Their fear is that France will demand a renegotiation of last year's EC-US farm trade accord, dashing hopes for the Gatt Uruguay Round. This is a troubling prospect, particularly in Bonn. The German government is uneasy about being forced to choose between France as its natural EC ally and its wider national interest in seeing an early Gatt deal. Last month, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, warned: 'We have reached the point where our conception no longer coincides with that of France.' Mr Kinkel's comments reflect a reassessment of EC trade policy in Bonn. Germany remains furious that it lost the 'banana' war. Having fought to preserve its supply of high-quality 'dollar' bananas from Latin America, Germany was forced to accept an EC-wide quota which guaranteed supply from Caribbean producers, many from former French and British colonies. Diplomats detect a new German assertiveness in favour of open markets. Bonn has resisted French-led efforts to strengthen trade weapons such as anti-dumping duties. It has also ignored pressure to impose curbs on cheap imports from China and North Korea. 'Trade policy is completely blocked in the EC,' says a former EC commissioner. The second challenge for the EC is how to stimulate economic growth. Last week's  1/2 percentage point reduction in the Bundesbank's discount rate is welcome; but the Commission argues that German rates must fall much further and faster if the EC is to beat its already optimistic forecast of 0.8 per cent growth in 1993. The target of 3 per cent growth looks even more remote. Yet at least 2.5 per cent growth is necessary to prevent a further rise in unemployment, according to a new European Parliament study. Low growth means longer dole queues. The EC economy expanded by just over 1 per cent in 1992, but unemployment rose by 2m. This year, the number of people out of work in the EC could top 17m. The response is an EC 'growth package'. The idea is that member states co-ordinate capital spending projects on roads, housing and infrastructure to kick-start their economies. But the real test is whether the 12 can put on a convincing show of solidarity to coax the US and Japan to support expansionary fiscal measures at the Tokyo economic summit in July. Without economic growth, there is no prospect of the EC meeting its third challenge: adequate 'convergence' in economic performance to proceed to a European monetary union in 1997, leading eventually to a single European currency. The economic downturn, compounded by high German interest rates, has shown that EC economies are more likely to diverge in the near term. This divergence lay behind the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism which forced sterling and the Italian lira to float; the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt have suffered forced devaluations, while the French franc is far from safe. Many EC officials argue the way to beat the speculators and salvage Emu is a Franco-German initiative launching a 'fast track' to monetary union, possibly through a fixing of franc/D-Mark exchange rates. 'There is nothing in the Maastricht treaty which prohibits such a move,' says one. A putative 'strong currency club' led by France and Germany would probably include the Benelux countries. Others would be invited to follow, at their own pace. EC officials add that such an initiative could be timed to 'relaunch' the EC immediately after Maastricht ratification. Yet such talk finds little resonance in Bonn; even less so in Frankfurt, home of the Bundesbank. Senior German officials rule out moving ahead of schedule on Emu; their great fear is that weaker members will try to fudge the 'convergence criteria' on curbing inflation and budget deficits, just to secure the political triumph of a monetary union by 1997. A senior Bonn official predicts that a majority of countries will not be ready to meet the Maastricht criteria in 1996. Without mentioning whether deficit-ridden Germany will be strictly eligible to join Emu, he declares: 'It's going to be 1999.' The length of time reflects the need to work out how to meet Maastricht's twin objectives of deepening the EC through monetary and political union, while preparing to accommodate new members. Enlargement goes beyond the current batch of EC aspirants - Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway - and extends planning for a Community of up to 20 members. Similar planning for institutional change is proceeding quietly in other European capitals. Among the ideas are: more responsibilities to the European Parliament, including voting on the membership of the Commission and new, limited revenue-raising powers; stronger powers for the Commission president, possibly by creating a troika of vice-presidents responsible for the internal market, trade and political co-operation; and limits on the number of languages used in the bureaucracy. At present, some 10,000 EC meetings are interpreted in nine official languages, requiring 72 combinations for interpreting purposes. The use of 16 languages would result in 240 combinations, requiring 54 interpreters for one meeting of a single committee. But no one wants to open the debate on institutional change. It might scare voters in Denmark or enrage UK Euro-sceptics. It could also muddy the picture in the Nordic countries, where popular support for Maastricht is lukewarm. A senior Belgian official says the present vacuum is surreal. 'The accession negotiations are being conduced on the basis of a non-existent treaty, a non-existent consensus among the applicants, by an EC presidency (Denmark) whose country has not even ratified the treaty.' Sooner or later all member states will have to make the tough choices on how to pursue deepening integration while continuing to offer wider membership of the club. On this fundamental question, the debate over the Maastricht treaty has little or nothing to say.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: W German GDP up 'about 1%' West German gross domestic product rose 'about 1 per cent' in the third quarter, bringing aggregate growth for the first nine months to 2.25 per cent, the economics ministry said yesterday. Although the recovery now extended to the whole country and was firmly based, it was still not safe to say that an extended upswing was assured, the ministry added in its monthly report on the economy. Rising international interest rates and the marked strengthening of the D-Mark against the US dollar presented risks to recovery which made it all the more important for pay negotiators to show restraint in the 1995 wages round. Final figures are not expected for some weeks, but the data published yesterday is still in line with previous government forecasts made just before the federal elections last month. French non-farm payrolls, excluding the state sector, rose a seasonally adjusted 58,400, or 0.4 per cent, in the third quarter after a rise of 85,100, or 0.6 per cent, in the second quarter, according to the labour ministry. Italy's industrial production grew 4.1 per cent during the first nine months compared to the same period last year, according to Istat, the national statistics institute.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / European court to rule on dismissal THE European Court of Justice is to rule on whether an employer is guilty of sex discrimination if he dismisses a worker who becomes pregnant shortly after being engaged to cover for a colleague taking maternity leave. The Law Lords decided to adjourn their final judgment on an appeal by Mrs Carole Nardin until after the European court has considered the case. Mrs Nardin of West Drayton, London, was engaged by EMO Air Cargo (UK) as an import operations clerk in June 1987. She was told the job was available because another clerk, Mrs Valerie Stewart, would be leaving to have a baby. Two weeks into a six-month training period Mrs Nardin suspected she was pregnant. The company's managing director said he had no alternative but to dismiss her. Having lost her industrial tribunal case Mrs Nardin unsuccessfully appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Court of Appeal before taking the case to the House of Lords.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS EVENING MEETINGS;  </P> <P> NO NIGHT SHIFT FOR AIRPORT BOARD  </P> <P> For the third time, the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority has  rejected a proposal to hold its regularly scheduled morning meetings at night  to make it more convenient for members of the public to attend.  </P> <P> The vote against the change was 5 to 4. Only the three commissioners  representing Burbank and one of the three commissioners representing Pasadena  voted for the switch Monday during a special meeting of the nine-member panel.  </P> <P> The board also turned down a proposed experiment to hold a night meeting in  each quarter of the next 12 months. However, board President Robert Garcin said  the panel would consider holding special night meetings on specific topics  suggested by commissioners.  </P> <P> Commissioners also voted down the time change last year.  </P> <P> Composed of three representatives each from Glendale, Burbank and Pasadena, the  authority oversees operation of the Burbank airport.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inconvenient Timing  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council has pressured the board for years to meet at night.  They have said it is inconvenient for the public to attend the regular  meetings, held at 9 a.m. on the first and third Mondays of each month.  </P> <P> The Burbank commissioners -- Leland C. Ayers, Mary Lou Howard and Brian Bowman  -- said during the special session that having night meetings would allow for  more input from experts on airport issues as well as from citizens.  </P> <P> "There are lots of members of the community that could give us good input,"  Howard said.  </P> <P> But Pasadena Commissioner J.C. Schwarzenbach said that the commission could  handle its affairs without the additional input.  </P> <P> "We're appointed officials, not elected officials," Schwarzenbach said. "'Our  time should be spent on deliberate debate among ourselves without emotions  being thrown in. If we hold open meetings, it will be a grave mistake."  </P> <P> Carl W. Raggio, one of the three Glendale commissioners, said night meetings  would not be as productive. "I favor night meetings for a particular subject  but not for business as usual," Raggio said.  </P> <P> Howard said she felt that the vote against the night meetings was partially the  result of the board's exasperation with several gadflies who regularly attend  its meetings and berate board members at length.  </P> <P> One of the gadflies, Jules Kimmett, told the board after the vote, "You have  castrated and desecrated democracy."  </P></p>

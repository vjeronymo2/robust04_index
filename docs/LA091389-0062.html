			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHIEF NAMED FOR WATER RECLAMATION  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley has named Bahman Sheikh to head the Office of Water  Reclamation, a new city agency approved and funded by the Los Angeles City  Council earlier this year with a mission to find markets for millions of  gallons of water reclaimed daily from the city's sewers.  </P> <P> Bradley said this week that the new office will work to "wipe out some of the  myths (about reclaimed water) that have been obstacles" to developing markets  for the water.  </P> <P> Officials said treatment technology now makes reclaimed water safe for  irrigation and could soon make the water drinkable.  </P> <P> Sheikh, who joins the city from the engineering consulting firm of CH2M Hill,  will receive an annual salary of more than $80,000 in his new role.  </P> <P> The city's Tillman and Glendale Treatment Plants in the San Fernando Valley now  reclaim 60 million gallons of water a day that is usable for agriculture and  some industries.  </P> <P> "We'll probably be, very soon, up to 120 million gallons a day" of reclaimed  water, about a fourth the city's daily water intake, predicted Ed Avila,  president of the Board of Public Works.  </P></p>

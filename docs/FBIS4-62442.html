			<p>BFN     [Text] All proposals concerning amendments to the Ukrainian  Constitution were only the results of the work of a deputy  group, which must be coordinated with the executive power,  including the president. This was stated by Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev today when commenting on the draft  amendments on the reduction of the president's powers.    Kravchuk stressed it was necessary to develop a clear  legislative basis defining the powers of all state bodies.  Kravchuk said that Crimea was an example of an unsettled  legislative basis since Crimea had received the autonomy status  in 1990 with no legislative acts regulating its relations with  Ukraine.    Kravchuk said that after this Kiev had been placed in a very  difficult situation and had to coordinate decisions on Crimean  autonomy with the Ukrainian Constitution. "If we come to the  elections with no documents defining the powers of those who  will be elected we will be in the same situation as with  Crimea," Kravchuk suggested.    He emphasized that the executive power must be in the hands  of a single person. "If it is in the hands of the president the  premier will be of no need. Then it will be a presidential  state," Kravchuk stated.    He confirmed that he would take no moves if the Ukrainian  parliament did not agree with the proposal to postpone  presidential elections.    Answering a question of a reader of the Ukrainian Youth  newspaper who had urged Kravchuk to force the parliament to put  off presidential elections, Kravchuk said he could not act by  force and violate laws. He suggested that to use force would  mean to return to totalitarianism.    On relations with Moscow, Kravchuk said he was not afraid of  Russia but would do everything so that "our children do not  start fighting." Kravchuk believes that the Russian leadership  supports the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>

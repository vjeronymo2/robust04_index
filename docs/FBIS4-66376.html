			<p>CSO     [Text] Tianjin (XINHUA) -- To meet the growing demand for  energy, Tianjin will develop its plentiful subterranean heat  resources.    The city, rich in geothermal energy sources, has reserves of  underground hot water estimated at 7.876 billion cubic metres,  said an official from the municipal government at a recent  conference.    Baodi County, north of Tianjin, has the city's biggest  reserves of subterranean hot water, which cover a total area of  8,700 square kilometres. Ten of these heat fields, encompassing  3,074 square kilometres, are especially rich.    Tianjin's underground hot water, with temperatures between  25  and 150C, is widely used in timber manufacturing, home  heating, greenhouses, heated swimming pools, and scientific  research.    The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources has invested  tens of millions of yuan in exploring the city's underground  heat resources. The United Nations Development Programme has  also invested $5 million.    Tianjin has tapped more than 250 underground hot water  reservoirs. The deepest required drilling to a depth of 3,654  metres, and the hottest is 98C.    The city uses about 38 million cubic metres of underground  hot water annually, with thermal energy equal to that produced  by 2.5 million tons of coal.    Tianjin is one of the country's biggest underground heat  energy centres. More than 140 overseas experts have visited the  city to consult on the exploration of underground heat resources.    Businesses from the United States, Iceland, France, Italy,  New Zealand and Japan have expressed interest in investing in  the development of the subterranean heat resources.    A contract was signed over the weekend between three Chinese  companies and a Hong Kong firm to set up a joint venture to  build a power station in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province.    The total investment for the project will be 1.84 billion  yuan ($212 million).    The four companies--the State Energy Investment Corporation,  Jiangsu Investment Corporation, Xuzhou Investment Corporation,  and the Hong Kong-based China Resources (Group) Company  Limited--hold 30, 20, 15 and 35 percent of the stake,  respectively.    The signing converts the Pengcheng Power Plant from a  solely-domestic joint venture into a China-Hong Kong venture.  The limited-liability contract has a term of 20 years.    The designed capacity of the power plant is 1.2 million  kilowatts. The first phase of the East China project includes  two units of coal-fired 300,000-kilowatt generators.    The first unit is expected to be put into operation in  September 1996.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ... AND INTRODUCING THE CLASS OF '89;  </P> <P> HERE'S WHAT MADE THE NEW INDUCTEES THE GREATS  </P> <P> Roll call time for the new members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame will be  Wednesday night at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City: Dion, Otis  Redding, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations and Stevie Wonder join the 30  other acts inducted since the Hall was established three years ago (though the  groundbreaking for the Hall's I.M. Pei-designed Cleveland home has yet to be  scheduled).  </P> <P> Also honored this year in the early influences category will be blues belter  Bessie Smith, vocal group the Ink Spots and the gospel Soul Stirrers, while  "wall of sound" producer Phil Spector was selected as a non-performing member.  </P> <P> Dion  </P> <P> Like the fabled Rose of Spanish Harlem, "doo-wop" vocal groups -- thus named  due to their practice of reducing background vocal parts to a stream of  nonsense syllables -- grew in the street, right up through the concrete back in  the '50s. At least 5,283 of these pimply mooks made records, of which Dion  &amp; the Belmonts' were arguably the baddest of 'em all -- mostly because lead  singer Dion DiMucci was the best white vocalist in the idiom.  </P> <P> While the tracks waxed with the Belmonts ranged from such monumental towers of  babble as "I Wonder Why" (distinguished by a second verse that contains not a  single word in English) to an uncomfortably ethereal version of the pre-rock  standard "Where or When," Dion's single finest vocal performance comes on his  1960 solo recording of "Ruby Baby," which blows no less than the Drifters'  original version into the next galaxy.  </P> <P> How? Well, partially it's due to the incredibly sexy edge that he puts on every  syllable and partially it's due to the incredibly cat-footed sense of rhythm he  displays, but mostly it's due to the stoned immaculate timing of the vocal  asides ("nowlistennow") of which the record is a virtual compendium. This was  the moment on which the myth of Dion as the apotheosis of sharkskinned hipster,  the paragon of gesture (in this case, finger-snappin' cool), the teen-aged  missing link between Frank Sinatra and Bobby "Blue" Bland, the Eternal  Wanderer, was made.  </P> <P> This myth takes on a further resonance with the knowledge that along with his  string of hits ("The Wanderer," "Runaround Sue" et al), Dion was himself strung  out on heroin. Eventually he kicked the habit and mounted a '68 comeback with  the reflective "Abraham, Martin and John." After several years of semi-success,  he moved into the realm of  </P> <P> contemporary Christian music and is currently preparing a new album of secular  material for Arista.  </P> <P> Otis Redding  </P> <P> There are people who'll tell you that the Big O was the greatest soul singer to  ever trod sod. There are others who maintain that Redding's death in a 1967  plane crash -- months after he'd been one of the few blacks to perform at the  Monterey Pop Festival -- did more to catapult the Macon, Ga., native into the  pantheon of hipster saints than anything else.  </P> <P> But any discussion of Redding's career must be tempered with the knowledge that  he was only 26 when he died and that the posthumous "(Sittin' on) The Dock of  the Bay" was not only his biggest pop hit, but also his most contemplative,  least affected work to date.  </P> <P> Don't get me wrong. Redding was a powerful vocalist, equally adept at  anguished, churchy ballads ("I've Been Loving You Too Long," "Try a Little  Tenderness") as he was at driving, all-stops-out, up-tempo tunes ("I Can't Turn  You Loose," "Respect"). When his patented, stuttering, "gotta-gotta-gotta"  approach worked, as on the classic "Live in Europe" album, the effect was  singsational. When the tunes weren't there, the performances too often  collapsed into mannerism at the expense of genuine emotional expression.  </P> <P> Ultimately, however, an artist must be judged by his best work, and seeing as  how Redding not only wrote almost all his own hits, but also penned Arthur  Conley's "Sweet Soul Music," only the tragically hip would deny that the man  merits inclusion strictly on the basis of the recorded evidence. Sleep on,  Otis.  </P> <P> The Rolling Stones  </P> <P> Mean, moody and magnificent. The self-proclaimed "greatest rock 'n' roll band  in the world" would almost qualify for Hall of Fame status on the strength of  its bad-boy image alone. But no one maintains a 25-year career strictly on the  ability to raise eyebrows -- look though the "Drummers Wanted" ads of any  musicians classified section and count how many people are looking for a  "Charlie Watts-type drummer." That ain't image, that's real life -- and that is  what the Rolling Stones have always been about. Hard knocks and dirty sox.  </P> <P> Meanwild, in the capable hands, lips and hips of Mick Jagger (who knew a thing  or two about performin') even the earliest Stones live shows redefined all  previous notions of sexuality and showmanship. Musically, there's not much to  say at this point. The Stones started out as a high-level rock/blues combo and  recorded about four albums' worth of mostly old R&amp;B tunes ("It's All Over  Now," "Time Is On My Side"), most of which were as stunning as they were almost  unprecedented.  </P> <P> Spurred on to ever-greater heights of outrage by their first manager, Andrew  Loog Oldham, the Jagger/Keith Richards team exploded as songwriters, composing  such bedrock numbers as "Satisfaction" and "Paint It Black." Ah, but it's with  the series of LPs that began with "Beggars Banquet" and continued through  "Exile on Main Street" that the Stones really hit their peak.  </P> <P> Though still capable of occasional flashes of brilliance -- notably, the "Some  Girls" LP -- it is this late '60s/early '70s stretch that has proven so rich,  so durable, so amoral that neither the Stones nor anybody else has been able to  improve upon it much since.  </P> <P> The Temptations  </P> <P> Although the Supremes were Motown's most-successful act, it was their male  counterparts, the Temptations, who had the reputation for being able to  "outsing, outdance, and outdress" any vocal group in sight.  </P> <P> While the Detroit-based quintet always prided itself on being a group with five  lead singers, it wasn't until 1968's "I Can't Get Next to You" that  writers/producers Norman Whitfield and Barrett Strong took a page from the Sly  Stone songbook and constructed an entire tune around the concept of constantly  shifting leads.  </P> <P> The team then grafted the style to such sociologically significant themes as  drugs ("Cloud Nine") and the fatherless family ("Papa Was a Rollin' Stone") to  create some of the most grimly realistic slices of ghetto life to grace the  upper reaches of the pop charts.  </P> <P> The group's earliest hits were more conventional, showcasing either the  scorched-earth baritone of David Ruffin ("Ain't Too Proud to Beg" and "My  Girl") or the stratospheric tenor of Eddie Kendricks ("Just My Imagination").  </P> <P> Along with basso profundo Melvin Franklin, founder Otis Williams and the late  Paul Williams (no relation), this first edition of the Temptations was as  versatile as the second, they just didn't pack it all into one three-minute  song.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, it was the second edition, in which Ruffin was replaced by  ex-Contours member Dennis Edwards and ex-Monitor Richard Street filled in for  Paul Williams (who wound up a 1973 suicide), that went on to greater heights  and is still out there scoring R&amp;B hits, dazzling three generations' worth  of audiences and inspiring such spiritual godsons as the Jacksons and the New  Edition night after night after night. Temptations sing!  </P> <P> Stevie Wonder  </P> <P> Born blind, this charter member of the Motown family signed his first contract  at age 8, landed his first hit ("Fingertips, Part 2") four years later and  hasn't really looked back since.  </P> <P> Wonder has never limited his music to strictly R&amp;B, although "Uptight," "I  Was Made to Love Her" and "Superstition" are all so tough, you'd have to shave  'em with a blowtorch, and over the years he's ventured into reggae ("Master  Blaster"), jazz ("Sir Duke"), Dylan covers ("Blowin' in the Wind") and Las  Vegas lounge lizardry ("For Once in My Life").  </P> <P> When Wonder turned 21, he negotiated a multimillion dollar contract that not  only set industry superstar standards, but also gave him unprecedented control  over his recordings. Together with Marvin Gaye's ground-breaking "What's Going  On" album, Wonder's earth-shattering "Talking Book" LP sounded the death knell  for Motown's old system-of-specialists.  </P> <P> Through the '70s, Wonder's mixture of percolating synths and Pollyannaish  social comments remained wildly popular. Lately, however, the records have  become more infrequent, and his greatest success has come via gooey ballads ("I  Just Called to Say I Love You"), so it's somewhat understandable that his  standing among dyed-in-the-black-leather-jacket rock fans has slipped a bit.  Nevertheless, Wonder's talent is such that he could get a hit tune out of an  electric toaster, and many of us would not be surprised if in the very near  future he did.  </P></p>

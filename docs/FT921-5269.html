			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Galileo, Apollo link for huge air booking network ONE OF THE world's biggest airline booking networks is due to be set up today by the merger of Galileo, owned by a consortium of European airlines, and Apollo, ultimately controlled by United Airlines, one of the top two US carriers. United will be the single biggest shareholder in the new entity with a stake of about 38 per cent. British Airways is the next biggest shareholder with 14 per cent and Swissair is third. Apollo and Galileo have had close links for several years. Several European and US airlines have direct and indirect stakes in both. Covia, the holding company for Apollo, estimates 'a 90 per cent overlap in ownership' since 1988 when United Airlines sold half its 100 per cent stake to other airlines. The merger follows pressure for booking systems to be distanced from individual airlines. It was feared tickets from one airline could be promoted through booking systems. The new company will develop a single database for all the world's air routes.</p>

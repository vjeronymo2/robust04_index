			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Judgment is reserved by tribunal A NURSING auxiliary left her job because she was unable to endure eight hours without a cigarette, an industrial tribunal heard yesterday. Mrs Mary Dryden is claiming constructive dismissal and is seeking reinstatement and compensation from Greater Glasgow Health Board, which banned smoking at all its premises last summer. The tribunal reserved judgment. Mrs Dryden told the tribunal that no special provision had been made for smokers in the building. She added that there was no time to go out to smoke during breaks.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading The heavy fall in German bonds in afternoon trading brought a sharp retreat in an already lacklustre derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. On the Liffe, early trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 which opened at 3,295 saw the contract challenge the 3,300 level. But interest fizzled out at 3,299 and a selling order from a leading US house reversed the initial advance, leaving March to drift lower. Further selling after the release of industrial and manufacturing production figures dampened hopes of a reduction in interest rates. However, it was the reversal in German bonds and the early falls in New York that brought the heavy sell-off in March in the afternoon. It closed at 3,249, down 46 from the previous close and at a 12-point discount to its fair value premium to cash of about minus 8. Volume at the official close was 13,632. In the Liffe FT-SE Mid 250, volume in June exceeded that in the March contract, which closed at 3,290. March traded 105 lots, against 200 in June. On the OMLX, 9 lots were traded in the March Mid 250 and it closed at 3,923.10. Liffe traded options saw volume of 32,399 contracts, of which 14,748 were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,500 in Land Securities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 23 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serb  chief of staff, Manojlo Milovanovic, today denied that his  troops had fired at the UN peacekeepers near Tuzla in  northeastern Bosnia.    A UN spokesman said in New York today that it was the Muslim  side who attacked the UN troops. But he did not denounce the  Muslims.    The UN peacekeeping forces were reportedly attacked with  mortars on Tuesday at Ribnica, some 20 kms southwest of Tuzla,  with two military vehicles being hit and five Swedish soldiers  wounded.    The chief of staff of the Nordic battalion in Tuzla said the  fire "came from the area that is held by the Bosnian Serb army".    But Milovanovic said it was impossible for the Serb forces  to  bomb the place from their positions 22 kilometers away.    The Belgrade headquarters of UN peacekeeping forces in  Bosnia  said Croats and Muslims were fighting each other around Ribnica.    It remains unclear who shot at the UN peacekeepers.    The chief of staff of UN forces in Bosnia Angus Ramsay  threatened air strikes against the Serb forces.    However, the commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, Michael  Rose, ordered a careful investigation into the incident.    After the attack, the United Nations discussed the  possibility of NATO air strikes against Tuzla area.    The UN has sent four fighter planes to fly over the area of  northeastern Bosnia to investigate.    UN secretary-general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi refused  the request for air strikes because "targets for strikes are  unclear".    Since the UN peacekeeping forces were sent to the former  Yugoslavia, 76 UN soldiers have been killed and 830 injured.    The western nations have recently asked to reopen the Tuzla  airport by force to guarantee the convey of humanitarian aid.    They warned that if Serbs opposed the plan, NATO would  launch  air strikes against the Serb positions.    Observers said that attacks on the UN troops might become an  excuse for NATO air strikes on Serb-held positions near the  Tuzla airport.</p>

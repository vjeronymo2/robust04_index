			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez; from the "RPC Television </F> News" newscast]    [Text] National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez has  agreed to remain in his post and work in the government of Dr.  Ernesto Perez Balladares.    President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, upon his arrival  for a meeting with the National Police director, said he will  not yet officially announce who will make up his cabinet, but  said he will seek the desired national consensus.    [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] There is a positive  atmosphere to achieve a consensus, which all Panamanians want  and for which, I understand, the Panamanian people voted.    [Unidentified reporter] Could this attempt at a consensus  lead to some problems within the Democratic Revolutionary Party  [PRD]?    [Perez Balladares] No, our party will be very well  represented in the cabinet and in all government posts because  it is also the party that obtained the most votes. The party  has the political maturity to understand that to achieve a  consensus it is necessary to allow other forces to participate,  otherwise there will not be a consensus. We cannot speak of  good intentions only. We have to put them into practice. [end  recording]    The meeting, which was held in the office of National Police  Director Oswaldo Fernandez, lasted over two hours. Some of  Perez Balladares' top advisers participated.    As he was leaving, the Panamanian president-elect broke the  tight security to greet the personnel working in this public  security institution.    National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez said the meeting  with the president-elect was to brief him on the Public Force,  its organization, and the future support for this institution by  the new government. Fernandez also talked about Perez  Balladares' offer to have him remain as the institution's  director. Fernandez said he accepted after President Guillermo  Endara also asked him to stay.    [Begin recording] [Fernandez] We decided to remain here. As  I told your colleagues a moment ago, it was not an easy decision  for an attorney who had already been nominated for a post in the  Supreme Court.    [Reporter] What motivated you to stay?    [Fernandez] The primary reason was that both the incoming  and  outgoing presidents asked me to stay. In addition, I have also  received requests from many people in the National Police,  especially policemen, sergeants, and corporals, who asked me to  stay with the institution. If both presidents thought I should  remain as director, it was not because I was the best but  because of the work accomplished by the National Police. The  work has been carried out thanks to those people, who asked me  to stay with them. [end recording]</p>

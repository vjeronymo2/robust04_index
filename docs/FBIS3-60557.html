			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by David Millward and Peter Pallot: ``Britain Faces </F> Flu Epidemic Say Doctors'']    [Text] Britain is facing its worst flu epidemic since 1989,  the Royal College of General Practitioners said yesterday.    Dr Douglas Fleming, director of the College's monitoring  unit, said 127 cases per 100,000 population had been reported  this week, three times the normal rate.    However, the Government is seeking to play down fears of an  epidemic and, with the A Beijing 92 flu strain  sweeping southwards from Scotland, Dr Kenneth Calman, Chief  Medical Officer, said vaccine would be available for all who  need it.    The College's figures, based on findings at 92 ``spotter  practices'' cross the country, suggest there were 65,000 new  cases of flu reported this week.    ``I don't like to use the word epidemic because it can  frighten people,'' Dr Fleming said. ``Although we are not in as  bad a situation as 1989, I would say that we have an epidemic.''    His figures show that flu reports have more than doubled in  the Midlands and South in the past week and increased by more  than 50 per cent in the North.    The Duchess of Kent was among the flu's latest victims  yesterday, cancelling a prize-giving engagement in Clerkenwell,  London. In Yeovil, a 35-bed orthopaedic ward at the district  hospital had to be closed this week after patients and staff  were struck down by the illness.    In Hampshire an infection control team was called in to the  Botley Ward of Knowle hospital, where psychiatric patients were  taken ill.    In 1989, when the infection rate reached 580 per 100,000,  more than half a million cases were recorded in a week and  between 20,000 and 25,000 died.    A spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory Service in  Colindale, North London, said the latest version of Beijing flu,  which was first identified last year, was not particularly  severe, though it was classified as an ``A'' -- or more virulent  -- strain.    The current strain is seen as a minor variation of previous  versions. The latest vaccine is also considered capable of  dealing with two other types of flu: A Singapore and  B Panama.    General practitioners are expected to vaccinate those whose  lives could be ``at risk'' from flu, though they do not receive  a special payment. These include elderly people, diabetics,  those with heart, kidney or lung disease and those whose immune  systems are weak.    The Department of Health said that there is not a shortage  of  vaccine. A spokesman said that 4.3 million doses were available  already, only 400,000 fewer than last year.    Another 460,000 doses are expected to be ready for  distribution shortly, the spokesman added.    Dr Calman has also recommended that vaccine should be  provided for residents of nursing homes, old people's homes and  other long-stay facilities where flu can spread rapidly.    He said: ``It is not possible accurately to predict the  impact of influenza at this time of the year, but it would be  reasonable to expect rates of illness to increase over the next  few weeks.''    The Department of Health is expected to buy almost five  million vaccine doses over the coming weeks from three suppliers.    The main symptoms of the new strain are the usual flu  symptoms: fever, headache, aching limbs, coughing, sneezing and  a runny nose.</p>

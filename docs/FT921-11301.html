			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Rosehaugh's banks extend standstill Rosehaugh, the troubled property company, yesterday announced it had extended its standstill agreement with its banks. The company, which has net debts of Pounds 310m, is negotiating a medium-term refinancing. Rosehaugh's statement to the Stock Exchange yesterday said that discussions were 'continuing satisfactorily'. Rosehaugh's share price slipped from 4 3/4 p to 4 1/2 p. The standstill agreement was set up at the end of last year, when Rosehaugh announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 227m for the year to June 30 and breached its covenants. Shareholders' funds shrank from Pounds 471m to Pounds 164m. Rosehaugh's 28 banks, led by Barclays and National Westminster, are discussing the margins and the maturity of its loans and the security position of the lenders.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Cost of prescribed drug ingredients rises 22% THE COST of the ingredients in prescribed drugs in England during June was 22.4 per cent higher than a year earlier, leading to fears that the UK's drugs budget may be out of control. The Department of Health estimates that the total cost of prescription medicines has increased 25 per cent over the past two years. During the first six months of 1992, the increase in the cost of drug ingredients was 15.2 per cent compared with the first half of last year. Inflation in the UK is running at 3.6 per cent. Although the July figures were lower at only 11 per cent, emergency meetings have been called within the Health Department to deal with rising cost of the drug bill, according to Scrip, the independent industry newsletter. The department denies that, although regular meetings have continued, it says. Although the drugs bill represents a relatively small proportion of NHS expenditure, which is dominated by staff costs, it is an area of spending that the government has been concentrating on trying to control in recent years. Substantial rises in drug costs would present difficulties for health authorities in a year when they are expecting little comfort from the autumn spending round. The most recent figures will be an embarrassment for the Health Department, which is struggling with the Treasury to justify its spending in the present expenditure round. The statistics suggest that government efforts to control demand for medicines have not been sufficient to keep down the drug bill. Last year, the government introduced budgets for general practitioners, which, if exceeded, had to be justified by the doctors. A scheme to show doctors how much they spent compared with their peers was also introduced. The National Health Service spent Pounds 3.138bn last year on drugs, equivalent to 9.7 per cent of its total budget. The increase in the NHS drug bill was about 10 per cent, according to Scrip. The National Audit Office is investigating the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme used to set the UK's drugs prices. The scheme is due to be renegotiated shortly. Other measures that could be considered by the Department of Health, according to Scrip, include: Generic substitution, which involves the pharmacist substituting a chemical equivalent and possibly cheaper medicine. An across-the-board price reduction and freeze. The newsletter suggests that the reduction could be 1.5 per cent, although it suggests that the move is unlikely. An extension of limited lists, removing certain items from the reimbursement list, forcing the patient to pay the drug's full price. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry is running an advertising campaign emphasising the importance of the UK's drugs industry and arguing that drugs are good value for money.

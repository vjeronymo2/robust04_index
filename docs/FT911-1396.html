			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Minding Your Own Business: Making a profit behind bars - The landlord of a once-derelict pub now in good cheer SO YOU are interested in buying a pub? You find one, in a semi-derelict state, that has been shut down by the public health authorities. How long does it take and how much money do you need to turn it into an award-winning purveyor of food and drink? For former truck salesman, John Milligan, the answer is 12 years and the surprisingly small sum of just over Pounds 150,000. From handing over Pounds 41,000 for a partly decrepit building in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, Milligan has been rewarded with the latest Good Pub Guide naming his Falkland Arms the best village pub in Britain. The path from partly-wrecked building to thriving business has not been easy. At one stage, Milligan faced 14 summonses for doing internal conversion work without planning permission on what is a Grade I listed building in a Grade I listed village. Great Tew is so quintessentially English, it could be straight off a 1930s film set. He was forced to take out a bank loan to cover a Pounds 20,000 back-tax demand and for which he is now suing his former accountants. A fire last month caused Pounds 10,000 of damage to the kitchen and suspended the Falkland Arms' trade in food and accommodation for three weeks. After obtaining an engineering degree in Belfast, Milligan joined Ford and then Godfrey Davis as a truck salesman. He bought a pub in Hertfordshire in 1976. Then he saw in the Morning Advertiser that the Falkland Arms was up for sale. His bid was accepted at auction. All the money for the purchase came as a loan from Allied Irish Bank. Milligan retained his first pub and had Pounds 18,000 of his own money to spend on the new venture. The Falkland Arms had been shut six months earlier. 'I decided it would not have been worth getting in a surveyor to look at it, it was so bad. Part of the thatched roof had caved in. The top floors were all rotten and some of the main beams needed renewing. Part of the staircases could not be saved. The kitchens were in a right state. There must have been an inch of gunge on the walls of the cellar,' says Milligan. Fortunately, the 2ft thick Cotswold ironstone walls were sound and the tiled roof above the main bar was in usable, if poor, condition. So within a year, the Falkland Arms reopened for business. 'What we basically had to do during that period was put in the toilets at the end of the building. We had to connect them to a private sewerage system. Then we dug up the mud floors in the cellar and put down concrete floors.' It took a year to complete this limited work because 52-year-old Milligan was doing most of it himself, coming over from his other pub four days a week. He has continued to do a lot of the work with the help of one or two local contractors. He has spent just Pounds 70,000 on rebuilding and fitting out the premises, including furnishing five guest bedrooms. The biggest element was replacing the thatched roof. 'It has been done from Norfolk reeds rather than from straw because reed will last a lot longer,' says Milligan. The Pounds 41,000 loan has been paid off but Milligan subsequently took out a further Pounds 60,000 from AIB, part of that to cover back-tax payments. Milligan says he did not know he needed planning permission to make internal alterations. He acknowledges with a wry smile, though, that he probably would not have got permission to make all the changes if he had applied beforehand. 'Fortunately it has worked out quite well with English Heritage and the Department of the Environment. Everything is now sorted out.' The Falkland Arms, with its massive oak ceiling beams, hundreds of hanging mugs, table candles, high-back settles and 50 types of snuff on sale, averages around Pounds 4,000 turnover a week. Three quarters of this comes from wet trade  - alcohol and soft drinks  - rather than food. Of last year's turnover of Pounds 210,000, the Falkland Arms made a substantial gross profit of 48 per cent. Milligan spends a couple of thousand pounds a year on advertising. The pub started to appear in Britain's drinking guides as early as 1982. Several live-in managers have been employed over the past 10 years at Great Tew, many of them with no previous experience. Milligan says this provides good training for them to move on to another pub. 'I wouldn't want to keep a manager for more than two years or so. For one thing, it is very hard work. It would kill them,' he says. The present manager and his wife together earn Pounds 11,000 a year. The pub's total wage bill is about Pounds 20,000. The pub sells beers from four breweries including Hook Norton and Hall and Woodhouse and always has on tap three guest beers which at the moment include Woodfordes Phoenix and Bullion Old Mill. The margins on beer are surprisingly large. Low-gravity ale, for which Milligan pays 48p a pint, excluding Vat, is sold over the bar for Pounds 1.16. Milligan can extract little discount from the breweries. 'A large freehouse could demand astronomical discounts on beer. Grand Met would offer you maybe Pounds 40 or Pounds 50 discount on a 36-gallon barrel. It's crazy but they are fighting for business,' he says. The Falkland Arms dispatches about 18,000 gallons of beer a year. Milligan's wife, Hazel, supervises the kitchen; its menu includes cheese, prawn and potato pie and lamb in apricot, with main courses costing about Pounds 4.50. A double room with breakfast is Pounds 40. A businessman and landlord, Milligan believes the Falkland Arms is now worth more than Pounds 500,000. That is incentive enough to stay in the business. 'Maybe next year, we'll look to buy another pub.' The Falkland Arms, Great Tew, Oxfordshire. Tel:0608 - 83653.</p>

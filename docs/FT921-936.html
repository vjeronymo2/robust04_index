			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Minimum wage effects 'limited' ONLY a minority of Britain's personnel managers oppose the Labour party's plan to introduce a national minimum wage at Pounds 3.40 an hour and more than 90 per cent say the rise in the pay bill will be minimal, according to a survey by Industrial Relations Services. The survey of 527 private and public-sector companies also found that nearly two thirds of respondents predicted that the minimum wage would have no effect on pay differentials, while a further fifth expected a limited effect. A recent survey by the British Hospitality Association, which represents employers in hotels, restaurants and catering, calculated that a minimum wage would increase the wage bill by only 5.9 per cent, although that figure rose dramatically to 65.5 per cent if all differentials were maintained. On job losses, 85 per cent of managers did not foresee their organisation reducing staff. The Low Pay Unit says the abolition of wages councils, likely if the Conservatives win, would cost 25,000 jobs because of the drop in demand created by lower wages.</p>

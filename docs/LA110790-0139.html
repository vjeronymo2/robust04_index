			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOP KEEPS GRIP ON ORANGE COUNTY'S HOUSE DELEGATION;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: EVEN IN THE 38TH DISTRICT, THE ONLY ONE IN THE COUNTY WITH A  DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY, DORNAN CAPTURES THREE-FIFTHS OF THE VOTE.  </P> <P> Republican incumbents in Orange County's five congressional races took  comfortable leads in early election returns Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), seeking his fourth term representing  the 38th Congressional District, garnered about three-fifths of the vote with  absentee ballots and some precincts counted.  </P> <P> Democrat Barbara Jackson withdrew from the race early on and did not campaign,  but still managed to draw significant percentage of the vote. Jackson, a public  affairs director for Planned Parenthood, pulled out of the race because she  feared her campaign could jeopardize her employer's tax-exempt status.  </P> <P> The 38th District is the only one in the county where the majority of the  voters are registered Democrats.  </P> <P> Freshman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), who gained national attention as  an outspoken opponent of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, was  leading Democrat Guy C. Kimbrough in the 42nd Congressional District, 2 to 1. A  third candidate in the race, Libertarian Richard Gibb Martin, a Long Beach  contractor, did not appear to be mounting a serious challenge.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher's fellow freshman in the Orange County delegation, Rep. Christopher  Cox (R-Newport Beach), was also well ahead of his opponent in the 40th  District, Democrat Eugene C. Gratz of Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), a member of Congress since 1978 who  is best known for his strident opposition to gay rights, was leading Democrat  Francis X. Hoffman, a Garden Grove lawyer, with more than two-thirds of the  absentee ballots.  </P> <P> In the 43rd District, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) faced no Democratic  opposition and was cruising to an easy victory. Packard, who was elected as a  write-in candidate in 1982, was challenged by Libertarian Richard L. Arnold and  Peace and Freedom Party member Doug Hansen. Early returns showed him leading  his challengers, 4 to 1.  </P> <P> Congressmen earn $96,600 a year. On Jan. 1, a raise will take effect that will  raise representatives' salaries to $120,800.  </P> <P> Orange County has not sent a Democrat to Washington since 1982.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PUBLISHER OF STRAPPED ENTREPRENEUR RESIGNS  </P> <P> Entrepreneur Magazine publisher Clare N. Thain resigned last week, Entrepreneur  Chairman Peter Shea said Tuesday, and his duties at the cash-strapped  publication will be assumed by Shea and Associate Publisher James L.  Fitzpatrick.  </P> <P> Shea also said he had turned down a joint-venture deal with Omni Group, a New  York-based publishing arm of the Swiss company Omni Holdings. He said talks  were continuing with other possible overseas investors whom he declined to  identify.  </P> <P> Entrepreneur has also laid off six people, including three marketing employees  and three clerical workers, Shea said. The company now employs 61 full-time  workers.  </P> <P> "I've gotten more involved in the day-to-day operations, and we looked at the  overhead and decided we were a little top-heavy," Shea said in explaining  Thain's departure.  </P> <P> But Thain said Tuesday that he left because of a disagreement over "the  direction the magazine was taking." He declined further comment.  </P> <P> Shea said the cutbacks would not affect growth at Entrepreneur and the  company's two other publications, New Business Opportunities and the recently  launched Entrepreneurial Woman.  </P> <P> Shea acknowledged earlier this month that fast-growing Entrepreneur had  encountered some cash-flow problems and that it was late in paying more than $1  million owed to three suppliers. But he denied that the cash pinch threatened  the company's future. Shea said Tuesday that about $500,000 of the outstanding  bills had been paid off in the last several weeks. "We're within 60 days on all  our payments," he said. "Our creditors are happy."  </P> <P> The creditors, including World Color Press of Los Angeles, Corinthian  Communications of Corona del Mar and Horizon Paper Co. of New York, have  declined comment on the situation.  </P> <P> Although Shea has said that the company can continue to grow without a cash  infusion from a partner, some analysts view the fact that he is in talks about  possible joint ventures as an indication that the firm's problems are serious.  </P></p>

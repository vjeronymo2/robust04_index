			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE EXHIBITION: PARIS IN THE '20S MEETS L.A. IN '40S  </P> <P> There are few decades that hover more glamorously on the modern imagination  than the myth of Paris in the '20s. Hemingway and the Lost Generation, Picasso  and Gertrude Stein, James Joyce and Sylvia Beach, French zazou flappers with  beaded dresses and little-boy haircuts. It's all so glimmeringly seductive and  maddeningly unattainable. Not only were we not there, we were not here. Most of  us weren't born yet.  </P> <P> Paris in the '20s was that wonderful thing that happened just before we got to  the party. The epoch has no rival, but a subtler second was certainly Los  Angeles in the '40s when it was still cloaked in the aura of Raymond Chandler's  tender toughness and the perfume of night-blooming jasmine on fake Spanish  patios. It lingered even after the war started and Rosie the Riveter did the  boogie-woogie with G.I. Joe. Ah, a moonlit night on the lagoon in Westlake Park  in a boat named Donald Duck. Rattle home on the Red Car.  </P> <P> An exhibition has just opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art presenting the  art of a man who laced those two improbable times together and played no small  role in creating their glamour. It is a retrospective of the work of Man Ray.  He wasn't very happy exiled in Los Angeles, but he made a happy marriage to  Juliet Browner. His presence added to our myth and reminds us there was art  hereabouts before the boom of the '60s.  </P> <P> Man Ray. Sounds like a Buck Rogers half-alien, and in a way, as an expatriate,  he was one. His name is unforgettable but after that it's difficult to know  what to call him. Photographer? Painter? Film maker? Dadaist bricoleur?  </P> <P> He fished earnestly in all those ponds and made unforgettable catches. Once  seen, it is impossible to forget his photograph of a girl's beautiful eyes  crying glass beads. Was she Midas' daughter whose tears turned to jewels or a  tart weeping fakes for effect?  </P> <P> We would probably remember his flat-iron bottomed with its ripping row of nails  without reading the label, but calling it "Cadeau" clinches it, adding insight  to injury. He had a knack for witty titles. Once he took a photo of a girl's  eye, attached it to a metronome and called it "Object to Be Destroyed."  Somebody obliged by pulverizing it, but by that time it was so famous he  shrugged, put it back together and called it "Indestructible Object."  </P> <P> Everybody remembers his best painting. It's one of the most erotic images ever  concocted. It shows a pair of Gargantuan ruby lips floating in a cloudy night  sky above the silhouette of an observatory. It was painted in Paris but it  looks like Griffith Park to us, especially since it seems like an ancestor of  Ed Ruscha's Pop Surrealism. But it's not in the show. Man Ray's best painting  is not in his retrospective. When you try to put the guy together he darts away  in a flash like a coy koi.  </P> <P> He was born in Philadelphia in 1890 and died in 1976. In the beginning his name  wasn't Man Ray, it was Emmanuel something, probably Radensky. The catalogue  offers an equivocal account of the family name and how it was changed. There  may have been a time when such name-changing shenanigans were provocative, but  by now we've had so many artistic pseudonyms that they are either quaint or  irritating. Can you really trust a guy who won't tell you his name?  </P> <P> Anyway, Man Ray was a pioneer, sort of. He led in the art of forging one's own  mythic public image, a precursor of Andy Warhol but more aristocratic in the  fashion of the day. He was a rare American to be celebrated by the School of  Paris avant-garde. Art-photo people said he invented the Rayograph while other  people grumble that the technique of making images on photo paper by exposing  it directly to light was really old stuff. Besides, the results look a lot like  mechanical Cubism.  </P> <P> By 1913, he was confirmed in his artistic ambitions, just married to his first  wife, Adon Lacroix, and living in New Jersey. This impediment did not prevent  him from becoming fascinated with Rimbaud's poetry, the writings of the weird  proto-surrealist Lautremont and the legendary Armory Exhibition, which  introduced radical European art to America. Soon Man Ray was paying court to  Marcel Duchamp. They both played chess. Man Ray painted his second-best  picture, "The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself With Her Shadows." It's a rather  embarrassing knock-off of Duchamp's "Large Glass," but at least it is in the  exhibition.  </P> <P> By 1921 -- discouraged at New York's indifference to Dada -- Man Ray moved to  Paris, where he was embraced by the avant-garde. He still wanted to be a  painter, but he was less a bohemian than a dandy who regarded a pretty  mistress, a good studio and a flashy car as life's basic necessities. In a  self-portrait he showed himself short and dapper with the face of an elfin  weasel.  </P> <P> He decided to become a fashionable portrait photographer to make money and  advance his own artistic fortunes through contact with the rich and famous. He  was so successful that it was soon regarded as a status symbol to pose for Man  Ray. The pictures are wonderful in themselves, chic, detached and witty and a  wonderful sociological record of the era. He photographed everyone from the  dead Marcel Proust to a solemnly tipsy Sinclair Lewis and every artist, poet  and slick young thing in town. And everybody was in town.  </P> <P> The required mistress was found in a teen-age model named Alice Prin, called  Kiki. He photographed her ivory face, bee-stung lips and powdery body  ceaselessly until he traded her in on a new model, Lee Miller, an aspiring  American photographer with a figure like a Greek statue. Clearly a certain  amount of inbreeding was going on because some of Man Ray's mistresses and  models -- including Dora Maar -- also turn up in accounts of Picasso's  mistresses and models.  </P> <P> Man Ray held the mirror up to a glamorous and richly creative era. That is  enough in itself to make the exhibition a popular attraction until it closes  here May 28. But when we have had enough of being flattered, kidded and  entertained by Man Ray's sardonic impishness, how does this body of work hold  up to art's harder questions?  </P> <P> I previewed the show at its point of origin -- the National Museum of American  Art in Washington. It comes on like a rare and definitive event, and it is, but  there have been others. In 1966, Jules Langsner presented a survey at the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art. It may be significant to note that both shows  came at times when stylishness threatened to gobble up art.  </P> <P> The MOCA installation makes the art appear more substantial. Paintings look  less raw, but the ensemble appears darker and more paranoid. The exhibition  meanders around like a gigolo at a cocktail party. Man Ray displayed all the  symptoms of butterfly dilettantism -- flitting prettily from flower to flower  -- looking brilliantly clever as he paused briefly on each one but never  resting anywhere for long. The show looks mainly like the work of four or five  gifted amateurs who dabbled for a time and moved on to collecting exotic  automobiles. His movies are full of witty bits, but their heartlessness  eventually causes your rear end to inform you you are sitting through another  self-indulgent art movie. Scrutinized for common threads, the work reveals a  commonplace artistic sensibility -- it is coldly mechanical at bottom, a kind  of updated Neo-Classicism. (He drew with a prissy thin line.) The closest it  comes to feeling is its delight in polite erotic fetishism. Man Ray admired the  Marquis de Sade and painted his third-best painting in his honor. He is also  said to have bragged about occasionally batting around a recalcitrant mistress.  Some later photographs are subtly sadomasochistic.  </P> <P> Art has to be free to express kinky desires, so that's not the point. Artists'  personal habits are even less relevant to our judgment of their artistic  qualifications than are those of candidates for presidential secretaries, so  that's not the point either.  </P> <P> The point has to do with the fact that egomania and narcissism are natural  occupational diseases of all artists. The only way to stave them off is by  being more interested in art than in oneself, one's career, one's image.  </P> <P> An artist who is more interested in art than himself may seem as self-involved  as one who is not. The difference shows in the work. A truly self-involved  artist's oeuvre is usually less than the sum of its parts. Man Ray's work shows  that what he created was not an artist but an artistic personality -- a kind of  visual Oscar Levant.  </P></p>

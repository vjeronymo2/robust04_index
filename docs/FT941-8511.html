			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Disgruntled Washington backs away from Aristide The Clinton administration and President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti appear to be irredeemably at odds after the failure of another attempt to persuade him to make more concessions to the military junta that ousted him two and a half years ago. Under pressure from the administration to show more flexibility, Mr Aristide met a delegation from the Haitian parliament in Washington, but he did not discuss a new peace plan that the US has been strongly backing. This parliamentary plan calls on Mr Aristide to name a new prime minister, but unlike the Governor's Island agreement last year which was supposed to bring about the restoration of a democratic government, it sets no date for the ousted president to return to Haiti. It also calls for the resignation only of General Raoul Cedras, the army commander, and not of other military leaders such as Colonel Michel Francois, the police chief. The Clinton administration still formally declares its support for Mr Aristide, but scarcely disguises its wish for a leader more accommodating to the military. 'I think we still have a working relationship with Father Aristide. We believe he's the democratically elected president of Haiti, and our policy stil is to restore a democratically elected government which is headed by Father Aristide,' said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary. But the US has for months now been urging Mr Aristide to appoint a government that includes members of the military, and has been cool to his demand that the United Nations stiffen its economic sanctions against Haiti. 'The relationship between the US and Aristide has never been worse,' says Mr Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington monitoring group, who describes the US's Haitian policy as 'devoid of any capacity for moral indignation or an ethical compass in favour of a president who won more than two thirds of the vote of his own people. Critics note that the US has blithely continued to do business with Haiti, despite the UN embargo. US imports from Haiti rose by more than half last year to Dollars 154m, thanks in part to an exemption granted by the US Treasury for imports of goods assembled in Haiti from US parts ' principally clothing and baseballs. US exports to Haiti also rose last year to Dollars 221m. European diplomats in Washington are scathing in their comments on what they see as the US's abdication of leadership over Haiti.</p>

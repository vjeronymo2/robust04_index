			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Presidency Information and Public Relations  Office of the Republic has released a communique announcing that  by executive decree signed by President Guillermo Endara  Galimany, educator German Vergara has been appointed education  minister. Professor Vergara has been appointed due to the  retirement of current Education Minister Marcos Alarcon,  effective 1 July. The communique adds Professor Vergara is the  current Health Ministry secretary general.    The executive decree will become effective on 1 July. RPC  tried to obtain reactions from Education Minister Alarcon as  well as from Professor Vergara, but both declined to comment.  The two men are members of the Arnulfist Party.    Meanwhile, teachers union leaders have expressed hope the  new  appointment will foster a better understanding between teachers  and the Education Ministry. Efrain de Leon, of the Association  of Independent Teachers, has commented on the issue:    [Begin de Leon recording] He represents the executive  branch;  therefore, he represents a political party and will function  with political guidelines. We also know that working against  him is his term of almost two months. We hope he will try  during this period to correct the many mistakes Alarcon has made  and reach an agreement, for the first time during this period of  democracy, between the Education Ministry and the teachers  unions.

The consultations are not yet over and  the final results of the round are not yet known. However, this  round is apparently not the final one: The talks will be  continued, with only a recess for Christmas, right up to the  opening of a Duma session, Ivan Rybkin, one of the leaders of  the Agrarian Party, told the newspaper. Various names of  candidates were mentioned during the consultations. Rybkin,  whose candidacy was named as well, said he personally regards as  fruitful the idea of electing four deputy speakers. This will  make it possible to ensure the stability of the ship called the  State Duma, for the more interests are represented in its  leadership, the more stable it will be."    TRUD on the reform-minded blocs' defeat in the recent  elections: "The paradox of the past elections is that,  notwithstanding the lack of victors, there still are the  vanquished -- reform-minded blocs. If they, while counting on  winning a majority in parliament, did not get it, this cannot be  called otherwise than a defeat. There is one hope, namely, that  all political forces from the very outset will renounce  orientation towards confrontation or political accusations  against one another and will come to realise that such a path  has already been traversed completely and it did not lead to  anything but trouble".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on why State Duma deputies are so  preoccupied with the speaker election issue: "There is one  disquieting circustance: The talks, a regular round of which was  held on Tuesday, focus on the search for a candidacy of a State  Duma speaker. Why does this question worry the deputies so  much? Under the new constitution, the speaker is a purely  functional figure: He will preside over sessions and see to it  that internal rules and regulations are observed. Neither party  affiliation, attitude to reforms, nor a stand with regard to the  government and the president should be decisive in a speaker's  characteristics: only tactfulness, organising ability, an  aptitude for the establishment of contacts, and loyalty to  various points of view. It is not so difficult to find such a  person among 450 deputies provided there is accord on  priorities. But the matter, apparently, is precisely in  priorities. This is actually the result of deeply ingrained  habits of the soviet times: The main thing is what kind of a  boss one will have, not the law (in this case -- fundamental  law). If the boss is not an outsider, then one has a chance for  promotion, etc. If the boss is a stranger, one would have  additional problems".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the possibility of Ukrainian  President  Leonid Kravchuk's participation in the forthcoming Russian-U.S.  summit in Moscow: "The Ukrainian president's foreign affairs  service has expressed doubt about the possibility of Kravchuk's  participating in Moscow talks among the presidents of Ukraine,  Russia and the United States on January 14, 1994, on the future  of Ukrainian strategic nuclear weapons. The summit will  coincide with an official visit to Kiev by President Nursultan  Nazarabayev of Kazakhstan, the presidential service announced.  According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, a meeting of the  presidents of the U.S., Russia and Ukraine in Moscow is still  possible but it will depend on the outcome of the ongoing talks  in Washington which involve Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister  Borys Tarasyuk and Vice-Premier for Defence-Sector Issues Valery  Shmarov".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with  Stanislav Voronin, chief designer of Russian nuclear and  thermo-nuclear weapons, who emphasises: "One does not toy with  an atomic bomb in political games! Some politicians state that  nuclear weapons can be dismantled in Ukraine. This is an  ill-intentioned attempt to mislead public opinion. in Ukraine,  there are neither specialists of the needed qualification, nor  facilities, nor experience in dismantling nukes".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Dmitry Volkogonov,  adviser to the president of Russia on defence affairs. He said:  "I could never agree that the army as one of major instruments  of the state can be outside politics. Yes, it must be outside  party-motivated politics but it cannot be outside state  politics. The army should adhere to the course followed by the  government and the president, who is the supreme  commander-in-chief, the course towards security, the official  course towards the armed forces' development, towards reforms,  etc.".    PRAVDA on an attempt on the life of Aleksandr Barkashov,  leader of the banned Russian National Unity Movement: "Could it  be that the shoot-out in which Barkashov was heavily wounded was  the consequence of his knowing some details of the firing on the  parliament building?"    St. Petersburg's-based NEVSKOYE VREMYA newspaper on an  explosion and fire near metro station: "An explosion, followed  by a heavy fire, occurred at the entrance to the Russo-Italian  shoe shop Marcopizii near Petrogradskaya metro station four  hours before the advent of the new year. The blast smashed the  stained-glass partition separating the shop and the hallway of  the metro station. No one was hurt but many people were unable  to get home by midnight -- the metro station was promptly closed  down. Criminal proceedings have been instituted."</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> LTV's Pension Liability Upheld: A federal judge affirmed a U.S. Supreme Court  ruling that ordered LTV Corp. to reassume liability for nearly $3 billion in  employee pension plans that it stopped funding in 1987. The Dallas steel,  aerospace and energy concern, which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization,  had opposed restoring the plans because it claimed that such a move could  possibly force the company to liquidate. U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet of  Manhattan rejected the position and granted a request by the federal Pension  Benefit Guaranty Corp. to make LTV take back responsibility for the pension  plans.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Time For Maturity"] </F>   [Text] As legislators steel themselves today for the  longest single day's sitting in the history of the Legislative  Council [Legco], they may take pride in the fact that it is also  the most important. Today's vote is more than just a  complicated procedure for determining the future shape of the  territory's democratic institutions. It is a rite of passage  for Hong Kong's developing democracy, a process enhanced by  Britain and recognised by China's Basic Law.    In less than three years -- since the first directly elected  members took the oath of office -- Legco has transformed itself  from a rubber stamp to a body of pragmatic, shifting alliances,  capable of effective, if not always constructive, opposition to  government policies. Today, it has a chance to display maturity  and responsibility. It is the moment to show it has not slipped  the collar of one government just to clip on to the leash of  another. A mature legislature is one that has the vision and  courage to vote for what the public wants and believes in, no  matter what Britain or China expect.    It is two years since Chris Patten began to listen to  popular  demand for more democracy and started work on his constitutional  package. In that time, legislators have had the chance to work  out what their constituents want and to develop a healthy  scepticism about both British and Chinese intentions and  justifications. They must now judge the competing proposals and  amendments on their merits.    The Liberal Party's amendments have the attraction of  appearing to conform more closely than Mr Patten's 1992 package  to China's interpretation of the Basic Law. It is argued these  "1994 proposals" would reduce the disruption to political life  if China carried out its threat to dissolve all three tiers of  elected government in 1997. This argument should be rejected,  for the effect of the proposals would be to maximise the chances  of Liberal candidates being elected to functional constituencies  in 1995.  <H5>  False guarantee </H5>   The amendments offer no more than a token nod in the  direction of the faster democratic development Hong Kong people  consistently have shown they want but they give no greater  guarantee of a smooth transition than the Patten package.  Beijing's tacit support can be read in the decision of  pro-China legislators to vote with the Liberals. But, come  1997, the voting system for the directly elected seats is likely  to be switched to whatever method with which China feels  comfortable (the Preliminary Working Committee, for instance,  has talked of proportional representation, which would return  more pro-Beijing candidates). The functional constituencies  might also be rejigged.    At the other end of the scale is Emily Lau Wai-hing's  quixotic Bill calling for all 60 seats to be directly elected in  1995. There is a respectable argument that since there is to be  no through-train, Hong Kong may as well choose full democracy  for the final 21 months of British rule. There is nothing in  the Joint Declaration to prevent this and the Basic Law does not  come into effect until 1997. The majority of Hong Kong people,  however, would not favour such radicalism.  <H5>  The sensible course </H5>   It would re-ignite the conflict with China and jeopardise  the  cooperation on other issues at last beginning to resume in the  Joint Liaison Group. Even by the British reading, the Bill is  in conflict with the Basic Law. So, too, is Martin Lee  Chu-ming's call for 10 more directly elected seats. Britain has  gone out of its way to stay within the Basic Law, however  controversial its interpretation. It would not wish to destroy  its own arguments by abandoning any show of convergence with the  post-1997 constitution.    Difficult though it may be for some legislators to accept,  Mr  Patten's modest attempt to broaden the franchise represents a  sensible middle course. It is not a substitute for full  democracy. But it would go some way to increasing Legco's  representativeness while staying within the Basic Law as it  might be read by a court operating within the British legal  tradition. Hong Kong people would feel cheated if Legco adopted  a package less democratic than the Basic Law.    The storm unleashed by Mr Patten's October 1992 proposals  should not deflect legislators from their obligation to settle  the conflict in favour of the people of Hong Kong. It is in  China's interest as much as Hong Kong's to end the debilitating  debate of the last two years and allow an executive-led  administration and a newly mature Legco to get on with the  business of running the territory's affairs for the remainder of  British rule and preparing for the transfer of sovereignty. If  they work well, the arrangements might seem less threatening and  offensive to Beijing in 1997 than they do today.</p>

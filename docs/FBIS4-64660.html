			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, May 5: General Jerzy Gotowala, the  commander-in-chief of the Polish Air-Forces, and his German  counterpart General Hans-Joerg Kuebart on Thursday [5 May]  agreed to expand cooperation between the Air-Forces of Poland  and Germany.    They decided that Polish and German Air-Forces should offer  help to the other side in special situations and inform the  other side of the intended operations in the border-line areas.  Poland and Germany will also propose to Sweden and Denmark  joint manouevres in the Baltic Sea.    "My talks are linked to Poland's approaching to Western  defence structures," Gen. Gotowala said.    Poland also aims to coordinate its charity actions with  German and international operations as it sometines happens that  Polish planes with humanitarian aid must wait for their turn to  come to unload the cargo. Closer cooperation with German  Air-Forces may help to include Poland in the international  system of charity operations.    After the talks, General Gotowala visited air-bases in the  north of Germany. The visit, that started on May Wednesday, is  to end on Friday.</p>

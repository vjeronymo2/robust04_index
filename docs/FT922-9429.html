			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Observer: Helm over How times change. Had it not been for Trafalgar House's opportunist bid for its smaller rival P &amp; O 10 years ago, Lord Sterling of Plaistow would not have been press-ganged into taking the P &amp; O helm. Today, a revitalised P &amp; O is worth more than three times as much as Trafalgar House. Nor is it faced with the humiliation of having to halve its dividend to survive the recession. So does Trafalgar House now need the same sort of external shock to wake up its rather inbred management team? Certainly, it has hired a slick PR professional to patch up its accident-prone image, and there's no doubt that founder Sir Nigel Broackes looks reinvigorated on his new diet. But something more will be needed to convince the City that anything much has changed. A few fresh non-executive faces on the board would be a start, especially if the Trafalgar House really is intent on transforming itself into a world class engineering giant. It is the sort of company that the new president of the board of trade will need to keep an eye on.</p>

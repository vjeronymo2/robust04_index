			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MISLABELED DISCS RING SOUR NOTE  </P> <P> A manufacturing mistake has struck a sour note with the Dallas Symphony  Orchestra.  </P> <P> The producer of compact discs for the Pro Arts record company mislabeled up to  1,000 compact discs, according to the orchestra's music administrator, Victor  Marshall.  </P> <P> "I found out about it when members of the orchestra bought the recording of  Gustav Holst's 'The Planets' to see how they sounded and discovered that they  had bought a Christian rock group album," Marshall said.  </P> <P> Many of the discs have been recalled, but Marshall said he still has 50 of  them.  </P> <P> "I don't even know who the rock group is, but I don't really want to throw the  discs away," Marshall said. "I may string them on a wire and turn them into a  mobile for my office."  </P></p>

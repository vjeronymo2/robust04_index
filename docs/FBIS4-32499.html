			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party Chairman Pavol Hagyari by </F> Anna Lenicka; place and date not given: "I Am No Demigod"]    [Text] Those who do not wish him well are spreading the  story that he bought the Democratic Party [DS]. In its  headquarters on Sancova Street, he works in an office he  inherited. With its customary modern furnishings, it would  probably give the impression of being run-of-the-mill and most  of all impersonal, if it were not for the small penguin sitting  on one of the black cabinets. This creature, which moves so  awkwardly on the ground, is exceptionally nimble in water. Will  the reinvented DS maneuver as nimbly in the political waters as  its mascot?    [Hagyari] I believe so, but our mascot represents, above  all,  a gentleman. Gentlemen, not boxers, should go into politics. The  penguin is a decent, unaggressive creature, capable of  overcoming extremely difficult conditions with extreme ease.    [Lenicka] On the same floor, just a few steps from where you  are, is the editorial office of the weekly journal MOSTY  [Bridges]. Don't you think we are unnecessarily burning those  bridges that still connect us with the Czech Republic?    [Hagyari] That is why our foreign policy follows the Czech  foreign policy. It is out of the question that we could join  West Europe without the Czechs, but the Czechs can join even  without us.    [Lenicka] Isn't a tactical election move hiding behind your  parcel of concrete initiatives for closer cooperation with that  republic?    [Hagyari] Certainly it is a tactical election move. I do not  do anything without a reason.    [Lenicka] But the Czech side reacted neurotically not only  to  your initiatives, but also to the installation of Moravcik's  government, being concerned whether, along with it, goes a  renewed pro-Czechoslovak sentiment or an attempt to establish a  confederation....    [Hagyari] No, I do not see any reason that anyone should  feel  uneasy about it, and I do not have any information about  anything like that. Only Mr. Klaus reacted to it that way. The  Czech Government, as far as I know, did not take a position on  it. Our proposals for improving cooperation will benefit all  Slovak citizens. In the political area, for example, we want to  give the citizens of the other state the very same rights our  citizens have. For example, the right to vote at the municipal  level, with the exception of parliamentary elections and  military service. This is common in West Europe. In the area of  education, we want our people to have the possibility to study  in the Czech Republic and vice versa, and to be compensated for  it by the individual governments. As far as cultural matters are  concerned, we could consider, among other things, a joint  television program or a joint radio broadcast, which would  certainly help to maintain good relations with the Czech  Republic.    [Lenicka] We cannot concede that Slovakia is a near  abroad--similar discomfitted reactions all the way to flat  rejections were heard mostly from the Civic Democratic Party  [ODS] politicians, with whom you cooperate closely. Most  recently with the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA], which won  seats only in the Czech National Council [CNR], and that, too,  thanks to the "Slovak matter" is not too "favorably inclined"  toward us....    [Hagyari] I do not think I agree with you. Mr. Kalvoda asked  the Slovak side several times just to say clearly what it  wants--federation, confederation, or independent states. Nothing  else. When I talked with him unofficially at the ODA congress,  he welcomed our initiative. He said that, as soon as he gets to  the government level, he will personally support it. Similarly  Mr. Dlouhy. I admit that I did not talk about it with Mr. Klaus.  The realization of this plan requires that both governments be  compatible. After all, only in the Czech Republic is there a  civic right-wing government, whereas in Slovakia the national  left was in the government.    [Lenicka] You consider the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia  [HZDS] the national left? Are you not worried about the  prediction of the chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left  [SDL] that the Slovak right will not grow out of Hagyari's DS  but from the vulgar, populist HZDS?    [Hagyari] We shall see after the elections. I respect  comrade  Weiss as a man who placed himself at the head of a party that  had 800,000 members. It is easier for him to build from  something, and when, for 40 years, he was an administrator here.  It is another thing to build a civic right wing. I am surprised  that Mrs. Schmognerova is following rightist, so-called  antisocial politics....    [Lenicka] Are you saying that rightist politics are  antisocial?    [Hagyari] What is one to call what they are doing? They  defend the interests of the workers, and they say about us that  we are antisocial. And all of a sudden, Mrs. Schmognerova is  more rightist than Ivan Miklos or Dzurinda.    [Lenicka] In what way is she more rightist?    [Hagyari] Note the cuts in social programs that she is  making  in an effort to keep as many resources as possible for the state  budget!    [Lenicka] If you were in her place, could you afford not to  make cuts, given the kind of shortfall that exists in the state  budget today?    [Hagyari] No, we embrace that policy. We maintain that we  can  spend on social programs only when we can afford it.    [Lenicka] You also assert that the difference between the  left and the right is that the left distributes and the right  contributes. Isn't this too cheap a shot? Don't you think that,  when the SDL insists on implementing certain unpopular measures,  without which the revival of the economy would be unthinkable,  that it does so precisely for the benefit of the working people?  That a postponement of these steps would be antipeople?    [Hagyari] I agree that no other solution exists. We evaluate  the course of action of this government positively, in spite of  the fact that, from the politico-logical standpoint, the  government is more to the left.    [Lenicka] L. Kovac, the former minister of education in the  first post-November government, therefore from circles close to  you, came to the conclusion during the polemic touched off by J.  Carnogusky's strict rejection of liberalism that Slovak  conservatism has always been reactionary. Reactionary in the  sense that it solved problems with delays measured in tens,  sometimes even hundreds, of years.... Will you reverse this  trend? How will you convince the citizens that, as a  conservative party, you are offering a modern program?    [Hagyari] There is a great difference between us and the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. Especially in the fact  that, while it addresses itself to Christian-oriented people, we  are for everybody--without regard to sex, age, education, or  religious affiliation. The greatest difference between us is the  fact that our stance on abortion is definitely more liberal. In  contrast to the KDH, which, as is known, calls for strict  prohibition of abortions, we think that a woman must make her  own decision. Another difference between us and the KDH is the  way we view the Slovak State of 1939-45. In our opinion, it was  a satellite of fascist Germany, and one has to take a stance on  history accordingly. As far as parties are concerned, we are  closest to the ODS or ODA.    [Lenicka] But there are more sticking points in the dialogue  between the Slovak secular and religious right. If one could  have said until recently that it was the KDH that was impeding  this dialogue, now the situation appears to be turning around.  As if you were the ones impeding it.    [Hagyari] Who told you that?    [Lenicka] Press that is favorably inclined toward you. I  even  read there that the only problem that prevents the creation of a  clearly defined and unified right-wing bloc is Hagyari's DS.    [Hagyari] That is an interesting opinion, but it is not  based  on any realistic premises. I do not know of any politician on  the Slovak political scene who is more pragmatic than I. In the  year and a half that I have been in politics, we succeeded in  uniting, under my leadership, six right-of-center political  entities. My politics are realistic and pragmatic; I am ready to  meet others halfway. I was the one who a year ago said that we  must create a large right-of-center bloc. That would ensure that  every voter would find his own leader and his own party, and  that not even one right-wing vote would be wasted. In this  respect, one can only take one's hat off to the left-wing  parties, which so quickly and without any problems came to an  agreement. A sane mind would say that we can do likewise on the  right. So far, that has not happened, but I firmly believe that  somehow things will be settled and we shall find a common  language.    [Lenicka] But the Cernak people do not hide their antagonism  toward your profederation orientation. The Moravcik people's  ambition is to get into the parliament on their own, similarly  Randa's party of small businessmen. Obviously, it will not be  possible to create even a counterbalance to the religious  right--the KDH, let alone a unified right-wing bloc.    [Hagyari] There are a number of possibilities. We can also  accept the KDH offer to put our top people who are running for  office on their slate of candidates, but that carries certain  risks. In the sense that not everybody will be ready to accept  I. Miklos and me on that slate as long as they harbor, for  whatever reason, a certain distrust of the KDH and distance  themselves from it. From opinion polls, we know that the  majority of our sympathizers do not want to accept the KDH. And  it really is questionable whether they would accept having us on  their slate of candidates. There is still the possibility of  creating a bloc of civic-oriented right-wing parties if the KDH  goes into the elections on its own. It there is no other  possibility and the executive council comes to the conclusion  that our presence on the KDH ticket will be the best way, we  will act accordingly. We think that there is not that much  difference in voter preference for us and for the KDH that we  need to accept the KDH proposal immediately.    [Lenicka] But you still have not crossed the mandatory  5-percent threshold. Your risk is greater. When will you make a  definitive decision?    [Hagyrai] It depends on the offer of the KDH, which is still  very unspecific. It did not tell us whether it is offering us  five of 10 slots, for which positions, etc. That is one thing.  It depends on our executive council, which will meet on the  penultimate Saturday in May. I assure you that I will do all I  can to see to it that not even one vote is wasted.    [Lenicka] Do you make so bold as to convince voters in case  you will be courting them on your own?    [Hagyari] That is a premature question. That will depend on  what the voter preferences are in May and June. We want to  demand more television time so we can address at least the 10  percent of sympathizers whom we united.    [Lenicka] Do you consider the fusion of the KDS and the DS  into the DS the final stop?    [Hagyari] No, I maintain that life will always find the best  way, that it will reject anything that is artificial, unnatural.    [Lenicka] You decided on the old, tried-and-true logo.  However, ingrained in the mind of our public is the DS, with its  "sunflower effect." Moreover, in the leadership of the party are  people who are too closely connected with Public Against  Violence [VPN], transformed into the Civic Democratic Union  [ODU], which perished because it was held in disfavor even by  voters with rightist views. Don't you think that certain  psychological barriers will again play a role?    [Hagyari] I do not know what barriers you have in mind  because Ivan Miklos is an economist par excellence. Today's DS  is not the DS that was marked by the sunflower effect. We have a  clear program of conservative democrats who place a clear  emphasis on economic reform, and we are oriented toward the  European Democratic Union [EDU]. We have completed our party  structures. We want to convince Slovakia--and do not be offended  now--that it is rightist, even though in the last election it  voted for the left.    [Lenicka] For the time being, Slovakia is not like that.  Why,  in your opinion, does it not believe in rightist values?    [Hagyari] It is a matter of personalities.    [Lenicka] Are you saying that the right has too few  personalities?    [Hagyari] Yes. In addition, it is unable to convince the  citizens. It is not the nation that is dumb and bad but the  politician who does not manage to address it. How we can address  it is another matter. We can go from door to door, which we are  doing, but the media are decisive. As long as television does  not give me enough time so that I can express my views in  comparison to others and have the citizen choose, I can hardly  become a personality. The media, and especially television, can  make a personality into a zero or a zero into a personality. We  often appear in private, local media, but, unfortunately,  television is providing us with too little time. We consider it  discrimination against the civic right wing in Slovakia. And it  would be a good thing if Slovakia had a balanced political  scene, which so far is overwhelmingly left-wing. We see that the  KDH, with all due respect to the KDH and the 70 percent of  Catholics, speaks only to one-tenth of them.    [Lenicka] ODU and the original DS left a debt of more than  2.5 million korunas. Are you going to settle it?    [Hagyari] I was never a member of ODU.    [Lenicka] But many of its people are members of your party.    [Hagyari] Ask Langos or Porubak about that....    [Lenicka] Not your deputy chairman at the time, Ivan Miklos?  He was not in ODU?    [Hagyari] He was, but I do not think he was the chairman....  We assumed the debt left by the old DS, and we are paying it  off. I see no reason to have anyone suffer a loss on anyone's  account.    [[Lenicka] Are you planning to borrow money for these  elections? Do you think there should be a limit on the amount  spent on campaigning?    [Hagyari] I will not borrow money. Limits are unnecessary  because there are many ways to get around such a law. A law that  has loopholes is useless.    [Lenicka] You already used one superlative--sense for  pragmatism--to praise yourself. Are there others? And what about  the weak points?    [Hagyari] I will not tell you about the weak points. I am  exactly the way the citizens of Slovakia are. I am not any  smarter, nor am I any dumber. I know exactly what bothers them.  I am no demigod, even if I think we have a program to solve  Slovakia's problems.    [Lenicka] You went into politics only recently. To do that,  you left a lucrative job--adviser on legal matters. Why?    [Hagyari] Yes, I gave up my work as a lawyer. It is because  everything I do I want to do well. I decided to give all of my  energy to returning the civic right to the parliament and  eventually to the government. Unfortunately, politics does not  have logic. You cannot always persuade people by logical  arguments. Since the 1992 elections, people have become much  worse off--there are no medicines, physicians receive minimum  wages, one must pay for schoolbooks in the schools, tuition will  be charged in institutions of higher learning, lunch programs  will be canceled.... When we realize that inflation is at 30  percent but pensions rose by only 6 percent, that privatization  was halted and when it was resumed it changed into a giveaway to  loyal subjects, etc., etc., therefore, when you look at any  area, the situation has deteriorated, and, in spite of that, a  certain movement's popularity is on the rise. I found out after  being in politics for several months that politics has no logic.  Few people can imagine what terribly hard work it is to build a  party with a solid structure, clear objectives, and orientation.</p>

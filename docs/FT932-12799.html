			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories sidestep debate on water THE possible privatisation of Scotland's water and sewage services will not be the subject of a separate debate at the Scottish Tories' annual conference next month, in spite of being one of the country's main political issues at present, None of the seven motions on water submitted by party associations has been chosen for debate and only one supports transferring the industry from regional councils, which currently run it, to the private sector. Two motions call for it to stay in public hands. The future of the water industry will instead be discussed in the debate on the reform of local government which begins the three-day conference in Edinburgh on May 12. Eight cabinet ministers, including Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, will attend the conference, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, will address the closing rally. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday he will announce his decision on the water industry and on the new shape of local government before parliament rises in July. Mr Lang confirmed yesterday that privatisation had proved to be the least popular option in the responses to the green paper. There have been suggestions that he is likely to propose a form of franchising.</p>

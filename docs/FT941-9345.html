			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Special tax adjustments lift Placer Pacific net Placer Pacific, the Australian mining group controlled by Canada's Placer Dome, yesterday reported record after-tax earnings of ADollars 110.3m (USDollars 79.1m) in the year to end-December. The group has a minority of its shares listed on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. The improved result, which compares with ADollars 74.9m the previous year, was entirely due to to special tax adjustments. Placer Pacific's operating profit before taxes and outside equity interests for the 12 months stood at ADollars 129.7m, compared with ADollars 154.2m last time. The company's revenues in the period fell from ADollars 623.5m (including a ADollars 6.7m special item) to ADollars 532.3m. Placer said this was partially due to the sale of a 5 per cent interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea to the PNG government. The sale reduced its interest in the mine to 25 per cent. Lower production at Porgera, and at the Misima mine, also in PNG, also dented revenues. This, however, was partly offset by higher production at the Kidston and Granny Smith mines in Australia. Placer said gold production from Placer-managed mines was 1.89m ounces, compared with 2.32m ounces in 1992, and ahead of early forecasts. The company's equity share of gold production was 829,064 ounces compared with 1.03m ounces in 1992. Although costs overall fell, the lower level of gold production meant cash cost per ounce rose from ADollars 227 to ADollars 252. Placer said it expected to increase 'significantly' its exploration budget for 1994, to fund expansion of its exploration programmes into Asia. Countries targeted include Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Myanmar.</p>

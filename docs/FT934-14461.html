			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kvaerner ahead in eight months KVAERNER, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in engineering, shipping and shipbuilding, yesterday reported a 3.7 per cent increase in eight-month pre-tax profits to NKr720m (Dollars 101m). It said profits for 1993 would match the level of profits in recent years. In 1992 the group posted a pre-tax profit of NKr932m and net profit of NKr729m. The eight-month result was helped by a 32.8 per cent increase in revenue to NKr15.9bn. Kvaerner said revenue included a NKr34m gain on ship sales but that the rise mainly reflected the acquisition last October of the Warnow shipyard in Germany. Operating profits were 29.5 per cent higher at NKr725m, but at the net level profits were slightly lower at NKr520m, against NKr532. Kvaerner was restricted by operating losses within the shipping division and by an unrealised exchange rate loss of NKr180m charged against accounts, related mainly to ship financing. Realised foreign currency gains dipped in the eight months to NKr129m from NKr138m. Group new orders totalled NKr18.4bn at the end of August, representing a 56 per cent increase over the comparative period. Among the group divisions, shipbuilding saw operating profit rise by NKr103m to NKr597m on sales up by NKr924m to NKr5.06bn. Oil and gas boosted operating profit by NKr124m to NKr266m as sales rose by NKr1.5bn to NKr4.9bn. Mechanical engineering operating losses were cut NKr40m to NKr122m. Shipping made an operating loss of NKr164m against a profit of NKr45m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Communist Party of Slovakia: Celebrations of </F> Slovak National Uprising Anniversary, Elections, and Politics"]    [Text] Zvolen--The 18 June meeting of the Communist Party  of Slovakia [KSS] Central Committee approved a proposal to hold  the communist celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Slovak  National Uprising on 20 August in Holic, in the presence of  representatives of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia.  The KSS Central Committee also approved the party's electoral  manifesto, the submitted KSS slate of candidates for the  parliamentary elections, and the election staff. KSS Chairman  V. Dado will be the Communists' main leader in the coming  elections. The meeting also dealt with cadre issues--M. Zozulak,  J. Sevc, and Anton Porubsky were elected KSS deputy  chairmen--and assessed some aspects of domestic and foreign  policy. The KSS Central Committee resolutely protests against  Zbigniew Brzezinski's call that nuclear weapons be used against  the DPRK if necessary. It regards Russia's pressure actions and  the U.S. efforts to impose an embargo as interference in the  internal affairs of a sovereign state.</p>

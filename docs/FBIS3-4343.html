A spokesman of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office today issued a statement on this matter, saying that soon  after Britain rented the "New Territories" by force with an  unequal treaty, it declared that all the lands in the new  territories belonged to the British Royal Family, thereby  peremptorily depriving the indigenous inhabitants of the New  Territories of land ownership. As this was unreasonable,  indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories rose up in  protest. A regulation adopted later requiring the indigenous  inhabitants to pay only nominal rent was the result of the  struggle of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories.  Therefore, it is imperative to protect the traditional  legitimate rights and interests of the New Territories  inhabitants. This has been written into the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law and it cannot be changed.    The spokesman said: Annex III of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration clearly provides that rural lands leased to  indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories "shall remain  unchanged so long as the property is held by that person or by  one of his lawful successors in the male line." The  interpretation given by the British side during the Sino-British  negotiations is that the only way to establish who are the  descendants of the indigenous inhabitants is to trace back their  ancestors through the male line. Children of a family  customarily use their father's last name, and it by no means  implies discrimination against women. We must, however, not  confuse these traditional rights and interests of the New  Territories indigenous inhabitants with discrimination against  women.    The spokesman emphasized: Our stand is that the concept of  "indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories" that is written  into the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic  Law should not be scrapped, nor should the legitimate rights and  interests of the aforementioned indigenous inhabitants won from  Britain as a result of their struggle be abandoned or nullified.  The spokesman said: It is only natural that the British Hong  Kong government, which endorsed the amendments to the  aforementioned bill without first consulting the indigenous  inhabitants of the New Territories, aroused intense discontent  among the indigenous inhabitants. He emphasized that the  British Hong Kong government must face up to the discontent of  the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, and  appropriately handle this matter by way of full consultations  with the indigenous inhabitants, and in accordance with the  provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law so as not to artificially  create social upheavals and division.</p>

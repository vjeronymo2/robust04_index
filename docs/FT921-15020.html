			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Observer: Close of play IBM's drive to become meaner and leaner is not confined to its marketing and research. The group's employees in Canada have just learned they are soon to lose one of those little perks that helped Big Blue to build its legendary reputation for cradle-to-grave paternalism. The 50-year-old IBM Country Club north of Toronto has been put up for sale. Once a buyer is found, it will be farewell to an 18-hole golf course, pro shop, bowling green, baseball diamond, soccer field, tennis courts, children's playground and even gardening plots which have helped to keep the IBM family together over the years. At present about 15,000 IBM workers and retired staff in Canada enjoy the subsidised amenities. According to chief executive Bill Etherington, the sale 'should send another clear signal that IBM Canada is determined to create a more competitive, aggressive company.' At the cost, perhaps, of having a bunch of grumpy, unfit employees.</p>

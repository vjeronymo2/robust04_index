Moreover, he  argued that with different situations in all localities, the  central authorities should grant local authorities more  flexibility on the question of handling the land tax given the  premise of resolutely enforcing decrees.    This morning, Li Ziliu delivered a speech as an NPC deputy  at  a meeting of the Guangdong delegation. He said the question of  collecting the land tax is still subject to great debate. He  maintained that if the question is handled improperly, it would  affect the mainland's economic development and dampen the  investment intentions of foreign businesses.    NPC Deputy Li Ziliu said: It would be best if the land tax  was postponed for two to three years to ensure the continuity of  the relevant policies. If the measure has to be implemented  immediately, then the current tax value ration should be  carefully considered. Since the land tax is a local tax  category, it is inadvisable to impose uniformity on all  localities in light of differences between them. The central  authorities should grant some flexibility to the localities so  they can handle different land tax values in a flexible way.    Moreover, Li Ziliu also talked about the pressures on  Guangzhou from large numbers of migrants. He said that the  migrant population in Guangzhou is estimated to reach more than  1.7 million, which is creating very great pressure on  Guangzhou's public order, employment, and other aspects. He  suggested that the State Council should set up population  management organizations to coordinate the number of migrants in  various localities.    Speaking on Guangzhou's future economic development, he held  that it is a policy mistake when a place cannot develop faster  when it is in a position to do so and should do so. He said  that Guangzhou is now open in all directions; should act boldly  with respect to capital, technology, and manpower; should boldly  "make concessions in regard to markets, shares, and interests";  and protect foreign investment.</p>

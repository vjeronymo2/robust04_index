			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These procedures are commonly performed with a variety of diagnoses found in MDC 5 such as disorders of the peripheral vascular system (diagnosis codes 747.60 and 747.69) and peripheral angiopathy (diagnosis code 443.81), as well as a number of heart conditions including malignant neoplasm of the heart (diagnosis code 164.1), and coxsackie carditis, coxsackie pericarditis, coxsackie endocarditis, and coxsackie myocarditis (diagnosis codes 074.20, 074.21, 074.22, 074.23, respectively). We note that these commonly performed diagnostic procedures are assigned to virtually every other MDC because they are associated with many diagnoses. Therefore, we propose to move these procedures to DRG 120.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We also note that hemangioma and anomalies of the peripheral vascular system may require open rectal biopsy (procedure code 48.25) or excision of the rectal lesion (procedure code 48.35) as part of their treatment. At the present time, neither of these procedure codes classify to MDC 5. Thus, we are proposing to move procedure codes 48.25 and 48.35 to DRG 120.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;MDC 6 (Diseases and Disorders of the Digestive System)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A total splenectomy (procedure code 41.5) may be performed on patients with a principal diagnosis of secondary malignant neoplasm of other digestive organs and spleen (diagnosis code 197.8). This diagnosis is included in MDC 6, but the procedure is not, resulting in the assignment of cases to DRG 468. Thus, we propose to add procedure code 41.5 to DRG 170 and 171 (Other Digestive System OR Procedures) in MDC 6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Reassignment of Procedures Among DRGs 468, 476, and 477. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We also reviewed the list of procedures that produce assignments to each of DRG 468, 476, and 477 to ascertain if any of those procedures should be moved to one of the other DRGs based on average charges and length of stay. Generally, we move only those procedures for which we have an adequate number of discharges to analyze the data. Based on our review this year, we are proposing to move a limited number of procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the list of OR procedures that produce DRG 468 assignments, we analyzed the average charge and length of stay data for cases assigned to that DRG to identify those procedures that are more similar to the discharges that currently group to either DRG 476 or 477. We identified three procedures that are significantly less resource intensive than the other procedures assigned to DRG 468. Therefore, we are proposing to move the following procedures to the list of procedures that result in assignment to DRG 477:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 24.5_Alveoloplasty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 53.61_Incisional hernia repair with prosthesis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 53.69_Repair of other hernia of anterior abdominal wall with prosthesis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We conducted a similar analysis of the procedures that assign cases to DRG 477 to determine if any of those procedures might more appropriately be classified to DRG 468. Again, we analyzed charge and length of stay data to identify procedures that were more similar to discharges assigned to DRG 468 than to those classified in DRG 477. We did not identify any procedures in DRG 477 that should be assigned to DRG 468.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the proposed reassignments of procedures in DRGs 468 and 477 would be effective with discharges beginning on or after October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Changes to the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Coding System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above in section II.B.1. of this preamble, the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM is a coding system that is used for the reporting of diagnoses and procedures performed on a patient. In September 1985, the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee was formed. This is a Federal interdepartmental committee charged with the mission of maintaining and updating the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM. That mission includes approving coding changes, and developing errata, addenda, and other modifications to the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM to reflect newly developed procedures and technologies and newly identified diseases. The Committee is also responsible for promoting the use of Federal and non-Federal educational programs and other communication techniques with a view toward standardizing coding applications and upgrading the quality of the classification system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee is co-chaired by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and HCFA. The NCHS has lead responsibility for the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM diagnosis codes included in Volume 1_Diseases: Tabular List and Volume 2_Diseases: Alphabetic Index, while HCFA has lead responsibility for the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM procedure codes included in Volume 3_Procedures: Tabular List and Alphabetic Index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee encourages participation in the above process by health-related organizations. In this regard, the Committee holds public meetings for discussion of educational issues and proposed coding changes. These meetings provide an opportunity for representatives of recognized organizations in the coding fields, such as the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) (formerly American Medical Record Association (AMRA)), the American Hospital Association (AHA), and various physician specialty groups as well as physicians, medical record administrators, health information management professionals, and other members of the public to contribute ideas on coding matters. After considering the opinions expressed at the public meetings and in writing, the Committee formulates recommendations, which then must be approved by the agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee presented proposals for coding changes at public meetings held on May 6, August 5, and December 2, 1993, and finalized the coding changes after consideration of comments received at the meetings and in writing within 30 days following the December 1993 meeting. The initial meeting for consideration of coding issues for implementation in FY 1996 will be held on May 5, 1994. Copies of the minutes of these meetings may be obtained by writing to one of the co-chairpersons representing NCHS and HCFA. We encourage commenters to address suggestions on coding issues involving diagnosis codes to: Sue Meads, Co-Chairperson; ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM Coordination and Maintenance Committee; NCHS; Rm. 9&hyph;58; 6525 Belcrest Road; Hyattsville, Maryland 20782.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the proposed NSPS allows compliance with a dioxin/furan limit either on a TEQ basis or on a total mass basis, procedures are being proposed for determining dioxin/furan emissions on a TEQ basis. For measuring dioxins/furans on a TEQ basis, the mass of each dioxin/furan tetra- through octa- congener would be measured by EPA Reference Method 23. Each congener mass would then be adjusted by the corresponding TEF's, which are listed in the proposed NSPS. Finally, the adjusted congener masses would be added together to determine dioxins/furans in terms of nanograms per dry standard cubic meter TEQ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by the 1991 subpart Ca emission guidelines, following the initial performance test for PM, HCl, and dioxins/furans, subsequent annual performance tests would be required for all MWC's to demonstrate compliance with the PM, HCl, and dioxin/furan emission limits. Under today's proposed emission guidelines, if three consecutive annual compliance tests for an MWC at a small MWC plant indicate compliance with the emission limit for a pollutant (i.e., PM, HCl, or dioxins/furans), the MWC would be allowed to wait 3 years before retesting for the pollutant. If the next test conducted in the third year shows compliance with the emission limit for that pollutant, then the facility could again wait 3 years to test for the pollutant. If noncompliance with the emission limit for the pollutant occurs, corrective actions would be required to be undertaken and annual testing would be required to be conducted until 3 consecutive years of compliance with the emission limit is established. At a minimum, performance tests for dioxins/furans, HCl, and PM would be required to be performed for each MWC at a small MWC plant every 3 years. This provision is included to minimize costs for small MWC plants, while still retaining periodic testing to ensure compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Testing and monitoring requirements are being proposed in today's emission guidelines for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Cd, Pb, and Hg emissions. The 1991 NSPS for MWC's includes performance testing and monitoring requirements for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . These testing and monitoring requirements are described in the NSPS promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488). These same testing and monitoring requirements would apply to MWC's only at large plants under today's proposed emission guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Cd, Pb, and Hg, annual performance tests would be required for MWC's subject to the proposed emission guidelines. The performance test for all three metals would be conducted in accordance with EPA Reference Method 29. The EPA Reference Method 1 would be used for determining the number and location of sampling points. The EPA Reference Method 3 would be used for flue gas analysis. All performance tests would consist of a minimum of three test runs conducted under representative operating conditions (i.e., at full load). The average Cd, Pb, and Hg emission rates of the three runs or more would be used to determine compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, as discussed above for dioxins/furans, PM, and HCl, if small plants demonstrate compliance with the Cd, Pb, and Hg emission limits for 3 consecutive years, they would be allowed to begin testing for these three pollutants every third year. At a minimum, performance tests for Cd, Pb, and Hg would be required to be performed by small MWC plants every 3 years. Large plants must test for each of these pollutants annually. These annual testing requirements are consistent with those for other pollutants, and MWC plants can reduce testing expenses by testing for multiple pollutants during the same test period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Studies conducted by the EPA have shown EPA Reference Method 29 to be a more reliable method for measuring Hg from MWC's than EPA Reference Method 101A. Recent refinements have been made to Method 101A, but the EPA has concluded that Method 29 is a superior method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a separate notice in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA Reference Method 29 is being proposed for determining emissions of Hg and other metals from MWC's, MWI's, and power plants. Method 29 consists of a particulate filter followed in series by two nitric acid/hydrogen peroxide (HNO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) impingers and two acidified potassium permangenate (KMnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) impingers. The method is identical to the EPA's Office of Solid Waste multimetals method, except that Method 29 requires filtration and analysis of the impinger solution collected in the KMnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  impingers. These filtration and analysis requirements are being added to the method for quality assurance purposes to protect against the loss of Hg in the manganese oxide (MnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) precipitate that can form in this solution. This additional step will result in similar sample preparation and analysis requirements for EPA Reference Methods 29 and 101A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA does not believe that addition of this filtration and analysis step will change the achievable Hg emission rates for MWC's and MWI's. Because of the significant amount of chlorine in MWC and MWI flue gas, most of the Hg in these flue gases occurs as water-soluble ionic Hg. As a result, use of Method 29 collects most of the Hg in these flue gases on the filter and in the HNO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  impingers, with the remainder collected in the KMnO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> /H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  impingers.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanislav Podvishenskiy, Marina Teslitskaya, and </F> Yelena Razgon, members of the Central Scientific-Research  Institute for Nonferrous Metallurgy Economics and Information:  "Priorities in Nonferrous Metallurgy"]    [Text] Moscow--Development of domestic nonferrous  metallurgy will be defined by the Federal Program of Technical  Modernization and Development of Russian Metallurgy. This will  require money. And a lot of it.    The share of capital investment in Russian nonferrous  metallurgy comprises about 4 percent of the total investment in  industry, while the proportional capital intensity of producing  a tonne of various metals fluctuates between 800,000 and 1.2  million rubles [R]. This is greater than the same value abroad,  because we use poorer raw materials, place enterprises in  undeveloped regions with difficult access, and so on. Besides,  nonferrous metallurgy (especially its ore base) also is a  high-inertia sector, where the investment cycle stretches up to  16 years (up to 10 years abroad).    The need to develop nonferrous metallurgy under the  extremely  difficult conditions of a transition to market relations assumes  the following investment policy priorities (see diagram)  [diagram not reproduced]:    --increasing investment in the development of the raw  material base, including greater investment in nonferrous  metallurgy reprocessing, since scrap and waste are important  components of the raw material balance;    --increasing the share of new construction in the total  volume of investment;    --increasing investment in the development of nonferrous  metallurgy in the Far North, Siberian, and Urals regions;    --stabilizing the share of investment (at the level of at  least 50 percent) for reconstruction and technical modernization  of nonferrous metallurgy enterprises, while at the same time  increasing the share of capital investment going into creating  competitive products and increasing the environmental safety of  production.    The chronic shortage of capital investment in the  development  of nonferrous metallurgy over the past 10 years and the  diminished share of investment into the raw material base (from  40-45 percent in the 1970's to 35 percent in the beginning of  1990's) have brought this base into a critical condition.  Development of new deposits is being delayed; anticipatory  construction has been sharply curtailed; construction in  progress has been suspended on number of objects.    Taking into account the raw material orientation of  nonferrous metallurgy, for which the strengthening of the ore  base is possible mainly through construction of new mining and  processing enterprises (frequently based on mineral deposits  located in sparsely populated areas of Siberia and the Far  East), the share of the raw material component in the total  investment must be increased to 45-50 percent. The Federal  Program of Development of the Raw Material Base for Nonferrous  Metallurgy for 1993-1995 envisaged investing R4.9 billion (in  1991 prices) in the development of priority objects of the ore  base.    The disintegration of the USSR, which has led to a  disruption  of production ties in nonferrous metallurgy, has created extreme  difficulties in keeping many Russian metallurgical enterprises  supplied with raw materials that were traditionally mined in  other republics of the former Union. This requires new  construction of not only mining but also of some metallurgical  capacities in order to organize production of items whose  manufacture in Russia had been limited.    Reconstruction and technical modernization of enterprises  along the entire production chain in nonferrous metallurgy and  reduction of ecological hazards of this production remain an  important direction of investment policy. The share of this part  in the total investment must be preserved at the level of 52  percent.    It is envisaged that the bulk of capital investment (more  than 70 percent) is to be used in the base raw material  subsectors--aluminum, copper, lead and zinc, and tungsten and  molybdenum. This reflects the existing ratios of industrial  construction and is necessitated both by the large scale of  these productions and by their high efficiency, as well as the  fact that these subsectors' enterprises (especially mining) are  located predominantly in regions that have difficult access and  are not well developed, and where capital intensity of  production is 2.5-3.5 times higher than that in the European  part of Russia.    Implementation of the measures envisaged by the draft  Federal  Program of Technical Modernization and Development of Russian  Metallurgy (1993-2000) will require capital investment in the  amount of R14.9518 billion (in 1991 prices) and $3.2052 billion  (see diagram) [diagram not reproduced].    It is envisaged that investment will come from enterprises  (stockholders), private capital, budget financing, and foreign  capital.    In carrying out the privatization program, capital from  issuing stock should become the main source of financing. A  potential volume of investment from this source is estimated at  the level of 30-33 percent of the total volume of investment in  1993-1995. In the future, as more nonferrous metallurgy  enterprises are denationalized, the share of stockholder capital  may increase to 60-70 percent.    The sphere that may attract private capital, which should  account for 3-5 percent, includes nonferrous metallurgy  reprocessing, certain metalworking productions, and development  of rich mineral deposits with insignificant content of ores.    Investment from attracting foreign investors money and  creating on this basis transnational-type companies is estimated  to account for 5 percent.    It should be emphasized that development of such a sector as  nonferrous metallurgy, which operates in objectively difficult  conditions necessitated by proximity to natural resources,  cannot and should not evolve without state protectionism--budget  financing. The share of state money in the investment in  nonferrous metallurgy development is envisaged at the level of  25-27 percent, which corresponds to foreign practices where  state subsidies comprise about 25 percent of the total  investment volume.    Implementation of measures envisaged in the federal program  will ensure a more balanced and effective development of  nonferrous metallurgy as a whole, liquidating disproportion  between the main segments of the production chain, progressive  changes in terms of enterprise location and product  nomenclature, less dependence on importing raw materials and  components, and increased effectiveness in export operations. It  is expected that annual savings by the year 2000 will amount to  more than R890 billion, including R270 billion from setting up  production that will replace imports, and about R60 billion from  increased effectiveness of imports. A return on capital  investment is expected in seven years.</p>

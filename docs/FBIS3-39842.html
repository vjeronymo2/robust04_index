On Friday, the bodies  of Rimmele's business partner Klaus Eichler (53) and the Czech  interpreter Alena Petrusheva (39) were recovered. The search for  Rudolf Wirschen (44), the pilot of the crashed plane, and Iveta  Ranetova (30), the Czech hotel manager, was continued yesterday  by the 70-member crew of the August Thienemann research ship  with the support of the Jago research submarine. By Sunday  afternoon, however, the search remained without any result.    Bundeswehr experts from Fuerstenfeldbruck performed  autopsies  on the two bodies at a hospital in Friedrichshafen, after Jago  used its grip arm on Friday to recover them from a depth of 160  meters. The experts stated that it was certain that the two  persons had drowned, and that they were also affected by the  cold.    Thus, the disaster can be reconstructed in the following  way:  The two-engine charter aircraft, which set off from Prague on 24  January, was forced to attempt an emergency landing on the water  -- for reasons that are still unclear -- immediately before  approaching the Swiss Altenrhein Airport (St. Gallen). Some 5  km from the lake shore, the wreckage floated on the surface for  a little while. The five persons on board the aircraft --  Rimmele's dog might have been on board as well -- survived the  crash, managed to undo their seat belts, and left the aircraft.  However, they could not rescue themselves from the ice-cold  waters of Lake Constance.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / People: Gonszor leaves PhilDrew: Wade moves on at Barclays Charles Gonszor has left PhilDrew Ventures to set up on his own. Gonszor joined PhilDrew Ventures in 1988, three years after the venture capital house was established by a team that left Prudential Ventures. Robert Jenkins, one of the six remaining partners at PhilDrew Ventures, said Gonszor left at the start of the month after a series of differences of opinion about the way the partnership should be run. Jenkins said none of the differences were about significant matters and there had been no differences of opinion with either Phillips and Drew Fund Management or UBS, the parent group. PhilDrew Ventures has been one of the more successful venture capital groups. It has raised over Pounds 250m and says its return on investments is more than 40 per cent.</p>

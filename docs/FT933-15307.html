			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / People: Shirai takes the wheel at Nissan Europe Japanese carmaker Nissan's European operations have a new man at the helm. He is Tadahiro Shirai, until recently the parent company's board director in charge of the marine division, as well as the industrial and textile machinery divisions. Shirai, a law graduate who joined Nissan in 1960, becomes president of Amsterdam-headquartered Nissan Europe in succession to Yoshikazu Kawana, who has been directing Nissan's affairs in the UK and on the Continent for the past four years. A keen golfer and music lover, Shirai also becomes chairman of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), the Sunderland-based car manufacturing subsidiary now on course towards making 270,000 cars a year. Additionally, he has been promoted to managing director of the board of directors of Nissan Motor Company in Japan. Kawana, who moved back to Japan last month, had been running Nissan Europe since it was set up in 1989 to integrate Nissan's various sales, design, development, manufacturing and distribution activities en route to becoming a significant production presence in Europe. During Kawana's tenure four European-produced vehicles have been launched - the UK-built Primera and Micra models, and the Spanish produced Serena multi-passenger vehicle and Terrano off-roader. Kawana himself has been promoted to executive managing director of Nissan Motor Company responsible for the overseas operations and parts groups.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Travel: Heavenly skiing in the very jaws of Hell - Skiing in the shadow of the Eiger, one of Europe's most lethal mountains THERE IS a magnificent off-piste run, the White Hare, which starts at the very base of one of the most terrible mountain faces in Europe - the fearsome North face of the Eiger. When I first skied it, I discovered to my horror that while I was cavorting in the powder, two Korean climbers were freezing to death somewhere on that awful slab of granite. They were the latest of many to perish on this monstrous wall. The Eiger and the quintessential Swiss alpine village of Grindelwald have always seemed bizarre neighbours. Separated only by the kind of meadows through which Shirley Temple once gambolled as Heidi, the mountain has always represented terror while the village oozed cuckoo-clock contentment. In a sense, to gaze at the Eiger from Grindelwald is to look at Hell from the portals of Heaven. In 1935 two German climbers, Max Sedlmayer and Karl Mehringer, studied the mountain with a mixture of fear and elation. They were the first men to try to scale its dreaded North face. On a quiet Sunday morning in August they froze to death on the upper rim of the third ice-field at 10,800 ft, a spot which came to be known as Death Bivouac. Less than a year later, Edi Rainer, Willy Angerer, Andreas Hinterstoisser and Toni Kurz were all killed retreating down the face. Kurz's death was particularly distressing. His would-be rescuers, arriving too late in the day on the ice-glazed face, had to leave him, with one arm already rigid with frostbite, another night hanging from a rope after getting near enough to hear him shout: 'I'm the only one alive. Hinterstoisser came off and fell the whole way down. The rope pulled Rainer up against a snap-link. He froze to death there. And Angerer's dead too, hanging below me, strangled by the rope when he fell.' The following day, a Herculean attempt by Kurz to climb down to Angerer's corpse and cut him free failed tragically at the last moment when he couldn't squeeze a knot through a snap-link. Kurz, all his energy drained, died there and then. Since the first successful conquest of the Eiger's ruthless North face in July 1938, dozens more climbers have died there. The Eiger has no mercy. If you make a mistake on this sheer and gigantic slab of rock that rises to 13,041 ft and dominates the Grindelwald skyline, you will be lucky to escape with your life. Whether you die or survive could depend on people like Ueli Frei, a 45-year-old mountain guide. Like so many real-life heroes, Ueli Frei comes across like an avuncular, unassuming sort of fellow. In the book The White Spider, which chronicles both the terrible and the triumphant attempts on the North face, Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian climber who was a member of the first successful assault on the North face, describes this rare breed thus: 'They were wiry, well-trained types, men with frank, wholesome faces. Not theirs the steely iron-hard features of legendary heroes, or of film-stars of a certain stamp. One would hardly have noticed them in the ordinary way.' Although Harrer was describing Sedlmayer and Mehringer, the first climbers to perish on the fearsome wall, his description fits many of these quiet mountain men, including Ueli Frei. Since joining the Swiss mountain rescue team in 1974, Frei has achieved several climbing firsts in the Jungfrau region - including the North face of the Gutzpfeiler, which is even steeper than the Eiger's North face - and played a key role in dozens of rescues, including no fewer than 12 on the Eiger wall. In many of them he has had to be winched on to the face by helicopter. In November 1977, after a Spanish climber had broken both his legs in an accident, severe storms delayed rescue by five days. By the time Frei and his fellow guide Edi Bohren were lowered on to the face, the injured climber had been on the mountain for 11 days. In 1984, Frei became head mountain guide for Powder Byrne, the British tour operator, and has run their powder courses ever since. Last year I joined one of his groups. Now the helicopter had become an instrument of skiing pleasure instead of a vehicle to deliver stricken climbers from pain. Our small group of five, a former army officer, Robert Williamson, and his wife Iona, and two jewellers, Nick Silver and Pippa Galpin, plus Ueli and myself, had a spectacular canvas of untracked, virginal snow on which to fashion our tracks: the beautiful mountains on the other side of the Eiger in the Bernese Oberland. Two of the classic descents - from Rosenegg, 11,972 ft, and the Sustenhorn, 11,490 ft, are reached by helicopter. Another - an exhilarating descent through the chillingly beautiful Fiescher glacier - can be reached via the Jungfraujoch, a shoulder of the Jungfrau at 11,329 ft from which Europe's longest glacier, the Aletschgletscher, meanders grandly into the distance. To reach the Jungfraujoch you take a truly remarkable journey on the Jungfraubahn, Europe's highest rack railway. On its way to the Jungfrau, the track curls its way into the Eiger, through the very North face on which so many climbers' nightmares and triumphs have materialised. The train stops at two halts hewn into the rock, and from these you can gaze out through gallery windows at the extraordinary climbers' eye-view of the lower half of the sheer face. It is an un-nerving feeling. From the higher station, the Eigerwand, rescuers can climb out through a door on to the mountain face. From the Jungfraujoch, there is some gentle skiing for half-an-hour down the Aletschgletscher before you reach the first major cross-roads of the glacier, the Konkordiaplatz. Here you fix nylon skins to your skis to enable you to climb without slipping backwards, and begin the 2 1/2 -hour slog up to the Grunhorlucke. From the summit, after an exhilarating descent through a massive snowfield, the Fieschergletscher, one of the most beautiful glaciers it is possible to ski through, beckons you into its maze of icy ridges, slabs, snow-bridges and crevasses. Without Ueli, you simply would not make it. Like a wily fox, he sniffs out a route. Sometimes the path he chooses looks like a dead end, or veers off in the opposite direction from the one you would expect. On one occasion we inched our way along a ridge with crevasses on both sides. It was difficult not to feel scared. Ueli grinned. He had seen it all before. Few skiers are privileged to visit this glacier. It could be on another planet. Yet the resorts of Grindelwald and Wengen, teeming with recreational skiers, are only a few miles away. As we glided this way and that, we finally exited from the icy maze and headed on across the snow scrublands of the Fieschertal valley. Finally the snow ran out, and we faced a gruelling but invigorating walk down to the pretty village of Fiesch, where there was just time for a cold beer at the railway station. Although we had skied in pretty much a straight line, the journey back took two train and two car rides to reach Grindelwald. The next day we did it the easy way, by helicopter. The gleaming machine clattered us deafeningly from Mannlichen up into the giddy and jagged world of mountain peaks interspersed with cliffs, columns, cols, cornices and crevasses, before setting us down at Rosenegg. The descent took us through steep, deep and virginal snowfields first. Even Ueli was grinning. 'Ski to my right,' he instructed us, 'and watch out for the wulperdings]' The wulperding is the local variety of the mythical 'snow snake' which lurks just below the surface, intent on tripping up powder-skiers who get too cocky. Later, as we reached the ice-fields, we had to be a lot more cautious. At one particularly awkward stage, where a fall would have sent us cascading down the ice across the glacier floor, Ueli roped us up and lowered us one by one to safety. We had skied for hours from one solitary helicopter lift. Every time we paused and looked back we were greeted by a stirring sight: five pairs of tracks meandering down a beautiful snowscape of craggy cliffs, slabs of ice the size of buildings and vast glacial valley floors. Perfect powder was giving way, now, to perfect spring snow, which is much sought-after and is rather like skiing on tiny glazed ball-bearings. We wanted to do the whole thing again, and with a helicopter it was a luxury we could indulge. The machine gave us a ringside seat as we re-traced our tracks in the powder, turn after turn, marvelling not so much at the satisfactory contours but at the complete isolation. Apart from our traces, signs of any other people were as rare as Yeti tracks. At the end of the day the smile on Ueli's weatherbeaten face was as broad as ours. A remarkable climber and skier, there is only one challenge that eludes him - the North face of the Eiger. 'The best time to climb the wall is during August, September and October,' he said. 'This is also the busiest time for the mountain rescue service. But I am still keen to do it one day.' Powder Byrne is at 50 Lombard Road, London SW11 3SU, tel: 071-223-0601. It offers four different off-piste courses, including an introductory course, depending on skier ability. Each is led by a Swiss mountain guide.</p>

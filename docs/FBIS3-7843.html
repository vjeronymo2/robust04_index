At  a news conference, he pointed out that the decision was final  and could not be subject to appeal.    The decision on granting the license to PolSat has aroused  much controversy. Among other things, there have been articles  in Warsaw daily newspapers containing references to the murky  past of the owner of this station, Zygmunt Solorz. Also,  President Walesa has voiced his doubts.    On Tuesday, when explaining his position with regard to the  controversy, Markiewicz said that, on the day when the decision  on the license for PolSat was made, he talked about this to the  president and Minister of State Mieczyslaw Wachowski. He said  that "the conversation with the president was unpleasant and an  accusation was made that the council had accepted a bribe."</p>

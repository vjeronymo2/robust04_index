BRIEFING;  </P> <P> REFUSED FARE BREAK, PAIR SUE  </P> <P> Two homosexual men filed suit against Continental Airlines because their  request for a frequent-flier companion ticket was rejected when they could not  produce a marriage certificate.  </P> <P> The suit was filed in U.S. District Court by Joseph Preis, 53, and Larry  Hiller, 50, both of Atlanta.  </P> <P> They claim they have lived together for 32 years, have joint bank accounts and  "each considers himself to be the spousal equivalent and family of the other."  </P> <P> The suit contends the men wanted to take a weeklong trip to London on Dec. 1,  1989, but Continental refused to issue a free companion ticket through its  One-Pass program.  </P> <P> Continental spokesman Dave Messing said the companion tickets "are for family  members only" and that couples who live together are excluded.  </P> <P> The two men didn't make the trip and are asking for at least $300,000 in  damages.  </P></p>

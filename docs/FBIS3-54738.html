			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the presidential </F> administration, by an unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given; from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] How do you see the first day of a  session of the new parliament? I understand that it is not a  rewarding business to make forecasts now, but still, as far as I  know, both voters and deputies expect the president to make a  speech during the first day of the session. Will this happen?    [Filatov] You know, deputies are calling for this. They  would like to start their work by meeting with the president, by  a presidential speech. Such a program is currently being  considered and prepared, though I am aware that Boris  Nikolayevich has the final say on that. He must make the final  decision on how to start cooperation with deputies.    That is the first thing. The second thing is that one should  be aware that people are tired of pointless discussions and  confrontations. One should understand that what people really  want is political stability in the country. The third thing  that gives inspiration is that despite what is being said about  the economic reform, or how much it is being blamed, its results  are obvious. No one can deny this. Both the government and  experts have predicted that 1994 might be a crucial year, and  this also yields a certain optimism.    If one were asked what year one would have liked to see come  in, I would have said 1945. It seems to me that there is  something deeply philosophical and humane in this. Hopes of  victory, hopes of stability, hopes of peace, and hopes of calm  -- it seems to me that there is very profound sense in all of  this. I would like to live to see all this, and I think that if  everyone understood that, and in particular those who will play  a significant role in deciding the country's future, it would be  a significant contribution to the country's development and to  the process of stabilization.</p>

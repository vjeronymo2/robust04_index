			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / BCCI creditors lose appeal A GROUP of creditors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday failed in its challenge to the compensation package negotiated between the liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. The group's appeal against the High Court's approval of the measures was rejected by the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Dillon said that Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor who had approved the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 880m) compensation package last month, was entitled not to follow the wishes of the creditors' committee. The committee, which had regarded the package as inadequate, had urged further talks with Abu Dhabi. The committee itself had decided not to appeal because of the cost. The appeal was taken over by a group of individual creditors, led by Dr Adil Elias, chairman of the BCCI Depositors Protection Association. The group was ordered yesterday to pay its own costs and those of Touche Ross, the liquidators - estimated at more than Pounds 100,000. It was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. Lord Justice Dillon said the agreement represented the best terms the liquidators had been able to achieve with the majority shareholders. It would be impractical to convene creditors' meetings for further consideration of the proposals. Mr David Hunt QC, for the group, had argued that the vice-chancellor had wrongly substituted his own commercial judgment for that of the creditors.</p>

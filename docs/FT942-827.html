			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Plans for telecoms infrastructure gather pace A rapid acceleration of plans to liberalise the supply of telecommunications infrastructure across the European Union is likely following the Corfu summit. A consultative document could be published as soon as this August setting a firm timetable for liberalisation, despite continued opposition from national telecoms operators fighting the loss of their monopolies. At Corfu the heads of government gave broad support to the recommendations of the Bangemann group of industry leaders, which called for speedy liberalisation of EU telecoms infrastructures and services. Mobile, satellite and other business-related services are already open to competition. Union governments agreed last year to set a target date of 1998 for the opening to competition of basic 'voice' services, which account for most of the revenue of the telecoms operators. However, the question of competing infrastructure, as permitted in the UK, was left for decision in 1995 with no prior commitment to liberalisation. The Bangemann group's objectives - to bring forward the decision and secure a commitment to infrastructure competition - were endorsed by the heads of government. A senior commission official said: 'To follow up the recommendations of the Bangemann group, there is a need for something shorter and punchier in addition to the green paper. We need a target date for infrastructure liberalisation.' The most favoured date appears to be 1998, to coincide with the liberalisation of telecoms services. However, senior officials in the Commission's telecoms directorate want to see immediate competition for infrastructure to supply services - such as private corporate networks  - already open to competition. Given the proximity of January 1998, they believe that such a move would encourage new operators to build infrastructure immediately capable of extension or adaptation as competition is extended to public 'voice' services. They are attracted to the competitive potential of radio and microwave technology and existing cable television networks. The extent of cable networks varies widely across the EU, but the conversion of cable systems could bring early nationwide competition in Germany, Ireland and the Benelux states. National operators in France, Italy and Germany believe the process towards liberalisation is moving too fast. Consultations on the mobile telecoms green paper in Brussels earlier this month attracted opposition from France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and Stet, the Italian state company, to the pace of planned liberalisation. The companies asked the Commission to wait until it published plans for infrastructure liberalisation across the industry. 'Their objections just amount to more prevaricating,' said the Commission official. Backing Brussels' move to push forward decisively with liberalisation, EU heads of government agreed that member states should create a new ministerial post to co-ordinate all aspects of telecoms development: political, financial and regulatory. The summit also agreed that that the Commission should establish a regulatory framework, concerned with access to markets, compatibility between networks, intellectual property rights, data protection and copyright.</p>

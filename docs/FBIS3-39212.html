			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Brussels, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Bulgaria joined NATO's  Partnership for Peace [PFP] on Monday [14 February], with  President Zhelyu Zhelev expressing hope that the Atlantic  alliance can persuade Russia to seal closer security ties with  the rest of Europe.    Zhelev said he hoped adherence to the Partnership, the  U.S.-led NATO intitiative to strengthen military cooperation  with East European countries, would eventually lead to Bulgaria  becoming a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    In a speech at NATO headquarters here Zhelev stressed that  "Bulgaria's arguments in favour of participation in NATO contain  no elements whatever which might be seen as directed against  Russia."    "On the contrary, we support the democratic and  reform-minded  forces in Russia and sincerely wish them success."    In reference to the resurgence of Russian ultranationalism  fronted by extremist deputy and demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovskiy,  Zhelev said he hoped NATO "will be in a position to find  adequate ways and means of involving Russia in European security  while keeping at bay the imperialist ambitions cherished by  aspiring dictators."    Bulgaria became the eighth East European country to join the  Partnership, with Latvia due to become the ninth later Monday.    Evoking the Bosnian war Zhelev added: "The conflicts on our  doorstep are an immediate challenge to our national  security...laying an unbearable burden on our reforming economy"  in fallout from the United Nations sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro.

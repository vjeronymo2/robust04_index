			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UN and Nato in struggle over Bosnia The UN has in effect recaptured from Nato the main diplomatic initiative over the Bosnian conflict, in a fresh setback for the prestige of the Atlantic alliance. The pivotal role of the UN was illustrated yesterday by the mediation efforts of General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, and a comment from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, that he was in touch with all the warring parties. Shrugging some off some harsh criticism from Bosnia's Moslem-led government, the British general yesterday took advantage of the apparent exhaustion - albeit temporary - of both parties in the Bihac enclave to broke a ceasefire. The visibility of the British UN commander pointed to a renewed emphasis on pragmatic, ad hoc mediation efforts - which avoid passing judgment on the parties - and a setback for the interventionist philosophy which the US has urged on its Nato partners. Amid confused reports of Nato aerial activity over Bihac last night, it seemed clear that the UN was sticking to insistence on making only the most sparing use of of air power. Nato ambassadors failed on Thursday to reach agreement on a US plan for demilitarising the Bihac area, and they said they were referring the proposal to the UN for further elaboration. There was little sign, however, of that elaboration taking place yesterday because the problem raised by France over the US proposal - the lack of ground troops to oversee demilitarisation - seems a virtually insoluble one. It was becoming clearer that the US hopes of a Nato imprimatur for firm intervention in the conflict, with tough use of air power to shore up the military fortunes of the Bosnian government, have been dashed. State Department deputy spokeswoman Christine Shelly said last night the ceasefire was not holding in Bihac, but said Nato should not be blamed for the failure. 'Nato is not an independent player in Bosnia. It's there in support of the UN.' Mr Willy Claes, the new secretary-general of Nato, acknowledged yesterday that he was disappointed by the allies' failure to agree. 'They should have been able to push further,' he said. Yesterday's developments were only the latest in a series of setbacks to the prestige of Nato's political machinery. In theory, the US should always find it easier to win approval for its policies in Nato - where it is by far the biggest military power - than in the UN, a where it has to contend with the influence of Russia and China. But last week, as air attacks from Serb-held Croatia brought the Bihac crisis to a head, US diplomacy appeared to be homing in more strongly on the UN, where the Security Council passed an emergency resolution late last Saturday. US officials are understood to have had some frank discussions with Mr Boutros Ghali about the need for tougher action in Bosnia. Recent electoral victories by US Republicans have increased pressure for an outright lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia - something that would almost certainly make the UN's continued presence in the republic untenable and force a humiliating withdrawal. Mr Boutros Ghali is believed to be well aware of that consideration as he formulates policy towards Bosnia and tries to head off the danger that peace-keeping in former Yugoslavia will end in the same humiliating way as the UN mission to Somalia. Yet the secretary general has other factors to take into account, including the delicacy of the situation on the ground, and the impossibility of intervening with air strikes in hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

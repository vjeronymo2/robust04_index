			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Boardrooms back strong links with Europe IF BRITAIN'S biggest companies had a vote in the Commons tonight, the endorsement of Mr John Major's pro-Maastricht motion would be beyond question. Although some of them have reservations about aspects of the treaty and look to the Edinburgh summit for clarification, any doubts are overcome by what is seen as the need for Britain to be in the mainstream of European political and economic development. Judging by the reaction of more than 50 of Britain's largest corporations, the blueprint for continuing development enshrined in the Maastricht treaty is not a cause for wild enthusiasm. But the consequences of being left on the sidelines are considered too bleak to contemplate. Many companies also believe that, whatever the difficulties, a Britain at the heart of Europe has a better chance of resolving them. Few businessmen share the apparent disinterest of Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive of Rank Organisation. He said he had not read the treaty and had no view on it, adding: 'I have no view about what they do in the Commons. I just get on with minding the store, if you don't mind.' Elsewhere, there may be confusion over the full implications of a treaty on which Mr John Major is staking so much but there is a recognition that the outcome of the debate will have a profound impact on Britain's prospects. Its ability to continue to act as a bridgehead for investment by non-EC companies operating in Europe is a particular source of concern. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, said that a 'stand-aside' Britain would risk losing its excellent record on inward investment. His view was shared by Mr Clive Thompson, group chief executive of Rentokil. He said: 'Inward investment, particularly by the Japanese, would not be nearly so attractive if Britain was seen to be dragging its feet over Maastricht.' Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive of RTZ Corporation, said it was important to protect the UK's role as a magnet for inward investment. An anti-Maastricht vote would damage that reputation. Many companies also emphasise that the successful operation of the single market and of the subsequent initiatives contained in the treaty Maastricht are indivisible. The idea that Britain could continue as a successful trading partner while remaining outside the later stages of political and monetary union is widely dismissed. BAT Industries, the financial-services-to-tobacco group, said Britain would encounter serious difficulties in the single market if it failed to ratify the treaty. The company said: 'The treaty is a vital part of completing the single market. A single currency is the glue that will keep the single market together.' Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman of Pilkington, said Britain's industrial and commercial future demanded a Yes vote. 'Within the treaty, we can begin to address some of the problems resulting from uneven enforcement of directives and the occasionally erratic approach of the commission,' he said. Cadbury Schweppes said the completion of the single market was the most important aspect of EC development, but the Maastricht treaty had to be ratified if Britain was to extract maximum benefit from that market. One dissenting voice came from Willis Corroon, the insurance group, which backed full British participation in a common market but said that failure to back the Maastricht treaty would not necessarily lead to isolation from the rest of Europe. The company said that there was 'probably more than one way of going about' continuing to develop the EC. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, said a vote against the government would help to leave Britain 'isolated within Europe on an unknown course' which would harm its trading prospects. That view was echoed by Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames Water, which has ambitions to expand in Europe. He said: 'Not everything in Maastricht is ideal, but we do not want the country or our company to be isolated from the rest of the community.' Mr Richard Everitt, a director of BAA, the airports operator, said that if Maastricht was a code word for the UK playing a leading role in Europe, it had to be supported. He said: 'The vote is really on the role that Britain should play in Europe. Should we be in the centre of things or should we be sitting on the sidelines? We think it is very important that we are at the centre.' Additional reporting by Michiyo Nakamoto, Cathy Milton, John Griffiths, Philip Rawstorne, Richard Evans and Richard Donkin.</p>

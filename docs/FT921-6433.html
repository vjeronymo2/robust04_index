			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Commercial Union No doubt it is unintentional, but CU seems to have perfected the art of embarrassing its rivals. A year ago the company's wafer thin profits stood out in a sea of red ink. Yesterday it was the dividend announcement - a 3 per cent increase in spite of nearly Pounds 70m of pre-tax losses for 1991 - which looks likely to distinguish CU from the pack once the latest reporting season is over. Given that CU shares underperformed the market by 20 per cent in the last 12 months, the real question for investors is not so much the company's relative position as the prospects for the whole sector. Nothing that CU said yesterday, however, encourages the view that the much anticipated re-rating of the composites is at hand, which is why expectations that the CU's losses can be kept to a relatively respectable Pounds 40m in 1992 are arguably of little comfort. The outlook for non-life insurance markets remains spotty: improving in the UK on the personal side, to be sure, but little sign of any hardening of commercial rates or of recovery in the London market. Motor claims at CU rose a remarkably modest 2.4 per cent in 1991, but theft and arson remain a nightmare for the whole industry. The plus points about CU are its solid management and the absence of exposure to big unknowns like mortgage guarantee losses and the direction of the US dollar. But while its weak balance sheet kept the company out of mischief in the late 1980s while others lost their heads, the lack of significant financial muscle can now be seen as a handicap. A solvency margin estimated as in the low 40s might be envied elsewhere - but it provides little scope to chase market share or turn acquisitive. CU may want none of this - but the opportunities are there as better capitalised continental companies have proved.</p>

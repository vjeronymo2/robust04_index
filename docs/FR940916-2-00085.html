Bodian (Licensee or Dr. Bodian) was the holder of NRC License No. 29&hyph;12417&hyph;01 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35 on September 11, 1967 and last renewed in its entirety on August 20, 1990. The License authorized the Licensee to possess and use iodine-131 as iodide for uptake studies, thyroid imaging, and the treatment of hypothyroidism and cardiac disfunction. The License was due to expire on August 30, 1995; however on January 25, 1993, the Licensee requested that the License be terminated. The NRC granted this request for termination, and Amendment No. 07 was issued to the Licensee on September 27, 1993, terminating the License. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 6, 1992, an NRC inspection was conducted at the Licensee's facility in Englewood, New Jersey. During the inspection, the NRC identified several violations of NRC requirements, including the failure to possess and use a dose calibrator to assay therapeutic doses of iodine-131 prior to administration to patients. Also during the inspection, Dr. Bodian told the inspector that he took doses of iodine-131 to Englewood Hospital for calibration. During a telephone conversation with Region I staff on April 7, 1992, Dr. Bodian stated that: (1) although he did not possess a dose calibrator, he had a technologist at Englewood Hospital perform the dose measurements for almost all patients he had treated; (2) all measurements of doses were within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  10 percent of the prescribed dose; and (3) the results of these measurements were recorded in the patient charts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shortly after the inspection, the NRC issued a Confirmatory Action Letter to the Licensee on April 9, 1992, which confirmed, in part, the Licensee's agreement to terminate patient treatments with any radiopharmaceutical authorized by the NRC until such time as the Licensee established, and submitted to the NRC for approval, a program that included all of the required equipment and procedures required by 10 CFR Part 35. Such a program was not established and patient treatment has not resumed. The NRC Office of Investigations initiated an investigation on May 22, 1992. Dr. Bodian requested, in a letter dated January 25, 1993, that the License be terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of Dr. Bodian's willful failure to adhere to NRC requirements, as well as the apparently willful failure to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC, thereby endangering patients to whom the doses were administered, the NRC needed certain information to determine whether there existed reasonable assurance that Dr. Bodian's activities conducted under other NRC licenses would be performed safely and in accordance with requirements. Accordingly, a Demand for Information (DFI) was issued to Dr. Bodian on June 24, 1993, that requested him to list all NRC licenses on which he was then listed as an authorized user, and to explain why the NRC should not issue an order to preclude him from any involvement in licensed activities in the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

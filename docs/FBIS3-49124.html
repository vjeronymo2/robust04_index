Kozlik took part in negotiations today with the German  ambassador to Slovakia, Heike Zenker, on the completion of  construction work in Mochovce and its financing. The key  issues, in his opinion, concern the repayment of German loans  through supplies of nuclear energy to Germany and the closing of  the nuclear power plant in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia, on  which the realization of the project is conditional. Kozlik  said that clear economic calculations are necessary if Slovakia  is to prove she can be depended on to repay her loans. A total  of 1.5 billion DEM [German marks] in foreign loans is to be  provided for the construction of the nuclear power plant in  Mochovce.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese and Japanese  agricultural experts today gathered at a seminar in Beijing to  probe into the prospects of the two countries' agricultural  development.    The co-sponsored symposium covered subjects including  sustained agricultural growth, the development of the rural  workforce, China's strategy on agro-science and technologies,  Sino-Japanese agricultural trade, global grain supply and demand  in the 21st century and world environment and resources.    Lu Liangshu, director of the China Agriculture Society, said  that the seminar was of great value for the two governments in  macro policy-making, as well as in bolstering China's efforts to  develop high-yield, good-quality and highly-efficient  agriculture and for promoting sustained growth of Japan's  agriculture.    Deputy director of the society Xiang Chongyang said that  agriculture is the basis for China's economic progress, social  stability and national self-independence.    Xiang, who is a former vice-minister in agriculture, noted  that the Chinese Government has always attached great importance  to agriculture and has always put agriculture in the first place  of all economic work, adding that agriculture will maintain its  position in the national economy in the next century.    He cited that one of China's agricultural development  objectives is that by the year 2000 the country will be able to  produce 500 million tons of grain and 5.25 million tons of  cotton, the per capita net income for farmers will reach 1,200  yuan and the food shortages in poverty-ridden rural areas can be  resolved.    The symposium is expected to play a very positive role in  promoting Sino-Japanese agricultural cooperation and  agro-produce trade, Xiang said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 4 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe  on Wednesday [4 May] rejected any question of striking a deal  for the release of 11 French aid workers detained by Serbs in  Bosnia for allegedly smuggling arms to Moslem forces.    Juppe said there was "no question of engaging in bargaining  of any kind" over the workers for the relief agency Premiere  Urgence (First Emergency) and he demanded their "immediate and  unconditional release."    The workers were imprisoned in a Serb barracks at Lukavica,  a  suburb of Sarajevo, on April 8 after their aid convoy was  intercepted and Serb troops allegedly found weapons in one of  the trucks.    The 11 were accused of trafficking arms to the Moslem-led  Bosnian government army and on Monday, three were indicted for  arms trafficking.    Premiere Urgence said Tuesday that the three were to appear  before a Bosnian Serb tribunal on May 8 and could face the death  penalty or up to 20 years imprisonment.    The organization said the weapons were planted on the truck  by the Serbs themselves.    Juppe, speaking to the National Assembly, said he had had  confirmed rumours of what he called a "pseudo-trial by Bosnian  Serb forces who are completely out of control. If this is the  case, we will not accept this parody of justice," he said.    The Bosnian Serbs first proposed swapping the aid workers  for  11 Serb doctors and nurses held in Sarajevo by the Moslems.    Juppe said he would be seeking the support of other Western  leaders, and in particular of Russia via its Foreign Minister  Andrei Kozyrev, with whom he discussed the case last week.    Juppe was due to meet the head of Premiere Urgence, Thierry  Mauricet, later Wednesday.    Premiere Urgence, which has been active in Bosnia  transporting food parcels to Sarajevo with the agreement of the  UN High Commissioner for Refugees, will send lawyers and  observers from Amnesty International and the International  Federation of Human Rights to the trial, in the Bosnian Serb  capital of Pale.</p>

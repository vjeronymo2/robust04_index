			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  and Assembly President Miro Lazovic held a news conference today  upon their return from Geneva.    The Geneva negotiations and the withdrawal of the  aggressor's  artillery from around Sarajevo were the main focus. We have  just received Mladen Bosnjak's report:    [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] Mr. Silajdzic, what were the  results of your talks with [Croatian Foreign Minister Mate]  Granic? Mr. Lazovic, how was the proposal on the three-way or  four- way organization of the authorities and territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina--made by the Bosnian Croat  convention--received in Geneva?    [Silajdzic] I think we held four meetings with Mr. Granic.  We agreed, first, that military commanders should meet and try  to put into effect a total cease-fire. We also agreed that both  sides completely supported a project entitled All Return Home.  That means creating conditions for everyone to return home, for  everyone who has been expelled to be able to go back home. I  think that we owe such an approach to our era and to this  civilization. I am pleased that the Croatian delegation  accepted such an approach.    We also agreed that the talks should be intensified and  should resume.    [Lazovic] I can say the proposal by the Bosnian Croat  convention--which had been accepted by the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly--was received with real interest in Geneva.    That was the first time that Bosnian Croats appeared before  the international public with a policy completely different from  that of Zagreb. The delegation of the Bosnian Croat convention  clearly said at a news conference that they represented  two-thirds of the Bosnian Croats and that they denied the right  of legitimacy to Akmadzic and others who are really entitled  only to represent western Herzegovina.    This is a complete novelty in the policy of the Bosnian  Croats. I am convinced that the official policy of the Republic  of Croatia will have to take this into consideration in the  upcoming period. It is interesting that even the representatives  of the so-called Srpska republic listened to the proposal with a  certain degree of interest. If the activities of the Bosnian  Croats achieve satisfactory results in the coming period,  particularly in the international arena, I believe that a change  could be brought about that is favorable to the overall  Bosnia-Herzegovina policy.

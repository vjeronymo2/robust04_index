			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by FAZHI RIBAO Correspondent Sun Chunying (1327 </F> 2504 5391), RENMIN GONGAN BAO Reporter Li Bingtian (2621 3521  1131), and RENMIN GONGAN BAO Correspondent Sun Baoye (1327 1405  0673): "Ten Years of Combat Readiness -- A Look at China-Burma  Border Defense Work"]    [Excerpts] Peaceful Border Not So Tranquil    Historically, the Chinese-Burma border has been a peaceful  and friendly boundary, the border peoples of both country  intermarrying and going to market in both countries, and traders  travelling back and forth. Following founding of new China,  Premier Zhou Enlai visited Burma in 1961. In 1962, the two  countries redemarcated the border, thereby laying a foundation  for further development of friendly relations between the two  countries.    The Yunnan section of the Sino-Burmese border runs for more  than 1,900 kilometers without natural obstacles. The border line  zigzags, border peoples living on both sides of it. In response  to reform and opening to the outside world, and for effective  maintenance of border security, the Yunnan border defense  headquarters has decontrolled all that should be decontrolled,  and controls what should be controlled.    On the Burma side of the Sino-Burmese border, the situation  is complex. Numerous political forces co-exist, and they  frequently fight with each other.    In November 1992, warfare broke out on the other side of the  Sino-Burmese border. The Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters  received an urgent report from the Lincang Border Defense  Detachment. The border Defense Headquarters took immediate  action, organizing forces to control the border situation. It  captured the weapons of Burmese personnel who had entered  Chinese territory, helped settle Burmese refugees, and  maintained China's national honor.    During this military incident, more than 20,000 Burmese  border people surged into Chinese territory. More than 1,000  armed personnel of local nationality from across the border also  fled into Chinese territory when they were defeated, carrying  large amounts of firearms and ammunition with them. China's  border defense units disarmed the more than 1,000 Burmese  personnel who had entered Chinese territory following their  defeat. All in all, border defense units confiscated 36 guns,  1,085 shells, 1,003 small arms of all kinds, 194 cartridge cases  containing more than 30,000 rounds, and 2,987 hand grenades. In  addition, border defense troops sent out search detachments  every day to search for weapons and ammunition that the Burmese  personnel had dispersed in key sections of the border, and urged  the return of more than 20,000 refugees who had entered Chinese  territory.    Acting on instructions from higher authority, the border  defense headquarters intervened actively in Burma, sternly  pointing out that this conduct was an infringement of China's  sovereignty, and explaining China's attitude about the  maintenance of territorial sovereignty and the restoration of  border order, forcing the other side to make an apology to us.  The disarmed Burmese personnel and their families were safely  sent back across the border.    In order to maintain national sovereignty and honor, and to  ensure border stability, the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters  strengthened patrols and guards on the national boundary. It  immediately halted illegal entry into and exit from China, and  it cracked down on all criminal elements who violated the law.    With the intensification of reform and opening to the  outside  world, large numbers of traders from outside China have surged  into this area, and the number of border people traveling back  and forth has increased. Some border people trading post  formerly located in villages far away from the frontier line  have been moved to the national frontier, and the number of  people entering and leaving through Chinese border exit and  entry points has risen greatly. Some illegal elements who noted  the complexity of the terrain along the China-Burma frontier  also tried to sneak out of the country here to escape  crackdowns. In order to maintain the prosperity of the border  region and crack down on criminals, the Yunnan Border Defense  Headquarters increased friendly cooperation with Union of Burma  police organizations. Both sides held many discussions about  joint crackdowns on criminal offenses, and the handling of  border security issues.    One bureau level cadre in Yunnan used his official position  to turn over to his son more than 3 million yuan of public funds  to go into business. Surprisingly, not only did this  spendthrift's business fail, but he also used the public funds  for eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. Later on, he  escaped to Burma with the funds remaining. The Dehong Dai-Jingpo  Autonomous Prefecture Border Defense Detachment provided the  Burmese with this person's physical description, photograph, and  hiding place. Very soon, the Burmese police returned this person  to our border authorities, both father and son falling into our  legal dragnet.    Through conversations, our border authorities also succeeded  in obtaining the extradition from Burma of intelligence peddlers  who had left China and were planning to sell Chinese military  intelligence, thereby preventing a major disclosure of state  secrets. Guo Tianming, the commander of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo  Autonomous Prefecture Border Defense Detachment, said that "in  order to escape a crackdown, some criminal elements in China  devise means to sneak out of the country. The Dehong Border  Detachment has succeeded in obtaining the extradition from Burma  of several economic swindlers and criminals who escaped from  China carrying public funds."  <H5>  Strong Contingent Receives a Rousing Welcome </H5>   A large tree farm stands in the Yunnan border region where  Wenshan and Honghe prefectures meet. One fall, a gang of  criminals banded together to fell this government timber using  armed force. They drove away the local forestry bureau personnel  and work came to a standstill. Slogans reading "Smash the  Forestry Bureau" appeared here and there. Each day more than 30  large trucks, each truck carrying more than 20 scoundrels,  forcibly entered the tree farm to haul away timber in a display  of swollen arrogance. At the time, the looting of state property  and the destruction of state facilities also occurred elsewhere  throughout the country. Consequently, the armed felling of  timber in a state tree park in Yunnan gained the serious  attention of State Council leaders who directed that Yunnan  resolve this distant incident with all possible speed. After  studying the problem, the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee and  provincial government ordered the Yunnan Border Defense  Headquarters to send troops within 24 hours to designated sites.  The Border Defense Headquarters urgently wired orders to the  Wenshan and Honghe border detachments to deploy 300 crack troops  along a line. At the same time, it ordered the Wenshan, Honghe  and nearby border detachments on full combat alert.    The commander of the Border Defense Headquarters who was the  deputy commander in charge of this action, Zhou Rupeng, and the  officers and men of the Wenshan and Honghe detachments moved  upon receipt of the first alert. Nineteen hours later, blockades  were in place at all entrances into the forest area, and six  guard units began to publicize policy and the law at their guard  locations. Within three hours, they successfully controlled all  vehicle entry into the forest area, and brought to justice the  marauding criminals. The lunar New Year was fast approaching,  but border defense officers and men worked together with  forestry bureau comrades and forestry public security cadres and  policy to rectify public order in the forest area. Zhou Rupeng  and more than 300 border defense officers and men spent that  lunar New Year in the forest area. Provincial CPC committee  secretary, Pu Chaozhu, personally drafted a congratulatory  telegram to comfort the border defense officers and men.  Provincial CPC committee and provincial government leaders  praised the border defense headquarters as a reliable, useful,  mobile, and superb corps.    During July and August 1992, the Yunnan Border Defense  Headquarters received orders to take part in a "tough crackdown"  campaign in Pingyuan Prefecture, and it was responsible for an  attack mission in combat. In order to reduce casualties, the  headquarters made military deployments and conducted special  combat preparedness training. Before dawn on 31 August, 20 small  combat teams made up of border defense officers and men and  public security cadres and police, led by border defense  officers and men who were familiar with the terrain, entered  designated areas under cover of darkness. At exactly 6:00 a.m.,  when a red signal flare went up, the 20 small teams  simultaneously fell upon criminal elements rounding up a whole  gang of criminals in one fell swoop.    The Pingyuan street campaign had been fought very well, only  three of the officers and men of the border defense units  suffering injuries, and no one killed. [passage omitted]    Virtually everyone knows that the Sino-Burmese border  adjoins  the world-renowned drug producing area, the "golden triangle."  International narcotics peddlers use countless schemes to open a  "China channel." Gun running and narcotic selling flow from the  same source, causing a precipitous increase in the dangerousness  of drug seizures. Trafficking in 50 grams of heroin is a crime  punishable by death. In order to protect their lives and make a  profit, drug peddlers may open fire and put up strong  resistance. In 1993, Yunnan border defense troops fought 24  battles with armed drug peddling gangs, winning every time and  delivering savage blows to the swollen arrogance of the drug  peddling gangs. On one occasion, Gao Guanglun, the headquarters  commander, personally led officers and men on the investigation  of a drug smuggling case. They fought skirmishes with the  criminals for more than a month, finally rounding up in one fell  swoop the criminals from outside China. They captured 11  criminals and seized 30,000 grams of heroin, and HK$1.5 million  and more than 400,000 renminbi in drug money.    In 1993, the Yunnan Border Defense Headquarters seized more  than 755 kilograms of heroin and more than 743 kilograms of  opium. It also captured more than 1560 army rifles, more than  40,000 rounds of rifle ammunition, and nearly 4,000 hand  grenades. In addition it confiscated more than 16,000  pornographic recordings and pictures. It also seized some  smuggled gold, platinum and precious stones. It freed more than  100 women who had been kidnapped for sale abroad, and it tracked  down and arrested more than 3,400 people involved in 500 cases  of flight.    Deep Feelings Dissolved in Ruili Jiang    Reform and opening to the outside world brought  unprecedented affluence to the vicinity of the border cities of  Mangshi, Wanding, and Ruili. One high building after another has  been built, shops and guest houses abound, and there is a  dazzling array of goods. On the streets, a tide of people  surges, and traffic is heavy.    "We control the border through a combination of manning  particular points, setting up lines, and conducting patrols  through the whole area. Border public security inspection  stations have set up checkpoints on the main thoroughfares in  the forward border control area. They use an all-weather on-duty  system, and they have instituted a general vehicle search and  verification to interdict criminal elements. Border work  stations have increased armed patrols, roadblocks, and ambushes  along the border to control the line. Border work (inspection)  stations have also increased controls at entry points and on  cross-border roads to maintain the arrival and departure order.  Public security posts control society along the border. They  have improved public order at public places such as stations and  hotels, and control over the general population, the transient  population, and the temporarily domiciled population, thereby  forming a complete border defense control network." This is what  Yunnan Border Headquarters commander Zhou Rupeng told us.    At the Simao Prefecture border line and in the triangular  area where Vietnam, Laos, and Burma abut China, land and water  routes are continuous, and there are numerous highways and  ferries one may take to enter or leave China. These have always  been places where smugglers, drug traffickers, and all sorts of  criminals have sneaked in and out. Border defense detachments in  these places feel that it is not enough to depend on border  defense units to exercise control. We must take the approach  of relying on the public to control the border. First, these  detachments sent propaganda teams into village streets, fields,  and hamlets along the boarder to conduct general indoctrination  of the public to improve the public's consciousness about border  control regulations. They used this as the first step in setting  up public "border control teams headed by township and village  cadres." For small roads away from villages, they sent guard  teams to institute control. Thanks to these efforts, a fine  situation of "three fews and three manys" emerged: the number of  people leaving the country without having been inspected or  registered were few, the number of people who submitted them  self to border defense inspection were many; the number of  foreigners entering China without permission to conduct  activities was few, and the number of those entering and leaving  through designated entry and exit points where they completed  procedures were many; the number of people violating border  control regulations were few, and the number abiding by the law  and consciously supporting border controls were many.    The border defense officers and men not only discharge the  heavy duty of guarding the border and protecting the country,  but they also regard the area they garrison like their hometown,  treat the people like their father and mother, and willingly  accept the task of helping the public extricate themselves from  difficult circumstances, escape from poverty and become wealthy.    The masses have begun to get wealthy. No longer need they  worry about having sufficient food and clothing. They have also  raised money for a joint border defense unit, doing all possible  to help the border defense headquarters do its work well. Hence,  one hears of case after case of joint police and people defense  and criminals being caught. One young person who had a plan to  flee from China by floating downstream on a raft was seized by  the public in Guanlei Village and sent to the border defense  work station. During the past several years, the public alone  has caught more than 100 law breakers.    Who are the most beloved people in this western Yunnan  region? It is those who guard the border and defend the nation  who are worthy of this name. Through their own behavior, they  have built a bridge that bonds them with the flesh and blood of  the people. They practice "a common destiny, breathing with, and  linking heart to heart" with the people. The breaking of many  large drug trafficking cases in the southwestern border region  has depended on the leads that the public has provided. [passage  omitted]</p>

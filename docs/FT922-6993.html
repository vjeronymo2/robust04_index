			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / FT Law Report: Russian ship's arrest was unjust KHERSON Queen's Bench Division (Admiralty Court): Mr Justice Sheen: May 1 1992 A CARGO claim which is both an action in rem against the ship and an action in personam against the shipowners, arises out of the same cause of action and is between the same parties as proceedings in the same matter which have already been started in personam by the cargo-owner in the courts of a country which is party to the 1968 Brussels Convention. Therefore, under the terms of the Convention, the UK court must decline jurisdiction in favour of the foreign court and where that court would have refused to order the arrest of the ship, security provided to obtain its release from arrest in the UK must be returned. Mr Justice Sheen so held when declining jurisdiction to hear a claim by the owners of cargo carried on Kerch, and ordering the discharge of security provided by the shipowners to obtain the release of her sister ship, Kherson, from arrest. HIS LORDSHIP said the cargo-owners claimed damages for breach of a contract for the carriage of a cargo of oil on Kerch, from Rosario to Rotterdam, in 1990. Kerch was owned by a Georgian state company. On September 26 1991, the cargo-owners issued a writ in rem naming 16 ships belonging to the shipowners. On January 23 1992, the writ was renewed for 12 months. On March 27 1992, Kherson, a sister ship, was arrested at Felixstowe. The shipowners applied for an order that the court decline jurisdiction and that the ship be released. During the hearing, the court was told that the shipowners had acknowledged service of the writ. The action then became an action in rem and in personam. Kherson remained under arrest until April 3, when she was released on the provision of security. The action then ceased to be an action in rem against the ship. It now proceeded solely in personam. On October 5 1990, the cargo-owners told the shipowners' Rotterdam agent that if security was not provided they would arrest Kerch, which was then in Rotterdam. The Rotterdam agent informed the cargo-owners that there was a treaty between the USSR and the Netherlands which prohibited arrest if the shipowners chose domicil in the Netherlands. The effect of the treaty appeared to be that if a party contemplated commencing an action arising out of use of a ship, the other party might 'elect domicil' on the plaintiff's territory. When he had elected domicil an action in personam could be brought against him that territory, but the ship could not be arrested. The parties to the treaty would ensure compliance with the judgment. On October 5 1990, the shipowners chose domicil in Rotterdam. On October 9, the cargo-owners's agents wrote accepting the choice of domicil and stating that they refrained from arresting Kerch as security 'because according to the bilateral agreement, the Soviet Union is to make sure . . . .a verdict rendered by the Rotterdam District Court is to be carried out'. The shipowners contended that that exchange of letters was evidence of an agreement that the claim should be brought in the District Court of Rotterdam. They relied on article 17 of the Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters 1968, which was given the force of law in the UK by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. Article 17 provided that if parties domiciled in a contracting state had agreed that the courts of a contracting state were to have jurisdiction, 'that court shall have exclusive jurisdiction'. The letter of October 9 1990 was not an agreement that the Netherlands courts were to have jurisdiction. By accepting the shipowners' choice of domicil, the cargo-owners established the right to commence legal proceedings in Rotterdam should they wish to do so, and prevented the shipowners from withdrawing their choice of domicil. That was not an agreement that the Netherlands court should have exclusive jurisdiction. Article 17 did not apply. As the cargo-owners had not had an opportunity to serve any of the ships named on the writ before October 4 1991, they decided to commence an action in Rotterdam. When they took that step they were aware they were not entitled to arrest one of the ships in the Netherlands, because of the treaty. Article 21 of the 1968 Convention provided that where proceedings 'involving the same cause of action and between the same parties' were brought in different contracting states, 'any court other than the court first seised shall . . . decline jurisdiction'. The cargo-owners disputed that article 21 applied to an action in rem. They submitted that a cause of action in rem was not the same character as a cause of action in personam. Also, it was said, the action was not between the same parties because it began as an action in rem and, after the shipowners acknowledged service, it continued as an action in rem as well as in personam. The action was founded on and involved the same cause of action as the Rotterdam proceedings (see The Deichland (1989) 3 WLR 478, 500). There were differences in character between an action in rem and an action in personam, but there were no differences between the essential elements of the cause of action in the two types of proceedings. As to whether two sets of proceedings were between the same parties, in The Nordglint (1988) 1 QB 183,201, Mr Justice Hobhouse said an action in rem was not an action between the same parties as an action in personam. He said 'it will only become an action between the same parties when and if a shipowner, liable in personam, chooses to appear in the action and defend it'. The court agreed. As Lord Justice Lloyd said in El Tawwab (1991) 1 Lloyd's Rep 205: 'The whole point of the action in rem is that it is an action against the ship itself . . . and not a personal action against the owners.' When a writ in rem had been served on the ship, if the owners did not acknowledge service, the action proceeded solely against the ship. If the shipowner acknowledged service, the action proceeded from that moment both in rem and in personam. Judgment would be in rem and in personam. The effect was that in so far as the judgment was in rem, it would be satisfied out of the proceeds of sale of the ship. Insofar as it was in personam, the plaintiff could not make double recovery, but could enforce it by attaching the defendant's assets as he could with any other judgment against a person. The only differences between an action which was both in personam and in rem (because the ship remained under arrest) and an action solely in personam, lay in the remedies available to a successful plaintiff and the procedure to obtain those remedies. The Rotterdam action and the present action involved the same cause of action. The two actions were between the same parties. Accordingly, article 21 applied and the court must decline jurisdiction in favour of the Rotterdam court. Now that the ship had been released, the court's decision as to return of the security must be the same as if she had remained under arrest. In October 1990, the cargo-owners refrained from arresting Kerch because of the treaty. If the cargo-owners had commenced proceedings in Rotterdam in October 1990 and refrained from arresting Kerch because of the treaty, the UK court would have regarded it as an abuse of its process if they had thereafter arrested a sister ship within the jurisdiction in respect of the same claim. The USSR had been dissolved, but Russia had assumed the treaty obligations. The security provided by that treaty was regarded by the Netherlands as adequate for its own national shipowners, and that was recognised by the cargo-owners in October 1990. In those circumstances it would have been unjust to keep Kherson under arrest. The UK court would have ordered her release. Accordingly, the cargo-owners were ordered to return the security. For the cargo-owners: Timothy Saloman (Clyde &amp; Co). For the shipowners: Charles Macdonald QC (Lawrence Graham).</p>

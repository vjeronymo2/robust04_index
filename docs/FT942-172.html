			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Times chief aims for rise to 750,000 Circulation of The Times at 20p could rise to 750,000, double the sales of a year ago, senior News International executives believe. Since the second price cut last week, in response to Mr Conrad Black's decision to cut the price of the weekday Daily Telegraph from 48p to 30p, The Times has been selling at around the 600,000 mark and close to 620,000 on Satur-day. 'More people are trying the paper and more people are liking it and staying, so therefore 750,000 is a reasonable target,' said Mr Peter Stothard, editor of The Times. He emphasised, however, that he had not been set any particular circulation figure. 'I have had one letter of complaint from a vicar who didn't think it (the price cut) was right,' said Mr Stothard. He expects The Times to sell more this Saturday once people realise that there is now a 40p differential between The Times at 40p and the 80p Daily Telegraph on Saturdays. If The Times were to reach the 750,000 figure it would realise an old dream of Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, owner of The Times. Journalists who were at The Times when Mr Murdoch took over in 1981 remember him saying on the newsfloor that he wanted to take the paper's circulation to three quarters of a million. Other national dailies including The Independent, The Guardian, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express are estimated to have been affected by the price wars between The Times and The Daily Telegraph, but not seriously. Even at a circulation of 600,000 the 20p Times is almost certainly losing a significant amount of money because 30p was a level where it was starting to approach breakeven. The company is believed to be paying around 15p of the 20p cover price to the news trade - less than the 17.5p estimated by executives at the Independent. According to newspaper industry analysts The Times costs about 16p a copy to produce. At May's circulation figure of 515,000 - which stirred Mr Black into action - The Times would lose about Pounds 1.2m a month this year, it is believed. The circulation has already risen beyond that figure and pressure will mount on advertisers to start paying a higher rate to reflect the new circulation. 'That will happen (higher advertising revenues) sooner rather than later,' Mr Stothard forecast yesterday.</p>

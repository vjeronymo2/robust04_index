			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Gummer to decide on stadium plan Sunderland Football Club's plans for a Pounds 75m superstadium and entertainment centre on land beside Nissan's Pounds 900m car plant have been called in for a decision by Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. A public inquiry into the club's proposals, which have been strongly opposed by Nissan, is now virtually certain. Earlier this month Sunderland City Council's environment committee decided not to refuse outline planning permission. But the environment department said yesterday Mr Gummer believed he should decide on the application because of its conflict with the council's approved development plan and its likely implications for the green belt, highway safety and neighbouring land uses. Nissan fears the development will block future expansion and jeopardise production methods.</p>

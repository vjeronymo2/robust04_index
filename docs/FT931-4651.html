			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Observer: Resurgence So who's being tipped for the job of UN's chief political representative for Bosnia once a peace agreement has been concluded? Lord David Owen, that's who. Though many obstacles still stand in the way of a settlement, the nitty gritty of implementing an agreement is already being discussed in private by members of the UN Security Council. It is already clear that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali will have to appoint not just an overall commander for the greatly enlarged international force required to operate the military provisions of the hoped-for settlement, but a political representative to boot. After his impressive performance as one of the two co-chairmen of the Bosnian peace conference, Owen is virtually certain of winning the support of the European Community and Russia for the new political appointment. The French, in particular, have been impressed by his combative style, not least the manner in which he has countered US criticisms of the peace plan he drew up with Cyrus Vance. In short, the lost leader has returned to the fore.</p>

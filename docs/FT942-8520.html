			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Cardoso revival lifts Brazil index Brazil's stock market closed about 12 per cent higher yesterday, amid renewed hopes for the presidential election chances of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. The former finance minister, who is well behind the front-running left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in opinion polls, has endured a bad couple of weeks because of bickering among his political backers. Yesterday, though, Mr Cardoso was lifted by news that Mr Jose Sarney, a former president who was level in opinion polls with Mr Cardoso and threatened to take some of his votes, had pulled out of the campaign. Last week, Mr Sarney failed to win the backing of the country's largest political party, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB). On Wenesday, a court refused to let him switch parties. Yesterday, he said he was no longer a candidate. In the latest soundings, both Mr Cardoso and Mr Sarney have about 15 per cent support, compared to nearly 40 per cent for Mr da Silva. Many of Mr Sarney's supporters are from the country's north-east. These are now expected to shift to Mr Cardoso because he is allied with the Popular Front party, strong in that region. However, Mr Cardoso's campaign for the election, due in October, faces severe challenges. Also, it seems badly organised and lacking ideas. Some analysts point out that many of Mr Sarney's supporters are among Brazil's poor, who may choose the more radical and populist Mr da Silva rather than Mr Cardoso, a member of the ruling elite. Brazil's stock market, always volatile, has fallen more than 20 per cent in recent weeks on concerns about Mr Cardoso. He is preferred by investors because of his pledges to open the economy further. The rise yesterday - the Sao Paulo stock market index closed up 2,176 points at 20,085, a climb of 12.2 per cent - was also partly due to Congressional approval, late on Wednesday, of measures towards the introduction on July 1 of a new currency, the real. It is hoped this will curb inflation, now nearly 50 per cent a month.</p>

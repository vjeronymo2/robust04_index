			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Unrealistic base for banks Sir, Mr Geoffrey Gardiner goes too far in his letter (January 25) in suggesting that a bank's equity base should be 'represented by realisable assets'. The implication is that all unrealisable assets should be matched with non-equity liabilities such as deposits, or that there are no such assets (which is an unrealistic expectation). Since equity capital is risk capital, it is fair that a portion of it should be represented by the infrastructural investments of the business, which will be to some degree 'unrealisable'. A proportion of equity should admittedly be free of such encumbrance, and it is another deficiency of the Basel approach that it jettisoned the 'free equity ratio' that had traditionally been part of the prudential armoury.

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Japan's big banks enter securities markets The Japanese Ministry of Finance has given the go-ahead for five leading Japanese commercial banks to move into the securities markets. Their arrival next month will represent one of the most substantial shake-ups in the history of Japan's financial system. The ministry announced yesterday that it had accepted the final details of the banks' plans to establish securities subsidiaries, as part of the continuing liberalisation of Japan's rigidly regulated financial system. The five banks - Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Fuji, Sanwa, Sakura and Mitsubishi - will establish units next month each backed by capital of about Y40bn (Pounds 253m) and employing up to 120 staff. The world's largest bank, Sumitomo, failed to win approval because of a disagreement with regulators over the name of its planned subsidiary. Japan previously strictly segregated banks and securities companies along the lines of the US Glass-Steagall Act. The ministry, mindful of the threat that the new brokerages represent to existing brokers, has, for the time being at least, limited the scope of their activities. They are not permitted to compete in the main area of securities business - equity trading - and there must be strict 'fire walls' between the parent companies and their offshoots. The banks' units will be restricted to corporate bond issuance. Details, Page 4 See Lex</p>

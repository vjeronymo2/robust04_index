			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tengiz Pachkoria: "They Have Declared Quarantine </F> in Gali Rayon"]    [Text] Information is being received from various official  and unofficial sources according to which Abkhazian separatists  have sharply restricted the movement of the civilian population  within Gali rayon and have also, to all intents and purposes,  reduced to a minimum contact between relatives and neighbors in  Gali rayon who are located on different sides of the Inguri  River. After all, the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants  of Gali rayon, fearing atrocities and robberies by Abkhazian and  north Caucasian fighters, have been forced to leave their  birthplaces and find temporary shelter in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha,  and other rayons in western Georgia. A certain number of their  relatives still remain in Gali rayon.    The Abkhazian authorities have now virtually forbidden such  movement. The formal reason given for this is the introduction  of a quarantine on the territory of Gali rayon. Its period of  duration is from 10 until 20 March.    In addition, during the last few days, Abkhazian and North  Caucasian fighters stationed at the Inguri River have been  sporadically opening fire with automatic weapons; they have been  firing either into the air or in the direction of those villages  in Zugdidi rayon that are located on the Inguri River. These  acts of provocation, apart from anything else, are probably  aimed at exerting psychological pressure on the inhabitants of  the villages in Zugdidi rayon and the refugees there from the  Abkhazian region.</p>

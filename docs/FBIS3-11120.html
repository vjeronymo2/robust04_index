			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Mar (PL) -- Today, the weekly JUVENTUD  REBELDE denied Colombian daily EL TIEMPO reports of a meeting of  Colombian guerrillas in Cuba and the existence of an office of  Colombian rebels in Havana.    JUVENTUD REBELDE carried a lengthy report entitled Neither  an Office, Nor a Rebel Summit in Havana, refuting the reports  published by the Colombian newspaper on 10 March based on  sources it never identifies.    The report added that one does not have to be Sherlock  Holmes  "to see EL TIEMPO's wicked intentions of trying to start a  scandal" shortly after the Colombian Government announced its  decision to sell 15,000 to 20,000 barrels of oil per day to Cuba.    JUVENTUD REBELDE said the lies published by EL TIEMPO also  coincide with attacks against the trade agreement by Alexander  Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for inter-American  affairs.    A JUVENTUD REBELDE reporter visited the building in Havana's  Alamar neighborhood, in Habana del Este Municipality, where  according to EL TIEMPO, the rebels reportedly had an office,  which residents in the area denied.    It is a building like any other, said Chilean painter Tato  Aires, who has been living at D-2 in Zone Seven of that  neighborhood for the past two months.    Several Latin American families live in the building, which  the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples (ICAP) made  available to them while they are residing in Cuba.    One of the tenants is Colombian citizen Alexander Salcedo,  20, who is studying medicine in Cuba thanks to his father's  efforts, who has been receiving medical treatment in Cuba for  the past six years.    Salcedo said there is no guerrilla office in that building,  adding that he has no links with rebels or political parties in  his country.    JUVENTUD REBELDE also noted that none of the Colombian  guerrilla commanders mentioned by EL TIEMPO are on the  participants list of a meeting of nongovernment, social, and  human rights organizations held here two months ago.    The publication stressed that while EL TIEMPO publishes  those  lies, it omits reports of attacks by ultraright sectors of Cuban  immigrants in Miami against Colombian citizens.</p>

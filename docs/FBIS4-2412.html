			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon, when delivering a speech at  the Fourth Session of the Discipline Inspection Commission of  the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, Pu Chaozhu, secretary of  the provincial party committee, emphatically pointed out:  Strengthening the building of clean government and opposing  corruption is a necessary condition and an important guarantee  for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure.  It is also a major issue which has a bearing on the success or  failure of reform and the future and fate of the party and the  state. He said: Since the central authorities issued the  mobilization call to thoroughly wage a struggle against  corruption in August, the provincial party committee and the  provincial discipline inspection commission have attached great  importance to the anticorruption struggle and all localities  have given mobilization talks and made effective arrangements  for the struggle. Achievements have been scored, in varying  degrees, in the three tasks set by the central authorities: 1)  Leading cadres at the county and office level have conducted  inner-party democratic activities quite conscientiously and  earnestly and carried out self-examination and self-correction  in terms of incorruptibility and self-discipline. 2) Initial  advances have been made in investigating and handling major and  important cases. 3) Some unhealthy practices have been checked  and initial success has been scored in rectifying selected  departments. The whole struggle against corruption is  progressing in depth and healthily. Facts have proved that our  party is completely able to get rid of corruption by relying its  own strength and the support of the masses. He said: As an  important measure to maintain political stability,  anticorruption work must solve the current outstanding problems  in the improvement of party style and building of clean  government in an active, reliable, and down-to-earth way;  alleviate and eliminate social hot points; strive to create a  stable social environment; ensure the smooth progress of reform  and opening up to the outside world; and promote the sustained,  rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.    Pu Chaozhu emphatically pointed out: In regard to the  anticorruption struggle, on the basis of continuing to  consolidate what has been achieved in the three tasks of  anticorruption in the previous phase, we should concentrate  efforts, in a selective way, on the new contents given by the  party Central Committee and the State Council to the three tasks  for 1994 and give them a great deal of attention to ensure their  gradual implementation. Leadership over anticorruption work  should be effectively strengthened. The entire party should be  mobilized and principal party and government leaders should  personally take charge of anticorruption work and carry out the  work level by level downward, with each level being responsible  to the authorities above it. We should work hard to achieve  marked results in implementing the three tasks, continue to do a  good job of the issue of incorruptibility and self-discipline  with cadres at the county and office levels, continue to devote  great efforts to investigating and handling cases, and continue  to check unhealthy practices.    As far as the struggle against corruption is concerned, we  should encourage all members of society to participate in the  struggle, combat corruption in a comprehensive way and by taking  both radical and stopgap measures, and do a good job of  anticorruption work by fully following the mass line and by  relying on the masses. We should work out rules and  regulations, augment the building of the legal system,  strengthen supervision and inspection through publicity and  education and the news media, give wide publicity to model  individuals and advanced collectives honestly and diligently  performing official duties for the people, foster a spirit of  uprightness, make public corrupt behavior that is highly  influential, combat evil trends, and teach all party members and  the vast numbers of cadres to push the anticorruption struggle  forward.    Present at yesterday's meeting were He Zhiqiang, Ling Huan,  Yin Jun, Zhao Shumin, Lang Dazhong, Li Jiating, Zhang Baoshan,  Meng Jiyao, Wang Tianxi, Zhao Tingguang, (Li Qun), (Li Lingge),  (Li Lingde), and other leading cadres.</p>

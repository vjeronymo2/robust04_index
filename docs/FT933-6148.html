			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Chile bank reform proposed THE CHILEAN government has proposed a solution to the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.66bn) subordinated debt issue that has plagued domestic banking for a decade, writes David Pilling in Santiago. Ten of Chile's commercial banks owe the central bank Dollars 3.9bn. This dates back to 1983 when the state took over their non-performing loans to prevent a collapse of the banking system. Banks have since been obliged to repurchase these debts yearly by handing over 70 per cent of their after-tax profits to the central bank. A reform bill, to be sent to Congress today or tomorrow, seeks to end the repayment period after 40 years. Banks with a realistic chance of achieving this would continue to pay the 70 per cent of profits to the central bank, but would be subject to an 'efficiency test' stipulating a minimum rate of profit. Those with less prospect of repurchasing all their outstanding debts within the 40 years - which include Banco de Chile and Banco de Santiago, two of the country's biggest - would issue convertible bonds to cover the shortfall. This would imply a dilution of existing shareholder stock, and is likely to be controversial in Congress. In return for their agreement to new repayment terms, banks - participating voluntarily - would be allowed to take on new activities such as factoring, securitisation and setting up international finance consultancies abroad.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> RECESSION COULD SLOW CITY GROWTH  </P> <P> Economic shadows cast by the coming recession could darken the outlook even for  Irvine's traditional growth, city officials said this week.  </P> <P> If the expense of running the city government and services continues to grow at  the current level, Irvine would fall about $15 million short during the next  two years, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said Monday.  </P> <P> But by no means is the city in dire straits, Brady said during a budget  planning workshop for City Council members and department heads. Even though  the nation seems headed for a recession, taxes, fees and other income that fund  city services should still grow in Irvine by about 6% annually, he said.  </P> <P> Six percent, though, is the smallest growth in the city's 19-year history,  Brady said. During the past two recessions, city revenue grew by 8% or more.  </P> <P> The biggest pinch will come in the slower growth of sales taxes, Assistant City  Manager Bernard Strojny said. A recession could cut the city's sales tax growth  to 5% or 6% a year, Strojny said. It is Irvine's largest revenue producer,  bringing in about $25 million -- almost half the city's annual income.  </P> <P> Projections show new construction in Irvine dropping by more than 20% during  the next two years, which will decrease development fees and eliminate the  sales and property taxes the new buildings would have brought, Strojny said.  Hotel use is expected to remain constant in the coming years, freezing the  city's income from its hotel bed tax, he said.  </P> <P> But despite the gloomy sound of those predictions, Irvine will be "fairly  healthy compared to other Orange County cities," Strojny said. "But nothing  compared to our past."  </P> <P> The economic discussion sets the stage for the coming months as Irvine  officials prepare the city's 1991-1993 two-year budget. The 1991 fiscal year  begins in July.  </P> <P> The belt-tightening will mean that of about 60 city staff positions now vacant,  only about 15 of those will be filled in the coming months, Brady said. Many of  the vacancies that will be left open are in the Community Development  Department, Brady said. TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

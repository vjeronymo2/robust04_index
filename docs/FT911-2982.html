			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (37): Keeping the house in order - On the move / Managers' careers may also interest savers THERE IS particular reason this year to ensure that the fund manager investing your money has a long and steady record, and as much experience as possible of volatile markets. Yet while the expertise of the individual managing the fund is fundamental, there is no real mystique about the investment business - the management principles are much the same as for any other industry. Paul Haines, investment director of consulting actuary Noble Lowndes, says: 'There have been no career changes in the last six months where people who have moved are so good that they could change my perception of an investment house overnight. But some could change the house over a period of time. Sometimes the problem with a house is not the quality of the staff, but the way the house is managed. If there was a house where the investment philosophy is sound but the management is poor, then a good leader can provide what the house is lacking.' Mr Haines also questioned the widely-held assumption that an investment group necessarily suffers when a brilliant and charismatic manager leaves. 'If a manager is really exceptional, then he will train people in his culture and that culture may persist beyond his own physical presence.' There are, however, two typical scenarios that are likely to take their toll on a group's fund performance. The first is where a group's traditional fund management department falls under the general business function, so that fund managers are remunerated on the same scale as managers in other departments. The best fund managers in their field can demand far more than such a structure allows. This type of structural problem occurs most frequently in insurance companies. The second is where different parts of a group are being merged, either through corporate takeover or the internal rationalisation of one company - for example, the merger of a group's pension and unit-trust arms. That said, the appointment of one exceptional manager can boost client confidence in a group, which in turn works like a self-fulfilling prophesy. An example might be the former chief of Prudential Portfolio Managers, Giles Weaver, who returned to his native Scotland in October to take up a directorship at Murray Johnstone, with overall responsibility for UK investment and pensions. Murray Johnstone has had mixed fortunes over the last 12 months. Funds under management fell by Pounds 700m in 1990; its attempts at merger have so far proved fruitless; and last month it streamlined its operation with the redundancy of a further 20 staff. However, the company claims it has not lost a single client since Mr Weaver's appointment. Hill Samuel Investment Services (HSIS) has also experienced a bumpy 12 months. Last month, chief executive Derek Fitch took early retirement following the group's decision to restructure the company into two parts. One arm is now headed by John Penny and concentrates on life, pensions and mortgage business; the other is led by John Bourke, and deals with private client services and offshore operations. One of the biggest blows to the group was the departure in December of David Tilles and his team of four, who had managed the Marks &amp; Spencer UK Selection Portfolio unit trust. They left to form Delaware International Advisers, taking the Pounds 13.5m M&amp;S contract with them. This also followed the departure of HSIS former managing director David Barker, who left in February 1990 to join Royal Insurance Asset Management as managing director, with the brief to oversee all of royal's fund-management functions. Another troubled house, Kleinwort Benson, appointed Charles Cavanagh last month as director and head of UK institutional fund management. Mr Cavanagh was previously responsible for client relationships with UK pension funds at Mercury Asset Management. Not all moves are from one house to another. In January, Kleinwort Benson's colourful Japanese unit trust manager, Campbell Gunn, moved to Switzerland to manage private client funds from the company's Geneva office. His position has been filled by Mark Pearson, who also managed the Kleinwort Benson Japanese Specialist trust and had worked alongside his predecessor for three years. Other significant recent job-changes of note in the fund-management fraternity include Jimmy West's move to Lazards as chief executive in December, following the takeover of Globe Investment Trust by the Coal Board Pension Fund.</p>

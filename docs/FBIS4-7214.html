			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's industrial  production in March climbed 4.0 percent from the preceding  month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)  said Wednesday [27 April]. The seasonally adjusted production  index for the mining and manufacturing sectors stood at 92.1  against a base of 100 for 1990, MITI announced in a preliminary  report.    The March output growth compares with a 0.1 percent dip  registered in February.    A production outlook index for the manufacturing sector  indicates falls both in April and May.    Uncertainty shadows the future course of final demand,  necessitating close watch of coming developments, MITI said,  repeating wording used in the February report.    Shipments increased 4.4 percent in March for the index of  95.0, following a 1.1 percent growth in February.    The inventory index dropped 1.7 percent to 105.0, following  a  1.0 percent decrease in the previous month.    The March inventory-to-sales ratio fell 6.0 percent against  a  2.7 percent decrease in February, with the index standing at  111.9.    On an unadjusted basis, industrial production in March slid  3.1 percent from a year earlier, stretching a record string of  year-to-year declines to 30 months.    With the latest statistics, Japan's industrial output has  shown considerable fluctuation over the eight months prior to  the reporting month.    Koichi Yoshimoto, chief of the ministry's Statistics  Analysis  Division, told a press conference that the basic undertone of  both industrial output and shipment is still weak although  bright spots are being detected in some sectors such as  household electric appliances and housing purchases.    The 4.0 percent growth in the March output, the highest  since  a 4.2 percent gain registered in September 1992, chiefly  resulted from seasonal factors toward the end of fiscal 1993,  Yoshimoto said. "It is too early to declare Japan's economy has  hit bottom," he said.    In March, production in all the 14 industrial sectors  covered  by the survey, except chemicals, scored gains from the preceding  month, MITI said.    Electric machinery such as air conditioners made a great  contribution to boosting March industrial output along with  transport vehicles such as passenger cars, MITI said.    Shipments for the month rose in all 14 sectors, with  electrical and passenger cars marking substantial increases.    The production and shipment indexes rose above 90 for the  first time since September. But the ministry forecast a 2.7  percent production decline for the manufacturing sector in April  and a 2.4 percent decline in May.    Demand for machinery will probably drop in these months in  reaction to sharp increases in the January-March period,  Yoshimoto explained.    The inventory index fell in March for the third month in a  row, thanks to smooth inventory adjustment in ordinary passenger  cars, Yoshimoto said. Volume adjustment of corporate  inventories is progressing steadily but the inventory-to-sales  ratio of 111.9 for March is still high, Yoshimoto said, noting  the slow growth of shipments. Corporate managers must feel a  surplus of inventories, he said.    Japan's industrial production for the entire year in fiscal  1993 fell 4.1 percent from the previous year while shipments  decreased by 3.7 percent.    Both industrial output and shipments thus registered  declines  for three consecutive years, a first for Japan. In the past,  two years of decline were recorded in fiscal 1974-1975 when  Japan's economy was struggling under the impact of the 1973 oil  crisis.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Japanese Industry (15): Different sides of same story - Finance and industry When Mr Takanobu Matsuda decided his company needed slimming down if it was to compete in the harsher economic climate of the 1990s, he knew he would require a little financial assistance from his banks. The cost of severance payments for some of Matsuda Denshi Kyogo's employees could not be met from the small electronic manufacturer's own coffers, so Mr Matsuda asked his local banks for a loan. But he got nowhere. None of the bankers in the Nagano area of northern Japan was prepared to take the risk of advancing him the money he needed. He eventually found the money by digging deep and trimming his restructuring plans, but he blames the banks for his troubles. Meanwhile in Tokyo, managers at a branch of one of the largest commercial banks tell a rather different story. For months they have been enjoined by their management to look for sound lending opportunities. But demand for their funds, they say, has never been weaker. The outlook has become so grim that they have taken to cutting their lending rates to larger corporate customers in an increasingly desperate effort to lure them back into the money market, despite the steady rise in their cost of funds this year. In a curious way both Mr Matsuda and the luckless Tokyo bankers tell different sides of the same story of Japanese corporate financing in the mid-1990s; the country has entered a kind of financial stasis. For the first time in living memory, bank lending has actually dropped for four months in a row. Supply of and demand for lending has fallen. But the problem is a mismatch. Banks want to lend to large, safe corporate customers. But they won't bite. Smaller companies are eager to borrow, but banks are wary of lending to them. For years, Japan's banks were the life-blood of the country's economy. Under the strict tutelage of the authorities, banks acted as a conduit to channel the huge savings of Japanese households into industrial lending. They paid rock-bottom interest rates to their depositors and they lent it on at similarly low rates to industry. The equation was simple and it worked. As Japan's economy emerged from the debris of the second world war, the money was plentiful and cheap, and corporations used it wisely, building an industrial base that would, in time, dwarf most of its rivals. But that happy tale of almost uninterrupted growth ended in the chaotic bubble economy of the late 1980s. Financial liberalisation and rapid economic growth created a speculative boom that started in Tokyo and spread throughout the country like wildfire. The explosion of asset prices embraced everything - land, stocks, even golf-club membership fees. Industry, too, flourished as the higher prices raised wealth and demand and enabled companies to expand. But in 1990 the bubble burst and Japan's economy suffered. For the banks the collapse of the bubble meant a mountain of bad debts as lending secured on over-inflated asset prices quickly became worthless. Between 1992 and September 1994, disclosed bad loans at the largest Japanese banks quadrupled, and on average now represent nearly 3 per cent of total loans. The true total is almost certainly much higher, since banks are not obliged to disclose all their non-performing loans. They have spent the past few years beginning the task of unpicking the problem. As a result they are highly cautious about lending to the type of smaller growth companies that fuelled the boom of the 1980s but collapsed so spectacularly in the 1990s. For industry it meant a pile of over-accumulated capital investment. For four years, they have been caught in a downward spiral of falling demand leaving them with excess capacity and lower profitability. New orders for machinery declined by nearly 30 per cent between 1990 and the first half of this year and have been flat since. Few large companies are willing or able yet to borrow to finance an expansion. In the past year, the slow economic thaw has created the demand-and-supply mismatch. As banks work through their bad debt problems they have started to allocate more lending to larger companies, on the grounds that security is stronger at such corporations and a repeat of the bubble years is unlikely. According to Ms Alicia Ogawa, banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, demand from large companies is so low that 'banks are having to discount their product in order to keep demand alive - by contracting loans at below the prime lending rate.' But smaller companies are still considered too great a risk for many bankers. The underlying problem, according to many analysts, is that banks' lending policies are hidebound by an attachment to land prices. More than a quarter of all bank lending is collateralised by land and property. Many companies are refinancing their borrowing on the basis of the new, much lower, land prices that prevail today. The lower property prices mean banks have cut their credit lines, making it more difficult for companies to expand. Land prices are continuing to fall, dropping by 5 per cent in the principal cities in the past year. That makes banks' lending policies still restrictive for smaller borrowers. Some lenders have started to shift towards a more innovative (in Japanese terms) policy of tying lending to expected future cash-flow, but the fall-out from the bubble economy is so great that most are still reluctant to break the familiar link with land collateral. Smaller companies have been borrowing in far greater volume from the public institutions and that has offset some of the tight conditions in the private sector market. But just as there is little sign of an upturn in land prices that will help the smaller companies to increase borrowing, there is scant evidence that the larger corporations are eager to start borrowing again. Corporate profitability is still at wafer-thin margins, and much of industry remains plagued by overcapacity. And when businesses do return to the financial markets they look likely to follow the growing trend towards corporate bond issuance. In Japan's over-regulated financial markets that may mean more business going overseas since corporate bond issuance in Japan is still encumbered by a restrictive regulatory framework. If the mismatch is to be redressed, banks must either change their lending policies, land prices must rise sharply, or there must be an early return to strong growth. Since none of those three possibilities seems likely in the next year or so, the constrained market for capital seems set to continue.</p>

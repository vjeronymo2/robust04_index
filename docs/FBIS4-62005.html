			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 11, BNS -- The National AIDS Center has,  so far, registered six AIDS patients and 12 HIV carriers, the  center's Director Andris Ferdats told BNS.    Two patients have died; one of them this year, Ferdats said.    Ferdats claims it is difficult to find how many residents  have fallen ill with AIDS and how many are HIV carriers because  seven to 10 years may separate the beginning of illness from the  moment of contamination.    As reported, the World Health Organization and the Latvian  AIDS Center opened a seminar for journalists Tuesday [10 May] in  Riga. The workshop is conducted by WHO expert Marie Noelle Belot.    The organizers maintain that the media play an important  role  in the formation of AIDS-related public opinion.</p>

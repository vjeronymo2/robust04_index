			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Singapore to lose TV plant Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the French multinational, is closing down its colour television manufacturing plant in Singapore and moving operations to Bangkok and to Batam in Indonesia. Rising costs in Singapore are believed to be the main reason for the move. Mr Didier Trutt, a general manager of Thomson in Asia, said the TV manufacturing industry operated under severe cost pressures. 'Expanding our manufacturing operations in Thailand and Indonesia, while strengthening our support functions at the regional headquarters in Singapore, makes good economic sense,' said Mr Trutt. TCE first set up in Singapore in 1969 and has about 5,000 workers. About 900 employees at the Singapore plant will lose their jobs.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Piet Muller and De Wet Potgieter] </F>   [Text] The General Staff of the South African Defense Force  [SADF] this week warned State President F. W. de Klerk that the  security situation in the country is extremely dangerous, and  that right-wing groups in particular could launch large-scale  violence or even an attempted coup at any moment.    They warned that if this happened, a considerable number of  defense force officers and servicemen would possibly not remain  loyal to the government, but would actively support the  dissidents instead. Security sources indicated to RAPPORT a  figure of "60 percent or even higher."    Regarding the loyalty of the SADF should they be called on  to  take action against the right wing, reference was made to  General Constand Viljoen, who this week was quoted as saying on  a radio program: "A government would have a tough time scraping  together enough SADF members to take action against  right-wingers."    The government apparently views the general staff's  information in a serious light, and the details are being  carefully studied. Defense force observers say the general staff  would not confront the government with an "own agenda." They  are simply presenting the state president with a factual report  on the situation in the country. There is no talk of a widening  gap between the general staff and the government, but the  government realizes that when a warning comes from this quarter,  it must be taken seriously.    RAPPORT was told that the warning could indicate possible  crises before the election at the end of April. Experts believe  that it could not have been easy for the general staff to inform  the government of their observations, in view of the suspicion  surrounding the defense force following the Goldstone  Commission's raid on a section of military intelligence. They  would also have wanted to ensure that they conveyed their  information in good time.    A minister remarked to RAPPORT that "this information is so  shocking one can hardly believe it." But he added that he  personally had believed for some months that "something like  this is possible." Another minister says bluntly: "I do not  believe the information."    The warning by the general staff tallies with the exclusive  information RAPPORT published last week: that fully equipped and  trained right-wing groups are ready to resort to military  protest. When RAPPORT asked whether it is true that officers on  whose loyalty the government cannot count might be detained  before the election -- a possibility which is not mentioned in  the submission by the general staff -- no one could give a firm  answer.    The fears of internment were raised this week in right-wing  circles as well as in the security community. Right-wingers say  it is odd that several police investigations are under way  against suspected far-right activists, yet no arrests are taking  place. They believe that the police will launch large-scale  strikes against suspects at an opportune moment -- on the  strength of piles of dossiers -- to prevent a possible take-over  by violent means.    Security sources also fear that action will be taken against  dissident serving members of the defense force and retired SADF  members who over the years were involved in underground  intelligence structures against the African National Congress,  such as the Civil Cooperation Bureau, the Division of Covert  Intelligence, Military Intelligence, Koevoet [police  counterinsurgency unit] and the Askaris [former ANC guerrillas]  of Vlakplaas. Last week RAPPORT reported that underground  right-wing military plans have found support within the security  community. On the day the report appeared two helicopters, a  Dakota aircraft, and even troops were sent to Beestekraal near  Brits to search for the weapons caches referred to by RAPPORT.    On Monday morning three trucks with black troops arrived in  the area from Pretoria to help in the search. This caused great  tension among right-wing farmers. It was confirmed to RAPPORT  that after an exchange of harsh words between farmers' leaders  and the defense force, it was agreed that black troops would not  be deployed in the area again.    Meanwhile RAPPORT's report of last Sunday has sent shock  waves through far-right underground planning structures. A  "tongue lashing" over the leak was delivered "from the top." It  also appears that several police generals in Pretoria were  caught unawares by the report. Urgent meetings were called in  the capital on Sunday night, and members of the Criminal  Information Service -- the old security branch -- were summoned  from Brits area to report on the situation.    It has also been reliably learned that the planned take-over  of police stations by the far-right is causing deep concern to  the South African Police General Staff. The report was high on  the agenda the whole week at police headquarters, Wachthuis.  Further investigation by RAPPORT indicated that only about two  commando units in the western Transvaal are not controlled by  right-wing structures. The far-right has also gained effective  control over the commandos and their arsenals in almost the  whole of rural Orange Free State, northern Natal, far northern,  northern, and southern Transvaal. Everywhere so-called area  protection units have affiliated with the commandos and will  therefore be eligible to receive defense force weapons.    White Wolf Barend Strydom's wife Karin, his mother-in-law  Trudy, and his father-in-law have apparently all been issued  with semi- automatic weapons. They live near Hartbeespoort Dam  in the Brits area. A very nervous source, rifle in hand, told  RAPPORT:    -- There are four experts in the Brits area trained in the  preparation of cyanide bullets. "These people also have pipes  [probably anti-tank equipment] with which to take out tanks and  armored vehicles."    -- A raid had been planned for last Sunday on the police  base  at Rosslyn outside Pretoria to get hold of more weapons. The  target was described in detail to RAPPORT. An expert at opening  door and safe locks, and whose name and address have been given  to RAPPORT, has allegedly been involved in several incidents to  date where he had to open locks to enable members of the  underground structures to steal weapons and equipment.    -- The recent spate of bomb attacks on power and railway  lines without the loss of life must be seen as part of an armed  propaganda campaign which serves as a prelude to what lies ahead.    The fact that no trains loaded with black commuters have so  far been blown up is ascribed to the fact that the far-right  saboteurs do not wish to cause any harm to Zulus who might be on  the trains.</p>

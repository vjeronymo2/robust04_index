Talks will resume in  Lusaka tomorrow, and the working agenda will center on national  reconciliation.    In Luanda, the Malian diplomat held a working meeting with  the French cooperation minister and requested the Luanda  Communist government to suspend the ban on distribution of  humanitarian assistance to areas administered by the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA].    Observers continue to insist that the parties should discuss  national reconciliation with great care and skill, because it is  the center point of any agreement that may come about in the  Zambian capital.    It should be pointed out that Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim,  a  member of the UNITA delegation to the peace talks, assured the  international press yesterday that the two parties had already  reached an agreement on the arrival of blue helmets in Angola to  supervise the agreements that may result from the ongoing peace  talks.</p>

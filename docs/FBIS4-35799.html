			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 5 Jun (MENA)--Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, head  of the government that has been announced recently in Aden,  arrived in Cairo this afternoon from Jeddah on a short visit to  Egypt. Al-'Attas' visit to Cairo is part of a tour he is making  of a number of Arab countries.    In an arrival statement, al-'Attas said that his visit is  part of the consultations with Egypt over the ongoing war in  Yemen following the Security Council's resolution in this  regard. He added: Sanaa is continuing the war and we are  continuing our consultations with the officials in Egypt, the  fraternal Arab countries, and the international community to  adopt the necessary measures to end this war and begin  negotiations and dialogue between the Yemeni north and the south  to tackle the various aspects of the situation. He added: We  are in need of medical supplies and medicines, because many  people are sick and wounded. He noted that many of those are  receiving treatment in hospitals in Egypt and other sister  countries.    Asked about the continued fighting in Yemen, al-'Attas said  that the Democratic Republic of Yemen has declared its clear-cut  and explicit commitment to the Security Council resolution, but  Sanaa, unfortunately, is still procrastinating in this matter,  has not made a clear or definite decision, and in the past few  days launched attacks against vital installations, oil  refineries, and electricity facilities. He pointed out that  these inhumane actions will destroy Yemen's infrastructure.  Al-'Attas concluded his remarks by saying that he made certain  today that both Iraq and Jordan are supplying Sanaa with weapons  and spare parts, as he put it.</p>

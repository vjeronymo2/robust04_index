			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu editorial: "Is There a Russian Encirclement </F> of Romania?"]    [Text] On Sunday evening, 20 February, the world's major  television stations carried footage of the entry of the Russian  contingent of UN peacekeeping forces into Pale in Bosnia.  Television viewers were surprised by one thing. In every  respect, the arrival of the Russian contingent in that area is a  routine matter. The UN troops are made up of contingents  belonging to various nations. Thus, numerous national  contingents have been replaced since the UN intervention. Some  have come, others have gone. Local people were hardly disturbed  by this. They continued to pursue their affairs, that is to  fire their guns and let themselves be filmed in their tragedy by  foreign television crews. This is why the arrival of the Russian  contingent had to be welcomed as well. It could have been  viewed as a mere replacement of a contingent under UN flag. It  was, however, viewed differently. The Serbs in Pale welcomed  the Russian troops like liberators. The television images from  Pale were strikingly reminiscent of the atmosphere in which  allied troops were welcomed in a Western city during the last  year of World War II. The enthusiasm among the Serbs about the  appearance of the Russian troops draws our attention to a fact  whose real dimension is not yet perceived by Europe and the  entire world. The Russian troops came to Bosnia under the UN  flag. Following Moscow's diplomatic actions, the Serbs agreed  to withdraw their heavy weaponry provided that the UN troops in  the area also included Russian troops. So far, this had not  been possible, because the West was, naturally, afraid that  these troops might become partisans for the Serbs. The only  thing is that, in reality, the arrival of the Russian contingent  -- through all its implications -- turned into Russia's return  to former Yugoslavia. Almost half a century ago, in 1948, the  Serbs were emerging from the traditional influence of their Slav  big brothers -- the Russians. After a few years of hesitation,  Tito, however, opted for the West. For almost half a century,  Yugoslavia was, if not hostile, then at least indifferent to  Russia. The arrival of the Russian troops in Bosnia was the  price that the United States had to pay to come unscathed out of  the mess called the NATO ultimatum. Russia's initiative solved  a crisis that worried the entire globe. The Serbs withdrew  their heavy weaponry. Even though NATO declared that it was  going to maintain the ultimatum, it is clear that the question  of air strikes is no longer valid. At least for the time being.  The price that the United States have to pay for this  face-saving operation is the loss of new Yugoslavia. Is it too  high? Is it too low? In my opinion, for the United States this  price is not as high as some people may think. First, because  the Serbs were lost anyway from the very moment that the United  States chose to side with the opponents of the Serbs --  Slovenia, Croatia, and the Muslims in Bosnia. Second, as I have  stated before, the United States is less and less interested in  Europe. In the new U.S. world plans, Europe is increasingly  being eclipsed by Asia. Within this context, the loss of the  Serbs does not seem to count a great deal. In exchange for this  loss, the United States could win over the Muslims throughout  the world. Which means not only the most attractive part from  an economic point of view, but also the most aggressive part  from an ideological point of view. The great analysts of the  U.S. Administration must have realized that communist ideology  is being replaced, with every passing day, by Islamic  fundamentalism, a sort of religious Bolshevism.    Things are satisfactory for the United States. For Romania,  however, things are a little different. For the Serbs to fall  under Russia's sphere of influence is tantamount to the  beginning of a Russian encirclement of Romania. Not so long  ago, we used to meet with Russia only in the east. Now there it  is waving to us from the west. Bearing in mind the increasingly  closer relations between Hungary and Russia, we cannot rule out  that soon we will see the Russians waving to us from the north.  All that is left is the south. I do not believe, however, that  there is any Romanian who, even for a moment, would have any  doubts about the true relations between the Bulgarians and the  Russians. Thus, one cannot rule out that, in a short time, we  will really be an island of Latinity in a great sea of Slavs.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Data on the safety and effectiveness of alcohol formulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an emolliented vehicle for use as a surgical hand scrub,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health-care personnel handwash, and hand degermer were submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Miscellaneous External Panel (Refs. 2 and 3). However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the data were not reviewed or categorized for these uses during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that rulemaking. In reviewing alcohol for short-term uses, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel stated, ``ethyl alcohol acts relatively quickly to decrease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of micro-organisms on the skin surface. Each minute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that scrubbed hands and arms were immersed in approximately 77  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent ethyl alcohol by volume was found to be equivalent to 6.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minutes of scrubbing in water; if the skin was scrubbed with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alcohol, the rate was further increased'' (47 FR 22324 at 22328).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Panel found ethyl alcohol safe and effective for use as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topical antimicrobial preparation in concentrations of 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution. The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indications were proposed:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) ``For first aid use to decrease germs in minor cuts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrapes.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) ``To decrease germs on the skin prior to removing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splinter or other foreign object.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) ``For preparation of the skin prior to an injection.'' (See the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol drug products for topical antimicrobial use, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> of May 21, 1982, 47 FR 22324.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The submissions (Refs. 1 and 2) included effectiveness data and labeling for a currently marketed product containing 62 percent ethyl alcohol formulated in an emolliented vehicle and dispensed as a foam used ``*&blank;*&blank;* to degerm hands *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The agency has reviewed these data, derived from effectiveness testing as a surgical hand scrub (glove juice test) and health-care personnel handwash, and finds that they meet the procedures in the testing guidelines in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1242). Statistical analyses showed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> microbial reduction to be highly significant. A glove juice test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showed that alcohol foam reduced the baseline number of bacteria present in normal skin flora, after first use, by 1.87 logs, and, after continued use for 5 days, by 2.36 logs. The reduction of the baseline number of bacteria was maintained for up to 6 hours under surgical gloves. A health-care personnel handwash effectiveness test showed microbial reduction on test subjects' hands, artificially contaminated with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Serratia marcescens  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. marcescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Microbial reduction averaged 3.3 logs after 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatments and 3.63 logs after 25 treatments. In vitro data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived from studies using  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. marcescens <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as the test bacteria,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showed that alcohol properly formulated in an emolliented vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dispensed as a foam, significantly reduced the number of test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bacteria, in 10 percent serum, within 15 seconds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these data and the conclusions of the Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> External Panel (47 FR 22324), the agency concludes that alcohol,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when properly formulated, is effective for use as a surgical hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrub and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because it is well established that alcohol alone does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide persistence, the agency notes that a preservative agent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the vehicle provided the persistent effect to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the baseline number of bacteria for 6 hours as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to demonstrate efficacy as a surgical hand scrub drug  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is including alcohol in proposed &sect;333.410(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.412(a) (patient preoperative skin preparation), and &sect;333.414(a) (surgical hand scrub), as follows: ``Alcohol 60 to 95 percent by volume in an aqueous solution denatured according to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms regulations in 27 CFR part 20.'' Further, the agency finds the Miscellaneous External Panel's proposed Category I indication for OTC alcohol drug products, i.e., ``for preparation of the skin prior to an injection'' to be an appropriate indication for patient preoperative skin preparation drug products. Based on that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Panel's recommendations, the agency is including this indication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as an additional claim for alcohol drug products in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.460(b)(2) of the proposed monograph. In addition, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Panel's similar recommendations for isopropyl alcohol (47 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22324 at 22329 and 22332), the agency is proposing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication for OTC isopropyl alcohol drug products in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;333.460(b)(3). As discussed in section I.N., comment 28, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is proposing new effectiveness criteria for drug products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labeled for this use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The monograph will also state that an alcohol drug product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be properly formulated, such as the product in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emolliented vehicle dispensed as a foam discussed above, to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test requirements in &sect;333.470. This means that alcohol when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended for certain uses must be able to demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness by certain tests proposed in this tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph, as follows: (1) Antiseptic or health-care personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwash_&sect;333.470(b)(2), (2) patient preoperative skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation_&sect;333.470(b) (3), and (3) surgical hand scrub_&sect;333.470(b)(1). As discussed in section I.B., comment 5, the term ``antiseptic handwash'' in lieu of ``hand degermer'' is being proposed in the monograph as the statement of identity for this type of product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

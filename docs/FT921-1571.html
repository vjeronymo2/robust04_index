			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: An important edge lies with the local hero - Loyalty counts with Lancashire voters ONLY in the nationalist heart of Lancashire might someone instantly recognise what Butch Cassidy's father and Sir Cyril Smith have in common. There the accident of birth matters. But an even more important test, which Mr Cassidy senior so dismally failed and Sir Cyril gloriously passed, was local loyalty - whether you stayed or whether you left. It is an issue which in the next three weeks will have an impact on which political party forms the next government. Rochdale, the four marginals immediately to the north of it and the rogue seat of Ribble Valley will on April 9 all reveal in their different ways whether a personal following can offset a national trend. While Ribble Valley, which a year ago delivered a by-election rebuff to the Tories, should revert to the Conservative camp, Rochdale, Rossendale and Darwen, Hyndburn and Pendle are all seats Labour would win with a swing of 5 per cent. The Liberal Democrats have gambled in choosing the actress Liz Lynne to defend Sir Cyril's 2,799 majority at the last election. She has sought to become as local as it is possible to be without having been born and brought up in Rochdale. Sir Cyril, though initially hesitant, now appears more convinced that she could be a worthy successor. But party workers on all sides know that since he won the seat in 1972 Sir Cyril drew votes from Labour and Conservative. With his retirement, they believe many of those voters may well revert to their national first choices. The Labour party is confident that the constituency remains instinctively socialist and that recession, together with the feeling that the time has come for a change of government, will be enough to give Mr David Williams the seat. But the Labour candidate is not without critics. A local councillor for 13 years, he is closely associated with controversial policies on land sales and devolving council services. The depth of his hostility to the Gulf war and to the poll tax may have frightened off as many voters as it won adherents among the sizeable Asian Moslem community. Up the road in Rossendale Sir Cyril and Rochdale persists. Mr David Trippier, minister of state for the environment, a Rochdale man who fought against, admired and learned from the former MP, is defending a majority of 4,982. Ms Janet Anderson, his Labour opponent, looks to have made one of the fastest campaign starts in Lancashire but will need all the momentum she can sustain to unseat a man whose local ancestry is impeccable and who has since 1979 become practised at the tactics of defending a marginal. Mr Trippier argues that voters in marginal seats appreciate their national responsibilities and are therefore less likely to be easily swayed. He and Mr John Lee in nearby Pendle took their seats in 1979 with smaller-than-expected swings and would like to emulate Mr Kenneth Hargreaves in Hyndburn. Against the national tide, Mr Hargreaves turned his majority of 22 into one of 2,220 four years later. In Ribble Valley, Mr Nigel Evans, a Welshman, has had a year to ponder the effects of poll tax, recession and not being from the region. Conservative workers say he has grown on people, is more widely accepted and can be sure of removing Michael Carr, the Liberal Democrat MP, by a margin of some 8,000-10,000 votes - still only half the Tory majority in 1987. Better, they say, to have a Welshman representing Ribble Valley than one living in 10 Downing Street. That, for north-east Lancashire, is not necessarily a winning argument. Even some members of the younger generation remember that Gracie Fields, once she became famous, virtually abandoned Rochdale for the less obvious pleasures of Capri, but that George Formby remained forever a part of Lancashire and was loved for it.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: LLOYD WEBBER, SAGER TALK ABOUT MUSICAL 'SUNSET BLVD.'  </P> <P> ISN'T ANDREW Lloyd Webber talking to lyricist Carole Bayer Sager about  collaborating on his musical version of "Sunset Boulevard"? Yes, he is.  </P> <P> And speaking of Carole, aren't she and her songwriter hubby, Burt Bacharach, in  the marriage doldrums? He recently took off for a month.  </P> <P> Now he is in and out of their house, but friends are extremely concerned about  this famous couple.  </P> <P> Whatever happens will give Carole new grist for her lyrics mill. She has said:  "Fortunately, there is not a simple definition of what 'love' really is. If  there were, I would not have any songs to write."  </P> <P> TED TURNER, the Atlanta TV mogul, will be honored by the Friars Club in New  York on April 13. And the hot rumor is that when Ted turns up at the Waldorf  Astoria for his honor, he will be accompanied by exercise queen, Oscar-winning  actress and new bride, Jane Fonda. Yes, Turner and Fonda are expected by many  to be married by then. We'll see.  </P> <P> FIRST PEEKERS who have viewed the latest in the screen saga of Rocky Balboa,  "Rocky V," are raving. They say it has all the qualities that made the original  such a phenomenon.  </P> <P> These advance critics are also praising two new finds. One is Sylvester  Stallone's handsome 13-year-old son, Sage, who plays his son in the film, and  the other is 21-year-old heavyweight boxing contender Tommy Morrison, who  portrays Rocky's protege. Everybody is saying young Morrison has real "star  quality." Well, if he does, perhaps it's in his genes. Tommy is the grandnephew  of screen legend John Wayne.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURF &amp; TURF;  </P> <P> PLAIN-WRAP THREADS AT 'SURFERS' SCREENING; DRESSED TO THE NINES AT SANTA ANITA  </P> <P> The big event was the fifth race at Santa Anita when Bill Shoemaker made "The  Legend's Last Ride." A crowd of 64,573 well-wishers packed themselves into the  stands, T-shirts pressing T-shirts at rail side.  </P> <P> High above the sweaty masses in the elevated environs of the private Turf Club,  the blue-bloods were gathering for Shoemaker's swan song. But they weren't  sweating, not even in their suits and ties and full-length furs. They remained  cool in their bespoke Oxxford suits and unruffled in their Chanel coat dresses.  Even the turf tykes were turned out to a tee in suits, ties and suede shoes. It  was such a nice looking crowd, so well dressed, so well mannered. Not a bead of  perspiration was shed when Shoemaker lost his race. As the nether crowd roared,  whistled and wiped their teary eyes, the bloods applauded politely and turned  the pages of their racing forms to the sixth race. The sport of kings had lost  a prince. Long live the sport of kings. GAILE ROBINSON  </P></p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: EFM seeks Pounds 50m for smaller companies investment trust EDINBURGH Fund Managers, the international fund management group, yesterday announced the launch of EFM Small Companies Trust to take advantage of what it believes is a favourable economic climate for investment in the sector. The trust aims to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and public offer. James Capel, broker to the launch, has already placed Pounds 37.5m from directors and institutions and is seeking another Pounds 12.5m through the public offer. The trust has a simple capital structure of 50m ordinary shares with one warrant attached to every five shares, at 100p each. Each warrant will give the shareholder the right to subscribe to one ordinary share at 100p in any year from 1994 to 2008. The public offer begins today and closes on August 11. Dealings in the shares are expected to start on August 19. Investment will be in companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 100m or less, and returns will be measured against the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index. Mr Iain Watt, managing director of EFM, said: 'We now believe that the economic climate for investment in small companies will produce some excellent opportunities of which this new company can take advantage.' He believes that small companies were undervalued while sentiment towards them was improving. EFM already has a small companies unit trust, with Pounds 78.3m under management at the beginning of July. This has regularly been top or within the top five performing funds in the sector in the 10 years to July 1, according to Finstat.</p>

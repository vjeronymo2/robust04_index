Oil and gas Streamline approval procedures for oil and gas field development consents. Small businesses Relax the statutory requirement for audit on 'certain small companies'. Introduce a new 'small business litmus test' to be satisfied before new regulations are imposed. Health Examine statutory sick pay regulations to simplify administration of the scheme and reduce 'unnecessary' burdens on business. Consumers Simplify consumer credit legislation. Transport Reform regulation of taxis and minicabs. Change the operator licensing regime for heavy goods vehicles and buses. Local controls 'Streamline' water pollution and air emission controls. Some proposals have already been announced by departments. None are detailed, and many are only 'possibilities' pending further review.</p>

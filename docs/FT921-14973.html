			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Women expected to dominate super-union WOMEN ARE likely to control Britain's largest trade union for the first time next year if the triple merger between the Nalgo and Nupe public-sector unions and Cohse, the health-service union, goes ahead as planned. At least 44 out of the 67 places on the executive committee of the new super-union, which has yet to be named, are likely to go to women. That proportion of places reserved for women on the ruling body will reflect the new union's heavily female membership. At present Britain's largest union is the TGWU general union, with 1.2m members. Although the TGWU has about 230,000 women members only three out of a total of 39 executive members are female. The merged public and health service union will have more than 1.4m members. Of those, over 1m will be women - more than a third of all women trade unionists in Britain, according to the unions involved. If a ballot of the three unions' memberships shows approval, the new union will begin in July 1993. After several months of disagreement, which nearly scuppered the merger, compromises have been reached on a range of issues concerning finance and structure. Detailed agreement is outstanding on some important points, including the role of full-time officials and Labour party affiliation. While the new union's executive will be female-dominated, the very top posts are likely to be held by men. The three existing general secretaries are male: Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe (Nupe); Mr Hector MacKenzie (Cohse); and Mr Alan Jinkinson (Nalgo). The unions say they have yet to discuss the position of principal officers. The recent trend in the amalgamation of unions has not improved the position of women in top posts. Two years ago there were four female trade union general secretaries: Ms Brenda Dean, of Sogat, the printworkers' union; Ms Helen McGrath, of the National Union of Hosiery and Knitwear Workers; Ms Elizabeth Symons, of the Association of First Division Civil Servants; and Ms Diana Warwick of the Association of University Teachers. Ms Dean and Ms McGrath have since lost their jobs as a result of mergers with other unions.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RADKE EVIDENCE DEBATE BEGINS  </P> <P> Arguments began Thursday on a motion to have key evidence in the murder case of  Mark Alan Radke ruled inadmissible because it was obtained after Radke had been  illegally arrested.  </P> <P> Radke, 23, of Mira Mesa, is charged with the Jan. 21, 1988, murder of Jeffrey  Vance Rudiger, 16, of Scripps Ranch, whose partly clothed body was discovered  near a pizza shop where the two worked.  </P> <P> The motion to suppress evidence in the case, made by defense attorney Douglas  C. Brown, has been to the U. S. Supreme Court, the California Supreme Court,  and twice to the 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but attorneys on both  sides said this is a crucial hearing in the case.  </P> <P> Thursday's hearing before Superior Court Judge Charles R. Hayes was ordered by  the appeals court, which instructed Hayes to determine whether the arrest was  lawful and whether the evidence subsequently obtained is admissible in his  trial.  </P> <P> The order came despite rulings by three higher courts that the evidence is not  admissible.  </P> <P> The key issues being discussed at the hearing, which will resume Wednesday  morning, are whether Radke was voluntarily transported to the police station,  even though he was in handcuffs, and whether there was probable cause to  impound his vehicle. Hayes said he would allow prosecutors to introduce new  evidence.  </P></p>

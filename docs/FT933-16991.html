			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Political Notebook: Champagne and tears on the terrace NEVER mind Mr Michael Mates's relationship with Mr Asil Nadir, the row over Tory party funding or whether Mr Kenneth Clarke really will raise income tax in his November budget. There is a move afoot to bar political journalists from the Commons terrace. For those unfamiliar with the by-ways of the Palace of Westminster, it should be explained that from Whitsun until the long summer recess the terrace is the favourite refuge of our weary politicians. Running alongside the Thames from Westminster Bridge, it offers a perfect escape for MPs and ministers from the fetid atmosphere of their Commons cubbyholes. It is exclusive. Cooled by the gentle breeze off the river, it is a place to drink Pimm's and champagne away from the angry gaze of a disgruntled electorate. What better way to fill the evening hours before that crucial 10pm vote on the Fisheries (Hake and Haddock quotas) amendment order. The terrace is a place also for serious gossipping and, in these febrile times, for serious plotting. It is here that the Tory irreconcilables gather in small knots to denigrate Mr John Major and to daydream about their leader's downfall. Their Labour counterparts forgo the Pimm's for the sharper bite of Federation Ale. But the mutterings of the Tory Euro-sceptics are echoed by dark whispers on the Labour left about Mr John Smith's fight with their paymasters or Mr Tony Blair's drive to dump the party's ideological baggage. Now some among our legislators have decided that the privileged access of Westminster's political journalists to this exclusive sanctuary should be withdrawn. On one level this represents no more than one of the periodical spats between the third and fourth estates which occur whenever politics gets rough. The journalists are emboldened to break the intricate rules of behaviour which regulate co-habitation at Westminster. This or that minister is named for socialising with Mr Major's enemies, this or that MP for preferring another glass to attendance at a dreary committee meeting upstairs. The politicians become terrified that stories (usually exaggerated) of emptied champagne bottles will fuel still further the ire of their constituents. They want the world to go away. It won't. So the next best thing is to banish the journalists who report it. In other circumstances such a dispute might be dismissed as so much hothouse trivia. The two sides eventually will kiss and make up. Politicians and journalists need each other. But instead it has become an unhappy metaphor for Mr Major's government. After the horrors of the past year it too wants the world to go away. Ask a minister about the government's prospects and their thinking shifts invariably to the autumn, skipping the traps in the intervening months. By late September, the argument runs, the voters will have forgotten about politics. The economic recovery will be gathering pace. Maastricht will have been consigned to the history books. Mr Michael Mates and Mr Asil Nadir will be little more than hazy memories. Mr Major will start again with a clean slate. It is this sort of thinking that has persuaded the party managers to postone the Christchurch by-election to the end of this month at the earliest. If the government is to suffer another disaster it will ensure at least that it happens when as few people as possible are around to witness it. By the end of July, the political commentators who would otherwise seize on a defeat to again write off Mr Major's premiership should be ensconced in their Tuscan villas. But like the MPs on the terrace, Mr Major will find it is not that easy to escape reality. It is not what the newspapers say that matters. If the government loses Christchurch the Tory party will panic. Mr Major will face a bloody party conference in the autumn. Unless he succeeds by then in re-establishing a sense of purpose for his government his leadership will be threatened. There is one other thing - the matter of the Maastricht treaty. So far the Euro-sceptics have failed in their efforts to mount an effective assault on the treaty in the Lords. But it is possible - just possible - that the sceptics will be driven to a much more dangerous game in their efforts to overturn the treaty: that enough Tory MPs will vote with the opposition to defeat Mr Major over the social chapter in the Commons at the end of this month. What price then champagne on the terrace?</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE COME SURROGATE SANTA CLAUSES;  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS: TRAINED FOR THE SEASON, ONE- AND TWO-PILLOW WOULD-BE ST. NICKS WILL  SPEND NEXT MONTH IN THE MALLS BRINGING YULETIDE CHEER TO THOUSANDS OF KIDS.  </P> <P> I'm a one-pillow Santa.  </P> <P> It's embarrassing to admit, since most of the others who enrolled with me in  Santa School last weekend seemed slim and healthy-looking. Distinctly  two-pillow types.  </P> <P> The 30 of us will climb into red-velvet, size-54 Santa suits today and travel  to shopping malls across Los Angeles County to take up battle stations as  surrogate Clauses. During the next month, we'll lift thousands of starry-eyed,  angel-faced children to our knees and listen to this generation's Christmas  wishes. But first, we had to be trained, and that took place last Saturday.  </P> <P> We were fed doughnuts and bagels as we met in a back room at the Del Amo  Fashion Center for class. We learned the Santa Walk (a slow, smooth gait --  like someone who's spent many lifetimes squeezing down chimneys) and memorized  a list of Santa Do's and Don'ts (Do use an industrial-strength deodorant and  breath mints. Don't flirt.).  </P> <P> "Be natural," said Santa instructor John McGill III. "Use your own voice. Lower  your volume -- not your tone -- when you're talking with the children. Kids can  detect a phony voice. Santa is a real person. I've been doing this for six  years.  </P> <P> "And I believe."  </P> <P> McGill is a jolly, bearded truck driver from Long Beach. Each year, he takes a  leave from his cross-country driving job so he can spend Christmas working as  St. Nick.  </P> <P> This year, he has helped recruit 55 potential Santas like me to work in and  around Los Angeles malls for Western Temporary Services. Nationwide, the agency  will supply more than 3,000 of them to department stores and shopping centers.  </P> <P> McGill told us to greet each child individually, take plenty of time for our  visit and end each conversation with an admonition such as "be sure to brush  your teeth" or "get to bed on time." Go light on the Ho! Ho! Hos!, we were  told, as they have reduced many a timid child to tears. We were warned never to  promise anything when youngsters reel off their Christmas wish lists.  </P> <P> "Watch the folks to see if they're nodding at what the child is saying. Take  your cue from them when a child mentions a toy," he said. Santas never endorse  toys, McGill explained, but Santas should study newspaper toy ads to know what  children are talking about when they ask for the latest hot item.  </P> <P> There were frequent breaks during the four-hour training session -- more rest  periods, we were warned, than we'll get once we settle in at the malls' center  courts.  </P> <P> "Help yourself to the doughnuts, gentlemen," said Anthony Scovotto, a San Pedro  shopping center promotions specialist who helped out at the class. "We want to  put some weight on our Santas."  </P> <P> My classmates, whose regular jobs range from welder to business consultant,  were quick to adopt the holiday spirit. Most made it clear they are as  interested in the Santa experience as in the Santa pay -- as much as $7.50 an  hour.  </P> <P> (My Santa salary is to be donated to charity by Western Temporary Services.)  </P> <P> Kevin Troutt, 19, a 6-foot, 165-pound college student from Hermosa Beach, took  one look at the suit he would be wearing and saw an immediate need.  </P> <P> "I'm a four-pillow Santa," he declared.  </P> <P> Dan Rogal, 45, a handyman from El Monte, wore a red Christmas sweater and a  Santa-length blond beard to class.  </P> <P> "I'll spray my beard white," Rogal said. "It will be fun watching the kids'  reaction when they pull on it and find out it's real."  </P> <P> After viewing a videotape that showed such tips as how to deal with children  who have wet their pants (Stand up, announce it's time to feed the reindeer,  then go change) we watched demonstrations of how to color our eyebrows white  and correctly wear the Santa suit, beard, wig, gloves and glasses. Then came  the role-playing part of the curriculum.  </P> <P> Student Santas Keith Rogers of Long Beach and Jim Branca of Playa del Rey sat  on chairs while the rest of us took turns sitting on their knees. Most of us  tried to stump the Santa by asking such questions as, "Who was that other Santa  I saw a few minutes ago at the other mall?" (The correct answer: "That is one  of my helpers.")  </P> <P> Branca asked me if I've been a nice boy this year. I said yes, and told him I  wanted a Milli Vanilli record album for Christmas. "They've been the naughty  boys!" Branca responded, a professional twinkle in his eye.  </P> <P> The class ended with a homework assignment. Each of us, McGill said, would be  required to learn the names of Santa's reindeer by today.  </P> <P> From around the room there arose a clatter: "Let's see, there's Dasher, Dancer  . . .," one student started.  </P> <P> "Rudolf and Vixen," another chimed in.  </P> <P> "Secretariat," came a voice from the back.  </P> <P> Santa Don'ts  </P> <P> No smoking, flirting, or drinking  </P> <P> Never promise anything  </P> <P> Never show a bad mood  </P> <P> Times staff writer Bob Pool has found work this season as a shopping mall  Santa. He promises to deliver occasional reports.  </P></p>

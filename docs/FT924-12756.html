			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Polls rejuvenate Brazil's radicals OF ALL the banners in Brazil's multi-party demonstrations for the impeachment of President Fernando Collor, the most visible was the red flag. The radical Workers party (PT) has since collected its reward, emerging from this month's municipal elections as the clear beneficiary of the impeachment campaign. Moribund since narrowly losing the presidential elections in 1989 and floundering in its search for a post-cold war popular platform, the PT was sparked into action by corruption charges against Mr Collor. Under the new banner of 'Ethics in Politics' it was at the forefront of protests and its members the most vocal in the congressional inquiry into government corruption. Its actions paid off. In the first round of voting in municipal elections the PT won one state capital straight off and goes on to the November run-off in five others including four of the country's most important cities: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre. Rio was the biggest surprise: Ms Benedita da Silva, the PT's black, female candidate, topped the poll - the first time the party has broken into the city. Mr Lus Inacio da Silva ('Lula'), the party's founder and leader, now seems certain to be a hot contender in the 1994 presidential elections (or parliamentary if the political system is changed in next year's referendum). It is a radical reversal from a few months ago. Demoralised by coming so close to the presidency and then losing, and by the collapse of socialism in eastern Europe, Lula, a former union leader from Sao Paulo, had practically dropped out of politics for most of the Collor era. In the 1990 congressional elections the party won only 35 seats in the 503-member house. The popular acceptance of Mr Collor's modernisation programme to open the economy and reduce the role of the state seemed to spell the death knell for the PT, which advocates the opposite. Half-hearted demonstrations with CUT, its union arm, to try to block the first sell-off last year were a failure, and today workers are calling for their companies to be privatised. Mr Renato Bosch, a political science professor at Rio university, believes the revival demonstrated by the municipal election results is more than a short-term phenomenon. 'The party has changed a lot and is strengthening independent of recent events. It has become far more diversified, aiming at salaried workers in general, not just blue-collar workers.'</p>

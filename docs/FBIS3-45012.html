			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lhasa, January 12 (XINHUA) -- The Tibet Autonomous  Region has its first vice-chairwoman of the regional government  since Cering Zhouga took office in the regional government at  the end of last year.    Cering Zhouga has served as the head of the Department of  Public Health in Tibet for about 22 years.    In 1971, the 27-year-old woman was appointed deputy director  of the regional Department of Public Health and, in 1980,  promoted to the department's directorship.    Before 1951, there was no modern medical service in Tibet.  With public health service in Tibet starting from a backward  state, Cering Zhouga was among the first generation of Tibetan  medical staff cultivated in New China.    In 1955, Cering Zhouga joined a medical team of the People's  Liberation Army in her hometown, Zedang of Shannan Prefecture.  In the summer of 1957, she was sent to study at the department  of medicine in the Northwest China Institute of Nationalities.    After graduation in 1963, she engaged in public health work  in Tibet.    In Tibetan language, Cering means long life and Zhouga  implies goddess. In Tibetan people's minds, Cering Zhouga is  like a "goddess of longevity."    But, the vice-chairwoman has not always enjoyed a smooth  life. She lost her mother as soon as she was born in 1943. At  the age of seven, she became a maid in a rich man's house and  toiled there for five years.    "It was the People's Liberation Army sent by the Communist  Party of China that liberated us serfs," she said.    Cering Zhouga is confident in her work but also feels a kind  of pressure. She said, "to be a vice-chairwoman, I must do some  down-to-earth work for the people."</p>

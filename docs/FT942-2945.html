			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Turkey shifts sell-off stance Economic turbulence has forced Turkey to shift its privatisation efforts from international share offers to direct equity sales to industry, according to a senior government official. Economic uncertainty - with a halving in the lira's value against the US dollar since the start of the year - would make it difficult to attract institutional buyers, Mr Tezcan Yaramanci, chairman of the privatisation administration, said. But he predicted the government would return to the market once the current IMF programme took effect. Mr Yaramanci confirmed bids would be invited next week for a 51 per cent stake in the Erdemir steel company. He added that buyers would be sought for strategic stakes in Petrol Ofisi, the oil products retail concern, Tupras, the oil refinery company, and for a minority share in Turk Hava Yollari, the national airline.</p>

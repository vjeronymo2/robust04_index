			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> An angry Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said a new book on Robert H. Bork's  ill-fated Supreme Court nomination incorrectly states Rehnquist broke a promise  to keep Justice Lewis F. Powell's impending retirement a secret. In the book,  "Battle for Justice," author Ethan Bronner says Powell told Rehnquist on June  25, 1987, that he would announce his retirement the following day and asked for  "a solemn promise" to keep it a secret overnight. The book says Rehnquist then  called White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker with the news, and Baker told  President Ronald Reagan. "That statement is in error," Rehnquist said. "I  notified Howard Baker of the retirement shortly before we went on the bench on  the morning of Friday, June 26, 1987." Bronner, however, said a tape-recorded  interview with Baker supports his account of Rehnquist's action.  </P></p>

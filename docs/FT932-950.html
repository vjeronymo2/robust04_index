			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Company News: Argentina pins hopes on YPF offer - The crucial privatisation of a state oil producer THE hopes and fears of Argentina's government are hanging on the outcome of its biggest and most controversial privatisation yet. It hopes to raise Dollars 3.54bnto Dollars 4.17bn from the YPF offer, making it one of the world's largest privatisations this year. If the sale of YPF, the national oil producer which is also Argentina's biggest company, is judged a failure, it would be a humiliating reverse for the government only four months before important mid-term legislative Congressional elections. But if a success, YPF will help to further the government's aim of spreading Thatcherite popular capitalism in Argentina. It would revitalise Argentina's sickly capital markets and bind them closer to the international financial system. The government would also clear political debts with pensioners, who will be one of the main beneficiaries of the sale. On June 28, the government will announce the price for the 59 per cent of YPF on offer. The flotation will go ahead on July 8. Some 31 to 35 per cent of YPF is to be earmarked for private investors. International investors will make most of the running, since only 7 per cent of the shares will be available on the local market. The remainderis being offered to politically influential pensioners to make good billions of dollars in unpaid benefits. The government is pricing the offer very competitively. It has set a minimum price of Dollars 17 per share and a maximum of Dollars 20, which is about 10 times net earnings, forecast to be Dollars 600m this year. At a 20 per cent discount to the grey market price in Argentina, YPF is attractive relative both to the Argentine stock market and other international energy companies. A Buenos Aires business consultant said YPF's attractions went beyond just a low price: 'YPF is the biggest oil company in Argentina and it will be the only integrated company on the stock market. It has an excellent market position, with over half of every market segment. It has great profit potential and it is well-managed.' He reckons YPF could earn a net Dollars 700m this year, against Dollars 259m in 1992. For 1993, he is forecasting profits of Dollars 1bn. Many investors see YPF more as a cheaply-priced international energy company than as a play on Argentina. 'A lot of international investors will buy it as an oil and gas company and put it in an oil portfolio,' says Mr Terry Mahony, of Baring America Asset Management. This has opened up the offering to investors not normally interested in Argentina. The privatisation is also benefiting from bullish sentiment about Latin America. In recent months, several Latin companies have made large international equity and debt offerings. However, there seems to be less enthusiasm for YPF among individual Argentine investors. The problem is that excessive speculation and a heavily over-priced telephone company privatisation last year led to a market crash that brought prices down by 48 per cent. Mainly small, highly leveraged investors bought shares in Telecom Argentina at Dollars 4.20, only to see its price sink by one-third and not yet recover. Banks and brokerages - which were also involved in the Telecom flotation - are facing an uphill struggle in their battle to sell YPF shares to individuals. However, Mr Pablo Estrada, capital markets director at Buenos Aires' Banco Roberts, said: 'Professional investors make rapid decisions. But it is in the final days that you sell (to individuals). In fact, we are getting a very large number of individuals' orders coming in and the same thing is happening at other banks.' Made wary by its experience with Telecom, the government, together with CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch, YPF's global co-ordinators, has turned to the book-building method to price its shares. If the issue is oversubscribed, which increasingly seems to be likely, then the government may not get the maximum possible price, but it will be guaranteed a strong after-market. The economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, clearly hopes YPF will transform the narrow and speculative Buenos Aires stock exchange into a broader and more stable market, which would encourage companies to boost investment and sustain economic growth. However, not everyone is optimistic. Buenos Aires-based equities analyst Mr Christopher Ecclestone says YPF is overpriced because government earning forecasts are too optimistic. He says first-quarter 1993 earnings of Dollars 78m were inflated by Dollars 38m in extraordinary earnings. Were it not for this, he says, profit would have fallen by 37 per cent to Dollars 40m. But if the deal succeeds, Wall Street expects many more Argentine companies to follow YPF and offer equity in the US, just as Mexican companies followed the landmark Telmex telecoms flotation in 1991.</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Plotters spared death sentence THE 12 men charged with conspiracy to seize power in the failed Soviet coup last August will be spared the death sentence, Mr Valentin Stepankov, Russian prosecutor-general, said yesterday. The trial would start this summer at the earliest, he added. Mr Yevgeny Lisov, chief investigator in the case, said a core of six Soviet leaders had long been planning to 'turn the clock back' on all reforms initiated by President Mikhail Gorbachev since he came to power in 1985. But they were spurred into action on August 19 by the threat of the Union treaty's signing, which would have dismantled most central authority. Mr Lisov said the putsch foundered on a failure to follow up a plan to storm the Russian parliament - which would have required 'killing several thousand people'. The plans emerged in about 100 documents found on some of the defendants. The coup plotters allegedly aimed to intern the Russian leadership, and execute thieves and other petty criminals as part of a law and order campaign. They also planned to abolish all local government councils. Mr Stepankov said the state would call for jail sentences of 10 to 15 years for the plotters, rather than the death penalty. 'The position of the accused is that they were acting for the good of the people,' Mr Lisov said. 'They consider themselves as not guilty.' Although some of the defendants had reason to believe Mr Gorbachev would support their bid to seize power, Mr Lisov said the former Soviet president was innocent of any wrongdoing.</p>

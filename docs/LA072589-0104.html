			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: WINERIES UNCORK A FILM FEST  </P> <P> There are international film festivals (Cannes, Berlin), national film  festivals (Chicago, Los Angeles) and there are local film festivals. Very  local.  </P> <P> On a cloudless, breezy Saturday morning, a knot of two or three dozen people,  sitting on blankets or folding chairs, are gathered in one corner of Petaluma's  pretty, shady Walnut Park to discuss screenwriting. Petaluma also hosts the  national wrist-wrestling championship and a celebrated ugly dog contest; the  movies fit right in.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the park, a local cycle club is gathering for its weekly sprint;  kids are playing, dogs are chasing about, drifters with bedrolls are catching  some sun-warmed Zs.  </P> <P> An oil-cloth banner stretched between trees declares the third annual Wine  Country Film Festival to be in session. The other park people are regarding the  film folk with benign indifference.  </P> <P> Local film festivals survive, if they do, on volunteerism, forgiveness and an  indefatigable love of the movies on the part of participants and consumers.  Survival is not easy. After two seasons, the Monterey Film Festival drowned  last year in a sea of red ink reportedly $250,000 deep.  </P> <P> The Wine Country festival, organized by Steven Ashton and partially funded by a  coalition of local wineries, operates on a shoestring that is frayed even as  shoestrings go. A local paper, the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat last week reported  grumblings of discontent from firms that supported the festival previously but,  for various reasons, no longer do, or will. There are moments when the festival  appears to proceed by improvisation, loping from crisis to crisis.  </P> <P> But, with continuing support from American Airlines, the Red Lion Inn and other  suppliers as well as the wineries, the festival manages to do what a local  festival ought to do, which is bring to town films and videos that, for the  most part, would not otherwise be visible within miles, maybe hundreds of  miles.  </P> <P> This year's festival was evenly divided between Healdsburg, where the  excellent, imaginatively programmed Raven Theatre was the principal venue, and  Petaluma, where the Palace Theatre, which had been dark in recent weeks, was  the major site.  </P> <P> The offerings were as varied as "When Harry Met Sally . . .," the current hit  that was the opening-night film, and "Bloodhounds of Broadway," the closing  film, which is based on some Damon Runyon short stories and stars Rutger Hauer  and Julie Hagerty in a large cast. "Bloodhounds," made on a minimal budget, is  said to have been the last project OK'd by David Puttnam before he left  Columbia. The studio's release plans for it are still uncertain.  </P> <P> The other offerings included "sex, lies and videotapes," the smash success and  Gold Palm winner at Cannes, and "The Raggedy Rawney," the remarkable anti-war  fable that Bob Hoskins ("Pennies From Heaven") wrote and directed and in which  he acts.  </P> <P> The luminous guests included Michael York, who came with "Heat of the Day," a  World War II thriller in which he stars with Peggy Ashcroft, Patricia Hodge and  Michael Gambon ("The Singing Detective"). Oscar-nominee Sally Kirkland gave a  very lively acting workshop that even attracted Petaluma's peppy mayor, M.  Patricia Hilligoss, who in one of the exercises was persuaded to sing "On a  Clear Day" as if she were Barbra Streisand. It was a smash.  </P> <P> Lynn Redgrave appeared with "Death of a Son," a co-production she did for BBC  television, which aired it early in the year to phenomenal ratings, and Center  Films, which is still negotiating for American distribution.  </P> <P> It is based on the true story of Pauline Williams, whose son died of a drug  injection administered by a user-pusher friend. The government refused to  prosecute. After a four-year struggle, Williams, who had never finished the  equivalent of high school, amassed enough medical lore to discover an error in  the inquest findings and launch Britain's first successful private prosecution  for manslaughter.  </P> <P> Williams was slashed by a drug-thug for her efforts but has become a national  heroine. Redgrave's performance is beyond question her most unforgettable since  "Georgy Girl" nearly a quarter-century ago. Home from the inquest, she stands  at the kitchen stove, back to the camera, moaning like a wounded animal.  </P> <P> It a moment of extraordinary intensity; it is also the bottom of an arc that  takes her from black defeat, despair, anger, rising curiosity, frustration  (always frustration), renewed determination and a damn-the-bureaucrats drive  and that leads ultimately to triumphs tentative and then total.  </P> <P> "Death of a Son" is a first feature for director Ross Devenish and scriptwriter  Tony Marchant, and I hope it finds its way to American audiences because it has  the doubled power of reality as art; and it affirms, from reality, the scarce  but welcome truth that one person can still make a difference.  </P> <P> Whatever its financial and administrative problems, a festival, if it works at  all, is its own kind of affirmation of the impact and the rewards of film.  </P></p>

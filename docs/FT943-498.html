The money had been placed in accounts set up in 1988 for special projects and to receive a windfall of oil revenue from the Gulf War, said Pius Okigbo, chairman of the panel on the reform and reorganisation of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He called the handling of the accounts 'a gross abuse of public trust'. Money from the accounts was spent in less than six years on what could neither be adjudged genuine high priority nor truly regenerative investment, he said.</p>

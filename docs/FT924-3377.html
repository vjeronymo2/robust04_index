			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: EC throws role of interdealer broker into question THE ROLE of interdealer brokers in financial markets throughout the European Community has been thrown into question by a ruling from the Commission over the activities of brokers in the international bond market. Interdealer brokers (IDBs) act as specialist intermediaries between marketmakers, helping to oil the wheels of financial markets. Rules in most markets prevent them from dealing with anyone other than marketmakers. The Commission has now told the International Securities Markets Association that its rules governing IDBs are potentially anti-competitive and could breach Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome. The ruling led ISMA to relax its rules at the end of last week, allowing IDBs to deal with institutions other than marketmakers. ISMA also dropped its requirement that IDBs open their books to inspection to prove that they were not breaking the rules. Restrictions similar to those which have been dropped by ISMA govern specialist brokers in several national government bond markets, including those in the UK and France, as well as the UK equity market. The Bank of England said yesterday that it had no plan to allow IDBs in the gilts market to deal with non-marketmakers. 'It's been a rule since 1986. The Commission has known perfectly well what our rules are, and it hasn't been troubled about them before,' the Bank said. Marketmakers complain that it is unfair to allow IDBs access to other institutions. 'They don't commit any capital and take no risks, and have access to the best prices,' said Mr Jerry Goldstein, the chairman of ISMA's council of reporting dealers. Freeing them of restrictions would enable them to deal directly with the marketmakers' own end customers, without forcing them to take on the same marketmaking commitments. The Commission officials responsible for the ISMA ruling could not be contacted for comment yesterday. However, it is believed that there is no immediate intention of extending the judgment to IDBs in the EC's domestic markets. ISMA, which is not covered by national regulation, had submitted its rulebook to the Commission in the hope of getting a letter of comfort stating that its regulations complied with EC law. The adverse ruling is also believed to have been prompted by a complaint to the Commission from one or more IDBs in the eurobond market.</p>

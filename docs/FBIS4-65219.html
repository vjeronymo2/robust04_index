			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Henrik Qvortrup report from the "Political Analysis" </F> column: "Pia Kjaersgaard Is in the Pocket of the Liberal and  Conservative People's Parties"]    [Text] The reaction was of the laid-back  variety: We'll have to wait and see. Let's leave the details  to later. We'll work it out.    That was the tune from Denmark's nonsocialist parties  yesterday after the Progress Party leadership had made public in  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE the party's very considerable demands that  are the price of the necessary votes to support a possible  future nonsocialist government.    Hereafter, no one need believe that three or four  no-nonsense  demands from Pia Kjaersgaard a good way in advance of the  elections can in any way disconcert Uffe Ellemann-Jensen  (Liberal Party) and Hans Engell (Conservative People's Party).  The two leading nonsocialist figures know the real political  landscape in 1994 too well for that.    It is quite simple.    It is true that the Progress Party's seats are an absolute  mathematical prerequisite along the road toward a  Conservative-Liberal government, but it is just as inevitable a  conclusion that Pia Kjaersgaard's troops really have no  alternative but to support the formation of a  Conservative-Liberal government. For who would the Progress  Party people otherwise choose to support -- Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen, for example?    It is thoughts of this nature that are currently reassuring  the Liberal Party and the Conservatives. And that have led to  the slighting indulgent nonsocialist reactions to the Progress  Party's extremely no-nonsense demands.    For Engell and Ellemann-Jensen can note with satisfaction  that for the foreseeable future the Progress Party will not find  itself in any key position that can even begin to be compared  with that which the Radical Liberals have exploited so  skillfully for quite a few years.    For while parties of the center can always make political  capital out of the mere threat of moving toward the opposite end  of the political spectrum, things are not so easy for the  Progress Party:    The party cannot bet on two horses. It has  support for the Liberals and the Conservatives -- or nothing.    This is why party leader Pia Kjaersgaard finds herself in  difficulties when she is asked what her and her party's threat  to the Conservatives and the Liberals really amounts  to.    In the past -- this was in [Progress Party founder] Mogens  Glistrup's day -- the threat was clear: Here the party was  always ready to play the role of totally unpredictable player.  A party that no one dared count on when it came to forming a  majority.    That threat is scarcely real any more. After years out in  the political cold the Progress Party is longing for the tiniest  scrap of political influence, and Pia Kjaersgaard is the last  person to want a return to the seventies' and eighties'  semi-anarchist conditions in the Progress Party.    In the light of this, Pia Kjaersgaard's latest statements  should probably be interpreted as a way of reassuring the  party's grass roots who to an increasing extent are seeking real  results at the national level in return for their support:    There must be no doubt among party officials that the  party's  flagship issues are at least being fought for.    And there is something else that reflects the relative  strengths of the three nonsocialist parties.    Pia Kjaersgaard has already -- at a time before a  Liberal-Conservative-Progress Party majority is a reality --  suffered several defeats at the hands of the Liberals and  Conservatives.    First there was the question of government involvement.    Pia Kjaersgaard considered it "natural" that the Progress  Party should have ministerial posts. That ambition has been  shelved -- everybody has now admitted that at best the party's  role will be that of parliamentary support party.    Then there was the question of foreign and EU [European  Union] policy. Pia Kjaersgaard's move recently was that these  issues should be included "from the outset" in the written  platform of a future government.    "Out of the question," both Engell and Ellemann-Jensen  immediately thundered. And that is how things were left.    The lesson seems therefore to be that in the final analysis  the two big nonsocialist parties can do what they like with the  Progress Party.    Nevertheless, the latest demands from the Progress Party  have  caught the Liberal and Conservative party leaders off balance.  Not so much because of their content, but rather because of the  negative signal value this "visual interference" has.    The truth is that what Engell and Ellemann-Jensen fear more  than anything else is that the impression will become widespread  among voters that there "is always some row" surrounding the  Liberal, Conservative, and Progress parties.    This would -- as several politicians have pointed out -- be  a  real gift. Particularly to the Social Democrats who would, for  example, fight the forthcoming election campaign by conjuring up  the vision of the Liberal Party, the Conservative People's  Party, and the Progress Party as an unserious and unreliable  alliance that does not represent a credible alternative to the  incumbent government.</p>

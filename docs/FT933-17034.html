			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Shocking words upset the EC's oldest family BARELY 10 days ago, on the eve of the EC summit in Copenhagen, shocking words were spoken in a remote committee room of the German Bundestag. 'Maastricht is dead,' was one of the more dramatic expressions. 'Social cohesion,' alias trade protectionism, was trumpeted as the answer to Europe's economic misery. The negotiations for liberalisation of the Gatt were denounced as dangerous, irrelevant and unnecessary. The perpetrators of these heresies, for that is how they sounded in the German parliament, were not German parliamentarians, but a dozen leading French deputies. The vehemence of their attack took their German hosts by surprise. The mood in Paris is certainly causing some concern in Bonn, just as the contrary is no doubt true, that Germany is obsessed with its internal problems of unification. There is tension on the age-old issue of free trade versus protectionism; there is tension over monetary policy, and the determination of the Bundesbank to cut its high interest rates at a tortoise-like pace; there are clear disagreements over policy towards the former Yugoslavia, with Bonn's frustration at its powerlessness self-evident. And yet, in spite of it all, the Franco-German relationship remains, apparently unperturbed, if just a little anxious. 'There are problems like this in every family,' says an official of the German Bundesbank. The official in question was referring to the latest spat between Paris and Bonn sparked by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister. Whether under the influence of post-electoral euphoria, prompted by bare-faced cheek, or demonstrating a remarkable ignorance of German sensitivities, he announced in a radio broadcast on Thursday that he had summoned Mr Theo Waigel, his German counterpart, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, to a meeting in Paris the following day. His purpose was to give the pair a good dressing-down on Germany's high interest rates, and set the guidelines for proper co-ordination of Franco-German monetary policy, he suggested. When Mr Waigel promptly cancelled the meeting - a routine session of the Franco-German economic and finance council - there was scarcely any surprise in Bonn. For Mr Alphandery had dared to intrude on the sacred independence of the Bundesbank, and suggest that it could be subjected to political pressure. Mr Waigel dared not be seen as a co-conspirator. At the highest levels in Bonn, there is understanding for Mr Alphandery's dilemma. 'The French government has to survive an extraordinarily difficult first six months,' according to one well-placed official. 'The popular pressures for protectionism, and abandonment of the franc fort, are very real. But if Mr Balladur can get through the first six months, I think relations will be back on an even keel.' There is also nervousness. 'Each of these problems individually is manageable,' according to a parliamentary foreign affairs specialist. 'If they all come up together, then it will be difficult.' Yet there may be less sympathy in the country at large than there is in the corridors of power in Bonn, where relations with Paris are bound by 'cords of steel' in the words of a senior diplomat. One sensitive popular issue is former Yugoslavia, where German sympathies lie overwhelmingly with Croatia, and the Bosnian Moslems, and against the perceived aggression of Serbia. Perhaps even more explosive is the issue of bananas. France is seen as the prime mover behind another example of EC protectionism, which threatens to force up the price of Germany's cheap banana imports from Latin America by almost 100 per cent, in order to favour expensive fruit from French territories. 'It is to the French we owe these expensive bananas,' according to Ms Angelika Volle at the German foreign policy institute. 'That is one issue making public opinion in Germany less positive than that of the political leadership. 'The relationship has become less active, and more reactive. 'We still have to go along with them, but because there is no alternative,' Ms Volle said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC]  and the United States will hold another round of tariff talks  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  framework in Washington, D.C., next week.    "The coming negotiations are expected to focus on more than  1,200 agricultural products," said Chen Wu-hsiung, director of  economics and planning development for the Council of  Agriculture's [as received]. Chen added that the talks may also  cover non- agriculture products.    Chen, who will participate in the talks slated to begin May  12, said Taiwan will make some concessions in the consultations,  but he declined to elaborate. The ROC delegation will be led by  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng.    The US is expected to ask Taiwan to lift its existing import  bans and control measures, Chen said, but the Taiwan Government  will insist on some sort of protection for local farmers. For  instance, he said, import controls on citrus fruits, apples, and  pears will not be eased until after the year 2000.    The US first asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 8,048 products  last November as a condition for Taiwan to enter the  Geneva-based world trade body. It demanded Taiwan lower tariff  rates on industrial products to below 10 percent and on  agricultural goods to below 20 percent.    The two sides failed to reach agreement in the first round  of  formal consultations held here in February. The talks failed  after the US demanded a 50 percent tariff cut on all  agricultural products, which was 20 percent higher than Taiwan's  offer.    Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 under the name "Customs  territory of Taiwan, Kinmen and Matsu," and is expected to be  admitted before the end of this year.</p>

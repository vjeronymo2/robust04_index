			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of safety and security, Mr. Sydney  Mufamadi, and his deputy, Mr. Joe Matthews, say stability in the  country is among their priorities as social development will  depend on personal security and law and order to attract foreign  investment. The two men were addressing a news conference in  Pretoria after talks with the commissioner of Police, General  Johan van der Merwe. Mr. Mufamadi and Mr. Matthews are to hold  talks later this week with all police generals and former  homeland police commanders.</p>

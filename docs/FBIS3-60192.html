Dhar] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 11 Jan -- Pakistan's continued  interference in the internal situation in Afghanistan and the  guns-for-drugs policy of its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)  is a major factor contributing to renewed outbreak of civil war  in Afghanistan.    Most countries, including India, having been forced to  vacate  their missions in Kabul. Details are available, through  diplomatic sources, of the extent of outside interference and  the part played by the drug barons with disastrous consequences  for the war-ravaged country which is finding it impossible to  return to normalcy.    India, like other countries, had reopened its mission in  Kabul after the Jalalabad accord as a result of which Prof.  Borhanoddin Rabbani was installed President and Mr. Golboddin  Hekmatyar as Prime Minister. During the U.S-backed anti-Soviet  operations in Afghanistan, Mr. Hekmatyar operated entirely from  Pakistan territory and in the installation of the  Rabbani-Hekmatyar team, the Pakistanis and the Saudis felt  confident that a regime which would be dictated to by them had  been put in place.    Most countries now seem to feel that outside interference in  Afghanistan's internal affairs, including arms supplies the  Mojahedin groups, must stop and the people should be allowed to  take charge of their affairs and elect their representatives on  the basis of a national consensus.    Despite Pakistan's backing, Mr. Hekmatyar was unable to  function and could not even open his office for fear of  retaliation by Ahmad Shah Mas'ud whom he had ousted from the  interim Government.    With Mas'ud and the Uzbek General Dostam having been pushed  out, many countries, including India, had doubted whether the  Jalalabad accord would last. They were proved right and Prime  Minister Hekmatyar, who has not been officially dismissed by  President Rabbani so far despite his having staged a coup  against him, has joined forces with his arch rival General  Dostam who has several thousand men in arms in the northern  region.    India shares the concern of the international community at  the deterioration in the situation in Afghanistan and feels that  a genuine reconciliation must take place and forces of  stabilisation, instead of fundamentalism, should be encouraged  to take charge of affairs and helped materially to undertake the  task of economic reconstruction.    Under the Jalalabad accord, President Rabbani and commanders  from all 29 provinces were supposed to elect a Defence Minister  by 22 July last, but this did not happen and Mr. Mas'ud began  mobilising the Pathans for an assault on all centres of power.  Mr. Hekmatyar's efforts to wean away his followers did not  succeed and with the U.S. having called off its Afghanistan  operation, huge sums of money which were once channelled through  Pakistan were no longer available.    Another factor is the prospect of the Pathans, who  constitute  about 45 per cent of the country's population losing their  dominance in all walks of life. It is also obvious that the  self-willing people of Afghanistan who have always fought for  their independence, are unwilling to accept the rigidities of  Islamic fundamentalism which are sought to be imposed on them by  several countries which spent considerable sums of money to  finance the war against the Soviets and, later, President  Najibollah.    With itself fully involved in drug trafficking to raise  resources for financing insurgency in other countries, the ISI  encouraged the drugs trade which had got disrupted during the  Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.    The Soviet occupation disrupted old smuggling routes between  Afghanistan and Europe via Iran, Turkey and across the  Iran-Soviet border. These routes were patronised by itinerant  Afghans who traded in everything. The cutting up of these  routes deflected much of this trade South and East to Pakistan.  The Herati traders no longer went to Mashhad, but southeast to  Qandahar and Quetta, south along desert tracks to transhipment  point in Balochistan and near the Afghanistan-Pakistan-lran  trijunction.    The major border tribals--Wazir, Masud, Bhattani, Mangal,  Bangash, Orakzai, Afridi, Mohmand, Tarklarnri, Utman Khel--live  under their own war-like code of Pakhtunwali, still regard  themselves as free peoples, and remain adept at playing  Islamabad and Kabul off against each other. They continue to  resist the slow processes of the integration with Pakistan,  although younger Khans recognise that their desire for  electricity, roads and services (education and medicine) will  make them more dependent on the Government. The Afghanistan  conflict, during which most Pakhtuns supported the Afghan  Mojahedin, offered limited opportunities to play Kabul off  against Islamabad although the Afridis and Mohmands did try to  manipulate the conflict to protect their crossborder smuggling  and heroin interests.    The ISI has financed insurgency not only in Afghanistan  (where the operation was backed by the U.S.), but also in  Kashmir with disastrous consequences. President Rabbani has  been forced to appeal to several countries to come to his rescue  by condemning the coup in all international forums.</p>

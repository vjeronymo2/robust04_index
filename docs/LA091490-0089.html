			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: UNION STRESSES BILINGUAL SKILLS OF TEACHER  AIDES  </P> <P> A report released Thursday by a union representing 10,000 teacher assistants  threatening to strike asserts that they are the vital link in the effort to  educate the one in three students who speak English as a second language.  </P> <P> The 32-page "white paper" is designed to increase public understanding of the  assistants' role in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where only 5% of  teachers are bilingual.  </P> <P> By contrast, 68% of teaching assistants are bilingual.  </P> <P> The TAs, college students who work three to six hours a day, are using their  language skills to bolster their contract demands. "TAs are the only district  employees who do not receive any medical benefits, sick leave, holidays, or  vacation," said John Tanner, staff director for Service Employees Union, Local  99, which is representing the TAs in their first contract negotiations.  </P> <P> The TAs, who make $9.44 a hour, want the district to increase their wages and  give them the same benefits given to other employees.  </P></p>

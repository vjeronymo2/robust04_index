			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASANT DISCOVERY  </P> <P> My wife and I are fortunate in being able to travel frequently, both in the  United States and internationally. Recently we had the pleasure of flying on  Cathay Pacific Airways. I cannot praise Cathay Pacific too highly for the  outstanding in-flight service and the fine food that we encountered on all of  our trips. This was particularly noteworthy since we were traveling during a  heavy traffic period and the cabin was fully occupied. The purpose of this  letter is to share our discovery with your readers. I wish someone had told me  about Cathay Pacific long before I discovered it for myself.  </P> <P> ROGER H. SCHNAPP  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

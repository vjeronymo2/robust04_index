			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Three installments of serialized article by Qin Yongmin </F> (4440 3057 2404): "Peace Charter (Draft)" -- First three  paragraphs are editor's note.]  <H5>  [16 Nov 93 p 10] </H5>   [Text] The "Peace Charter (Draft)" which appeared in  Beijing on the 14th is a spontaneous democratic proclamation  seldom seen on the mainland in recent years, and quite capable  of shaking up both the Communist Party rulers and the mainland  democratic movement.    The charter was comprehensively revised and perfected  through the collection of signatures and a wide spectrum of  ideas, and clearly reveals that pluralistic democratic  government reforms are an unstoppable historical necessity. It  requests that the communist party in power act in good faith and  initiate a peaceful transformation of the political system from  top to bottom and reduce to a minimum the negative effects which  would disrupt the life of the masses.    "The Charter," on the principle that it is "operable,"  requests the communists eliminate "counter-revolutionary  crimes", open up restrictions on political parties, respect the  resolutions of the United Nations regarding human rights  questions, redress the wrongs of the "4 June" incident, release  all political prisoners, and establish a strategy for attaining  a pluralistic democracy. It also requests both sides of the  Straits initiate co-equal negotiations, call a roundtable  discussion, and promote peaceful unification. These suggestions  and procedures are the accumulated crystallization of the  thinking and struggling of the members of the people's movement  on the mainland over the past ten years and have the great  boldness of vision for driving history, a vision which  transcends the limitations of time and space. It is truly a rare  democratic document.    Over the past decade or more, tremendous changes have taken  place in the economic system on the mainland: We greatly admire  this fact.    However, as the facts of contemporary world history amply  testify, the rapid expansion of the market economy of necessity  requires the implementation of a pluralistic democratic  government.    In view of the fact that tremendous changes have occurred in  the present world order with the end of the cold war, we move  toward a new order.    In view of the fact that all Chinese are concerned for the  future peaceful development of China, towards this end we  specifically put forward this charter.    The many and varied examples of transformations in political  systems which have taken place in the past and in the present,  at home and abroad, compel us to worry deeply. If pluralistic  democratic government is an unstoppable historical necessity,  then we must ask ourselves: in China, will this process be  carried out peacefully or not?    We are convinced that within the ruling circles on the  Chinese mainland there are men of historical insight who also  have come to recognize the above stated problem and its urgency.  For this reason, the teachings of historical experience,  especially the example of the pros and cons of the former Soviet  Union and of Eastern Europe, are sufficient enough to cause both  the government officials and common people on the mainland who  still harbor antagonistic feelings to arrive at a sort of common  understanding.    Only when the government powerholders are sincere and it is  carried out in a systematic and peaceful manner from top to  bottom, can the negative effects of the historical  transformation of mainland China from a centralized to a  pluralistic to a democratic government, that is, the disruption  of the social and economic lives of the masses, be kept to a  minimum.    It should be pointed out that the turbulent tides of world  history and the unprecedentedly strong international forces of  democracy have not only caused the peaceful transformation of  China to become a popular cause, but have also provided various  necessary conditions for this transformation. The present  situation at home and abroad, considered from every angle,  absolutely will not allow a repetition of an incident like the  "4 June" massacre. At the same time, justice and reason do not  desire that a situation similar to that prior to 4 June, when  all social controls were lost, should ever happen again.    The key to the current question is this: This transformation  will be a blow to the upper classes of China's society and  certain persons who derive benefits therefrom and thus harbor a  negative, rejecting attitude toward such a change. At the same  time, the classes which are victims of the present system and  some individuals hold unavoidably extreme feelings. These two  conditions, both to a certain degree, have a negative effect  upon a peaceful and systematic political transformation.    As for the question about the two sides of the Taiwan  Straits, the key problem is not what form unification will take  or at what time it will happen, but rather upon what basis and  upon what type of mutual recognition will unification be based.    In accord with the above historical background, we, the  citizens of China, with a deep sense of the great mission facing  us, boldly step forward and call upon the government and the  governed of our whole nation. Basing our actions upon the  principle that "the interests of the entire nation override all  else" renouncing all past enmities, with mutual respect and  mutual accommodation, renouncing aggression and seeking  compromise, let us discuss the state of the nation and realize  the great reconciliation of the Chinese people. Let us seek in a  peaceful and safe manner to come together to accomplish the  great mission of the transformation of the political system of  the Chinese mainland and the peaceful unification of the two  sides of the Taiwan Straits.    We especially call to the attention of the members of all  levels of governing and governed, the fact that in order to  avoid the intensification of contradictions, which could lead to  loss of control of the process of political change which must be  forthcoming and which could cause the nation to slide into  anarchy, the present regime should from this moment onwards  begin to take all precautions necessary to avoid these troubles.  This applies especially to the present government on the Chinese  mainland, which most particularly has the responsibility to take  positive action at the earliest possible opportunity to  gradually ameliorate the political situation and to grasp the  present favorable opportunity and self-consciously conform to  the laws of historical development. Otherwise, they must bear  the greatest historical responsibility for the various  situations which might develop as mentioned above.    To avoid having the next chapter in China's political  history  again tread the vicious circle of the last hundred or so years,  with the premise of taking into full consideration the common  interests of the government and the public on both sides of the  Strait and in particular their individual special interests, we  solemnly recommend, specifically to the governments on the two  sides of the Strait, naturally first to the government on the  mainland, to the whole body of the Chinese people including  those on both sides of the Strait, in Hong Kong and Macao and  the minorities, and to our compatriots overseas, and to all  organizations at home and abroad who work for social progress,  the following workable procedure for the peaceful reconciliation  of the whole people.    1. We believe that the government of Mainland China does  represent China, and as a standing member nation of the Security  Council of the United Nations, has the duty to comply with all  resolutions of the United Nations regarding human rights and  should begin guaranteeing the human rights of the Chinese people  beginning with contemporary international standards and  immediately establish laws comparable with those of contemporary  democratic nations regarding person, speech, communication,  publication, assembly, organization (including lifting party  restrictions), travel and holding demonstrations, as well as the  free travel of citizens in and out of the nation's borders. It  should immediately eliminate "counter-revolutionary crimes" and  strictly carry this out under international supervision and  under the supervision of the people both within and outside the  country.    As a reciprocal gesture of good will, we appeal to the  masses  of the people to restrict their own inalienable rights to  assemble, travel and demonstrate, in normal times to the levels  of the present laws of the authorities, and reduce the social  unrest instigated by a politically motivated peaceful transition.    2. We appeal to the authorities in the mainland government  to  exhibit the great spirit of being controllers of a historical  transformation, and as soon as possible legislate and enforce  strategic measures for passing from centralized to pluralistic  forms, and then establish and make complete a democratic system  of government, creating the conditions under which the processes  of the transformation of the mainland government can be carried  out from beginning to end in a context which the central  government can control and adjust.  <H5>  [17 Nov 93 p 18] </H5>   3. Under the premise that the mainland government recognizes  the previous two articles, we then appeal to the whole body  politic and all advanced forces at home and abroad to respect  the government of the mainland as the one force which is capable  of leading the peaceful transformation of the mainland, to  actively and voluntarily cooperate with them, to provide various  types of workable and constructive suggestions, to lay aside the  terrible disputes which are not related to the main issues, and  strive to form with the present authorities a beneficial  relationship of mutual aid in which both sides push for progress  in reconciliation.    4. We earnestly urge the mainland government to make the  first initial necessary gesture of reconciliation, that is to  immediately redress the wrongs of the "4 June" incident, set  free all political prisoners incarcerated because of "4 June"  and other such reasons, making no differentiation regarding  political beliefs and factions, and give an appropriate amount  of recompense to all those who suffered in the "4 June" incident  and others or their families who suffered political harm.    When the mainland government truly exhibits sincerity  towards  reconciliation, we call upon those who have suffered and their  families, and members of society at all levels to adopt a  forward-looking attitude and no longer seek to ascertain the  general responsibility for "4 June" and various later political  incidents.    5. We call upon the Chinese Communist Party and its  government to remove the legal prohibitions placed upon all  political exiles, and allow all students, labor movement  personnel, and other such persons in exile abroad to return to  China.    We believe that China's problems can only be solved by the  Chinese people themselves, in China. For this reason, we call  upon all who truly aspire to dedicate themselves to the  motherland to immediately return to China and join in China's  economic modernization and political democratization.    6. On the day when, according to modern international  standards, laws regarding forming associations are legislated  and implemented and restrictions on political parties are  lifted; that is, when all non-violent political parties at home  and abroad may legally register their existence; at that time,  all societies and organizations and political parties should  proceed promptly to the concerned department to register and be  recorded. At the present time we thus call upon all concerned  sides to initiate, under the principles of openness, legality  and non-violence, with planning and with skill, an ideological  movement which will not disturb the order of society, and use  this as the means of exerting pressure to attain human rights  and the minimum limits which a democratic movement should  possess. After it is possible to legally register, then of  course these should continue to be the principles employed.    7. We call upon the governments on both sides of the Taiwan  Straits to immediately start direct negotiations regarding these  problems. We believe that the cohesiveness of the Chinese people  is great enough to peacefully unify Taiwan and the mainland. For  this reason, we call upon the authorities on the mainland to  formally put away the proposition of use of force to settle  problems, and treat the Kuomintang Party, the Peoples  Progressive Party and other political parties of Taiwan as  equals; when conditions are ripe, welcome the expansion of the  Taiwanese political parties onto the mainland. We also call upon  all levels of government and the public in Taiwan at such a time  to also, in a like manner, welcome the expansion of the mainland  political parties, including the Communist Party, onto Taiwan,  and thus finally accomplish the social and political conformity  of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. We also call upon the  Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan to discard their proposal  of an "Independent Taiwan" and to actively work for the cause of  democratic progress of all of China, including the mainland,  Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.    8. We call upon the mainland government to completely  respect  the self-governing rights of the peoples of Hong Kong and Macao,  and handle problems occurring after their reunion with the  mainland under the principles of sovereignty belonging to the  center and administrative rights belonging to the localities,  fully respecting the freedom of choice of the local peoples  regarding their social, political and economic systems and their  style of life.  <H5>  [18 Nov 93 p 18] </H5>   9. We call upon the various nationalities throughout the  nation to protect the great unity of the Chinese people, and at  the same time call upon the government to handle the problems of  each of the nationalities in accordance with modern  international standards, fully respecting the right of self-  determination of the minorities, and laying aside the worn-out  concept of preserving a unified domain through violent means.  10. On the basis that the preceding articles are accepted by  all sides, and this naturally means that first they are  basically accepted by the mainland government, we suggest that  in a speedy manner a roundtable discussion be called, with  government and public personnel of various callings from the  mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and the nationalities and  others from home and abroad participating, to discuss and  resolve in common the next stage of the peaceful transformation  and the peaceful unification of the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait. Naturally, in accordance with the needs of the objective  situation, a great many bilateral and multilateral preparatory  meetings could take place beforehand, and the peaceful  transformation and peaceful reunification talks could be carried  out at separate roundtable discussions according topics or  differences.    We believe that the above articles not only are in  accordance  with the basic interests of the Chinese people, but also are the  rational requirements of the next chapter in Chinese history.  We especially beg the mainland government to understand our  good intentions and accept our proposal for the peaceful  reconciliation of the entire people.    We call upon all Chinese and all the descendants of the  emperors living abroad to join their signatures and voices with  ours to convey our common desire for a peaceful political  transformation of the mainland and the peaceful reunification of  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.    The "Peace Charter" is a free and public informal  organization composed of all Chinese people at home and abroad,  without differentiation as to political affiliation, who accept  and agree with this charter and who as individuals and  organizations strive to achieve a peaceful transition to a  unified and democratic China wherein pluralistic political  forces coexist and carry out all sorts of public, lawful  activities.    The "Peace Charter" welcomes all persons who agree with its  viewpoint both at home and abroad and who will effectively  support and participate in its work -- initiating collection of  signatures, widespread propaganda, and carrying out other  activities within the limits permitted and guaranteed by the  present day constitution and laws.    The "Peace Charter" emphasizes most emphatically and deeply  respects the Chinese Communists and their government as the only  social force which is capable of leading the mainland in  peacefully completing the change from centralized to pluralistic  democracy. This is a fact that we sincerely hope will facilitate  the Chinese Communists to shoulder this immense historical  mission, and we most strongly urge them to not miss this last  opportunity.    The measures which the "Peace Charter" proposes are only  those measures which we deem workable under the present  conditions, and are offered mostly to elicit better suggestions.  There is no need to be restricted by its wording. However, we  firmly believe that the spirit of this charter's proposal to  realize the systematic and peaceful transformation under the  leadership of the present governments not only conforms to the  greatest interests of the Chinese people and the mainland  government, but also is the only rational choice for  contemporary China.    The signatories to the Peace Charter include persons from  all  walks of life; together they are the sponsors of this charter  and bear the responsibility for the charter. At the same time,  they have selected three spokespersons who have full authority  to represent the "Peace Charter" in any talks with the  governments on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and in any  public meeting held at home or abroad. The distributed copies of  this charter, due to their extreme importance, become effective  upon being signed by one of the signatories or by a  spokesperson. Every signatory to this document has a mission  to accept the signatures of persons from all walks of life and  to initiate all types of activities, and to carry out special  assignments with persons of all levels who are committed to this  charter, all bearing together as one the responsibility. Let us  work together with all Chinese people everywhere for the  peaceful transformation of the mainland and the peaceful  unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.

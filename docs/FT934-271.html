			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / UK shares hit all-time high as world markets rise again The UK stock market made a powerful return from the Christmas holiday yesterday with the FT-SE 100 Index gaining 49.7 points to reach an all-time high of 3,462.0. This marked its third largest daily gain of the year - although not in percentage terms. Retail stocks and banks led the market forward as London caught up with record performances this week by other world markets and also anticipated lower interest rates and continued UK economic recovery. Favourable reports on Christmas trading from the retail sector encouraged investors, whose expectation that domestic interest rates will fall in the new year were buttressed by firmness in sterling and in UK government bonds. However, some analysts now warn that any cut in base rates may be held back until the spring when domestic consumers will feel the effects of tax increases introduced in the Budget. Government optimism over the economy and housing market reports from the Halifax, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, also boosted investor confidence. The FT-SE 100 index closed well below the day's best reading of 3,474.2 but was still 1.5 per cent up on the session. On December 1, it registered a rise of 66.3 points or 2.1 per cent. Yesterday a strong premium on the FT-SE futures March contract again provided a lead. Share prices were higher from the start of trading as international stocks traded in the London market, which had been closed since Christmas Eve, took on board strong performances recorded in Hong Kong, Tokyo and in other world stock markets earlier this week. Outside the UK, the markets which have risen the most this year - in Asia - sustained their rallies as equities wobbled across continental Europe. New highs were registered in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Pakistan. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched to a another record closing high, gaining 0.56 points to 3,794.33. In continental Europe, Germany fell for the second successive day, closing around the 2,280 mark, although the French CAC-index registered a new closing high. Spanish stocks dropped another 1.5 per cent after Tuesday's 1.3 per cent fall, shaken and apprehensive after the Bank of Spain dismissed the entire board of Banesto, the country's fourth biggest bank.

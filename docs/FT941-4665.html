			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Economic Viewpoint: What's wrong with economics The Death of Economics is the misleading title of a hyped-up book by Paul Ormerod out on March 21. Careful reading shows that the author does not want to bury but to reconstruct economics. Having become chief forecaster for the National Institute of Economic and Social Research at a precocious age, Ormerod should have both the team leadership and the computational skills to make a serious effort to do so later; but this book is not it. It is easy for Ormerod to score some good hits. While the book was being written, forecasters failed to predict the Japanese recession, the strength of the US recovery or the depth of the collapse in the German economy. And Ormerod is right to condemn the way in which too many economists will describe someone as a 'sociologist' as a superior form of putdown. He wrongly assumes, however, that the only opposition to economic scholasticism comes from the left of the political spectrum, at points between Marx and Galbraith. He seems not to know the equally trenchant criticisms from, for instance, the 'Austrian' school - not merely the card-carrying members but others, such as the more empirical Schumpeter, who concentrated on entrepreneurial initiative and poured scorn on 'perfect competition'. For a while I thought that his book was going to be merely another attack on Thatcherism and Reaganism disguised as an attack on economics. Fortunately there is more to the book than that. But Ormerod repeats like a mantra Lady Thatcher's remark, 'There is no such thing as society', as if merely citing it were a knock-out blow. For a demonstration that this saying can bear a civilised and sensible interpretation, I must modestly refer readers to a publication of my own in the accompanying list. Ormerod seems half to believe that Thatcher-Reagan economic policies are based on esoteric, modern General Equilibrium Theory or its close relation, the New Classical Macroeconomics. Indeed, he accuses Conservative ministers, as others have done, of not appreciating the extremely unlikely conditions required for free competition between numerous agents to promote a perfect allocation of resources. In fact, neither political leader has been influenced by the New Classicals or even been much aware of them. The economist who influenced Thatcher in her formative period was Hayek, who was of course light years from current New Classical orthodoxy both in style and in substance. He saw markets as 'discovery procedures' which are never in equilibrium and never produce an optimum, but are the least bad method we know of co-ordinating the activities of millions of human beings without having to make excessive demands on their mutual knowledge and love. Thatcher was also influenced by Hayek's assertion of a relation between a free society and market capitalism  -topics dismissed by the New Classicals as 'not economics'. Nearer to his home ground, Ormerod's attempt to attribute ultra free market policies to mainstream economists flies in the face of all empirical evidence. The Thatcher era began with the famous letter by 364 economists denouncing the 1981 Budget - which was much like the last Budget under a prime minister and chancellor from a very different wing of the Conservative party. At the end, the Institute of Economic Affairs was discomfited to find that the majority of the economists it polled deliberately distanced themselves from government policies, above all the attempts to curb public spending. A less pretentious but better-focused critique of current academic economics appeared last year by the German-American monetary economist, Thomas Mayer, entitled Truth versus Precision. Mayer admits to favouring competitive capitalism but to having an interest in income redistribution - for instance via a negative income tax. He was, also, ejected from the hardline monetarist Shadow Open Market Committee for deviationism - all of which biases me in his favour. Yet his book contains many passages which could equally occur in the supposedly unique Ormerod book. He reports cynicism among younger, ambitious academics, who follow practices such as 'sticking in the maths' so that their articles can be published and they can obtain tenure. Another example of the folklore of the profession is remarks by graduate students that 'policy is for simpletons'. Mayer focuses on the practices of economists in the most prestigious American universities. He complains that precision and mathematical elegance, which have a legitimate place, have come to play a dominating role in economics which they do not have even in the natural sciences. Like Ormerod, Mayer regards what is called the New Classical Economics as, on balance, a retrograde influence. The main propositions of this school are: that economic agents behave as if they know the correct model; that markets normally clear without surpluses or shortages. The New Classicals are probably best known to practitioners in the financial markets through the more extreme form of the 'efficient markets' hypothesis  -which is difficult to reconcile with the recent shake-out in the bond market, let alone the equity crashes of 1929 or 1987. Beneath the surface populism, it is Ormerod, not Mayer, who emphasises the mathematical side of economics. His real crusade is against what he calls the linear view of mainstream economics. The issue can be safely left to the modern economics industry with its heavy mathematical bent. Indeed, it is beginning to use non-linear relationships, for instance by introducing chaos theory. I wish I could be so confident of its ability to handle policy problems. Ormerod's own practical contribution is to point out that the Phillips curve linking unemployment to inflation is liable to shift its position quite suddenly. But during any one period, unemployment circles around a surprisingly stable rate, and normal economic policies seem powerless to shift the position of that 'attractor point'. This point bears a suspicious relation to our old friend the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (or NAIRU), which Ormerod has spent several chapters trying to kill. Ormerod rightly complains that forecasting models downplay the role of profits, which appears as a residual. He himself has a medium-term model which relates economic growth to the profit share. But he has, as far as I can tell, no better explanation than anyone else of why the underlying unemployment rate has moved so adversely (outside the US) in recent decades; and in his policy recommendations he falls back on work-sharing, which is for an economist the equivalent of showing the white flag. What has gone wrong with economics is not that mysterious. It has been the over-emphasis on economic technique as opposed to underlying ideas. Both the Keynesian revolution and the monetarist counter-revolution arose from problems thrown up by real events, while the New Classical school was a development internal to academic economics. The result, as Mayer points out more clearly than Ormerod, is that people interested in policy are turning more and more to schools of government or management consultants, a process which has its costs, as we see with Clinton's trade policies. But in the end the academic market, like others, will have to correct itself. Books cited Paul Ormerod, The Death of Economics, Faber, Pounds 14.99 (to be published March 21).

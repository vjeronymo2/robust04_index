Needle loss came to a halt a few years ago, but during  the last two years it has increased again. Now, 20 percent of  all trees suffer from needle loss. In general, forest growth is  still satisfactory, although, in more sensitive areas, one can  see various symptoms of stress on the trees.    Needle loss among Finnish conifers is average, based on  European standards. In Finland and Sweden, between 10 and 20  percent of all trees are damaged, and, for example, in Norway,  Estonia, Germany, and Poland, the figure is 20 percent. The  forests in Czechoslovakia are in the worst shape: Almost 60  percent of the trees are damaged.    Needle loss is used as a measure of tree vitality, or, in  other words, their ability to survive, grow, and produce seeds.  A tree has suffered needle loss if it has lost more than 20  percent of its needles, and it has been damaged if it has  dropped 25 percent.    Researcher Martti Lindgren does not believe that air  pollution has any significant effect on needle loss. In the  southern parts of Finland, nitrogen and sulfur emissions have,  in part, caused needle loss among pines.    ``Aside from areas in the vicinity of emission sources,  densely populated areas, and roadside areas, needle loss is  primarily caused by the aging of trees and by unfavorable  climate and weather factors,'' said Lindgren. He spoke about  needle loss studies at a research convention arranged by the  Forest Research Institute in Vantaa.    The greatest needle loss has been suffered by conifers in  Lapland. Also, spruce forests in Kainuu suffer from needle loss.  Pine forests on the south coast and in Ostrobothnia have  suffered more needle loss than in other parts of southern  Finland.    Needle loss has been suffered by 38.5 percent of all spruce  and 11.5 percent of all pine. The defoliation percentage for  deciduous trees is 18.</p>

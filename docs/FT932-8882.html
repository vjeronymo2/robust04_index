			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Home Office to come under police fire over spending curbs THE HOME OFFICE is likely to come under fire today over plans to limit government spending on the police service. Police authorities and chief constables are to press senior Home Office officials for further details. The change away from the current arrangement, under which the Home Office provides 51 per cent of local authority spending on policing, will come as part of the reorganisation announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, in March. Mr Clarke will address the Police Federation conference this week. At last year's conference he used his first big speech as home secretary to announce a wide-ranging inquiry into the structure of the police service. While his announcement was welcomed at the time for giving chief constables greater authority over their budgets, the police and local authorities have since become more cautious about the proposals. When Mr Clarke appears at the Blackpool conference on Wednesday he will see that the service's instinct for suspicion has heightened over the past 12 months. He will face heavy criticism for failing to involve police representatives in advance consultations on what are likely to prove the biggest changes in modern times. The inquiry, chaired by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, will report by the end of next month. It will almost certainly lead to a flatter management structure, the abolition of some senior ranks above inspector level, and a form of performance or task-related pay. Mr Clarke, while awaiting Sir Patrick's report, has done his own detective work in areas outside the inquiry's scope. As a result he has started plans to restructure police authorities into smaller, more businesslike bodies with national objectives and fewer local authority representatives. Police officers of all ranks, worried that a giant programme for change will gather pace before they have had formal opportunities to influence it, have launched a campaign to win public support. In an attempt to present the service's case widely, the Association of Chief Police Officers has taken the unusual step of publishing a fact sheet designed to 'unravel some of the mythology about the role of the police'. The document, issued with the support of the Superintendents' Association and the federation - which represents all other ranks - is being sent to influential people in local communities. The changes proposed by Mr Clarke also worry local authorities. Some senior local government figures fear that, in practice, the move could lead to a cash limit on all current police spending. The proportion of police spending met by local authorities will be brought under even tighter control. There are also concerns about how central government grant will be allocated, now that the Home Office is abandoning the system of recommended levels for police forces. The representatives at today's meeting with Home Office officials are likely to seek assurances about levels of police funding under the new arrangement. One Whitehall official described the change as a 'Faustian' deal in which the Home Office won Treasury agreement to its plan only because it is seen as a way of imposing a ceiling on the Pounds 6bn-a-year police budget. The change is not due until 1995-96 because it requires legislation which will not be introduced until the autumn at the earliest. A study carried out for the Sheehy inquiry last month by Ernst &amp; Young and Towers Perrin, management consultants, showed that, while many forces have reformed their management structures there has been little reduction in management costs over the past two years. Mr Clarke has kept his pledge to await the Sheehy inquiry's report rather than charging into change; but this is just the sort of evidence he will use when, in about a month's time, he dons his riot gear and gives himself the signal to charge.

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hunter Saphir suspended on bid talks SHARES IN Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce and herbs and spices company, were suspended yesterday as the company announced it was in 'advanced discussions' with a possible bidder. Berisford International, the commodities and property group, has a 19.8 per cent stake in Hunter Saphir's ordinary shares, as well as some preference shares, following a 1986 asset swap. However, it is understood Berisford is a willing seller of its stake to a third party and has been involved in the discussions. The Saphir family is the other main shareholder and owns more than 20 per cent of the company. A number of possible suitors were rumoured to be behind the talks. These include food and agribusiness group Dalgety and Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution concern. Dalgety was thought to have previously approached Hunter Saphir, in early 1991, but the companies could not agree on price. According to analysts, the recent fall in Hunter Saphir's share price made it vulnerable to predators. The company has been hit by low volumes at its new British Pepper and Spice factory in Northampton. That, and unsuccessful forays into areas like popcorn, have overshadowed the shares which have been falling since 1989 and touched 27p last October. They were suspended at 36p. Hunter Saphir said a further announcement would be made today.</p>

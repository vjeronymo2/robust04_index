			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / As They Say in Europe: More sex please, we're British Today, all being well, I shall hear what the Germans and the British think of each other. Top journalists from each side will tell me about 'British-German National Stereotypes and the Media' at the Goethe Institute in London. This to stop the British depicting the Germans as ranting madmen in leather coats or potbellied drunks in leather shorts. But I dread it. As a patriot I think of the Island Race as honest, upstanding, decent and so on. But recent events have only confirmed the German impression that we are, in the words of Reiner Gatermann, London correspondent of Die Welt, 'obsessed with sex'. The Anglo-Saxon concern with other people's sex lives remains of some, but dwindling, interest to most of our neighbours. The British are for their part fascinated by the different attitudes in France, where a law on privacy reinforces the national preference for ignorance about what happens behind others' bedroom doors. Few take much interest in Germany either, where attitudes are just as easy-going. Many years ago the papers there reported that a politician was robbed in a park; they did not mention that he was with a prostitute at the time even though the fact was common knowledge. The one occasion when the ban seemed to be lifted was in the case of the skater Katarina Witt, but that was because of her alleged involvement with the East German regime - and the note in the daily record kept by the Stasi (secret police) read: 'Sexual intercourse: 8 minutes.' German journalists can reel off a list of public figures and name their mistresses. Yet the British stereotype of the Germans excludes relaxed, irregular relationships; I had always assumed a German mistress would have to be registered at a local Liaisons Registration Office, or Stadtischeverhaltnismeldeamt. But this is not so. The only expert on German sexual attitudes I have come across is Anne McElvoy of The Times, now in Moscow. She originally made her name writing from Berlin. In another publication some time ago she recounted her experiences at the hands of German men who sought a a deeper relationship with her. As I have never been an attractive young woman and, anyway, have led a life of invincible chastity, I am unable to vouch for the accuracy of her observations, but they ring true. They can be confirmed by those monumentally anaphrodisiac films on late-night German television which consist of what one might call Tyrolean erotica. It is evident that the notorious streak of romanticism in the German soul does not extend to transactions between the sexes. If German attitudes resemble the French, their basis is entirely different. Many leaders of the Third Reich demonstrated that a seamlessly respectable domestic life did not preclude revolting excesses elsewhere. This provides the other side of a coin familiar to readers of this paper: a colourful and varied emotional life does not preclude political integrity. The French don't even make that connection: for them the acquisition of a mistress is a reward of success which not only marks out the man, but gives the woman a useful leg up the ladder of life. In Germany, attitudes are based on the view 'boys will be boys'. The Germans ally their preparedness to accept the inevitable with a tolerance of self-indulgence unknown in Anglo-Saxon puritanism. 'Illicit' sex is a safety valve. Maybe writing about sex is the British safety valve. Certainly I am sometimes surprised by the concerns of many of my colleagues - and then think that they must have much more fun than I do in pursuing their professional interests. As the man from The Sun said to me: 'It's more interesting than the Belgian budget.' Perhaps I too suffer from the real vice anglais, prurient voyeurism. In his recent reporting of the British scene, Die Welt's Gatermann has been most struck by the scale of the investigative resources deployed in reporting MPs' sex lives. It was inspired by the apparent contrast between what government ministers were preaching and what they were practising. 'I would not like to dig into the private lives of people who are so sanctimonious,' Gatermann told me. He meant the lives of the journalists, not the politicians. Today's Goethe Institute seminar is designed to tackle the 'negative aspects' of stereotypes like, presumably, 'the British are obsessed by sex.' But what if they are founded on fact?

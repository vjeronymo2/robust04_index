			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ONE COLORADO' PROJECT MOVES STEP CLOSER TO CONSTRUCTION;  </P> <P> DIRECTORS OK CONCEPT FOR OLD TOWN PROJECT, BUT PRESERVATIONISTS MAY FIGHT IT  </P> <P> The controversial One Colorado project, the last and largest component in the  redevelopment of Old Pasadena, won unanimous concept approval from the Board of  Directors on Tuesday despite the protests of preservationists.  </P> <P> The project, previously called the Marketplace, has been delayed for 16 years  as preservationists, city officials and a string of developers have struggled  over a variety of proposals to turn a block of historic buildings into an  upscale shopping center.  </P> <P> But Tuesday, the board threw its support behind a design from San Francisco  developer Douglas Stitzel that abandons previous proposals to build a mall  behind the buildings' facades.  </P> <P> Several board members were upset with the amount of demolition needed in  Stitzel's design, but all of the directors agreed that it was time to move  forward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Several Conditions Imposed  </P> <P> "While I am not happy with this project, I'm less happy with no project," said  Director Rick Cole.  </P> <P> The board imposed several conditions on the project to lessen damage to the  site, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. The conditions  include limitations on the grading of alleys and the maximum height of  buildings.  </P> <P> Stitzel has proposed a design that even some preservationists say is ingenious.  </P> <P> The design calls for ground-floor entrances to shops on both the first and  second floors.  </P> <P> To accomplish this, the front entrance of several buildings would lead down a  few steps to a first floor several feet lower than the street. The entrances to  other shops in the rear would lead up a few steps to a second floor slightly  above the street.  </P> <P> The design doubles the amount of valuable space accessible from the street. The  plan also includes a new three-story building on Union Street that would house  restaurants, shops and six movie theaters.  </P> <P> The board's review of the 336,000-square-foot project was the most critical  hurdle in the city approval process.  </P> <P> Although the project will undergo a series of more detailed reviews in the  coming months, concept approval sets the foundation of what will be accepted in  the future.  </P> <P> The Community Development Commission, which reviews projects in a redevelopment  area, gave its approval last month.  </P> <P> The Design Commission also reviewed the project last month but voted to delay a  decision until an additional environmental study is completed. Stitzel appealed  the decision to the Board of Directors, which overruled the commission Tuesday.  </P> <P> Stitzel, who bought the property in December with several partners, said he was  pleased with the board's action and relieved that the $75-million project has  received concept approval. Stitzel estimates construction could be completed by  early 1991.  </P> <P> Preservationists, however, say the real battle over One Colorado has just  begun.  </P> <P> The preservation group, Pasadena Heritage, is considering legal action to halt  the project, which it believes would destroy the architectural and historical  fabric of the area.  </P> <P> Claire Bogaard, executive director of the group, said Stitzel's project  requires too many changes to the facades and alleys on the block. She said up  to 80% of some buildings would be demolished.  </P> <P> While some aspects of the new design are an improvement over previous  proposals, others are worse, such as the extensive relocation of existing  floors and walls, Bogaard said.  </P> <P> Bogaard said construction of the project could jeopardize the site's status on  the National Register of Historic Places.  </P> <P> "Let's get this project done, but let's get it done right," Bogaard said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Proposed in 1983  </P> <P> Construction of a shopping center on the block of 16 buildings located at the  intersection of Colorado Boulevard and Fair Oaks Avenue was first proposed in  1983 by developer John Patrick Wilson.  </P> <P> Wilson believed that the only way to attract shoppers was to build a modern  mall behind the facades of the buildings. An open atrium walkway would have  been bored through the buildings, like the one used in the Plaza Pasadena mall.  </P> <P> Preservationists attacked the proposal at glitzy, phony and historically  outrageous.  </P> <P> Wilson's plans crumbled in 1987 because of financial problems and the project  was sold, first to CMC Capital Corp. and then to Pierce/Lange Development.  </P> <P> Both groups adhered to the mall concept and both ran into similar financial  problems.  </P> <P> Stitzel's group, Pasadena Preservation Associates, bought the project in  December. The group says it already has the financial backing to complete  construction.  </P> <P> Stitzel said he believes that his design causes far less damage to the  buildings than previous proposals.  </P></p>

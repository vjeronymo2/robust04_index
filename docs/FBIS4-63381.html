			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovsky] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Director of the Middle East  and Africa department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Viktor  Posuvalyuk told ITAR-TASS by telephone today that the number of  Russians in Algeria had substantially decreased during the  recent period due to the evacuation of the wives and children of  Russian specialists and employees of different organisations.  Their total number now equals to 1,100 people. Various ways  are being studied to ensure their security, including probable  further reductions, he stressed. However, the recall of Russian  experts from several sectors of the economy, which are vitally  important for Algeria, is linked with definite difficulties,  which may affect both friendly Algeria and Russia.    Touching on his Thursday meeting with Algerian ambassador to  Moscow, Posuvalyuk explained that the demand to toughen security  measures in order to protect Russian specialists, handed to the  Algerian side, was "worded in the most resolute form". The  sides also discussed ways to "approach the very concept of this  security from a new angle, in particular, to lodge the Russians  more compactly, which would make it easier for the Algerian law  enforcement bodies to ensure their protection".    The ambassador stressed the difficulties with which the  Algerian police was now confronted. It was decided to establish  closer contacts of the Russian Embassy and the Algerian  contractors with the local security services.</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries overcome early unease over interest rates The US bond market regained its poise yesterday afternoon after suffering earlier from jitters over currency rates and monetary policy. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/32 lower at 86 13/16 , with the yield rising to 7.346 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 5/16 , to yield 5.855 per cent. Earlier, prices were higher as the Federal Reserve and several European central banks made a co-ordinated effort to support the dollar in the foreign exchange markets. Traders were encouraged because a stronger dollar would make US-denominated securities more attractive to overseas investors. However, doubts soon emerged over the sustainability of the strategy. The market slumped when traders failed to follow through on the early buying. The Fed's new activist stance also gave rise to speculation over monetary policy. Traders considered the possibility that the central bank might raise the Fed Funds and discount rates by 50 basis points each as a way of shoring up the dollar's value. Adding insult to injury, the Commerce Department said that March factory orders jumped 1.1 per cent, while February orders were revised upwards to a 0.3 per cent decline, against an initial estimate of 1.0 per cent down. Economists were expecting a 0.5 per cent upturn in March. But bonds recovered their losses in the final hours, helped by news that April car sales were weaker than expected. The Bundesbank lowered its repo rate by six basis points to 5.41 per cent at yesterday's closely-watched repo operation, continuing its recent trend of weekly cuts. The cut was within the expected range and the German central bank accepted bids for DM77bn of the 14-day funds, draining DM2.2bn from the market. Comments from Bundesbank council members yesterday morning attracted dealers' attention. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said he expected the west German inflation rate to fall below 3 per cent in the near future and added that the Bundesbank would use all possible scope to cut interest rates, as long as this did not clash with the bank's aim of maintaining price stability. However, Mr Hans-Juergen Koebnick, Bundesbank council member, said he believed that the pace of German interest rate cuts had been too slow and that the discount rate (now at 5 per cent) should fall soon. Meanwhile, the latest economic data to be released indicated that the Germany economy is seeing an export-led recovery: west German manufacturing orders showed a better-than-expected monthly rise of 2.9 per cent in March, giving an annual increase of 9.3 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 94.82 and reached a high of 94.88 but declined in the late morning and afternoon to a low of 94.07. The contract settled at 94.26. The French government bond market followed the bund market lower, apart from the very short end where the June Pibor contract ended higher. Germany's repo cut raised hopes that the Bank of France may cut its intervention rate by another 10 basis points today, from its current level of 5.7 per cent. 'There's no reason why France shouldn't cut, as the franc is holding up reasonably well,' commented Ms Marie Owens Thomsen, international strategist at Midland Global Markets. However, dealers said the market was focusing on today's FFr19bn to FFr21bn OAT tender and the US employment data, due to be released on Friday. Spanish government bonds witnessed another rocky day as the continuing saga of the country's political scandals hit the market and foreign investors continued to sell. In addition, the market was hit by rumours that one of the international credit rating agencies was considering lowering Spain's debt rating. The Meff futures contract opened at 96.15 and dropped to a low of 94.60, but traded at 94.84 by late afternoon. UK gilts took their cue mainly from the US, although dealers said the gilt market continued to dwell on Tuesday's M0 figures and the reduced chances of a base rate cut. The Liffe long gilt future fell from its opening of 104.20 to a low of 103.11 and settled at 103.22.</p>

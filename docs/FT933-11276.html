			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Mercury prompts price war in mobile phones THE long-awaited mobile telephone price war came closer yesterday with the unveiling of tariffs by Mercury One-2-One, the new cellular mobile network due to be launched in the M25 area soon. One-2-One, a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent, and US West, will charge only two thirds of the price levied by existing operators for peak-rate calls made from phones on its new digital network. The discount on charges for calls to phones on the One-2-One network is likely to be still larger, and initial connection charges will also be significantly lower. One-2-One will charge 16p a minute for calls from its mobile phones at peak rate, with an initial connection charge for business subscribers of Pounds 20 and a monthly subscription of Pounds 20. Vodafone, the leading mobile operator, charges 25p a minute at peak rate for its existing analogue business service, which has national coverage. The initial charge is Pounds 50 and the monthly charge Pounds 25. Those charges already represent a significant reduction from a pre-June Vodafone tariff of 33p a minute for calls in the M25 area. The price cut was in anticipation of One-2-One's tariffs. Vodafone is launching its own 'MetroDigital' local digital service this autumn. Its tariffs will be lower than those for the existing network, but with a Pounds 50 connection charge and a 20p per minute peak-rate tariff it will still be more expensive than One-2-One. Cellnet, the other operator, has yet to announce revised tariffs, but indicated last week that reductions were on the way. One-2-One has nearly completed its customer trials and the launch of its network is imminent. It plans to expand beyond the M25 to cover about 13m people in the south-east by the middle of next year. Handsets for use on the One-2-One network will retail for between Pounds 250 and Pounds 300, compared with about Pounds 399 for handsets compatible with the MetroDigital network. One-2-One will offer a special tariff for low users, who will have a reduced monthly subscription of Pounds 12.50 but pay 25p a minute for peak-rate calls. Facilities with the One-2-One service include itemised billing, call barring, call waiting, call divert, and voice mail. Among new cost-control features is a monthly call limit allowing customers - or their managers - to set a ceiling on permitted expenditure.</p>

They had been taken to  Yerevan from Stepanakert, near which an Iranian C-30 [as  published] military transport went down. There was a funeral  ceremony at the airport attended by Armenian Vice President  Gagik Arutyunyan and other ranking republic leaders. Akhmad  Sobkhani [name as transliterated], Iranian charge d'affaires in  Armenia, expressed gratitude for the sincere condolences. The  Armenian side, he said, had proved its good-neighborly relations  in practice by actively participating in the investigation into  the causes of the crash.    Nonetheless, it would be premature to believe that all the  ramifications of the incident have been exhausted. As an  Armenian Foreign Ministry representative said in a brief  conversation with journalists, "it was all far more complicated  than we might have thought."    A special commission including experts from Iran, the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Armenia is still at work in  Stepanakert. It is too soon to talk of results, but certain  statements by the head of the Iranian experts have sounded a  warning. He claimed that the aircraft exploded before coming  down, and that it had not malfunctioned. Journalists have not  discovered on what this assertion is based. If the aircraft was  indeed in proper working order, how could it have been as much  as 100 km off course? And why did the aircraft remain at an  altitude of 7.5 km for 20-25 minutes over Azerbaijan, but then  descend to 3.5 km over the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic? How could  the crew have failed to respond to the calls from the air  traffic controllers who noticed the course deviation? For his  part, Akhmat [as published] Sobkhani rejected the theory that it  was an intelligence-gathering flight. The aircraft did not have  the necessary equipment for this.    Another point is worrying -- in the opinion of certain  observers, Iran is inclined to consider Armenia chiefly  responsible [glavnym otvetstvennym zvenom], even though the  aircraft was not overflying its territory. It is to be hoped  that the experts will be able to unravel the true cause of the  crash and that this tragic incident will not overshadow  Armenian-Iranian relations, which are developing actively.</p>

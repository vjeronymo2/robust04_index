			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In possible coalition negotiations  with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] after the  Bundestag election, the Alliance 90/Greens will insist on the  abandonment of nuclear energy, possibly within two years. It  will not be easy to push this through, but it is economically  and technically possible, Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the  Federal Executive Committee, said before journalists in Bonn on  Tuesday on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the nuclear  catastrophe at Chernobyl. One can build on the 1986 SPD  decision to abandon nuclear power within 10 years.    Volmer and his party friends Klaus-Dieter Feige and Manfred  Busch affirmed the call for the immediate shutdown of all  Chernobyl-type reactors, which are the most dangerous timebombs  in Eastern Europe. Retrofitting measures that cost billions  [currency not specified] would not reduce the risk of a new  catastrophe. New energy policy priorities have to be set. The  abandonment of nuclear energy in Germany can break existing  barriers and initiate an energy policy throughout Europe that is  oriented toward ecological restraint, it was stated.</p>

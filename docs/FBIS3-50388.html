			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victoria Stegic] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Bosnian General Jovan  Divjak has warned that any withdrawal of United Nations  peacekeepers from the former Yugoslavia would spark a tinderbox  in the Balkans in the face of rampant Serbian nationalism.    In an interview with AFP, Divjak, one of two deputy  chiefs-of-staff in the Bosnian Army, deplored the "lack of  determination" shown by the United States and the  "irresponsibility" of the European Community, whose negotiator  Lord Owen has been trying to broker a three-way carve-up of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    With the present balance of forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  any  UN withdrawal would "only put a match to the powderkeg the  Balkans have become," he said.    Divjak said the Bosnian Army was "poorly armed, starved of  logistical back-up, but well motivated," and would carry out the  political objectives it had been assigned.    "Despite protestations of peace, the three parties continue  to clash on the ground, because the Serbs and the Croats have  not yet completed the boundaries of their quasi-states, while  the Bosnian government is seeking to recapture the territory  taken from it by force."    He said the Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council]  forces were trying to forge a corridor in central Bosnia linking  the towns of Prozor, Gornji Vakuf and Travnik with Vitez and  Busovaca. Some 14,000 soldiers from Croatia with around 40  tanks, helicopters and aircraft had reinforced the HVO troops,  Divjak said. But he vowed that the "Bosnian Croats and Croatia  will be the biggest losers in this war."    A former officer in the defunct Yugoslav army, Divjak,  himself of Serb origin, predicted that "without a strong  multi-national Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia cannot survive."  Serbia's expansionist appetite was not limited to Bosnia, he  said, pointing out that Serbs already controlled a quarter of  Croatian territory. The Bosnian Serbs were fielding 80,000 men,  25,000 of whom had come from Serbia, he said.    Backed by at least 500 tanks, they were trying to establish  a  corridor running from northwest to southeast along the Krivaja  valley, which was why they were currently attacking the  Moslem-held town of Olovo, on the Krivaja River some 30  kilometres (18 miles) northeast of Sarajevo.    "The Serbs are not interested in Olovo itself," Divjak said.  "What they want is to advance up the valley towards Vozuca and  Maglaj (which are held by the Bosnian Army) to link up with  (Serb-held) Doboj." That way they would drive a wedge between  the second and third Bosnian Army corps, he said.    Sarajevo itself was in a bad way, he admitted. "Not one  single weapon has got into Sarajevo since November 1992," he  said. It was now more than a year and a half since the Bosnian  forces had managed to destroy any of the 80 Serb tanks training  their guns on the city.    More firepower was aimed at Sarajevo than had been deployed  to pound Berlin into surrender at the end of World War Two, he  said, with some 1,500 artillery pieces ranged against the city.  By contrast, Sarajevo had not more than 20 artillery pieces, no  mortars, no ammunition, few weapons and only a few home-made  handgrenades with which to defend itself. "We are putting the  emphasis on diversionary tactics," he said.    He said airstrikes against Serb positions would help ease  the  situation. "It would be enough, by way of reprisals, to bomb  their mechanised units and tanks, their ammunition dumps, and to  knock out the 20 or so bridges across the Drina River between  Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina." One thing was certain, he said.  "The war will not end tomorrow."</p>

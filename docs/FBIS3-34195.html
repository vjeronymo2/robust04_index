Some 28 people  were either killed or wounded as a result of the air attack.  Meanwhile, significant damage was done in the villages.    The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Ministry officials  contacted their counterparts in Turkey and expressed concern  over the incident. They also urged Turkey to offer a convincing  explanation for the operation. Turkish officials rejected the  claims that the attack on Iranian villages was preplanned by the  Turkish Government and stressed that the target of the air  attack was the Kurdish Workers Party camps in northern Iraq.  However, the disclosure made by Deputy Foreign Minister  Borujerdi after his meeting with the Turkish ambassador in  Tehran indicated that Iran's officials wanted Turkey to  seriously assess the matter. Undoubtedly, a more detailed  assessment could be made if Turkey decides to dispatch a  delegation to study the situation in the bombed areas and visit  the wounded people.    According to the political experts, the Turkish officials  must provide a convincing explanation about the attack on Iran's  border. This is necessary because Turkey and Iran have common  borders. Furthermore, they are very sensitive about the  maintenance of border security and stability. That is confirmed  by the talks the Turkish and Iranian committees have held on  border security during the past 18 months. Obviously, the  Iranian Foreign Ministry officials' call for an inquiry into  this incident can be described as an initiative based on  good-neighborly relations.    However, that approach can only be maintained if the Turkish  officials seriously consider the magnitude of their military  operations against opposition forces and avoid any move that may  harm the cooperation between the two neighboring countries.</p>

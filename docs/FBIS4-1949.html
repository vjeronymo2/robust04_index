			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial work conference of supply and  marketing cooperatives ended in Shenyang on 31 March. It was  put forward at the conference that supply and marketing  cooperatives at all levels should adopt every possible way and  means to broaden their business and service fields, to  extensively open markets at home and abroad, to enliven their  operation, to enhance their management, and to increase economic  results so as to extricate themselves from a difficult position  as soon as possible and to get on a track of healthy development.    It was contended at the conference that although the supply  and marketing cooperatives across the province had played an  inestimable role in developing the rural economy, the  difficulties they are facing are very serious. In particular,  the rate of supply and marketing cooperatives at the grass-roots  level of rural areas, which are suffering losses, surpasses 80  percent. These cooperatives at all levels must further do a  good job in conducting reforms with the combination of control  and decontrol and the enforcement of contracting system as its  mainstay. They should break away from their traditional  business structure and operation pattern and bring about a  change to their operation model of large or small and  all-embracing. They should actively bring in the modern styles  and methods of business and sales, such as conducting overall  sales on commission, acting as an agent, and combining operation  between industry and commerce. They should also engage in  specialized and standardized business so as to seek a new way  for their development.</p>

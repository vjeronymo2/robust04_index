			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: Africa's need to keep in touch - Technically Speaking To communicate with my sister Joyce in North Carolina is simple. l can telephone from a public call box using a plastic card. l can send her a fax. When l was a student, l would use electronic mail. Soon, l will be able to talk to Joyce face-to-face, using the latest in video-conferencing systems. We can share access to current real-time and on-line communication systems, such as Internet. To communicate with Esi, my uncle in Lagos, is much harder. Although Nigeria is one of the most advanced African nations, communicating can be difficult. Even in the most cosmopolitan places there can be problems. In April 1992, the international phone service connecting the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Europe was down for nearly a week. In fact, there is a distinct feeling of remoteness whenever I try to contact my Nigerian relatives. Nigeria, like many developing countries, is not part of the new communications order. Along with many others in the west, I enjoy the latest in communications technology. Most Nigerians, however, do not have easy access to a telephone or computer - never mind the infrastructure of a modern global communications network. In the west, the humble telephone is taken for granted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use. Cheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while international rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people. By comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive. The other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution is the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications world; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African context. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has only 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages. The 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the world, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only Internet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire African continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national telecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone lines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does not even feature. At a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society, there is a danger that the developing countries will become further marginalised and impoverished. In all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications technology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect, created a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the developing countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to be applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of the developed nations. Yet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an essential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and television were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations between north and south. The US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds in developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are eagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies, Africa is largely an IT desert. We are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'. This is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the gap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under international investment programmes, could help to develop more modern industries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to help improve agricultural production.

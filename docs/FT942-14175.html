			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Volvo Volvo's clean break with its previous chairman's ambition to form a diversified holding group is welcome. The decision to dispose of interests in BCP, the consumer products company, and Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical group, and focus on the motor industry brings to an end a 20-year odyssey that has included dabbling in crunchy cucumbers, North Sea oil and stockbroking. The holding company strategy made little sense. Success in automobiles requires focus. Though the earnings of a single-minded Volvo will be more volatile, investors are quite capable of constructing diversified portfolios for themselves. That does not mean Volvo's new strategy will easily bear fruit. While its truck operations are strong, it has few comparative advantages in cars. Even its reputation for safety is being compromised by a marketing campaign stressing Volvo's aggressive image. The big weakness remains the Swedish company's insufficient size to earn a good return on investment in new model development. Volvo plans to overcome this weakness by forming ad hoc co-operative ventures with other manufacturers. Such an approach may seem an attractive way of maintaining independence following the Renault trauma. But it is doubtful whether Volvo can cut costs and extend its market reach sufficiently by a piecemeal strategy. With up to Skr40bn coming from the non-core disposals, getting the cash to invest in cars will not be a problem. The concern is rather that without effective collaboration that cash will be frittered away.</p>

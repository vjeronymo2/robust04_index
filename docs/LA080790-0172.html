			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: WHITNEY HOUSTON ON THE ROAD TO HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> WHITNEY HOUSTON, that young, gorgeous pop diva, has finally found a movie  script that she is eager to do. Whitney turned down dozens in the past few  years. She has now said yes to Tri-Star's screen version of the Terry McMillan  novel "Disappearing Acts," from Pocket Books, a contemporary love story between  a singer and a construction worker. It's certainly about time we had another  major black female movie star.  </P> <P> FLASH! Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson welcomed a 6-pound boy last Saturday in Los  Angeles. Tom has two children from a previous marriage.  </P> <P> FEAST or famine: That's the actor's life most of the time. Well, Kevin Conway,  who made such an impression in the off-Broadway hit "Other People's Money," is  truly feasting. Conway opens this week in the Ted Whitehouse play, "The Man Who  Fell In Love With His Wife," at the Quaigh Theater in New York. His real-life  wife, Mila Burnette, co-stars.  </P> <P> The actor will also make his debut as a movie director when his film "The Sun  and the Moon" opens at Joe Papp's Festival Latino in New York later this month.  </P> <P> Conway has also just been signed by Disney for a two-picture deal, the first of  which, "One Good Cop," starring Michael Keaton, starts shooting in New York on  Aug. 27.  </P> <P> SEVERAL MONTHS ago, when that "Designing Woman" Dixie Carter was setting New  York on its ear with her cabaret act, she and I spoke of various things, among  them, her hit CBS series and her wonderful co-stars, including the  then-beleaguered Delta Burke. Dixie was affectionate and enthusiastic about  everyone and everything on "Designing Women," including Delta, whose talent and  beauty she praised. She was particularly incensed about the tabloid coverage of  Delta's much-publicized battle with her weight.  </P> <P> Now Delta has been nominated for an Emmy for the episode written especially for  her that deals with society's attitude toward the overweight -- particularly if  that overweight person happens to be a beautiful woman.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, on the heels of this triumph, Delta Burke has become embroiled  in a war of words with producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason. And from the bitter  comments being flung about, it may be that Delta won't return to "Designing  Women" as the femme fatale Suzanne Sugarbaker.  </P> <P> As a fan of all the "DW's," I certainly hope this does NOT happen! "Designing  Women" could survive without Delta, but her presence would be sorely missed,  and, realistically, could Delta ever find such a marvelous role in any other  series -- a character written expressly for her, so accommodating to both her  talents and her real-life personality and problems?  </P> <P> Let's hope cooler heads prevail.  </P></p>

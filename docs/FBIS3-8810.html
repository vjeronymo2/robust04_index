According to [KLD chairman] Donald Tusk, Mazowiecki would  guarantee a successful fusion--that is, a union between the two  parties in their entirety--better than any other candidate.  Tusk has expressed his hope that UD would consult its  recommendations for new candidate leaders with the KLD.  Moreover, he let it be understood that the KLD would not  support Wladyslaw Frasyniuk as candidate to the post.    Instead, he himself suggested a preferred KLD candidate. He  is Leszek Balcerowicz. The only trouble is that Balcerowicz,  who, incidentally, does not belong to any party, has so far  failed to indicate in any way whether he would be willing to  accept such an offer.    During a press conference convened in Warsaw before the  opening of the Democratic Union's Third Congress, due to begin  today, Donald Tusk presented those assembled with the  fundamentals of his party program, which the Liberals are not  prepared to renounce in the process of merging with UD. These  are formulated in a nine-point document entitled "The KLD's  Liberal Minimum." The document discusses the following points:  a new constitution, which should be approved by the whole  nation; a gradual regionalization of the country; and the  preservation of the state's neutral worldview, which should  nonetheless guarantee optimum relations between state and church  institutions. The last clause could, in my opinion, generate  reservations among UD's right-wing orientation because Tadeusz  Mazowiecki--and, incidentally, other UD activists, too--would  replace the condition of "neutral worldview" with one that  speaks of a "friendly separation between state and church."    But let us return to the fundamentals of the KLD program.  The Liberals go on to discuss the trade unions, which "should  not determine the shape of the budget or other important  decisions." They discuss the need to protect taxpayers from the  state's fiscal policies--in both their open and hidden form.  They insist on protection of the free economy: "It is  necessary to safeguard economic freedom against all forms of  monopoly, unfair competition, and attempts to control it by the  power apparatus." They discuss privatization and  reprivatization. They talk about reforms in the budget-funded  sector. Finally, they mention the need to bring the country  "into the sphere of the self-integrating international  community."    So much for the Liberals.    Now for the Democratic Union: The Congress convening on  Saturday and Sunday should pass decisions on several questions  and also elect a chairman. If Tadeusz Mazowiecki refuses to be  persuaded to put up his candidacy, there could well be trouble.  Individual Union factions have campaigned to promote their own  candidates: Hanna Suchocka, Jan M. Rokita, and Wladyslaw  Frasyniuk. Consequently, observers watching the political scene  do not preclude the possiblity of an eventual split within the  Democratic Union.</p>

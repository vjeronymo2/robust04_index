			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Hoechst If it does decide to spin its fibres business off into a separate subsidiary, Hoechst will be following a road already taken by a number of its competitors, most recently Bayer. The idea is far less radical than the split in ICI which gave birth to Zeneca, or the creation of Courtaulds Textiles as a separate company from Courtaulds. It is an indication of the depth of concern about German manufacturing costs just the same. Fast growing competition from Asia makes that concern particularly acute in the fibres sector. By making its fibres division a separate legal entity, Hoechst might be able to pay its employees at rates prevailing in textiles rather than the chemical industry. The chances are that its workforce would accept this rather than face redundancy. The creation of separate entities may also make it easier to establish joint ventures with other companies which have established a similar structure. The consequent reorganisation might mitigate the effect of Asian competition. It is unlikely to be a panacea. Hoechst has set up joint ventures in other sectors such as that in agrochemicals with Schering last year. But it has been slower than Bayer or BASF to cut jobs in the recession. Healthcare reform in Germany and Italy has blighted the outlook for pharmaceuticals. Earnings are now only around a fifth of their peak in 1989 and the company has warned that the dividend is likely to be cut for a second time this year. Perhaps Mr Jurgen Dormann will shake up Hoechst's cumbersome structure when he takes over as management board chairman in May. Some more restructuring would help while Hoechst waits to be rescued by the cycle.</p>

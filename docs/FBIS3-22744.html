			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Kutakhov] </F>   [Text] Tokyo February 17 TASS -- Japan is quite capable of  building its own nuclear bomb, like any other country with  similar potential and nuclear power engineering industry, but  Russian scientists are not apprehensive, according to Professor  Viktor Murogov, director of the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry's  Institute of Physics and Energy. Professor Murogov was speaking  upon return from Tokyo, where he attended an international  roundtable conference on the use of plutonium.    "Tokyo is clearly orientated towards the solution of  energy-supply problems. More, the country announced that it  renounced nuclear weapons," the scientist said.    Japan's ability to produce nuclear weapons within a brief  period of time became a subject of speculations after the SUNDAY  TIMES published at the end of January excerpts from a  confidential British Government report on the matter.    "In the development of its nuclear power engineering Tokyo  is  oriented to advanced technologies in the field of plutonium and  the development of reactors of fast neutrons, although the  Japanese do not yet have such reactors," Murogov said.    He said Japan is lagging behind Russia in this respect and  added that the lag amounted to some 10 years. "Japan buys  technologies we developed earlier, which brings us good returns  in hard currency".    Murogov said no brain drain has been reported from Russia to  Japan, although Russian nuclear specialists regularly visit  Japan, as they do the United States and Western Europe.</p>

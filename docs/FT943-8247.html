			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Arts: Sensuous 'Antony and Cleopatra' - The Edinburgh Festival It is far harder to explain the virtues of the Berliner Ensemble's account of Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra at the King's Theatre than to explain its flaws. The virtues lie almost all in the acting, which is marvellously full of human truth and telling detail; and for me this carries the day here. The flaws are obvious, so I will rattle through them briskly. The play is given in a modern German translation which seems to avoid either the metre or phrasing of poetry. It runs at three hours and 35 minutes (shorter than the advertised four hours]) without any interval. The director, Peter Zadek, has put it into 1920s costumes (designed by Norma Moriceau), with Antony donning Lawrence of Arabian headwear but, since there is no realistic scenery, the detail of what each individual is wearing or carrying against the vast sunbaked-yellow cyclorama of Wilfried Minks's set acquires a distinctly absurdist quality. And Minks has provided a wooden floor on which every movement makes such a clatter that the lines are sometimes inaudible. The modern and intimate tone which is sustained throughout deprives the play of any grandeur: when Cleopatra says 'The man hath seen some majesty, and should know,' we may doubt her words. The small-scaled and low-key performance that the Berliner actors deliver within these considerable restrictions is one constantly alive with feeling and character. Each role is absolutely distinct: even Decretas, who takes the sword of the dying Antony and delivers it to Caesar, is vividly realised in his mixture of shrewd opportunism, embarrassed awe, and shuffling awareness that he is a tiny cog amid the massive wheels of history. The most complex and riveting characterisations are those of Gert Voss and Eva Mattes as Antony and Cleopatra. Mattes has great physical allure - like a broader, more voluptuous and sexually charged Vivien Leigh. And she is very much of the East: in one big scene of contrition to Antony, she approaches him on her knees, hands behind her back, in the full Asiatic demonstration of repentance. Though she lacks infinite variety - she can be authoritative but not majestic - she certainly has an endlessly mobile disposition. Voss shows Antony's rueful awareness of his own decline, his ready appetite for all the pleasures of the flesh, and the expansive jovial humanity that distinguishes him from other men even in his cups. They make the title couple the most relaxed and humorous people in the play. Their interpretations are full of beautifully telling detail. In one scene, she cries and abases herself before him; he mimics her whimpering; whereupon she promptly rises and slaps him. Moments later, his spirits restored, he drinks and spouts a fountain of wine from his mouth into hers. After his last defeat, she comes in to try allaying his humiliation - subdued, and yet dignified in full regalia; he rejects her; she sticks her tongue out at him. As with Judi Dench's great account of Cleopatra, it is this plenitude of contrasts that makes Mattes captivating. Other roles have similarly revealing strokes. When Caesar (Veit Schubert) receives the news of Antony's death, he wipes his bloody sword dry while choking back a sudden excess of emotion in his voice. His army is ordered, whereas Antony's is wonderfully raggle-taggle. Charmian and Iras are all irresponsibility: they practise a little Chaplinesque dance even in preparation for battle, but later, when Cleopatra is Caesar's captive, they perform a more seriously exotic dance, as if luring her away from politics and the West into the sensuality of the East. At all times the production reminds us that the East is the realm of the senses and of self-gratification, the West the realm of self-control and precise thought. It is Antony's tragedy that he is caught between the two, but the play goes on to transcend any sense of tragic loss. Behind all the action, Minks's cyclorama - in the aching hot yellow with which Picasso once realised Spain onstage in Le Tricorne - glowingly speaks of heat, sand, sun, and of a sensuous condition before which all politics and dominion are petty.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Skachko, HOLOS UKRAYINY columnist: </F> "Stalemate as a Possible Development. Presidential Elections:  More Problems Than Certainty"]    [Text] A typical, and in many ways determining feature of  the parliamentary elections campaign in Ukraine is the fact that  its completion coincided in time with the start of the  presidential elections campaign, which started, in accordance  with the law, 90 days prior to 26 June 1994. It is precisely  this coincidence that has immediately revealed, first, several  real threats to the presidential elections and, therefore, also  to the sociopolitical stability in the country. Second, it has  finally become clear to everybody that the contradictions  emerging in this connection cannot, in fact, be resolved without  violating the current laws. That is to say, one of the most  typical characteristics of the "old" Supreme Council's  legislative activity has clearly manifested itself: It first  adopted laws and then thought them over and figured out how to  implement them in such a way that they would be fulfilled.  However, let us analyze everything in order.  <H5>  Threat One </H5>   It has already become obvious that, in accordance with the  provisions of the law on presidential elections, there may  simply be not enough time, since, on 27 April, the nomination  and registering of candidates for Ukrainian president must be  completed. Today, it is known that only the Socialist and  Social Democratic parties have officially agreed to take part in  the presidential elections. The Socialists have even been  issued their first registration certificate. However, nobody  has heard of personal nominations from those parties; there are  no names. There did appear some information to the effect that  515 Chernihiv citizens had nominated ex-prime minister L. Kuchma  as a candidate for president, but nobody knows for sure what is  next. It is, therefore, necessary either to speed up the  process of nomination or to change the norms of the law. The  latter may only be effected by the Supreme Council, whose last  meeting has been appointed for 22 April. Then there will be  days off [Saturday and Sunday] and the "difficult day,"  Monday.... In short, there remain only 10 days, but who cares  about the political consequences of this situation? However,  this is not the main point.  <H5>  Threat Two </H5>   This is the main threat, as everything else emanates from  it.  It is clear today that candidates must be nominated to the post  of president, who is, in accordance with the current  constitution, the head of both the state and the executive  power. However, it is known that the old parliament agreed to  reconsider the division of functions in the upper echelons of  power. There is still no law on this. Instead, the law on the  26 June elections to local power structures was adopted. In  accordance with it, in the case of electing these bodies, the  institution of presidential representatives in provinces will be  abolished. In other words, a constitutional crisis of  contradiction automatically arises. The president remains head  of the executive power, but the executive vertically  subordinated to him and to the government becomes abolished.    Well, it is not known today what kind of president we are  going to elect, and this considerably complicates the task of  compiling preelection programs for possible presidential  candidates. It is simply not known what to promise to the  people and on what platform to enlist supporters, without  risking to become, excuse me for the word, a charlatan, if the  law on the redistribution of powers is not adopted in favor of  the presidential power. Incidentally, [President] L. Kravchuk  had in mind precisely this when he refused to be registered as a  presidential candidate.  <H5>  Threat Three </H5>   Today, the fate of the president in Ukraine is totally  unknown. The new parliament may object to the existence of such  an institution and simply abolish it. It may then transpire  that, on the one hand, there are people wishing to become  candidates and there even are presidential candidates who  started their election campaign, but there is no institution of  the presidency. It is futile to expect that the new law on the  new powers for the Ukrainian president will be adopted by the  present Supreme Council on 22 April and, as a result, it will be  necessary to wait for the first plenary session of the new  parliament. It is not yet known when it will be held. Nor is  it known whether the new parliament will be able to elaborate  and adopt the new law in a constructive and efficient manner.    Suppose that there are no presidential candidates until the  new parliament ultimately makes a ruling on the issue of the  presidency, and that the new parliament will convene in the  middle of May and will adopt the necessary law. Then, there  still remains one question: How about the 90 days assigned for  holding the presidential election campaign? There only are  three possible variants: Either to change the current law on  presidential elections, to violate it openly and hold elections  within shorter time limits, or to postpone the presidential  elections by several months. In any case, there will suddenly  emerge other problems: What kind of president will it be if he  is elected in a hurry? What will be the attitude of those  political forces, which demanded the presidential elections, to  their postponement? What will be done about the law on holding  the elections on 26 June? What will be done about the elections  of local power bodies, and so on?    Head of the Ukrainian Presidential Legal Service Ivan  Tymchenko said that there may also be the following variant with  regard to the Ukrainian presidency other than its abolishment  without elections: First, the president will be elected in  accordance with the current constitution and then a new entry  will be made in the new one to the effect that there is no  presidency in Ukraine, and then the president will resign ahead  of time. Second, the elections will proceed in accordance with  the current constitution, but in the new Main Law it will be  specified that the president is only the head of state and  therefore, some of the powers for which people voted will be  taken away from the president. I. Tymchenko clearly referred to  the above situations as a "legislative deception of the voters,"  something that may only lead to one thing -- a constitutional  crisis, when nobody will know what to govern and how to govern.  In addition to that, for example, the institution of the  presidency is provided for in our current constitution, and in  order to abolish it, it is either necessary to make  corresponding changes in the Main Law or, again, adopt  corresponding constitutional laws, something which is  practically impossible to accomplish with an incomplete  composition of the deputies corps.  <H5>  Threat Four </H5>   Let us imagine that the elections did take place and  resulted  in electing a president as the head of state, and local bodies  of representative power whose heads will also preside over the  local administrations. This situation will not simply be one of  stalemate. It will be disastrous for the integrity of the  state, because there are no levers for the center to influence  the local power bodies and no mechanisms for determining the  responsibility for the failure to fulfill the laws or general  state programs. Nationwide elections of local leaders may turn  them into de facto princes, Ukraine's federalization will be  brought about spontaneously and, instead of an integral and  balanced state organism, there will emerge a disintegrated state  structure composed of centrifugally oriented territories.  Besides, the new parliament may also turn completely into a  place for competition among regional deputations, as, in our  single-chamber Supreme Council, there is no special body (like,  for example, a chamber for the issues of territories), which  might take care of balancing relations between the center and  regions.    Consequently, in the situation which has taken shape today,  it is difficult to draw any constructive conclusions. It is  difficult to dispel an impression that the prevailing mood among  the ruling elite is "well, things will somehow settle down," and  this mood has absolutely nothing to do with laws. Are we going  to look for our separate Ukrainian road. In other words, will we  proceed from the principle: It's your property and your fire, so  burn it if you desire! Despite the laws?...</p>

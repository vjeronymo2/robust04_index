			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party, PT, President Luis Inacio </F> Lula da Silva by O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO journalist Ricardo Lessa;  date and place not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Lessa] You have referred to  the elite that failed...    [Lula] I am willing to make a political offensive against  the  Brazilian elite, who have managed the country as if it were  their private property, frequently running their private  enterprises with state funds. The elite have not fulfilled the  duties of the state. The elite are collapsing and the PT is not  in the government. They are collapsing because of their  incompetence.    [Lessa] What is your proposal?    [Lula] We will implement a policy to end elites. We will  implement an income distribution policy. I don't want  entrepreneurs to become Marxist but Fordist. I want them to  understand that by paying higher salaries, the workers will buy  what they produce. Just imagine if workers could afford to buy  cars, television sets, chicken, clothes. Our country would be  much more civilized. Entrepreneurs do not have that mentality.  Their mentality is one of high concentration. They sell the  idea that the world will end tomorrow and they want to make all  the money today.    [Lessa] Then, you want to improve capitalism in Brazil,  instead of implementing Socialism, right?    [Lula] That is exactly what I am willing to do. At no time  has the PT program been presented as a socialist program. The  socialist part of it is the strategic program, the dream, the  utopia. We are making a program for five, 10, or 15 years, to  meet people's basic, vital needs.    [Lessa] How will you cope with the division within the PT?    [Lula] The press sees one PT, but there is another PT, which  is the one I lead. The voting on the moratorium and on the  minimum income took place during peaceful sessions of the  national party executive board. Yet the press did not notice  it. What they want is to depict a war within the PT, a war that  does not exist. May God permit the existence of two or more  different opinions within the PT. I do not want a party with  just one single opinion.    [Lessa] But party bloc members have been forbidden to vote  on  the Constitutional amendment. They are being constrained.    [Lula] How many things have I already been forced to do  while  under constraint?! I had to expel a PT deputy although I was  against doing it. This is no political constraint; it is the  case of one deputy or another who might be more euphoric about  participating in the amendment of the Constitution. The  majority of bloc members see this as something normal.  Disagreement within the PT is normal. If it had been war, do  you think I would have been touring the country, leaving the  party bloc alone? I would have stayed in Brasilia. The party  will participate in the amendment of the Constitution at the  time it feels it should. We do not want to endorse a policy of  summary voting, which has been instituted by Deputy Nelson Jobim  and the conservative wing. [passage omitted]</p>

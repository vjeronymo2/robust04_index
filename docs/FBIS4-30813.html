			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Subotica, 28 May (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska and of the Serb Democratic  Party [SDS], speaking in Subotica today said that the leadership  of the Srpska republic will not sign any documents unless the  abolition of the unfair sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro  was given a priority treatment.    Karadzic was speaking at the founding assembly of the SDS  Municipal Committee in Subotica today. Bogoljub Zelen was  elected the committee's first chairman. The founding assembly  was attended by Velibor Ostojic, chairman of the SDS Executive  Committee, and numerous guests from town in Vojvodina where  branches of this party already exist. [passage omitted]    Speaking about the republic of Srpska and the current  situation, Karadzic said that during the coming talks "part of  the territories will have to be ceded, but either the Srpska  Assembly or the people at a referendum will decide which ones  and how many." When the war is over the Serb people will have  the least reasons to feel ashamed. Many crimes they did not  commit have been attributed to them. Everyone knows who  committed them and when and which units were involved, said  Karadzic who spent three and a half hours in a packed hall of  the Open University replying to numerous questions about the  organization of a future state and the ties between the republic  of Srpska and Serbia.</p>

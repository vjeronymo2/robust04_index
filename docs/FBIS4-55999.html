			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, May 22 (ATA) -- The president of the  Republic of Albania, Sali Berisha, met today before noon in the  city of Pogradec with the president of The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], Gligorov. This is their fourth  meeting, but this time it is an informal meeting. Mr. Berisha  and his wife welcomed President Gligorov and his wife in the  governmental residence of Pogradec city.    The two presidents dwelt mainly on cooperation between the  two countries and the situation in the region. Later, Berisha  and Gligorov made statements for the press. Considering the  meeting as very warm and friendly, Berisha said that: "Our  conversation was open and friendly. We especially discussed  cooperation between our two countries and agreed to make efforts  to develop this cooperation further. We discussed the  broadening of communication links and the establishment of the  airline as a success in this relation. Both parties consider as  necessary the signing of a series of other agreements, such as  that of commodities' and passengers' transportation and that of  connecting the two countries by a railway. Albania is ready to  offer and has offered facilities to the Macedonian party for  deposits up to 1,5 million tons of fuel in the Albanian ports as  well as facilities for one million of other commodities. We  also consider as very important the lifting of visas on both  border areas at a distance of 20-25 kilometres, as it will be  judged by the experts and this will be a first step towards the  complete removal of visas.    "The signing of a series of other agreements on economic  cooperation, on guaranteeing investments will help the two  countries promote cooperation and develop friendly relations.  "We also discussed political relations and the situation in the  region. I personally hail President Gligorov's efforts in  realizing the census and materializing the law on the census in  Macedonia. Also, I hail his efforts in broadening the freedoms  and rights of Albanians in this republic. The daily publication  of the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, the determination to  enlarge the mass media, the opening of the faculty for teachers  in Skopje, the enlargement of the middle school system, will  increase the role of the Albanian factor in the stability and  development of Macedonia. We also encourage the contribution of  the Albanian political forces to the stability of Macedonia and  governmental coalition.    "As regards developments in the region, both countries are  determined to work for their integration into Europe and the  European and West institutions. Both countries are resolute to  overcome difficulties through dialogue. Cooperation between  Albania and Macedonia is not only a bilateral but also a  regional contribution."    Macedonian President Gligorov spoke at first on  possibilities  to develop cooperation between the two countries and stressed  that "It is not normal for the two countries not to be connected  by a railway. This way of transportation as well as the  possibility offered by the Albanian party for the exploitation  of its ports, will help develop cooperation between the two  neighbouring countries."    President Gligorov declared before the reporters the  predisposition of the Macedonian state to sign agreements  between the two countries. "The agreements, he said, will  consist in economic cooperation, guarantee of each other's  investments, removal of double taxation, cultural cooperation  and joint care for safety in the border, which allow the  citizens of both countries to move freely to each other."    Concerning the Balkans, Gligorov said that "We have many  reasons to try to maintain stability and peace in the region.  It is to our merit that Albania and Macedonia were not involved  in the conflict." President Gligorov considered the realisation  of the census in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a  possibility for removing any kind of disagreement and considered  the census as indispensable. He assessed the cooperation between  the two countries as "Successful and with sure prospects."    After the dinner, Presidents Berisha and Gligorov, together  with their wives, went for a visit to the city of Ohri.</p>

What obtains all over the world is true here as  well: there is no wise conquering army. And an army that is not  intelligent seizes upon the unfortunate guard at the gate as  upon a life preserver. There is no alternative, it is necessary  to return to the basic truth, that so many in Israeli society  have been trying for years to repress: the seeds of the violence  were sown on the seventh day of the Six-Day War. That was the  beginning of the dunghill of the conquest. The caravan of the  conquest galloped forwards, with arrogance and hutzpa, first  under the leadership of the Labor Movement, and afterwards by  the crushing steamroller of the Likud. One of the rotten fruits  of the conquest is the settlements. They were and remain the  watershed that separates the solution of the conflict and its  perpetuation.    That which occurred in the State of Israel during 27 years  of  conquest is a known process, which was diagnosed among the  German people in the transition period from the democratic  Weimar Republic to the tyranny of the Third Reich. Professor  'Amos Funkstein, who holds the chair for the History and  Philosophy of the Sciences and Ideas at Tel Aviv University,  said in a newspaper interview: "Between 1933 and 1937, up to  Kristallnacht, the situation of the German Jews was better, from  several aspects, than that of the Arabs of the  territories...legal approaches were more open to the German Jews  than to the residents of the territories" (HA'ARETZ, 9 December  1988). The reference, of course, is to the first stages of the  Third Reich, in the 1930's, long before the outbreak of the war  and the establishing of the extermination camps. That was the  stage in which good persons, who were not Nazis, acquiesced in a  reality of racism and violation of human rights, became  accustomed to it, and found themselves serving it, some out of  loyalty "to the people and to the state," some out of  conformism, some out of fear and calculation. From here, it was  a short road to animalization and insensibility of writers,  musicians, academics, judges, attorneys, actors, and others. The  poison was absorbed in all systems of the society.    That is what happened in Israel, as well, "the only  democracy  in the Middle East." But in Israel, in contrast to the first  stages of Germany in the 1930's, the blade of massive and  arbitrary arrests was not placed on the neck of the citizens and  there was no fear of a secret police that was liable to burst  into homes at midnight. The collaboration with the conquest was  generally done voluntarily in Israel. The willingness of most of  the Israeli elite to cooperate with the conquest over time  created a conceptual confusion, the apartheid reality, the  acquiescence in the evil.    It is expressed in the professors at the Hebrew University  continuing with their researches and their academic lives as  usual, at the same time that at a distance of five minutes from  them they closed universities, sent professors and students to  administrative detention and shot at them with live ammunition.  It happened to attorneys who agreed to serve as judges in  military courts and in that way turned overnight from defenders  of the rights of the accused into abusers of human rights and  servants of an oppressive system. It happened to physicians who  forgot their oaths and gave daily approvals, either by closing  their eyes or by direct support, to a terrible system of  tortures. Many harsh testimonies about cooperation with the  conquest authorities by Israeli physicians, who served in the  conquered territories on reserve and regular duty, were  uncovered at an international convention that was held in ZOA  House in Tel Aviv under the auspices of the association of  Israeli-Palestinians Physicians for Human Rights (It seems to me  that DAVAR was the newspaper that first revealed the existence  of that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] form in which a doctor  confirms the ability of an interogatee to undergo torture). It  is self-evident that this happened to reserve soldiers, who in  crossing the Green Line became conquerors harassing a civilian  population, sometimes maliciously and with astonishing cruelty.  Given all this, there is no reason to be amazed at orders on  opening fire that discriminate between rulers and ruled.    Barukh Goldstein is not a sole lunatic, and it is impossible  to define him as a wild outgrowth of a Jewish Hamas. Barukh  Goldstein lived in Qiryat Arba, with the support of the secular  State of Israel. All the military might of the Israeli conquest  power was spread over him. He was part of the conquest army,  received uniforms and weapons from the secular military  establishment, was not denounced and was not expelled from the  system when he refused, during the Lebanon War, to treat a  wounded Arab. He enjoyed full backing from the governments of  Israel over the years.    If we adopt the principles of the Cohen Committee about  indirect responsibility, then many of the "leaders" in Israeli  society--in politics, in academe, in arts, in all of the  intellectual frameworks--bear indirect responsibility for the  atrocities of the conquest. The decision of the Israeli  government to forbid the political activities of the Kahanist  movements, and the administrative detention of several of the  activists, not only are inconsistent with proper administration  of a democratic state, but it is also doubtful whether they are  especially effective. As long as they are surrounded by a  sympathetic political environment in the form of the  settlements, Gush Emunim, parties such as "Tsomet", "Moledet",  and the militant parts of the Likud, the Kahanist cancer will  continue to send out its satellites to additional parts of the  body. It must be admitted that there is no essential difference  between a "legitimate" racist such as MK [member of Knesset]  Yehosu'a Matz'a, for example, or the former MK Ge'ula Cohen, and  the "new" terrorists Tiran Polak or No'am Federman. As it is no  coincidence that the administrative detainee for several days,  the president of the State of Judaea, Ben Horin, was previously  an active member of "Kach" and today he is a member of "Tsomet".  It is a natural transition within the family.    These words have very practical implications. Whoever  supported at one level or another the conquest and the  settlements may say today: I thought that conqueror and  conquered can live in harmony. I found that this is not  feasible. Therefore, in order to break the bloody circle, I  (please enter the appropriate name) support the removal of the  settlements. It is not yet late.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / US inflation rises less than expected Upward pressure on US inflation remains subdued, official figures indicated yesterday. The consumer price index rose 0.1 per cent last month, less than expected. The annual rate of inflation fell to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent in March. 'Core' consumer prices - which exclude the volatile food and energy components - were also subdued, rising 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.8 per cent in the year to April. The figures followed an encouraging report on wholesale price inflation earlier this week. Producer prices fell 0.1 per cent last month, taking the year-on-year decline to 0.4 per cent. Most economists, however, still expect the Federal Reserve to signal another increase in short-term interest rates next week following a meeting of its policy-making open market committee. A rate increase is seen as necessary to slow the rate of domestic growth and help stabilise the dollar in foreign exchange markets.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Thomson announces FFr2.47bn deficit HEAVY restructuring costs forced Thomson, the flagship of the French state-owned electronics industry, into a FFr2.47bn (Dollars 414m) net loss last year, from profits of FFr497m in 1989. The group yesterday announced a FFr2.9bn one-off charge, to cover job losses in its two main divisions, Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE) and the partially privatised Thomson-CSF defence electronics group. There were no provisions in 1989. Consumer electronics has been hit by a plunge in US demand, the dollar's fall and a price war against fierce Japanese competition, while defence electronics has suffered from the pressure on military budgets worldwide. Last month, the French government pledged nearly FFr2bn of fresh capital for Thomson, which is forecasting a return to profits this year, at least at group level. The state has also promised to provide FFr4bn during the next two years to Bull, the computer maker which forms the other main leg of the state electronics industry, and which recently announced a record FFr6.8bn loss for 1990. The European Commission is studying whether the capital injections contravene EC controls on state aid. Thomson's group net operating profits, before the exceptional charge, rose by 2.5 per cent to FFr1.6bn last year from FFr1.56bn in 1989. Turnover fell by 1.9 per cent to FFr75.23bn from FFr76.66bn during the same period, mainly because of the dollar's decline. North America accounted for nearly a quarter of last year's sales. Pre-tax profits were unchanged at FFr1.43bn. Yesterday's net loss was no surprise, since both TCE and Thomson-CSF had already published their results, showing that the group had had a tough year. TCE announced a 1990 loss of FFr2.7bn after charges of FFr1.8bn, while Thomson-CSF's net profits fell 17.4 per cent to FFr2.17bn, after a FFr1.1bn charge.</p>

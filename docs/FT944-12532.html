			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Samax seeks Pounds 16m in issue and placing Samax, which is developing a graphite mine in Tanzania and a gold mine in Ghana, hopes to raise about Pounds 16m this month with an issue and placing of new shares, which will be floated on the London Stock Exchange. The company was set up in 1989 by Mr Michael Martineau, its managing director, and Mr John Park, operations and finance director, who each have more than 25 years experience in the minerals business, partly with British Petroleum and more recently with Cluff Resources. Samax's activities so far have been financed primarily by the Addax &amp; Oryx Group, described in the pathfinder prospectus yesterday as a private, Europe-based group involved in trading and related operations in Africa. Addax will remain a substantial shareholder after the placing by stockbrokers Credit Lyonnais Laing. Mr Martineau said: 'The flotation will give Samax access to capital and a higher profile. Exploration is the excitement for our future; our portfolio is already valuable and a higher profile will increase the number of projects offered to us.' The prospectus says that both the graphite mine, at Merelani, some 14km south west of Kilimanjaro airport in Tanzania, and the gold mine, at Prestea in south west Ghana, are scheduled to begin commercial production in the first half of 1995. The pre-tax net present value of the group's interest in these mines is calculated by independent consultants to be about Pounds 33m. Samax also has interests in mineral exploration projects in Tanzania, Ghana, Congo and Senegal. Mr Martineau said these projects were typically in areas where there was previous evidence of gold mining and where there was potential for economically recoverable reserves. Not enough work has been done on these projects for any value to be ascribed to them.</p>

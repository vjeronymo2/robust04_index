			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: J&amp;J settles patent suit JOHNSON &amp; Johnson, the US health care group, was yesterday ordered to pay Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing (MMM) about Dollars 125m in damages to settle a patent infringement suit, writes Karen Zagor in New York. Johnson &amp; Johnson does not expect the charge, which will be reflected in third-quarter results, to have a material impact on earnings. The judgment by a court of appeals upholds a 1991 ruling which found that Johnson &amp; Johnson had wilfully infringed MMM's patents on fibreglass casting materials.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Cabinet resistance to EC post for Kinnock A PLAN for Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, to take over as Britain's second EC commissioner in Brussels has run into unexpected opposition within the cabinet. Mr John Smith, the present opposition leader, has informally proposed to Mr John Major that Mr Kinnock be appointed to the high-profile post. He would replace Mr Bruce Millan as Labour's nominee to work alongside Sir Leon Brittan, the senior British commissioner. Traditionally the prime minister would automatically accept Mr Smith's recommendation, but ministers said last night that it had caused serious concern about the potential impact on the Tory back benches. Some ministers are questioning whether the proposed appointment would encourage more Tory MPs to rebel against Mr Major's support for Maastricht. Their fears underline the sensitivity in the highest ranks of the government over Europe. It is understood that Mr Kinnock discussed a possible move with Mr Major just before the summer break. Mr Kinnock left with the impression that the prime minister was ready to endorse his appointment. Mr Millan has said he is ready to stand down at the end of this year in favour of the former Labour leader. But during a discussion at Thursday's cabinet meeting some ministers raised the possibility that Mr Kinnock's nomination to such an influential post could inflame passions among Tory MPs about the Maastricht treaty on European union. No firm proposal was put to the cabinet. Last night senior Labour officials indicated that Mr Smith would not formally propose Mr Kinnock until it was clear that Mr Major would endorse his appointment. But the view of one senior minister was that, with the dispute in the open, the prime minister would have to move quickly to resolve the issue. Labour unrest, Page 4</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises against D-Mark A sharp fall in the February US trade deficit led to modest selling of the dollar, but the currency finished higher on the day after the German Bundesbank failed to raise official interest rates at yesterday's council meeting. Fading expectations of an early easing of the US Federal Reserve's monetary stance also helped push the dollar higher. This followed denials by officials in Washington that Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is struggling to maintain his authority over monetary policy. It had been suggested that Mr Greenspan was forced to delay a cut in interest rates because of resistance by members of the Federal Open Market Committee who are still worried about inflation. February's trade figures were the best for over seven years. The deficit fell to Dollars 5.33bn from a revised Dollars 7.16bn in January, but they pointed towards a weak economy and did not help the dollar. US exports fell 2.4 per cent in February and it was only because imports fell by 6.4 per cent that the trade figures were so good. The volume of oil imports declined by 14.9 per cent reflecting, a run down in US industrial activity. At the London close the dollar had climbed to DM1.6880 from DM1.6725; to Y136.70 from Y136.35; to SFr1.4415 from SFr1.4270; and to FFr5.7000 from FFr5.6550. Its index rose to 65.1 from 64.6. Speculation about a rise in German interest rates was mainly confined to overseas markets. This accounted for the calm reception in Frankfurt to the Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged and also for the selling of the D-Mark following the news. Lack of change in German rates turned attention back towards the gloomy economic prospects for the country as a result of unification and to concern about a possible power struggle in the Soviet Union. The D-Mark lost ground in the European exchange rate mechanism and also weakened against the Japanese yen. It fell to Y81.00 from 81.50 in London, after failing to break through resistance at Y82.00 earlier in Tokyo. Sterling fell against the dollar, but was firm in the ERM. There was no obvious reaction to a larger than expected rise in March UK unemployment or to a surprising drop in manufacturing output. The monthly rise in unemployment was the biggest for 20 years, and although total industrial production rose 1.6 per cent in February, manufacturing output fell 1.6 per cent. This encouraged speculation about a further easing of UK monetary policy, but was not reflected in the pound's performance. Sterling fell 1 cent to Dollars 1.7720. It also declined to Y242.25 from Y243.00, but rose to DM2.9900 from DM2.9800; to FFr10.1000 from FFr10.0775; and to SFr2.5550 from SFr2.5425. The pound's index gained 0.1 to 93.0.</p>

HOLLYWOOD BLAZE  </P> <P> A fire in a North Hollywood commercial building this morning caused an  estimated $6 million in property losses, the Los Angeles Fire Department said.  There were no injuries and the cause of the fire was under investigation.  </P> <P> The fire was reported at 4:14 a.m. in the single-story complex in the 7400  block of Fulton Avenue, spokesman Greg Acevedo said. About 130 firefighters  controlled the blaze in about an hour. The 45,000-square-foot building was  severely damaged and flames burned through the roof, Acevedo said.  </P> <P> Fire officials estimated damage to the building at more than $4 million; the  loss of contents was estimated at $1.75 million.  </P> <P> The building had once been an air-conditioning warehouse and was used by  several small businesses, including a flag manufacturer, a novelty company, a  trophy and plaque maker and a video production company.  </P> <P> Acevedo said several employees were working at the production company when the  fire was reported. They escaped without injury.  </P> <P> Because of heavy damage to the building, investigators had not yet pinpointed  where the fire started, Acevedo said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans </F> by Josef Vesely in The Hague; date not given: "Peter Kooijmans:  Moscow Cannot Dictate Terms to NATO"]    [Text] The Hague -- Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter  Kooijmans claims that Europe's security is facing a rather  uncertain future. Nevertheless, at the same time, he gives the  Czech Republic a chance of possible membership in NATO and the  European Union [EU]. He also emphasizes that the alliance's  policy cannot be dictated from Moscow. Therefore, MLADA FRONTA  DNES asked him for an interview. By the way, 70-year-old  Kooijmans will accompany Netherlands Queen Beatrix on her visit  to Prague in three weeks time.    [Vesely] The Czech Republic will officially become part of  the Partnership for Peace initiative this week. Do you have any  idea what our next step with regard to NATO could be and when  the time will come for this?    [Kooijmans] The future is so uncertain that it would be  better for you to banish any exaggerated hopes. The admission  of individual countries into NATO would, after all, just mean a  new dividing line across Europe. This could provoke a reaction  from the countries on the other side of this line and lead to a  threat to stability in Europe. The Partnership in its original  form envisaged that all the countries of Central and East Europe  would be treated equally. During consultations with you and  among the allies, this concept was gradually changed. Each  applicant has to progress and do something for membership. It  is apparent, however, that given proper coordination among the  allies, it is possible to establish a differentiated  relationship between NATO and the individual partners. This  gives them a chance to gradually become familiar with the  alliance. The changing developments in Europe must also be  taken into consideration in the future. It must be clear to  everyone that countries like the Czech Republic will have closer  ties with NATO than, for instance, Kazakhstan or Georgia.    [Vesely] Nevertheless, Yeltsin maintains that not only the  East European countries, but even other states in Europe must  not give a thought to NATO before Russia. What do you intend to  do about this?    [Kooijmans] The alliance's policy cannot be dictated from  Moscow. We must, it is true, take into consideration what  Russia says, but do not forget that the Western European Union  (WEU) and NATO complement each other. Each new member of the  European Union must, consequently, adapt its relations with the  WEU. Although a new member will only be an observer at first,  it will not avoid membership later. The guarantees ensuing from  this are similar to those from NATO. This means that the moment  a country -- let us say, Sweden or Finland -- becomes a member,  apart from the Western European [Union] partners, the United  States is also indirectly interested in it. Moscow should not  overlook the fact that being a member of the WEU means the same  as being a member of NATO. Even so, I do not see any threat to  Russia here.    [Vesely] When, in your opinion, should the Czech Republic  submit an application to the European Union, which is currently  being expanded to include four more countries?    [Kooijmans] A country may submit an application whenever it  wants. It will come first to the European Commission, which has  to give its point of view. If it is positive, the negotiations  can begin. I understand the reasoning of the countries from  your region that it is necessary to submit the application as  soon as possible, since the negotiations could be long. It took  a total of nine years for Spain and six years for Portugal. It  has only taken two years for the Scandinavians and the  Austrians, but the four European Free Trade Association  countries were already participants in the agreement on the  European Economic Area. It has a regime that made association  with the Twelve easier. In your case, this will not only  require political will, but -- in my opinion -- it will also  involve a formidable process of harmonizing employment, social,  ecological, taxation, and other standards.    [Vesely] It is not pleasant just to be in the anteroom and  wait until others make a decision for you.    [Kooijmans] You are right -- if these were to be  negotiations between a superior and an inferior, then, this  would spoil the whole atmosphere. Fortunately, things are  different: The state applying for membership is not the only  one who can benefit. The entire Union will also benefit. We  know that Prague has a certain tendency to proceed independently  of the other countries in your region. However, although the  Czech Republic will be ready for admission before others -- and  this has to be taken into consideration -- the European Union  will not waive the comparisons that unite all the new candidates  as a group. Your advantage -- compared with the Finns, Swedes,  Norwegians, or Austrians -- is that you do not have an arctic  agriculture or Alps, and so your situation is more like that of  the Netherlands or Germany. Despite this, it will be very  difficult to draw the negotiations to an end. After all, this  will involve a transition from one system to a completely  different system.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Vydrin, director of the International </F> Global and Regional Security Institute (IGRSI), by Volodymyr  Skachko; place and date not given: "It is Better To Do This  `Before' Than `After'"]    [Text] At the end of last week, an international  conference "Interregional Conflicts in the Post-Totalitarian  World" was held near Kiev. Specialists from various Ukrainian  scientific and state structures and from research institutions  of NATO, Russia, Moldova, Great Britain, the United States, and  Italy participated in it.    Ukraine was represented by one of the organizers of the  conference -- the IGRSI. Its director Dmytro Vydrin comments  upon the course and results of the conference.    [Vydrin] It was one of Ukraine's first conferences on  "conflictology." We are pleased that we managed to hold it, as  it seems to me, there is one major shortcoming in Ukraine,  namely, its introvert political mentality: Almost all political  problems that Ukraine deals with, directly concern Ukraine  alone. From the viewpoint of common sense and pragmatism, this  might seem normal. However, we profess a different idea: We  believe that a state may only become a normal one if it shows  interest in problems that go beyond its geographical borders.  That is why it was, perhaps, the very first conference where  Ukrainian specialists analyzed not only internal problems, but  also those of the Dniester Region and of the "hot spots," such  as those in Belfast, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and so on. As  a matter of fact, our task consisted of reviewing all such spots  in order to determine whether, today, mechanisms exist that are  capable of helping in the resolution of such conflicts. God  forbid the need to use this experience in Ukraine. We hope that  Ukraine will avoid this danger, but if, to our greatest pity, we  fail in this, we would not like to be "naked" both  intellectually and psychologically when confronted by it.    [Skachko] Was there a specific result of the conference?    [Vydrin] As is normal for initial conferences, it took us  half of the time to unify the terminology and to begin to  understand one another. Then we tried specifically, for  example, to determine the limit of resorting to military force  in conflicts and the limit of using peacekeeping forces and  actions, as well as their possibilities and limitations. For  the time being, we have just addressed this theme. At the next  conference, we will get closer to elaborating specific recipes  and recommendations, which we will be able to offer to  politicians.    [Skachko] Did the conference result in comprehending the  fact that interregional conflicts are perfectly possible in  Ukraine?    [Vydrin] Our scientific community became divided into  "pessimists" and "optimists." I belong to such "optimists" and  believe that, unfortunately, conflicts are virtually  unavoidable, although our colleagues, in particular, the British  ones, believe that it is quite easy to avoid conflicts in  Ukraine. However, I am convinced that it is hardly possible to  outsmart history, which teaches us that fragments of empires  become arenas for conflicts. There have been almost no  exceptions in history....    [Skachko] Isn't the situation in the Crimea and in the  Donetsk-Luhansk Region the reason for your optimism in inverted  commas?    [Vydrin] Yes, we gave much of our time to discussing the  situation in those regions and, unfortunately, discussed it in  the context of situations analogous to those in the Dniester  Region and in Karabakh. Unfortunately, for us, the Crimea is a  potential Dniester Region or Karabakh. We gather in advance in  order to prevent it from becoming an actual situation.    [Skachko] D. Vydrin also added to this that the IGRSI plans  to hold such conferences twice a year, and this week, the  conference on "Interethnic Conflicts in the Post-Totalitarian  World" was in progress in Kiev. The subject matters are  related, because not infrequently, interethnic strife becomes  that same internal factor that generates interregional conflicts  and even wars. It is, indeed, better to prevent conflicts than  to resolve them.</p>

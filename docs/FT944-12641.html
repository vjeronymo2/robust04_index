			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Bonuses boost boardroom pay Britain's top company directors are continuing to enjoy earnings rises substantially higher than either the rate of inflation or the increases awarded to their employees, says a survey published today. The number of companies where the chief executive earns more than Pounds 1m a year doubled from eight to 16 in the past 12 months, according to the study by Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration adviser. It found that the highest-paid directors in the country's biggest industrial companies - with annual turnovers of more than Pounds 400m - secured 9.0 per cent median earnings rises, three times the level of rises received by the employed workforce as a whole. While the best-paid chief executives in the financial sector enjoyed total median earnings increases worth 7.3 per cent, rises of 5.8 per cent were recorded for top directors in companies in industry and commerce, taking their remuneration from a median of Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 137,000 a year. The survey points out that the rate of increase in executive pay in the industrial sector has slowed to its lowest for five years. More than a quarter of commercial and industrial best-paid directors received no rise at all - on the other hand the top quarter enjoyed total earnings improvements worth at least 18.9 per cent. The growth in executive pay reflects an increase in annual bonus payments. In companies with annual turnovers of more than Pounds 400m these amounted to median rises of 4.1 per cent. In enterprises with turnovers of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m they were only 1.1 per cent. Bonus payments make up an average 18 per cent of total remuneration and contribute just over 15 per cent to the remuneration of the best paid directors. In the finance sector they amount to 22.4 per cent. The biggest earnings growth has been in the retail and distribution sector with a 9.1 per cent improvement in earnings (6.0 per cent in basic pay plus 3.1 per cent from bonuses), followed by electrical engineering and electronics with 8.4 per cent and leisure and services with 7.7 per cent. The smallest earnings rises were found in the building materials and construction sector, where top executives averaged only 2.7 per cent rises. Mr David Atkins, editor of the survey, said yesterday the results showed that there was 'a much closer relationship between company performance and total earnings' for top executives.

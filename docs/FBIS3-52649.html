These  issues are: Relations with Jordan; the stumbling negotiations  with the Israelis; and the internal Palestinian course. Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, member of the PLO Executive Committee, spoke to  AKHIR KHABAR following the meetings, which ended Monday [3  January] afternoon.    Regarding relations with Jordan, 'Abd-Rabbuh said: The  Jordanian and Palestinian sides agreed, during the meeting  between His Majesty King Husayn and Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat on Thursday, to activate the joint coordination  committees and to instruct these committees to be practical in  their deliberations and to directly deal with the major issues  that must be viewed as priorities. He added: Despite the delay  in the work of the committees, we believe that it is not too  late and that there is a possibility for avoiding such a  shortcoming.    'Abd-Rabbuh said: It is obvious that the problem on our part  does not lie in our hesitation in or refrain from reaching the  highest level of coordination, but in the lack of progress in  the talks to end the Israeli occupation of even a part of the  Palestinian territory. Any agreement with sisterly Jordan will  be useless and cannot be practically applied without ending the  occupation. We reached an understanding with our brothers in  Jordan that discussing future relations, particularly on the  political level, depends on the establishment of a Palestinian  entity on Palestinian land and on ending the Israeli occupation.  He said: The relationship should be established between two  independent entities on an equal footing. He added that the  same thing applies to the economic and security issues.

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATE BLOOMERS;  </P> <P> NEW 'NAKED LADIES' HAVE PETALS OF WHITE, YELLOW OR RED  </P> <P> A nurseryman trying to describe to a customer what the fat, papery bulbs of  Amaryllis belladonna would look like when they bloomed was having no luck.  Until he said: "It's the bulb that grows in vacant lots, the one with the big  pink flowers." That did it.  </P> <P> Amaryllis belladonna are hard to miss because they bloom when and where very  little else does (in the middle of summer, in completely dry soil). "They're  amazing," says Polly Anderson, whose back yard in La Canada Flintridge is full  of the bulbs. "They need absolutely no water, and they grow in sun or shade."  </P> <P> Their common name, naked ladies, refers to the fact that flower without leaves.  The leaves comes later, usually in October -- in time to take advantage of  winter's rains -- and last until late spring. Typically, they are shiny, dark  green, and strap-shaped, growing in clumps two to three feet across but only  about 18 inches tall. The bulbs then go dormant until the first flowers push  out of the bare ground in August.  </P> <P> Anderson's naked ladies, however, bloom in September -- she has been  hybridizing them over the past 40 years. In her yard, they grow under a large  Aleppo pine and around citrus and eucalyptus that are about 100 years old.  </P> <P> In the Anderson garden, however, they are not just pink. She has developed  plants with flowers of pink with white throats, pure china white, white with  creamy yellow or apricot throats and a dark pink that most people simply call  red. Her flowers are bigger than the standard type, growing atop taller stems.  Flowers make a circle around the stem; the common pink makes but a quarter  circle, with most of the flowers facing the sun.  </P> <P> Some of the bulbs grow in full sun, others in complete (but bright) shade. Some  grow from under a ground covering of cape weed (Arctotheca calendula, which  does not need summer water, either) and some from a mulch of pine needles, but  most send the sturdy reddish-brown stems from bare dirt. The bed under the  Aleppo pine has the largest number of bulbs and flowers. Anderson suspects that  this is because she waters that bed in the winter for the narcissus growing  there. Where other beds get no water at all, the bulbs grow more slowly but  just as surely.  </P> <P> Anderson does not fertilize at all; according to growers she has talked to  fertilizer can contribute to the early demise of bulbs, causing them to rot. So  can summer watering, though the bulbs can take a certain amount. In some beds  she does not even bother to weed; the weeds seem to be unable to overwhelm the  amaryllis. She notes that even the cape weed, a very tough plant from South  Africa that looks much like a gazania, has trouble growing into the bed of  amaryllis because the ground is so dry.  </P> <P> Anderson began her hybridizing with a dark rosy-pink amaryllis that grows  nearly wild in Santa Cruz, in Northern California, and a nice white named  'Hathor' that she found in Santa Barbara. It has been a long, slow process  because it takes five to six years from seed to flowering bulb. The seeds are  easy to grow, she says, and they are simply sown in the ground, in neat little  rows as if they were corn. The seeds sprout right along with the foliage on the  parent plants, in early fall, and even these seedlings should be allowed to go  dry in summer.  </P> <P> If she doesn't plan to save seed, she snaps off the seed heads after the last  flowers fade, to help conserve the bulbs' energy. The flower head breaks off  cleanly with a crisp pop. Some of her amaryllis are growing in pots, but, she  says, they don't flower well or at all in some cases, much preferring the dry  open ground. Some also grow at the bases of the taller crinum lilies that  flower at the same time with very similar flowers but with foliage, even though  the leaves of the crinums are often tipped with brown and beginning to dry.  </P> <P> At the Palos Verdes Begonia Farm (which, despite the name, is a large, general  nursery), John Bauman makes sure he gets a few bins of bulbs each fall, and, in  general, the bulbs of the common pink are not difficult to find at nurseries.  Anderson's hybrids are carried only by Burkard Nurseries in Pasadena, cost a  great deal more and are in very limited supply, because she digs up each one  herself, with a bloom attached so that you know what you are buying. They can  stay out of the ground for several weeks this way, but then should be planted  so they can make new roots and leaves in the fall. They may not bloom the next  year, but the following. Plant bulbs just under the ground with the very tops  of the necks sticking out. In general, it is best not to dig or divide clumps  of amaryllis because it does take them at least a year to become reestablished  and begin flowering again.  </P> <P> The flowers of the common pink and the hybrids are excellent cut, fragrant and  long-lived, lasting a week or two in a vase.  </P> <P> Several large bulb growers have shown interest in the Anderson hybrids, so some  day they may be more generally available, but in the meantime there is nothing  wrong at all with the readily available plain pink of vacant lots. Their return  to cultivated gardens is long overdue, and they will smile at the next drought.  </P></p>

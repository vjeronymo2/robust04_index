			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Drawing out lines of argument / Reviewing the implications of revised electoral boundaries THE DRAWING of electoral boundaries is doubly in the news. A dreary and technical subject, it can nonetheless be political dynamite. Last Wednesday the home secretary forced through the second reading of a bill to give England five more seats in the European parliament. Wales is to get one more and Scotland none. Special commissions are being hastily set up to draw the boundaries but, against recent precedent, there will be no public inquiries. Objections must be expressed by letter. The reason for this arbitrariness is the shortage of time. To add six to the existing 81 seats must involve a drastic transformation of the UK electoral map. The government did nothing until this week, although the European elections are due in June next year. Parties and candidates are desperate to have the boundaries settled as soon as possible - certainly by the end of the year. Home secretary Michael Howard says it is too late to follow customary procedure. But perhaps it does not matter. Euro-constituencies are arbitrary areas, each made up of seven or eight Westminster seats and containing about 500,000 electors. Experiments have shown that, in almost all circumstances, the party consequences of alternative maps will differ negligibly. The government has been generous - or politic - in giving Wales an extra seat (almost necessarily a Labour one). In strict arithmetic terms all six new MEPs should come from England. Scotland has no claim whatsoever. Of course, the main objection to the bill is that it preserves the first-past-the-post system. It would have been simple to allocate the six seats on a proportional basis. All parties except the Conservatives favour proportional representation for the European parliament. Even the government is committed by treaty to implement a common electoral system for Europe which, given the practice of the other eleven countries, necessarily means a proportional system. On the basis of opinion polls the 1979 result could easily be reversed next year with the Conservatives down to 17 seats or less. On the basis of the county elections last May they would only get 11. A switch from 60 to 17 seats means a change of 86 in the right-left balance at Strasbourg. The government's insistence on first-past-the-post may give Mr Jacques Delors an easier ride in the next Euro-parliament. But another bombshell is approaching. For the last two years the UK boundary commissions have been redesigning parliamentary constituencies. By next week all their provisional proposals will have been published. When parliament has approved them the decks will be clear for the next general election. The Conservatives will benefit from the changes - the drift from cities always guarantees that - but their gain, perhaps 10 or a dozen seats in an evenly balanced parliament, will be less than most have predicted. It would, however, be enough to decide many general elections - six of the 13 contests since 1950 have produced a majority of less than 20. But there is a snag to the timetable. The new boundaries can be challenged in the courts. Judges are reluctant to get involved in these political matters, as was shown in a long case brought by the Labour Party in 1983. But the frontiers of judicial review are extending and new grounds have just been provided for challenging the work of the boundary commissions. They are operating, as required by statute, on the basis of the 1991 electoral register. But last week OPCS published a study - showing the scale of error in the register. Using the 1991 census - itself flawed - as a base, the OPCS research found that nationally, 7.1 per cent of the eligible names were missing from the 1991 register. For Inner London the proportion was a staggering 20.4 per cent. On the basis of the 1991 register Inner London is set to get only 24 MPs, but on the basis of the 1991 census it would be entitled to 28. Activist councillors in boroughs that are being cut from three to two MPs or indeed the London Labour Party as a whole, have prima facie grounds for seeking to enjoin the boundary commissioners from presenting their proposals to the Home Secretary. Judicial caution may frustrate them, but who can tell?</p>

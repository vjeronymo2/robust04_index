			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS MIGHT DEAL FOR RYPIEN  </P> <P> The Chargers are still acknowledging the possibility of a three-team deal that  could bring them Washington Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien.  </P> <P> "It's an idea," Steve Ortmayer said Thursday. "It's something we might  consider. But I haven't talked to anybody about it today, and I don't expect  anything to happen in the next 48 hours." Ortmayer is the Chargers' director of  football operations.  </P> <P> The genesis of the deal stemmed from talks between the Chargers, the Redskins  and the Atlanta Falcons last month at the National Football League owners'  meetings.  </P> <P> The Atlanta Constitution reported Thursday that former Pro Bowl running back  Gerald Riggs wants to be traded amid speculation the Falcons have decided to  make running back John Settle, a Pro Bowl selection as a rookie last year, the  future of their running game.  </P> <P> The Constitution quoted sources close to Riggs and the Falcons saying the  Chargers have offered their first-round pick (eighth overall) to the Falcons in  exchange for Riggs. According to the report, the Chargers would then ship Riggs  to Washington for Rypien or quarterback Stan Humphries (both are backups), an  unnamed offensive lineman and a second-round pick in the NFL draft April 23.  </P> <P> Rypien and Humphries have worked closely with new Charger Coach Dan Henning,  who was an offensive assistant with the Redskins last year.  </P> <P> Asked if he thought either quarterback plus an unnamed offensive lineman plus a  second-rounder were worth giving up the No. 8 pick in the draft, Ortmayer said,  "I don't want to comment on that."  </P> <P> The Chargers are known to be looking for a quarterback. Their starter at the  end of the 1988 season was Mark Malone, who finished with the lowest listed  quarterback rating in the American Football Conference for the second  consecutive year. The Chargers have hopes for the return of quarterback Mark  Vlasic, who was 2-0 as a starter during the Chargers' 6-10 1988 season. But  Vlasic is still recovering from reconstructive knee surgery. His status for  1989 is uncertain.  </P> <P> The Chargers also have major draft needs at offensive line, linebacker and  secondary.  </P> <P> Asked about the current status of the Riggs-Charger-Redskin deal, Ortmayer  said, "It was left nowhere. It was left as an idea."  </P> <P> Such a deal would leave the Falcons with the Nos. 5 and 8 picks in the first  round.  </P> <P> Rypien started five games for the Redskins last year after spending the 1986  and 1987 seasons on injured reserve because of knee injuries. Replacing Doug  Williams, Rypien lost his first two starts and won his next two before  suffering bruised ribs against Green Bay in Milwaukee.  </P> <P> He finished the year with a quarterback rating of 85.2, which would have placed  him fifth in the NFC if he had the minimum of 224 completions necessary to  qualify for the season-ending rating standings. He completed 114 of 208 passes  for 18 touchdowns and 13 interceptions.  </P> <P> Humphries, a sixth-rounder from Northeast Louisiana, spent his rookie season  (1988) on injured reserve with a blood disorder called thrombocytopenia.  Meanwhile Humphries has reportedly ballooned to 240 pounds during the  off-season.  </P> <P> Sources in Washington say the hang-up on the deal could be the Chargers'  insistence on getting Rypien rather than Humphries.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Chargers continue their normal draft preparations. Today they  will attend workouts in Los Angeles for about 25 players. Among those players  will be UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman, who will probably be the first player  selected in the draft. Dallas owns the No. 1 pick.  </P> <P> Ortmayer said he and a handful of other teams have contacted the Cowboys about  trading up to get a shot at Aikman. He says the Cowboys have not yet decided  whether they want Aikman for themselves or whether they want to trade him.  </P> <P> "I've asked them (the Cowboys) to tell us what they need," Ortmayer said. "And  that's where it was left." Other teams believed to be interested in trading up  for Aikman include Green Bay and Kansas City.  </P> <P> USC quarterback Rodney Peete also might be at the workout today. But Ortmayer  said Peete might have a schedule conflict. This is the same workout that the  Charger staff used last year to make a final determination on Tennessee wide  receiver Anthony Miller, whom they selected with the 15th pick of the first  round.  </P> <P> Ortmayer said the Chargers are getting an increasing number of phone calls from  other teams interested in trading up for their No. 8 pick. "There's some  anxiety on the part of other people," Ortmayer said. "I think they think the  draft breaks right about where we are."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> The Chargers have brought in LSU wide receiver Eric Hill and Pittsburgh  defensive end Burt Grossman for physical tests, and they may do the same with  Nebraska linebacker Broderick Thomas and Georgia running back Tim Worley. All  four of those players are projected to go among the first 10 in the first round  of the NFL draft. . . . Charger assistant Bobby Jackson attended a workout  Wednesday for Oklahoma State running back Barry Sanders.  </P></p>

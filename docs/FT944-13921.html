			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / PIA hints at review of heavy fine tactic A shift away from the use of heavy fines for financial organisations which fail to meet regulatory standards was signalled yesterday by Ms Colette Bowe, chief executive of the Personal Investment Authority. Speaking at the Chartered Insurance Institute, Ms Bowe said that one task facing the PIA, the watchdog to protect the private investor, was to develop its own approach to discipline. 'My own personal view is that massive fines which, in the case of a mutual, end up being paid by existing policyholders are not always the most appropriate form of discipline,' she said. Her comments appeared to contrast with the view taken by Lautro, the PIA's predecessor in regulating life insurance companies. The record penalty imposed by Lautro rose sharply this year from Pounds 180,000 levied on Legal &amp; General in February - to Pounds 300,000 - exacted from Premium Life and Norwich Union in April. Ms Bowe seemed to favour a clearer focus on individual responsibilities in errant organisations - an approach which would require the PIA to introduce a system of registering individuals as well as companies. The regulator plans to issue consultation papers on both registration and discipline early next year. This will include the prospect of individual penalties not only for 'rogue' sales agents but also for individual board members, including non-executive directors. One concern for regulators in considering discipline is that they value as a deterrent the bad publicity a heavy fine attracts.</p>

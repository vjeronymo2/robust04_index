			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Endowment threat to mortgage repayments - John Authers asks if policies will fail to cover loan obligations THOSE who bought an endowment policy between 1987 and 1989 may find their golden goose turns out to be an albatross. Most mortgages purchased during those housing boom years were backed by an endowment. At the time, many were eager to get into the housing market and did not stop to bother too much about the policy which the lender added on top. As the figures on prices and repossessions show, many also borrowed more than they could afford and bought houses which lost value. Now, a new element of misery could be added - the low-cost endowments taken out to repay the loans may fail to do so. Endowments come with a guaranteed 'sum assured', but this is not for the size of the loan; an endowment which guaranteed this would be expensive. Instead, it is fixed at a level lower than the total of premiums paid in. The policy needs a certain investment return to pay off the mortgage. This method is cheaper; hence, such endowments are known as 'low-cost.' But the endowment could fail to pay off the mortgage if its investments do not perform as well as expected. As previous articles have made clear, those who took out endowment policies in, or before, the early 1980s already have enjoyed good investment returns and need not worry; the problem is confined to the late 1980s. Lenders have to decide if endowments are acceptable security for the loan, and the assumptions needed to determine this vary according to whether the policy is with-profits or unit-linked. The latter assumes an annual investment growth rate - in the case of Allied Dunbar, 7.5 per cent, after charges, during the late 1980s. If this is achieved, the policy will be paid off. With-profits policies, where annual bonuses are added each year and a terminal bonus can be added at the end, assume that annual bonuses will continue at 80 per cent of their present rate, with no terminal bonus. They ultimately depend on their investment growth. Some lenders may have been too optimistic in their assumptions for endowment growth rates. With-profits offices have cut their bonuses this year, and returns have been harmed by poor performance in the property and equity markets. Predictions are widespread that returns for the rest of this decade will be low. Several companies now admit that endowments sold at the peak of the boom might not reach their target. The annual returns they require from now until the maturity date have crept above 10 per cent, after paying expenses and taxes. Such returns are not unrealistic; but with inflation and interest rates at low levels, it is conceivable that the policies will miss their target. This might sound like a problem that will manifest itself only in 2013, when endowments bought in 1988 mature, but those who can afford it might want to take action now. Insurers are adapting their systems so that they can ask customers to increase their premiums if the policy seems to be falling short. But Tony Shepherd, chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, suggests this is the last thing you should do. Those nervous about their endowment should supplement it with tax-efficient saving, such as a Pep, he says. A life office which asks for an increased premium is, effectively, admitting it has failed, so it is hard to see why borrowers should pay it more money. Shepherd's advice to the many people considering stopping the premiums on with-profits policies is, however, unequivocal: 'Once you've got it, you're stuck with it.' None of the options is as worthwhile as continuing to maturity, even if dire predictions for future returns are correct. Unit-linked contracts offer a simpler deal, as values are determined by the underlying performance of the units, while with-profits returns are at the discretion of actuaries. The options are: Surrender This is almost certainly the worst choice. You stop paying premiums and take the returns from the policy immediately. But all the expenses of setting it up, meant to be spread over 25 years, will have to be taken out of the premiums paid in already, making a bigger proportionate impact. Surrender values need not take account of bonuses added on, as these are guaranteed only if the policy continues to maturity. It often takes 10 years before the surrender value is greater than the total premiums paid in, so this is an act of desperation. With a unit-linked policy, the costs are taken via a 'nil allocation period' at the start when premiums do not buy any units. After this, the surrender value will equal the total value of the units. Making the policy paid-up This involves stopping paying the premiums but only taking the proceeds at the scheduled maturity date. The value will not be as good as you would get by continuing to pay the premiums because the start-up costs will be spread over a smaller sum. But by giving the investment longer in which to earn compound returns, you should ultimately get more than if you surrender. John Lister, of General Accident Life, says standard practice is to reduce the sum assured by a proportionate amount and then add bonuses to this reduced amount. The amount you receive eventually depends on future bonus rates. Most companies will not allow a policy to be made paid-up in its first year or two. After this, the value improves the longer the policy has been in force. Standard Life says a policy started 25 years ago, with annual premiums of Pounds 360, and made paid-up 10 years ago, would have paid out Pounds 44,045 on maturity. Had all premiums been paid, the maturity value would have been Pounds 68,848 - compared with a surrender value at the time of Pounds 10,048. The returns on premiums paid make the trade-off clearer. The surrender value gave a return of 7.4 per cent, the paid-up policy 11.7 and the maturity value 13.5. The past 10 years have produced good returns, so this is a flattering period over which to judge the policy. Those who can afford to continue paying premiums are well-advised to do so. Selling the policy Dealers have established a market for second-hand endowments. Policyholders in search of cash can ask for a quote from a marketmaker. This is usually higher than the surrender value. But the marketmaker will then take a cut and sell it on to someone else for a profit. The fact that this is possible shows that a better return should be achievable by keeping the policy to maturity. There is no need to panic. Endowments are unlikely to miss their target by much, and planning should make up any shortfall. But if they do fail to repay loans, the final words will have been written in an unhappy episode for the housing industry.</p>

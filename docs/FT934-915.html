			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: The Tale of Tsar Saltan - Opera in Berlin While fairy tales have become a welcome part of the Christmas diet for British opera companies, most German theatres are too blinkered to venture beyond Hansel und Gretel. That may explain why Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tale of Tsar Saltan has been so well received at the Komische Oper in Berlin. With its Cinderella-like characters and exotic musical pictures, Tsar Saltan deserves to be better known. This was its Berlin premiere. Like so much of the Komische Oper's repertory, the work was performed in a 'Neufassung' - in other words, it was doctored to suit the way Harry Kupfer wanted to stage it. Tsar Saltan emerged mercifully unscathed. Kupfer cut some of the obscure corners of a circuitous plot, but otherwise preserved its charm and humour. Reinhart Zimmermann's decor captured the stuffy, snowy atmosphere of the Tsar's court as effectively as the sunny freedom of the paradise to which the heroine Militrisa and her son Guidon were banished. Reinhard Heinrich's costumes were colour-coded - pink and purple for the court, blue and green for the desert island - which made their coming together for the final scene a visual symbol of harmony. The production was naive in the best sense of the word. Sabine Passow was the blonde and gracious Militrisa, Donald George a bright-eyed, bright-voiced tenor prince. Hans-Martin Nau's dopey Tsar made up in blundering comedy what he lacked in largesse. The company showed off its depth and experience in the ensemble scenes, but some parts - notably the Swan-Princess - were poorly sung. One expects as much at the Komische Oper, where dramatic expression has always been more highly prized than musical purity. What was not expected was the quality of orchestral playing under the young Australian conductor Simone Young. The audience loved every minute. And so did I.</p>

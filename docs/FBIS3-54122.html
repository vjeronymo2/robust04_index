			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pressures Again"] </F>   [Text] The Clinton-Yeltsin declaration from Moscow calling  upon India and Pakistan to sign the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty (NPT) and join a multilateral forum to make South Asia  nuclear-free is a sinister anti-India move. Getting Mr. Yeltsin  to line up with Washington is no big achievement for Mr.  Clinton. Moscow showed its eagerness to join the United States  and other members of the Nuclear Club to force India and  Pakistan to sign the NPT or a regional treaty even during the  Republican regime in Washington. American support is so vital  for Mr. Clinton to survive politically even in his own country  that his international views will be suspect, especially in  India which has experienced his ability to go back on a contract  (on cryogenic rocket engine technology), a feat unusual for the  President of a great country like Russia. The Russian  concurrence with the US on forcing India to give up its nuclear  and missiles programmes should not be taken as an irrepressible  pacifist urge. Its logic is to kowtow to the US, and its net  impact is to endorse the American approach of being even-handed  towards India and Pakistan. This, in practice, has been a  smokescreen for pursuing a policy of not to let India grow in  power. Even before the Moscow declaration, it had been the  consistent Western policy to magnify the threat of Pakistan's  nuclear capability which, as the world knows, was developed  within reasonable knowledge of Washington. It is pertinent to  ask: Did the US show an intemperate concern about Iraq's  nuclear capability because it posed a threat to Israel, and did  not show a comparable anxiety at Pakistan's nuclear programme  because it was aimed at India, and not Tel Aviv? Pakistan has  declared on several occasions that it would sign the NPT only if  India did so. This country-specific approach does not worry the  US, but Larry Pressler's country-specific law for a nuclear  Pakistan causes great unease in the State Department.    Washington's partisan approach on nuclear and missile issues  is likely to raise complex bilateral questions between New Delhi  and Washington. By getting Mr. Yeltsin's consent, Mr. Clinton  may have formally mobilised additional international support for  non-proliferation, but it need not necessarily force India's  hands. The time has come for India to tell the US that it is  prepared to discuss the nuclear question, but unencumbered by  what Pakistan did or did not do in the matter. In fact, the US  must learn how to deal with India without the Pakistan factor  for any reasonable success in achieving a convergence of views  on key issues. On the question of NPT, the crucial question is  discrimination. Neither the US nor others in the Nuclear Club  show an inclination to address this matter. Without doing so,  the charge of intransigence against India is so much of  nonsense. If a government in New Delhi were to succumb to  pressure and sign the NPT against national consensus, its  continuance would be in jeopardy under an onslaught of  ultranationalist forces. It will be unfortunate if this were to  happen.</p>

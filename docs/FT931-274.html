			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Juppe faces tussle over foreign policy IN THEORY President Francois Mitterrand is free to object to any of the suggested candidates for the French cabinet, in practice he needs a very sound reason to do so, writes Alice Rawsthorn. He must have wished he could have found such a reason to stop Mr Alain Juppe from becoming foreign minister. Mr Juppe, 47, is, after all, a close friend and political confidant of the president's old adversary, Mr Jacques Chirac, mayor of Paris and leader of the RPR. The new foreign minister was also one of the loudest voices calling last week for the septuagenarian Socialist president to resign. The president managed to quell the resignation calls by threatening not to appoint a prime minister from any party - namely the RPR - which was calling for his own dismissal. But the choice of Mr Juppe as foreign minister must have irked him almost as much as having to accept Mr Francois Leotard at defence, a post the president refused to give him in the last cohabitation government. Mr Mitterrand may yet get his revenge. The ambitious Mr Juppe, a graduate of the elite Ecole National de l'Administration, has been overshadowed by Mr Chirac ever since he joined the latter's private office in 1976. He was lumbered with the low-profile job of budget minister in the last cohabitation government and sees the Foreign Ministry as way to make his mark on the political scene. But foreign affairs is one of the key areas of policy that Mr Mitterrand is determined to cling on to as head of state. The previous cohabitation administration was marked by humiliating scenes as Mr Mitterrand upstaged Mr Chirac, then premier, and his conservative ministers on the international summit circuit. Mr Mitterrand has already made it quite clear that he has no intention of behaving any differently in the second round of cohabitation. Mr Juppe now faces the tricky task of trying to wrest control of foreign policy from the president, at the same time as he attempts to fulfil his own aims of renegotiating the Gatt reforms and cementing the relationship between France and Germany.</p>

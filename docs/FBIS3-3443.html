Ford is prepared to fully  participate in the development of China's automobile industry."  This statment was made by James Paulsen, newly-appointed  president of Ford's China operations, during an interview with  this correspondent at Ford's world headquarters.    Ford, the second largest automobile manufacturer in the  United States and the fourth largest in the world, established  operations in China on 1 March to coordinate automobile business  related to China. As Paulsen stated, its top priority is to  establish as early as possible a joint venture with vehicle  assembly lines in China, and to help modernize China's  automobile industry.    Business exchanges between Ford and China go back a long  time. As early as 1978, Henry Ford II visited China and was  received by Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The 750 F-series  trucks it later sold to China were the first of its kind  imported from the U.S. since 1949. In 1984 and 1985, Ford  entered into negotiations with China to establish an automobile  joint venture; Ford sold over 3,000 and 6,200 vehicles in China  in 1992 and 1993 respectively.    Paulsen told this correspondent: "Ford was the first to  undertake efforts to establish a joint venture with China. This  will be helpful to our cooperation with China. .... [ellipsis as  published] Our goal is to produce the best quality products  suited to the Chinese market." [The 0239 GMT version reads:  "Compared with other automobile companies, Ford was the first  to undertake efforts to establish a joint venture with China.  This will help better ensure that ours products will be the  best among all the joint-venture automobile enterprises in China  in terms of quality and value. Our goal is to produce the best  quality products suited to the Chinese market."]    This correspondent has learned that the number of people  involved in the China operations at Ford's world headquarters  has increased to over 60. Ford's operations in China are now  mainly in the form of component manufacturing, technology  licensing, and joint scientific and technology research. All  its operations are successful or making progress. Last year  Ford established dealers in 10 major Chinese cities, and its  service facilities are expanding.    "The considerable base of China's automobile industry may  serve as a basic condition for cooperation between China and  Ford. Ford's investment in China will continue to focus on  things like vehicle technology," said Paulsen. Last October,  Ford supplied $800,000 to establish a vehicle technology fund  together with the China National Science Foundation. Grants for  25 basic research projects will be officially awarded in April  this year. This shows Ford's cooperation with China is more  oriented to the future, according to Paulsen.    Ford personnel told this correspondent that the naming of a  president for operations in China equivalent in rank to vice  president of the head office clearly indicates the company's  resolve to enter the Chinese market. [The 0239 GMT version  reads: Ford personnel told this correspondent that the naming  of a president for operations in China equivalent in rank to  vice president of the head office clearly indicates the  company's resolve to march into the Chinese market with great  strides]. Paulsen will soon move his office from Ford world  headquarters to China.    Paulsen, who visited China last year, told the  correspondent:  "I very much want to go to and work in China. I am eager to  learn about China's business environment and automobile  industry; I also want to learn about China's culture,  humanities, and history."    Speaking of the domestic debate in the United States  regarding China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status,  Paulsen said he hopes the Clinton administration will support  Ford and other automobile companies in their efforts to expand  overseas. He said: "As a businessman, we hope the government  will extend China's MFN trade status." He believes the Clinton  Government's decision in June regarding China's MFN trade status  will mark a turning point in Ford's operations in China.</p>

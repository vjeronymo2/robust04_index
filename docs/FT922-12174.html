			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Boardrooms The myth that Britain's building companies are conservatively managed was blown to bits last week. Sometimes conservatively accounted, perhaps. But the dreadful results of Taylor Woodrow and Tarmac were gruesome testimony to the way they and most of their peers blundered through the recession with the same expansionist strategies which made them stock market darlings in the late 1980s. The reckoning has arrived, as shown by such boardroom changes as the departure of Taylor Woodrow's chairman Mr Peter Drew and the promotion to chief executive of Tarmac's Mr Neville Simms. For investors, the questions to ponder now are how well management teams in the sector are equipped to face the different challenges of the 1990s and how far they are prepared to make difficult decisions about capital allocation once the grim task of retrenchment is complete. Alternatively, are these apparently new-look boardrooms merely the product of shuffling the old pack? New thinking among housebuilders and contractors is hard to find, although the decisive manner in which Mr Andrew Teare turned his back on housebuilding after arriving at ECC stands out. The ratings of Redland and Blue Circle among building material companies have been improved by new boardroom blood - Redland effecting a complete generational change - though ironically it was the old soldiers at RMC Group who impressed the market with better than expected figures last week. Calls for better corporate governance notwithstanding, too many institutional investors seem to have waited for disasters and then jumped ship. Having been slow to tackle the contractors, they might perhaps make amends by calling for heads among the insurers and the banks.</p>

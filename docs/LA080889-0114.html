			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE CO. DETAILS PLANS FOR 3 RETAIL PROJECTS IN SPECTRUM  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. announced Monday that it plans to develop three new retail  projects totaling more than 800,000 square feet in the master-planned Irvine  Spectrum area.  </P> <P> The three projects, which will cost a total of $50 million, are aimed at  employees of the hundreds of businesses in the Irvine Spectrum center, at the  juncture of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways in south Orange County.  </P> <P> With the three new centers, the Irvine Co.'s retail projects in Orange County  will total about 4 million square feet -- making the privately owned firm the  largest retail developer in the county.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. owns the Irvine Spectrum, a 2,600-acre phased development that  already is headquarters for more than 600 companies with about 20,000  employees. Firms located there include such heavy-hitters as Mazda North  America Inc., AT&amp;T, Kawasaki Motors Corp. and Toshiba America Inc.  </P> <P> Irvine Spectrum is not scheduled to be completed until the turn of the century  -- when Irvine Co. executives estimate that it will be home for up to 100,000  workers.  </P> <P> "We're developing (the retail projects) to meet those needs," said Keith C.  Eyrich, vice president of development for Irvine Retail Properties Co., a  division of the Irvine Co. "The market is businesses and employees of those  businesses."  </P> <P> To attract employees of the Irvine Spectrum area, the three retail projects  will be home to some discount retailers plus a heavy concentration of  restaurants and fast-food outlets, dry cleaners, hair stylists, and  business-support firms, such as photocopying outlets, Eyrich said.  </P> <P> Two of the centers are to be the size of a typical community shopping center,  while the smallest is to be the size of a neighborhood shopping center. Large  regional malls are generally 1 million square feet or more.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. will be executive developer overseeing the initial planning,  layout and design of the projects. It is working with two Newport Beach  developers -- SDC Development Co. and Hopkins Development Co. -- that will be  in charge of day-to-day construction.  </P> <P> Here are details of the projects:  </P> <P> * Construction will start early next year on the first phase of a 10- to  12-acre development at the corner of Alton Parkway and Technology Drive.  </P> <P> Phase One will have 120,000 square feet of retail space, including a food  court, restaurants, a gas station and car wash, and shops. It is being  developed by Hopkins and the Irvine Co. and is scheduled for completion in  spring 1991.  </P> <P> The second phase is still being planned. It will include 310,000 square feet of  retail space on an additional 30 or more acres, Eyrich said. Plans include  discount retailers.  </P> <P> * Construction is scheduled to begin in the fall of 1990 on a 40-acre site  bordered by Irvine Center Drive and Lake Forest Drive south of the Santa Ana  Freeway.  </P> <P> Retail space in the project will total 300,000 square feet, anchored by  discount stores supported by restaurants, business-support and neighborhood  services. The project is being developed by SDC with the Irvine Co. and is  scheduled to open in the summer of 1991.  </P> <P> * Ground breaking is planned in late 1990 on a 14-acre site southwest of the  San Diego Freeway at Irvine Center Drive near the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  The center will include 120,000 square feet of retail space, with a scheduled  opening in the fall of 1992.  </P> <P> Notwithstanding the ambitious plans announced this week, Eyrich acknowledged  that none of the space is yet leased.  </P> <P> Even though all three of the centers are aimed at the employees at Irvine  Spectrum, Eyrich said they are expected to draw consumers from a three- to  five-mile radius.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co. also still plans to build a 5-million-square-foot regional mall  in the Spectrum area, Eyrich said.  </P> <P> The Rouse Co., based in Baltimore, Md., is doing feasibility studies on adding  a regional mall to the site and "working with anchor prospects," Eyrich said.  The mall has been on the drawing boards for at least 10 years.  </P></p>

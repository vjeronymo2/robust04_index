			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 4 KYODO -- Science and Technology  Agency Director General Satsuki Eda Friday [4 February]  dismissed concerns that Japan's rocket development program aims  at turning the country into a major military power.    To the contrary, Eda said, the successful launching earlier  in the day of an H-2 series rocket, the first to use wholly  Japanese components "turned space from a theater for Soviet-U.S.  military competition into a sphere of activity for people who  want to give wings to peaceful dreams."    Eda told a news conference following a regular cabinet  meeting that Japan's plutonium program and its rocket  development, which have sparked international concerns over the  country's nuclear intentions, are both strictly devoted to  peaceful purposes. He said Japan would "pay careful attention"  so that no such concern need arise.</p>

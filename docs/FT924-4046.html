			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Lender falls out with the modern generation: Bristol &amp; West's proposal to back the nuclear family for mortgages MR Tony FitzSimons is worried about British society. 'There is a generation that does not have the thrift mentality and does not fear losing their homes,' he says. Unlike others who shake their heads at the ways of young people, Mr FitzSimons is prompted by financial rather than moral concern. Bristol &amp; West, the building society of which he is chief executive, has fallen out badly with this generation in the past two years. After competing with other lenders to sell mortgages in the overheated south-east housing market of the late 1980s, it has paid the cost in the 1990s. The society has suffered a wave of mortgage arrears and house repossessions among its 190,000 borrowers. About 2.9 per cent of them were more than 12 months in arrears last year, the worst record of the top 25 societies. Its half-year provision for bad debt quadrupled to Pounds 29.7m. That is the reason why Mr FitzSimons is considering the bold step of pricing mortgages by its assessment of the credit risk of borrowers. The policy will mean that younger people, unmarried couples and, above all, young adults who take out mortgages together will be charged more. Mr FitzSimons says the move may be forced on Bristol &amp; West by its experience of the past five years. The over-eager borrowers who were encouraged by over-eager lenders in the 1980s have proved such a bad risk that he believes it must discriminate in the future. The underlying issue is that southern building societies lent in the 1980s on the assumption that risk was largely covered by the boom in house prices. Any repossessions would be covered by selling the property for a higher price. 'We have not really examined people's ability to pay a debt over 25 years,' Mr Fitz-Simons says. 'The fundamental tenet now should be that, rather than the security value of the property.' Until now, societies have used only people's income and the amount saved as a deposit as indicators. That would change under Mr FitzSimons' proposal. Prospective borrowers would be scored on various factors - most importantly age, marital status and whether they have children - and the mortgage priced accordingly. In spite of its unsettling implications, that was greeted with murmurs of approval among societies yesterday. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, said: 'Some growth in segmentation is inevitable. We have to make more judgments about our borrowers.' Mortgage rates have already started diverging to reflect risk. In consequence, many young first-time buyers are being priced out of the market. No society will now lend more than 95 per cent of the property price, and higher rates of mortgage guarantee insurance in effect lower that to about 93 per cent. Bristol &amp; West's move raises the possibility that the mortgage market will now become segmented according to family status. Yet there are sizeable obstacles. The first is social acceptability. Probably the most controversial aspect of the proposal is its implication for the way people live. As Mr FitzSimons admits, the lending criteria will favour the traditional nuclear family with two children against young adults without family commitments. There appear to be good financial reasons. Mr Fitz-Simons says the society has found unmarried couples are 50 per cent more likely to fall into arrears than married ones. Even so, the society was forced somewhat on to the defensive yesterday. After the disclosure, it issued a statement saying that any scheme 'will have to be broadly acceptable in the mortgage marketplace', and young families with special needs would be 'properly catered for'. Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers Association, said she accepted the principle of pricing for risk. However, she was concerned that the society might breach the Sex Discrimination Act. The second obstacle is that the pricing policy depends on past patterns of behaviour continuing in the future. As Mr Melville-Ross of Nationwide puts it: 'The experience of the past three years may be all that we have got to go on, but it is not an ideal way of judging what will happen.' The accuracy of Bristol &amp; West's pricing will depend on whether there has been a long-term term shift in behaviour, or whether the late 1980s was a blip. Mr FitzSimons argues that there has been a broad change in risk: 'We are finding a lot of 'won't pays' as well as 'can't pays',' he says. The final obstacle is whether the policy even makes sense for Bristol &amp; West. Mr FitzSimons says he regards with equanimity the prospect of high-risk borrowers taking business elsewhere. Yet Bristol &amp; West is burdened not only with bad debts but with an expensive network of branches. Its cost-to-income ratio last year was 55.5 per cent - the seventh-highest of the top 25 societies. To keep the network profitable, he must keep new business flowing in what will be a subdued mortgage market. So there is some way to go before the mortgage market segments into pricing according to demographic status. But whatever the outcome, it seems clear that today's young adults will have to pay for the financial sins of their carefree predecessors.</p>

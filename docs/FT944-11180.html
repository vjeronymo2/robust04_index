			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Proposal on Kurdish language Turkey's foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, said in a newspaper interview yesterday that Kurdish could be taught in schools and used in broadcasting. At present, schools must teach in Turkish and no broadcasting organisation or newspapers use Kurdish, a language spoken by one fifth of the country's population of 60m. However, Mr Soysal said he would insist that Turkish was still taught as a first language. The separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) has waged a 10-year war that has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Prime minister Tansu Ciller has adopted a hardline anti-PKK policy, rejecting calls to grant Kurds cultural rights and autonomy. Neither Mrs Ciller, on a state visit to Egypt, nor her office could confirm that Mr Soysal's comments represent a new government initiative. The unpredictable Mr Soysal, foreign minister since August, belongs to the junior SHP party in Mrs Ciller's coalition government.</p>

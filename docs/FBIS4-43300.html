			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxembourg, June 14 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  has raised ECU300 million (about 345 million dollars) from EU  banks for a ECU2 billion fund to boost investments, the European  Investment Bank (EIB) said here Tuesday [14 June].    EIB Chairman Sir Brian Unwin said the so-called European  Investment Fund would generate guaranteed loans of ECU6 billion  (about 6.9 billion dollars) immediately and nearly three times  that much later on.    The money will be targeted on long-term pan-European rail,  road and tunnel networks aimed at boosting economic growth and  European competitiveness.    The EU has already identified 11 such projects on which it  wants an initial ECU32 billion (about 37 billion dollars)  invested by the turn of the century.    The EIF fund will also be used to fund subsidised loans to  small- and medium-sized businesses. Unwin said the fund  comprised ECU2 billion of subscription capital.    Of this, ECU1.4 billion comes from the EU budget and the EIB  itself, ECU300 million from EU governments, and ECU300 million  from 58 financial institutions -- some of them private -- in all  12 EU countries.    "It's about getting sensible capital into worthwhile  projects," he told a press conference.    The European Commission has scaled down ambitious plan to  finance transport, telecommunications and energy projects  networks originally estimated at ECU120 billion (about 138  billion dollars) over 12 years.    Now the Commission is struggling to keep the skeleton of the  programme intact in the face of unwillingness among many EU  countries to spend public money on ambitious projects at a time  of economic recovery.    The debate will feature high on the agenda of an EU summit  next week on the Greek island of Corfu.</p>

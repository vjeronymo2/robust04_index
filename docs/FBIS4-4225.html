			<p>BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, April 28 (CNS) -- At a meeting on national  civil air safety being held here today, the Director-General of  the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Mr. Chen  Guangyi repeatedly asked representatives from CAAC branches  across the country for strengthened awareness of anti-hijacking  and said that they must not loosen, in the slightest degree,  their efforts in achieving this end.    Mr. Chen stressed that air safety work undertaken by CAAC  had  to be done in accordance with the law and regulations covering  various items including the sale of tickets, checking of  tickets, inspection of luggage and passengers, examination on  board the plane and the handling of hijacking. Responsibility  had to be clearly defined and to be held by officials on duty.  The practice of safety coming first with the emphasis on  precautions had to be employed. Possible hijackers and  incidents likely to pose a threat to air safety have to be dealt  with on the ground and not let them develop to the airborne  stage.    As for hijacking incidents, they have to be fully  investigated right to their end. Responsibilities for hijacking  have to be distinguished clearly while effective measures to  preventing hijacking have to be sought after. Hijacking  incidents have to be seriously handled, the director said.    Since the beginning of last year, CAAC has issued a  succession of rules, regulations, decisions, instructions and  notices for strengthened air safety while at the same time  greatly increasing the number of air security personnel,  equipment, and facilities for the strict implementation of  safety inspections and precautions. Mr Chen said that such  measures had achieved success to some extent in countering  hijacking. The authorities uncovered six hijacking attempts,  arrested 45 suspects who hid firearms and weapons restricted  according to law and seized a number of dangerous items and  contraband articles.</p>

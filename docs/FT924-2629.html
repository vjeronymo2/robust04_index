			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Damage limitation in the heart of Paris: The defence by French banks against the collapse in Parisian property The French financial establishment's capacity to get itself out of a fix is facing its toughest test for years. Banks and insurance companies are closing ranks in an attempt to reduce the damage from the up to FFr80bn (Pounds 9.6bn) of estimated doubtful debts in their property loan portfolios. The threat to their balance sheets is so serious that the government, owner of two of the three biggest banks and three top insurers, plans to announce measures by the end of next week to help the ailing property industry. These could also include some form of refinancing for the worst-hit bank lenders and investors. France's property decline, which has already forced banks to make heavy provisions on dud loans, is happening for similar reasons to its equivalent in the US, Japan and Britain. However, the final outcome will be less catastrophic, partly because the market is less hard hit than elsewhere and because the decline has been concentrated on the capital. Average rentals on Paris commercial property have dropped 20 per cent in three years, though the decline is less bad in the 'Golden Triangle' around the Champs-Elysees. Today, the average commercial vacancy rate in the capital is only 6 per cent, rising to 12 per cent in the office district of La Defense. The close ownership and business links between all those involved has also helped. 'The fact that the market is operated in concert means that the risk of a catastrophic drop in values is very limited,' says Mr David Robinson, partner in the Paris office of Richard Ellis, the property consultants. 'The fundamental difference is that there is no such thing as a free independent developer here. They all have a very close relationship with their banks.' A property analyst says: 'The banks are hardly going to pull the rug from under the developers, because they would only be pulling the rugs from under themselves. In many cases they are the developers. Thanks to this, Paris will not have an Olympia and York.' Credit Lyonnais, Paribas, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale all have stakes in property developers, to which they have also lent heavily. On the surface, French banks face a serious property headache. Estimates of their outstanding property loans vary widely from FFr250bn, by the Paris commercial court, to FFr400bn or FFr500bn, by Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, and Mr Gerard Worms, chairman of Suez. There are no centrally gathered figures. Estimates of the losses they face also vary. Mr Worms and Mr Levy-Lang recently warned that banks could face losses of between FFr45bn and FFr70bn on their property loans, while Mr Didier Rougier, president of the commercial court, believes the final write-down could be as much as FFr80bn. Banks have already set aside FFr20bn of provisions for dud property loans against their profits, but that covers only half the damage, according to James Capel in Paris. To make matters worse, this lending is concentrated in the hands of a few, with nearly FFr123bn outstanding from Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Societe Generale, Paribas and Suez alone. This contrasts with the UK, where foreign banks made more than half of property loans before the crisis hit, or the US where the damage was spread through the savings and loans institutions. Heads have rolled among the unfortunates responsible for bad loans and investments. The past year has seen the departures of the head of Banque Indosuez's property development arm and the chairman of Banque Worms, the UAP insurance group subsidiary crippled by bad property loans. French financial institutions have tried to defray or delay losses on property investments and loans by rescheduling some property loans; turning others into equity to be held by their property investment units; setting up sale and leasebacks; and occupying borrowers' empty buildings. They have also offered potential tenants rent-free periods. Another sweetener is to offer soft loans to potential purchasers, as Indosuez has done with the NMPP building, which it bought from Hachette for FFr2.7bn in 1990, only to declare a FFr1bn provision on the building a year later. It is now trying to sell the building as eight lots, five of which have gone, with the help of a 5 per cent loan, to a Middle Eastern property developer who happens to have a stake in the bank. Insurers, which have substantial property investment portfolios, have been busy recently exchanging Parisian office buildings at high valuations each other, worth several billion francs in the last month alone according to one institutional investor. Typically the buildings concerned were last valued a decade ago, so the process enables insurers to register capital gains to cover losses on insurance claims on their banking businesses. Analysts suspect this might also help prop up property values, a theory denied by one leading insurer, who says it is a legitimate way of realising capital gains on long-held and undervalued properties. Even so, several analysts fear that even after the recent write-offs, French banks and insurance companies could be carrying some of the property loans and investments they made at the peak of the upturn at the end of the 1980s at unrealistically high valuations. They face the choice of declaring another round of heavy write-downs next year, or keeping them at current values until the property market recovers. 'It's really a question of accepting the loss now or putting it off till another time,' says Richard Ellis' Mr Robinson.  ---------------------------------------------------------- LENDING TO PROPERTY DEVELOPERS  ----------------------------------------------------------                                             As % of French As at December 31st 1991         FFr. bn     bank lending  ---------------------------------------------------------- Credit Foncier France              6.2          1.8 Banque Nationale de Paris         25.0          3.2 Credit Lyonnais                   30.0          3.9 Societe Generale                   9.9          1.7 Paribas                           33.1          6.9 Financiere de Suez                24.6          8.8  ----------------------------------------------------------</p>

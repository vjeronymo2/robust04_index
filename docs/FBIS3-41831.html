The figure, considered preliminary by Cuban economists,  appears in a letter and annex sent by Fernando Remirez de  Estenoz, Cuban ambassador to the United Nations, to UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and distributed at UN Headquarters  as an official document of the General Assembly.  [passage omitted]    The report stresses that one of the major strategic impacts  of the blockade consists in closing Cuba's access to advanced  technology and any kind of scientific and technical exchange.    It adds that in the field of medicines, the U.S. blockade  has  had particularly harsh consequences in that it has limited the  nation's ability to acquire third-generation antibiotics  essential in treating severe infections and cytostatic  medication used on cancer patients.    Among other problems, the report stresses that the price of  insulin, which can only be obtained through a European supplier,  has been driven higher because of the great demand in Cuba.  There are an average of 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000  residents, and many Cuban diabetics are dependent on insulin.</p>

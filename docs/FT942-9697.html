			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Esso oil is to reappear in India Esso oil is to reappear in India after an absence of 18 years under a deal reached yesterday by Exxon, the US oil company that owns the Esso brand, and Hindustan Petroleum of India. The two companies have signed a licensing and marketing agreement that will allow Hindustan Petroleum to blend and market Esso lubricants and other speciality products in India. Exxon, which uses the Esso trademark for its products outside the US, pulled out of India partially in 1974 and completely in 1976 because of the adverse economic and political climate then prevailing. Since then, the Indian government has taken steps to liberalise its markets. Last year it approved investment plans by several western companies including Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks company, which returned to the country after an absence of 16 years. Exxon previously owned a refinery and a lubricant manufaturing plant in Bombay and was the market leader in aviation and marine fuels. When it left, the facilities were bought by the Indian government and are now owned by Hindustan Petroleum. Under the new arrangement, Exxon will use its refinery in Singapore - its largest in the Asia-Pacific area - to supply Hindustan Petroleum with the basic ingredients for a range of lubricants. Hindustan Petroleum will blend them to Exxon's specifications and sell them under the Esso name. Exxon's presence in the Indian market will be relatively small compared to its position before 1976. But it said the move was significant because it would re-establish the Esso brand in India and provide a platform for expansion. Mr Kwa Chong Seng, chairman and managing director of Esso Singapore, said market studies had shown that Indian consumers had a strong awareness of the Esso brand name.</p>

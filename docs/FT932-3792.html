			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / US inflation figures ease fears of interest rate rise FEARS that the Federal Reserve might raise short-term interest rates in the US eased yesterday after the release of encouraging inflation figures. The Labour Department said the producer price index was unchanged last month after increases of 0.4 per cent and 0.6 per cent in March and April. The annual rate of wholesale price inflation dropped to 2 per cent from 2.4 per cent in April. Separately, the Commerce Department reported a 0.1 per cent rise in retail sales last month, which was smaller than expected. Share and bond prices rose as analysts discounted the chance of an immediate tightening of monetary policy. The dollar weakened slightly against leading currencies. Consumer prices for May, due on Tuesday, are also expected to show an ebbing in inflationary pressures. If so, the Fed seems certain to leave rates unchanged at 3 per cent for at least the next month. Many economists predict that inflationary pressures will remain moderate throughout the summer, in which case the Fed may take no action before September or October. Speculation about a possible rise in rates grew intense last month after the third set of bad inflation figures since Christmas. The annualised rate of inflation for the first four months was more than 4 per cent compared with 3 per cent in 1992. Concerns were exacerbated when press leaks indicated that Fed governors and regional presidents voted last month to shift from a neutral stance on interest rates to a bias towards raising them. Minutes of a previous meeting showed that two Fed governors were pressing for higher rates as long ago as March. However, a shift to a bias towards raising rates does not necessarily imply an early tightening of policy. The Fed may simply have wanted to reassure financial markets that it was concerned about inflation until distortions which pushed up price figures earlier this year began to unwind. Many economists have long argued that the monthly figures had to improve because the economic recovery was too weak to put sustained upward pressure on prices. Wage settlements are moderate and the unemployment rate, at 6.9 per cent, is well above the level that has previously led to higher inflation. If economic growth continues, the Fed is expected to nudge rates higher over the next 12 to 18 months to a more sustainable level of perhaps 4 to 4.5 per cent.

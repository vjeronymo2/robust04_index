			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by JB: "More Effective Waste Water Treatment With </F> the Biogas Tower Reactor"]    [Text] Anaerobic biotechnical waste water treatment in  bioreactors is today already being used by the food industry,  pulp production, and paper manufacturing companies. The field of  bioprocessing technology at the Hamburg-Harburg Technical  University (Professor Herbert Maerkl, Denickestrasse 15, 21071,  Hamburg) has now, in cooperation with Preussag Noell  Wassertechnik GmbH, developed a new type of bioreactor concept  for increasing the decomposition effects.    As reported by Maerkl, anaerobic biotechnical cleaning  methods are generally held to be less effective than aerobic  ones. This is due to the slow rate of growth of the anaerobic  microorganisms. However, the decomposition effects per gram of  biomass are comparable to those of aerobic microbes. For that  reason, if it is possible to increase the biomass in the  reactor, anaerobic methods are also very effective. This  increase has been achieved with the biogas tower reactor from  Hamburg by using the sludge bed process. Another problem with  anaerobic bioreactors is transferring the generated biogas to  the outside. Gas production can be so high that disposal is  impossible to deal with or would lead to a loss of biomass  through flotation. This problem is also solved by the tower  reactor. Gas suction equipment has been built into the reactor  container at various heights. This makes it possible to dispose  of gas even at low levels. Technically, the suction equipment  works by adding pockets in the form of sloping metal sheets in  the reactor volume. They partition the reactor into several  compartments connected with each other and catch the rising  biogas. The gas bubble formed under the sheet can be drawn off  through a vent placed there. By regulating the gas extraction at  the various heights, it is possible to regulate the gas content  so as to be uniform throughout the reactor. But the gas bubble  under the pockets has other advantages as well. By means of the  free surfaces formed on the liquid, floating biomass particles  are also kept down. Therefore, the gas extraction is possible  without loss of biomass. The pockets can also help when mixing  the reactor content. It is important for the decomposition  effect that the microorganisms and the added waste water are as  evenly distributed as possible. Since some microbes live in the  form of symbiotic agglomerates, this blending must have as  little gravitational force as possible. This problem is  elegantly solved in the biogas tower reactor.    If the gas under the pockets is not removed, it continues to  rise upward over an overflow edge. Through built-in flow  channels this creates a circulating flow in the liquid. It can  be controlled by the level of gas removal. In this way various  blending intensities can be regulated in the various  compartments of the reactor. The requirement to achieve good  blending in the lower reactor areas and a high storage capacity  for the biomass in the higher areas is easily met. By properly  regulating the blending, the inhibiting effect of hydrogen  sulfide, which is created from sulfate in the waste water, can  also be reduced.    At this time a 20-meter-high reactor with a diameter of one  meter is being operated as a pilot facility. It has turned out  to be successful in treating yeast waste water.</p>

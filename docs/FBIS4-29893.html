			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, unusual moves [simsangchi  anun umjigimdul] are being made on U.S. Army bases in Japan at a  time when the U.S. hostile policy of crushing the Republic is  becoming all the more obvious [migugui pan konghwaguk choktaesi  apsal chaektongi poda nogorhwa toego innun kotkkwa ttaerul kachi  hayo].    U.S. battleships frequently enter and leave port at the  Yokosuka base, the sortie ground of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The  flagship Blue Ridge left port on the morning of 17 June,  following the sailing out of port by the large naval destroyer  (Pipe). Four U.S. warships -- including the missile cruiser  Mobile Bay, the naval destroyer O'Brien, and an oil tanker --  are at anchor at this base, and the aircraft carrier  Independence that participated in the Rimpac-94 joint military  exercise, will return there.    The Independence abruptly made an unplanned call at this  base  to be refueled on the evening of 3 June and left port on the  following day without any accompanying ship.    Foreign media reported that this aircraft carrier had  received an order from the U.S. secretary of defense to stay in  waters, from which it can get to the Korean peninsula within a  week.    The U.S. ammunition ship Mauna Kea recently made port in  this  base and brought a large amount of ammunition in the (Urago)  ammunition repository for two days.    U.S. military planes are busy conducting exercises in the  Iwakuni base, an air base of the U.S. Marine Corps where 38  military planes including various attack planes and electronic  warplanes are deployed.    Witnesses said that FA-18 attack planes were carrying out an  exercise of flying toward the North, AV-8B attack planes carried  by the amphibious assault ship Belleau Wood were conducting a  vertical taking off and landing exercise.    Nuclear-powered submarines have unusually and frequently  entered and left port at the Sasebo base in Nagasaki Prefecture  since the beginning of the year. The number of ammunition ships  and refueling ships entering port is also increasing. The  number of ammunition and refueling ships that entered port in  this base this year is 82, up 60 percent from the same period  last year. Most of those refueling ships come from South Korea.    The U.S. Forces in Okinawa are carrying out exercises, under  the simulation of sanctions and use of arms with Okinawa as the  supposed battlefield. Troops of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed  there are frenzied particularly in special operations training  and exercise.    These busy moves in U.S. Army bases in Japan are arousing  our  extensive alert [kipun kyonggyesim].</p>

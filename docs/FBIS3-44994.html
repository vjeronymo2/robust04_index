The decrease in recent years in the acreage of such  important  crops as grain, cotton and vegetables must be reversed, said  State Councillor Chen Junsheng.    Chen, who is in charge of China's agricultural and rural  affairs, was speaking to more than 300 agricultural officials  attending a national conference on agriculture that ended on  Saturday.    He said it is of strategic importance to national stability  and the smooth implementation of a series of crucial reform  measures this year to ensure adequate supply of farm produce.    China has decided to plant at least 110 million hectares of  grain and 6 million hectares of cotton this year to reach its  1994 target of 450 million tons of grain and 4.85 million tons  of cotton.    Even though the acreage of grain planted last year declined  by about 666,700 hectares from 1992, China managed to reap  another bumper harvest with a slight increase over the 442.6  million tons of grain harvested in 1992.    In 1992, about 1.86 million hectares of grain fields were  used to plant cash crops or for non-farming purposes.    Chen criticized the rush to enclose and occupy large  sections  of farmland, including vegetable fields in suburbs, for  development of real estate markets, industrial projects and  other purposes.    "Stimulated by quick profits, many areas, especially those  in  coastal regions, have abandoned agricultural production," he  added.    Some former grain-exporting provinces have become  grain-importing ones, Chen noted.    And output in former grain-importing provinces, including  Guangdong, has declined further.    Guangdong, with the country's most vibrant economy, has seen  its farmland reduced by some 310,000 hectares since 1991. Its  grain yield was 16.3 million tons last year, down 1.796 million  tons, or 9.9 percent, from that in 1992. Its 1992 grain output  was 3.4 per cent less than in 1991.    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, most of the  provinces in South China have experienced a decrease in output  of grain and cotton.    Chen laid the blame on less profitable farming, which has  forced more and more farmers to leave farmland uncultivated, and  the issuing of IOU notes --failing to pay farmers in cash when  purchasing farm produce -- and increasing financial and labour  burdens on farmers.</p>

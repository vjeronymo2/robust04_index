			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour prepares blueprint for statutory British SEC A LABOUR government would set up a full-blown British Securities and Exchange Commission with comprehensive supervisory and enforcement powers, the party said yesterday. Under a blueprint set out by Mr Stuart Bell, a trade and industry spokesman, the new body would swallow the much-criticised Serious Fraud Office, which would become its enforcement arm and take over fraud, regulatory and supervisory work from the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Bell said that the SEC would be a statutory authority with powers over retail banking, building societies, insurance, corporate governance, accountancy, pension funds and the Lloyd's insurance market. Labour would also overhaul insolvency laws, introducing US-style chapter-eleven procedures to give companies in difficulty a 'better chance of survival'. Mr Bell's speech to the Oxford University business summer school appeared to open a rift over City regulation between Labour's Treasury and trade and industry teams. Less than two months ago Mr Alistair Darling, a front bench Treasury spokesman, said he did not advocate the 'importation' of a US-style SEC. Mr Bell said Labour would 'build upon' the recent Large report on 'improving the efficacy of financial regulation' to provide greater openness, cost-effectiveness and public accountability. He promised Labour would 'consult widely' with the City. Anticipating criticism of Labour's suggested approach, Mr Bell argued that statutory regulation was 'no more time-consuming or expensive than self-regulation'.</p>

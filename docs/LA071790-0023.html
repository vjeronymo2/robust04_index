			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Stick Up for Your Rights: Virgin Records will begin implementing its own brand  of warning label for rock records starting in August -- a pro-First Amendment  sticker. Jeff Ayeroff, Virgin's co-managing director, told The Times Monday  that all Virgin Records albums, tapes and CDs will feature an anti-censorship  label that reads: "The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you  hear, what you say and what you think.  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP IS UNAMERICAN. Don't let anyone take away that right. Raise your  political voice. Register to vote." Ayeroff said that Virgin will also make the  label available to artists at other companies. Boogie Down Productions, a rap  group that records for RCA, is slated to be the first outside artist to use the  new sticker, he said. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

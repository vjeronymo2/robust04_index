			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zvornik, March 23 (TANJUG) -- A convoy of the U.N.  High Commessariat for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday crossed the  territory of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) on its way for  Moslem-held Tuzla, northeast Bosnia, Bosnian Serb military  sources in Zvornik said.    The 13 truck convoy was carrying 104 tonnes of flour.    Another relief aid convoy was also scheduled to leave for  Tuzla, but the UNHCR team failed to return from a previous  humanitarian mission, the Zvornik authorities were told.    Bosnian Serb military sources said that the fact that since  their very start the humanitarian land convoys for Tuzla have  crossed Bosnian Serb territory safely and unhindered, gives rise  for doubts in the humanitarian reasons for the opening of the  Tuzla airport.    The sources said that the land routes enable the efficient  ferrying of much bigger quantities of relif aid to Tuzla than  via the air bridge.</p>

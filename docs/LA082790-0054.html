			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES  </P> <P> Go West -- to Michigan?  </P> <P> There goes our plastics industry.  </P> <P> Action West, a coalition of 15 counties in southwestern Michigan, has launched  business development ads that debase the stereotyped California lifestyle in  favor of another west coast lifestyle -- the west coast of Michigan.  </P> <P> The ads, running in trade publications such as Modern Plastics and Food  Engineering, tout southwestern Michigan as "America's Other West Coast."They  are aimed at luring businesses to their corner of the Great Lakes State.  </P> <P> One ad is headlined "Imagine a West Coast without all those condos, kooks and  quakes." Another says, "Imagine a West Coast where plastic is more than just an  attitude." It is aimed at attracting plastics manufacturers.  </P> <P> John Sebestyen, executive vice president of Johnson &amp; Dean, the Grand  Rapids agency behind the ads, says it's "all done in good fun."  </P> <P> "We're not even selling against California," Sebestyen contends. Still, he  admits, he got a call from a Detroit woman who wanted to know "why we're  picking on California. I told her, 'I really don't think they're losing a lot  of sleep over this.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Barbies for a Mickey Mantle?  </P> <P> Trading cards, once the domain of baseball-crazy boys, are now available to  girls who love Barbie dolls. Mattel is jumping into the $350-million-a-year  trading card market in a big way, offering packs of 10 oversized Barbie trading  cards for $1 and a coordinating poster for $3.  </P> <P> There are more than 300 different cards, each with Barbie in a fashionable  outfit, beginning with her shapely debut in a 1959 striped, one-piece swimsuit.  "We elected not to add the pink bubble gum, although it would be a natural,"  said Meryl Friedman, vice president of marketing and product development for  Barbie's lifestyle group.  </P> <P> Mattel predicts that the cards will appeal to mothers and daughters who, for  three decades, have picked up fashion tips by dressing their Barbie dolls for  dates with Ken.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Latest Dirt on Rodeo Drive  </P> <P> Rodeo Drive has new gardeners, but the change has nothing to do with how well  the landscaping has looked on the glitzy street.  </P> <P> The switch stemmed from a turn in an ongoing legal battle launched in 1984 by  the Rodeo Drive Committee, a group of 80 merchants and property owners. To  protect the Rodeo image, the committee sued an apparel firm that unveiled a  Rodeo Drive line, accusing it of trademark infringement.  </P> <P> California Guys N Gals, the apparel firm, countersued and won $180,000 in legal  fees. The firm then tried to recover some of the money by filing a claim  against a $40,000 contract under which Beverly Hills was paying the Rodeo  committee to maintain the street's median. The committee responded by canceling  the contract and asking the city to do the gardening itself.  </P> <P> So how does Rodeo's landscaping look?  </P> <P> "It's just a dirt strip, with dead weeds in it," said Richard Weaver of  California Guys N Gals. Joan Luther of the Rodeo Drive Committee retorted: "The  median strip is as bright and beautiful as ever."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Flemish minister of culture, Hugo Weckx, is  considering terminating the advertising monopoly of the Flemish  VTM commercial cable television station. Mr. Weckx said on  Tuesday [10 May] he expects VTM to apply for a licence to set up  a second channel and this could open the door for other  commercial stations to make their appearance on the Flemish  cable network. And there's no lack of candidates. [passage  omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] The statement of Minister for  Culture Hugo Weckx is a reaction to the deal concluded last week  between the Belgian Football Association and the Flemish  commercial television station VTM. At a cost of around three  million dollars a year, VTM secured the rights of televised  football matches over a period of four years. The BRTN felt  cheated and spoke openly of a breach of promise by the Belgian  Football Association and VTM. The public broadcaster had  expected to reach an agreement between the three parties to  share the costs of the television rights for soccer games.    According to Minister Weckx, the VTM commercial station can  impossibly [as heard] meet its obligations toward the football  association without a second channel. And that is precisely  what the station wants, because there are other candidates who  are more than eager to get their share of the cake. And that  cake is worth more than seven billion francs in commercials a  year, around 200 million U.S. dollars.    A Swedish broadcasting concern has shown great interest to  get on the cable in Flanders. SBS, which stands for  Scandinavian Broadcasting System, wants to appear in the Flemish  households before the summer of next year, and that news has led  to mild forms of panic in VTM, BRTN, and Flemish political  circles. [passage omitted]    The general feeling in Flemish media circles is that SBS  will  not easily conquer the market over here. In Scandinavia the  station's top programmes are U.S. soap series like The Cosby  Show and the Oprah Winfrey talk show, and the rights of many of  these programs are already in the hands of VTM or BRTN.    For the Flemish media specialists, it's a certainty that the  advertising monopoly of VTM will be abolished sooner or later,  whether by SBS or another candidate. [passage omitted]</p>

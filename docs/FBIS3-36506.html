			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" No. 24 feature] </F>   [Text] The Russian President's foreign policy adviser  Dmitriy Ryurikov has described Thursday's [3 February]  Russian-Georgian summit as a success. "Russia and Georgia are  historically bound to cooperate with each other in that region,  they are linked by bonds of long-running friendship and need  each other," he told Interfax.    Ryurikov says that the outline agreement will build up their  potential to help towards a peaceful solution to the conflicts  in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It is this move that was long  awaited both in the Caucasus and Black Sea region as a whole.    The presidential adviser denies any threat from Russia's  commitment to help Georgia set up its own army. Nor will this  lead to renewed conflicts in Abkhazia or South Ossetia, he says.  Militarily, said Ryurikov, Russia will prefer to deal with a  disciplined army rather than separate armed units meddling in  politics.    In his words, Russia is determined to effectively monitor  the  process of creating a Georgian army while the Russian military  are well aware of how responsible is the job facing them.    Speaking to local intellectuals in Tbilisi on Thursday,  Yeltsin said that a balanced, unbiased and well-wishing approach  to all sides in the conflicts was Moscow's foreign policy  priority. He said any other approach would be perilous both to  Russia and other countries. In his words, Russia is prepared to  offer whatever help is needed to defuse all conflicts in the  region.    On the framework agreement between Moscow and Tbilisi,  Yeltsin said its ratification would depend on the extent of  Georgia's drive for a negotiated solution to the confrontation  in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. He called on Georgian  intellectuals to play an important role in the regional peace  process.    The Russian leader described the CIS as "a very effective  instrument for the peoples' rapprochement" and Georgia's entry  into the Commonwealth as "a sensible move".</p>

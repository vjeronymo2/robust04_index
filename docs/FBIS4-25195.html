			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy is  expected to continue its modest growth in the second half of  1994, the First Commercial Bank reported Monday [6 Jun].    In its report on domestic economic outlook for the next six  months, the bank said the domestic economy will benefit from the  gradual recovery of the global economy, the depreciation of the  new Taiwan dollar, the ongoing six-year national development  plan, the government's economic stimulus package, increasing  private consumption, and stable consumer prices.    Citing estimates made by the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and  Statistics (DGBAS), the bank noted that the world economy should  grow 3 percent this year as compared with 2.2 percent last year,  and said the domestic economy should expand 6.24 percent in the  third quarter and 6.30 percent in the fourth quarter.    The estimated economic growth for the latter half of the  year  is better than that of the first six months, which the DGBAS put  at 5.58 percent.    The bank, one of the three big banks run by the Taiwan  provincial government -- the other two being Hua Nan Commercial  Bank and Chang Hwa Commercial Bank, also saw some negative  factors coming into play in the next six months.    These include increasing government debt, sluggishness in  domestic investment, a lack of progress in major construction  projects, the worsening labor shortage, uncertainty caused by  ever- increasing indirect trade across the Taiwan Strait, and  stiff export competition from the mainland and Southeast Asian  countries, the bank report elaborated.    The government's debt level is expected to soar to an  all-time high of NT$1.37 trillion (U.S.$50.55 billion) in fiscal  1995, which begins on July 1.    Meanwhile, the report saw as a positive sign the expected  stable growth of the domestic money supply between July and  December. It said the M2 supply should grow at an annual rate  of between 14 percent and 16 percent, or near the 15 percent  target set by the Central Bank of China.    The broadly-defined M2 is the total stock of money in the  national economy comprising cash in circulation, checking and  demand deposits, passbook savings accout , plus quasi-money  (including time deposits and treasury bills).    The M2 supply rose by 14.84 in the first quarter, higher  than  the 14.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. The money  supply increased by a 12-month high of 15.41 percent in April.    The expected improvement in foreign trade, growing foreign  investment in the domestic stock market, and the lowering of  domestic interest rates are expected to help push up the capital  demand from the private sector, the report pointed out.    Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only U.S.$590 million  in the first four months of the year, down 66.9 percent from the  year- earlier level, while foreign institutional investors have  applied to invest U.S.$9.347 billion in the Taiwan stock  exchange since the ban on foreign stock investment was lifted in  late 1992.    In addition, domestic financial institutions slashed  interest  rates one after another last week following similar moves in  March and April.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / International Company News: Passenger trend behind KLM's tumble into red KLM Royal Dutch Airlines swung into a heavy loss of Fl 562m (Dollars 312m) last year, due partly to the trend among passengers to choose tourist class over business and first class as well as to continued losses at Northwest, the Dutch group's minority-owned US airline. The loss - for the year ended March - compares with a net profit of Fl 125m the year before. Passenger traffic rose, but the airline also saw a sharp increase in demand for cheaper seats, resulting in a 9 per cent decline in average yields. The guilder's strength and fierce international competition also lay behind the downturn. KLM has written down the remaining Fl 438m book value of its Northwest stake to zero, compared with the Dollars 400m it paid for the shares in 1989. This accounts for the widening of total losses in associate airlines to Fl 388m from Fl 145m. The figure would have been higher had it not been for profits posted by Dutch charter airline Martinair. Mr Pieter Bouw, president, said: 'This does not however mean that we have written off Northwest Airlines. Nor that we have waived (our) loans to Northwest.' The Dutch airline is to omit its 1992-1993 dividend. In 1991-1992 KLM had resumed dividends after a one-year hiatus. KLM planned to redouble efforts to reduce costs and return to profitability, Mr Bouw said. This will include a reconfiguration of seats in its Boeing 747 fleet to increase the size of tourist class and reduce the availability of first and business class. Other measures might include taking aircraft out of service and pruning the route network. He said he was optimistic about co-operation talks between KLM, SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. Swissair said yesterday that it and three other European airlines intended to sign a memorandum of understanding on their planned alliance at the end of this month.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Lonrho vote on Rowland today Lonrho directors will today vote on whether to strip Mr Tiny Rowland of his executive powers, in a move which may end his 33-year reign over the international trading group. Although the formal agenda of today's board meeting does not contain a motion to depose him as joint chief executive, directors are expected to raise the question of whether he should continue in the post as part of 'any other business'. One director said: 'I am determined to push to remove him.' However, another said: 'Betting against Tiny has always been dangerous.' The move to oust Mr Rowland has been prompted by disclosures that he costs the company more than Pounds 5.5m a year in salary, expenses and other charges under his direct control. Some directors are also concerned that the company has sold a recently completed film about the Lockerbie bombing to an Egyptian company linked to Libya, in possible contravention of United Nations sanctions. Mr Rowland has increasingly been at loggerheads with his joint chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock, a German developer who owns 18.8 per cent of the group. The board meeting, which will begin mid-morning in London, is expected to be attended by all 14 directors. Mr Rowland can be certain of the support of only two board members, Mr Rene Leclezio and Mr Robert Dunlop, both of whom retire this autumn. A simple majority of voting directors is necessary to strip a director of executive powers. There is unlikely to be an attempt to remove Mr Rowland from the board altogether, as this requires a notice to be signed by 75 per cent of directors. Mr Rowland may attempt to supersede the board by calling an extraordinary meeting of shareholders. One of the group's biggest shareholders said yesterday that if Mr Rowland did this, his institution would vote its shares based on the recommendation of Lonrho's three non-executive directors, who were appointed on Mr Bock's initiative. The Pounds 5.5m annual cost of Mr Rowland includes a contribution of about Pounds 500,000 to the costs of his two homes, more than Pounds 1m in business expenses and Pounds 200,000 to pay for the education of dependants of African politicians.</p>

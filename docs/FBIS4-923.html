			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning South Africa" program; italicized </F> passage in English]    [Text] Soon after the announcement yesterday that the  Inkatha Freedom Party was to participate in the election, Gary  Alfonso spoke to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on his call to  the Zulus to vote, and the possibility that violence would now  begin to decline.    [Begin recording] [Zwelithini] The king doesn't  particpate in politics, in political party politics, so I don't  think it would be good for a king to dictate to the people who  must they vote for, and who must they not vote for, because I  don't think by doing that, that wouldn't mean that the king now  stands with other political parties. [sentence as heard] So I  think the Zulus, as I know that they are affiliated in all  different political aparties, so it's not the duty for the king,  actually, to tell them who must they vote for, who must they not  vote for.    [Alfonso] Your Majesty, do you think all people in  South Africa, or most people in South Africa, the overwhelming  majority now going to the polls and voting, do you think that's  enough to stop the violence?    [Zwelithini] Actually, it's something that needs to be  looked at. It's not the throne, or the Zul? throne, that has  caused violence in this country. The king has been there as a  symbol of unity of his people, so the king was very much  surprised to see that people are killing each other because of  their differences in politics. So now, as far as I am  concerned, the tension that has been increasing in between the  political parties needs to come down, especially from the  followers themselves, because the political leaders have been  pleading to the people to stop this violence. But it means to  me that it has never been actually addressed so much to the  grass-root level, because those are the people who need actually  to be addressed and to be reminded about peaceful structures  which need to be put in practise most of the time. So I hope  that with the announcements today in kwaZulu-Natal, the violence  that has erupted in this province, it needs to come to an end  today, and tomorrow. [end recording]</p>

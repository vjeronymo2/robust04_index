			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> An official Soviet magazine published works by Leon Trotsky for the first time  since the long-reviled former hero of the 1917 revolution was exiled and, in  1940, assassinated in Mexico, presumably by agents of his archrival, Josef  Stalin. Young Communist republished a series of Trotsky's articles called "The  New Course," first printed in the party daily Pravda in 1923. The magazine said  that publication of Trotsky's writing is "a step toward restoring him as an  eloquent revolutionary and man of letters." President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  glasnost (openness) campaign has not rehabilitated Trotsky as it has other  Communist Party members executed by Stalin's orders, but he is now treated as a  historic figure.  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Le Comptoir falls into the red LE COMPTOIR des Entrepreneurs, the troubled French financial group, yesterday confirmed that it fell into the red in the first half of this year with a net consolidated loss of FFr940.5m (Dollars 167m) against net profits of FFr23.7m in the same period of last year. The company, which has been badly affected by the problems of the French commercial property market, is in the final stages of being rescued by its shareholders in a restructuring package orchestrated by the Bank of France and the economy ministry. Le Comptoir, which went into deficit last year with a net loss of FFr1.05bn, was forced in February to turn to the French authorities for help after it hit serious liquidity problems. The company said the rescue package was 'progressing' but it could not give any indication of its likely performance for the full financial year. Mr Francis Lemasson, chairman, recently stated that he did not expect Le Comptoir to break even until 1995. Group turnover fell sharply in the first half to FFr3bn, against FFr4.8bn in the interim period of 1992. Le Comptoir attributed the decline in activity to the continuing pressures on the property market and its own financial difficulties. It was forced to make provisions of FFr1.31bn in the first half. Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the state-controlled insurance company which is the largest shareholder in Le Comptoir, last week cited the losses on its 30 per cent stake as one of the main reasons for its static first-half profits.</p>

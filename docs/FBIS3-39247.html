			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Elections -- Choice of </F> Continuity"]    [Text] The Socialist Party (PS) bureau, the steering  committee of the Social Christian Party (PSC), and the executive  committee of the Liberal Reformation Party (PRL) all selected on  7 February the "stars" to head their electoral lists for the  European elections in June. It will be, and no surprises here,  Jose Happart, Gerard Deprez, and Jean Gol respectively who will  be called upon to set their parties apart from the rest. The PS  is placing its trust in the team of the five outgoing European  deputies and therefore is banking on continuity. Jose Happart,  Raymonde Dury, Claude Desama, and Claude Delacroix will stand  for the four top spots.    Behind these four candidates for continuity are less  well-known names, with the exception of the candidate in tenth  and last spot, Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain. On the  secondary list we find Claude Delacroix and Robert Urbain in  first and second place respectively, and Ministers Laurette  Onkelinx, Robert Collignon, and Magda De Galan bringing up the  rear.    At the end of the bureau meeting the PS president stated:  "We have put our trust in the outgoing team, while making room  for younger people and women."    Despite the results of the most recent Dimarso poll, the PS  is currently banking on four sitting MEPs [member of the  European Parliament] for the European elections, Philippe  Bosquin emphasized. Moreover, the results of the opinion polls  should be read cautiously, he said, noting that the PS was way  down in the polls at the start of 1993 while it was the only  party to defend the wage-indexation system.    The PS president again justified giving the top two spots to  Jose Happart and Raymonde Dury by noting the desire of the PS to  reaffirm its commitment to the solidarity between Wallonia and  Brussels and to equality of the sexes.  <H5>  PSC: Deprez Signs Up Again </H5>   The PSC's list for the European elections will thus again be  headed by Gerard Deprez, followed by Fernand Herman and  Dominique Jeanmoye. The last place goes to Albert Lienard,  while ninth spot will be defended by Jean-Pierre Grafe.    Michele Bribosia is first on the secondary list, followed by  Anne-Marie Corbisier and Marc Bertrand. In seventh, eight, and  ninth place we find Jean-Louis Thys, Michel Lebrun, and Guy  Lutgen.    In a press statement, the steering committee which drew up  this list on Monday stated that five spots remained open,  including the last spot on the secondary list, and that the  mandate of the wise mens' committee had been confirmed to  complete the list.  <H3>  Liberal Reform Party-French-Speaking Democratic Front  (PRL-FDF): Gol Before Spaak </H3>   The PRL [Liberal Reform Party] executive committee met on  Monday to examine the list that the PRL-FDF federation is to  present for the European elections. This PRL-FDF list will be  headed by PRL President and Deputy Jean Gol. Antoinette Spaak,  the FDF [French-Speaking Democratic Front] deputy, will take  second spot.    In a communique, Jean Gol stated that he wanted in this way  to commit himself to strengthening the European Union, a liberal  and democratic Europe, and the influence of the French-speaking  community in Belgium and in Europe. He also wanted to offer the  electorate the possibility of disowning the parties of the  majority and the policy directions taken in Belgium by the  Dehaene government.    The PRL's executive committee also decided that at least one  third of the names on the PRL-FDF list would be women and that  all the subregions of Wallonia would be represented, in addition  to Brussels.    The complete PRL-FDF list should be officially presented  sometime next week.    The PRL president's concluding speech delivered this weekend  at the University of Liege, at the "Forum of Liberal and  Democratic French-Speakers of Europe," traced the main policies  which, to the president's mind, must be the leading principles  guiding European integration: "European integration must above  all be a political project; one of the most urgent tasks facing  us is to reconcile the unity and diversity of Europe; we need  more Europe, not less; we want a Europe that is strong,  independent, and which can be sure of respect; Europe must first  concern itself with the welfare of its citizens; different  cultural identities are one of Europe's advantages and we must  cultivate our identity, that of French language and culture; and  Europe must be open to the rest of the world and take on greater  responsibility."</p>

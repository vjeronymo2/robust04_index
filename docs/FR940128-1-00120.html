			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Use of vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained above, vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged smoked,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored, and salted fish products represent an increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health hazard over conventionally packaged products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because these types of packaging provide the ideal environment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for spore outgrowth and toxin production. Based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion above, the agency states in section 3 of Example 6 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this appendix that these types of packaging should be used only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when: (1) As provided in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix the product is a hot-process smoked or smoke-flavored  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere-packed, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product, or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the finished product (section 4.a.1. of Example 6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix); (2) as provided in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this appendix, the product is a cold-process smoked or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packed, and contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finished product or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrite.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is providing in Appendix C, section 8.a. that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging should be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the processing plant where the product is manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 180). FDA considers this limitation appropriate to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any postprocessing contamination of the product from bacterial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogens and to ensure that the fish will be packaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately after processing to protect its overall quality.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Process monitoring. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 7 of Example 6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix, the agency is recommending specifications for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature indicating and recording devices where they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended elsewhere in this appendix. These proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications are the same as those proposed in Appendix A for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products (Appendix A, section 7). A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full discussion of these controls is provided in section VII.J.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the preamble to this document. Temperature indicating and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recording devices are specifically recommended in section 5.j.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 5.k. of Example 6 of this appendix for the control of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoking temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, the agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommending specific controls to ensure that the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water-phase salt and sodium nitrate levels are achieved. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance of these attributes has already been discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this document. In section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency recommends that a processor perform or obtain a study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that shows that under certain processing conditions the desired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water phase salt or sodium nitrite level will reliably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved. The processor should monitor those processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions identified by the study as having an impact on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability of the product to achieve the desired level. The study  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should provide critical limits for each of the relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing conditions (e.g. maximum fish size, minimum soak time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum salt to product ratio).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the existence of numerous variables that affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability of fish to uniformly take up salt and sodium nitrite,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it may be appropriate for a processor to perform periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finished product water phase salt or sodium nitrite analyses as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification step. The purpose of such analyses would be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify any variables that have an impact on salt or nitrite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absorption that were not identified by the study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Corrective actions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  At section 9 of Example 6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix, the agency is recommending corrective action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. These proposed procedures are the same as those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Appendix A, section 8). A full discussion of the procedures is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in section VII.J.5 of the preamble to this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Sanitary zones. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  At section 10 of Example 6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix, the agency is recommending the institution of sanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> zones. This proposed control procedure is the same as that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Appendix A, section 9). A full discussion of the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure is provided in section VII.J.6 of the preamble to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further ensure the safety of the product during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution and storage, FDA is considering adopting specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package labeling requirements for smoked and smoke-flavored fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products to reduce the opportunity of temperature abuse of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finished product. The agency requests comments on whether it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should require that the label of all shipping containers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail packages state that the product is perishable, and, more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically, that the product must be kept refrigerated. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tentatively finds that such labeling is extremely important to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring the safe handling of these products, and, therefore, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers it likely that it will require this labeling in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule. The agency requests comment on whether it should do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so. The agency also requests comment on whether, if it decides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require such a label statement, the statement should specify a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature at which the product should be refrigerated (e.g. 40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4.4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or below). The agency is also considering requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the label of all frozen smoked products state that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product must remain frozen, that if the product needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thawed, it must be thawed at refrigerated temperatures, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product must not be refrozen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has authority to adopt these labeling requirements under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections 201(n), 403(a), and 701(a) of the act because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections require the inclusion of facts on the food label that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are material with respect to consequences that may result from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of the product under conditions of use prescribed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> label or that are otherwise customary or usual. The agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on whether it is necessary to do so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

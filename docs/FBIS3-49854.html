Our delegation included Alija Izetbegovic,  president of the Presidency; Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic;  Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic; and Muhamed Sacirbey,  ambassador of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the United  Nations. The Croatian side was represented by Franjo Tudjman,  Mate Granic, and Mile Akmadzic.    The Croatian side presented a very detailed proposal on  access to the sea for the future Bosnian Republic within the  union of republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the  plan, access to the sea for the Bosnian republics would be on  the territory of the Peljesac Peninsula, across from the port of  Ploce. It would extend about 7 km. The length of access on  land would be about 1.5 km. This involves the region between the  bays of Serevo and (Ilisa) on Peljesac.    The delegation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to examine this  proposal. The open question that imposes itself in this case is  how to get from the port of Ploce to this proposed territory. A  group of experts has been formed and it started work at 1100.    At this meeting with the Croatian delegation the position of  Mostar was broached. The Croatian side proposes the division of  Mostar into six local communities, while our delegation insists  on the whole of Mostar. A problem seems to be Rastani and  Vracici and also the territory of Mostar airport, which should  remain within the city region because, as Prime Minister  Silajdzic pointed out, Mostar could hardly survive without the  airport.    The meeting of experts at 1100 is to discuss the airport  issue as well, and, as was pointed out, the talks will continue.  The talks will be resumed in Medjugorje this month, so more  about these disputed issues will only be known in about two to  three weeks.    The meeting of all three delegations with cochairmen Owen  and  Stoltenberg has just begun and the first version of the draft of  the final agreement is expected to be made. Our correspondent  Mirza Hajric will present the details of the plenary session at  our next newscast after the meeting ends.</p>

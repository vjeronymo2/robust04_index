			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS CLUBS OF PASADENA PROVIDES DAY CARE  </P> <P> I am writing in response to your article concerning day-care centers (Times,  May 2). The article did not provide a complete description of day-care centers  in Pasadena. Girls Clubs of Pasadena Inc. would like to expand the information  given about its position and its services.  </P> <P> We operate two fully licensed preschools; however, you only mentioned the  center located in Northwest Pasadena. The Girls Clubs operates a second center  at our main branch located at 3160 E. Del Mar Blvd. This facility has a full  enrollment with a waiting list. We are in the process of expanding this  facility in order to become licensed to accommodate 12 additional children.  </P> <P> Additionally, we only charge $60 a week per child with siblings receiving a  reduced rate. We also have a sliding scale. We receive no government funding.  </P> <P> Our fully licensed centers provide an age-appropriate curriculum, teaching  early childhood development and stressing self-esteem. Our teachers are fully  qualified in early childhood education.  </P> <P> One of the major community needs is half-day care for kindergartners who only  attend school a few hours each day. The Girls Clubs of Pasadena Day Care  Centers are ready to provide this service immediately at the North Branch,  charging $30 per child per week for half-day care.  </P> <P> Like the Boys Club, Girls Clubs of Pasadena relied heavily on the surveys  conducted by the city of Pasadena. It was felt that many of the children would  be those whose mothers were enrolled in the Gain Program. Unfortunately, this  program has not developed as first indicated. However, we still believe that  the need for safe, affordable and nurturing child care is needed in the  Northwest area of Pasadena. The problem is how to get the funds necessary for  the children to attend these much-needed programs.  </P> <P> The Girls Clubs' objective is to never have to turn away any child. But like  any organization -- whether nonprofit or for-profit -- the bills have to be  paid. We definitely feel that we have one of the most affordable, quality  preschool programs in the area and that our rates are at the subsidized level.  </P> <P> We would greatly appreciate having a more complete article written about our  preschool program.  </P> <P> ALYCE McCARROLL  </P> <P> Human Resources Director and Child Care Coordinator  </P></p>

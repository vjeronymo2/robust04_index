			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Paris With last week's austerity budget providing no surprises for the market, attention has switched back to the corporate reporting season, writes John Pitt. Alcatel Alsthom, due to release interim figures on Wednesday, has seen its share price lose ground steadily this month. From around FFr600 at the start of September the shares were trading by the close of trade on Friday at FFr554, a fall of 7.6 per cent. Most of the selling has come from international investors, while the telecommunications company has also been dogged by allegations of corruption made in certain elements of the French media.

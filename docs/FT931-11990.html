			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Letter: Promoting UK more difficult Sir, I hope you will allow me to set the record straight about the British Tourist Authority and English Tourist Board ('Tourist chief failed to win allies', January 28). The ETB board unanimously expressed its dismay at the government's decision to cut its grant-in-aid. So did the chairmen of the 11 regional boards. The BTA may appear to have its grant-in-aid maintained, but devaluation of sterling has substantially reduced our ability to promote Britain around the world. I also want to make it clear that it was entirely my decision to give up the chairmanship of both boards at the end of March. William Davis, chairman, British Tourist Authority and English Tourist Board, 24 Grosvenor Gardens, London SW1W 0ET</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A monument to Louis J.M. Daguerre, the Frenchman who discovered the earliest  practical system of photography, the daguerreotype, has been unveiled outside  the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery and National Museum of  American Art. The 12-foot-high, 23-ton granite-and-bronze monument was  originally presented to the American people in 1890 by the Professional  Photographers of America, which is sponsoring in part the relocation and  rededication in honor of the 150th anniversary of the invention of photography.

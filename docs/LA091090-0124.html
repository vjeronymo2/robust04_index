			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KICKING OFF LOSER IMAGE;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER NFL DOORMATS GREET THE NEW SEASON WITH WINS. GLANVILLE'S  FALCONS PUNISH HOUSTON.  </P> <P> A new season, new players, new coaches and new results -- Tampa Bay, Atlanta  and Dallas all won on opening day; the Rams, Broncos and Vikings all lost.  </P> <P> And the Giants beat the Eagles for the first time in five games.  </P> <P> The most striking debut was turned in by an old guy turned new guy -- Jerry  Glanville, now coaching Atlanta, who had his Falcons pumped up for his old  team, the Houston Oilers.  </P> <P> Final, 47-27, and a characteristic Glanville stat for Atlanta -- 16 penalties  for 139 yards.  </P> <P> "They were flying at us," said Houston linebacker Robert Lyles. "There were  guys jumping all over the pile."  </P> <P> On one play, a short pass late in the game, nine black shirts were on the pile  and only two were standing by -- one of them Deion Sanders, who later returned  an interception 82 yards, prancing the last 20.  </P> <P> AS FOR ROOKIES: Jeff George, the No. 1 pick in the draft, got a swift  introduction to the regular season. He was 13 of 24 for 160 yards and a  touchdown in a 26-10 loss in Buffalo. He also was sacked three times and  knocked out of the game with a concussion with 11:48 to go when he was hit by  Cornelius Bennett.  </P> <P> Steve Broussard, the Falcons' No. 1 pick, ran 17 times for 54 yards, scored on  a 6-yard run and left the game briefly with a sprained ankle.  </P> <P> Rodney Hampton of the Giants caught four passes for 26 yards, including a  12-yard TD pass from Phil Simms, and rushed six times for 17 yards.  </P> <P> Harold Green of Cincinnati carried five times for 22 yards and caught two  passes for 5 yards.  </P> <P> Seattle's Cortez Kennedy, signed less than a week ago, had four tackles.  </P> <P> Chicago safety Mark Carrier, a USC product, had three tackles and an assist and  Percy Snow, Kansas City's No. 1, had three tackles, an assist and a sack as the  Chiefs beat Minnesota 27-24.  </P> <P> Tampa Bay's Keith McCants had one assist.  </P> <P> SPEEDUP: Sunday's 13 games, played under the NFL's new speed-up rules, averaged  3 hours and four minutes, including the 3:49 that Houston, Atlanta and the  officials spent sorting out penalties and other oddities. Seven of the games  came in under three hours, the shortest the 2:50 it took the Bucs to beat the  Lions, 38-21.  </P></p>

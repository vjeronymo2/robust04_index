			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Ex-Customs chief raps mandarins: Scott told that advice from Whitehall did not justify dropping Matrix prosecution Customs prosecutors bringing the Matrix Churchill trial were given only vague warnings by other government departments about the problems they might encounter in court, Sir Brian Unwin, a former chairman of Customs &amp; Excise, told the Scott inquiry yesterday. The warnings, given by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, and the Department of Trade and Industry, amounted to no more than 'background noise' and would not have justified dropping the prosecution, he said. Sir Brian said that at a meeting with Sir Robin and Sir Peter Gregson, permanent secretary at the DTI, he was warned that Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, had given ambiguous advice to machine-tool manufacturers. He said this had encouraged the interpretation that Mr Clark was giving them a 'nod and a wink' to export equipment for military use to Iraq. However, Sir Brian - who ultimately sanctioned the prosecution - said that he had left the meeting unaware that any fresh light had been cast upon the Customs investigation. Sir Brian also discussed the case with the cabinet secretary in a separate telephone conversation. In his earlier evidence to the inquiry, Sir Robin said he had tried then to alert the Customs chairman to the intelligence background to the case. Sir Brian said yesterday that if that was what the cabinet secretary was attempting to do then he had not been very explicit. He told the inquiry that if there had been real misgivings within Whitehall about the prosecution, the officials concerned should have come to Customs to tell them. 'It was open to the DTI, Sir Peter Gregson and the other departments involved to come to the department (Customs) and not simply make noises, but to say there is a piece of hard evidence which we think will affect your prosecution.'</p>

According to the NARIC staff who are updating this directory, there are a minimum of 411 organizations providing information or direct services to persons with disabilities and their families. These organizations disseminate information through national, State, and local conferences, as well as publications such as newsletters and brochures. They also provide training, using a variety of means and settings, to their professional staff as well as to their membership. According to representatives of disability organizations, the extent to which national disability organizations, as well as their State and local affiliate organizations, have provided training or information to their members about the ADA varies according to the primary mission of the organization (e.g., provision of services or advocacy), resources available to the organization, and the interest of the membership and its leaders. As a result, knowledge about the ADA among these organizations can vary widely from one organization to another as well as from one affiliate to another within the same organization. The purpose of this proposed priority is to provide training on the ADA to persons who are members or staff of disability organizations that provide services and information primarily to persons with disabilities and their families by utilizing the existing training and information systems of these organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An ADA training project for family organizations shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Placing special emphasis on those organizations that have had limited access to ADA training and information, identify and select for training a range of disability organizations that provide services and information primarily to persons with disabilities and their families, including those organizations focused on developmental, cognitive, emotional, physical, or sensory disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop a strategy and schedule for training the membership and staff of these organizations using a variety of approaches including, but not limited to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Utilizing existing Federally approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling needs of selected organizations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Provide training to the membership and staff of selected organizations on the provisions of the ADA and the resources available to them to facilitate the implementation of the ADA;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained as trainers on the ADA by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For the length of the project, provide selected organizations with quarterly ADA information updates, before and after training, regarding legal and policy developments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

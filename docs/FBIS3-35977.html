			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgy Shmelyov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 1 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev mocked the idea that inflammatory statements of  nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky can influence the  position of any of the three warring sides in Bosnia and  proposed to hold a competition for the best tablet for  Zhirinovsky.    The tablets should be for "hysteria, suspicion and other  types of devilish possession". "There is a feeling that  Zhirinovsky has succeeded in creating the situation of hysteria  and suspicion", Kozyrev told reporters after meeting  international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg on  Tuesday.    He was evidently referring to statements of Zhirinovsky who  said that air strikes on Bosnian Serbs will be viewed as an  attack on Russia and promised to use an alleged secret sonic  weapon in retaliation.    But Kozyrev expressed hope that there would be no air  strikes  on Bosnia although the possibility is not ruled out in the  framework of the UN Security Council resolutions and only in  "extreme cases".    He added that "punishment strikes" are "absolutely  inadmissible".    However, the foreign minister admitted that "hypothetically  the possibility of air strikes exists" in case UN peace-keepers  are attacked by any of the conflicting sides while fulfilling  their humanitarian mission.    Kozyrev said that the UN secretary general had named  Srebrenica and Tuzla as the regions where a threat to UN forces  exist. "Luckily, talks with the Serbian side resulted in an  agreement on help in replacing the Canadian battalion with a  Dutch one. Diplomatic work to unblock the situation in Tuzla is  going on which is possible with a direct Russian participation",  Kozyrev said adding that attacks on UN convoys are staged not  only by Serbs, but by Muslims and Croats as well.    Lord Owen thanked Russia for "a very constructive role" on  all stages of the work to reach a political settlement.    None of the three warring parties can secure a military  victory and a solution can be found only at the negotiating  table, he told TASS.    He expressed hope that the conflicting sides will resume  negotiations in the coming weeks to "find a compromise on those  inconsiderable contradictions which still exist".    Owen urged to continue humanitarian aid supplies to the  civilian population in conditions of a harsh winter.</p>

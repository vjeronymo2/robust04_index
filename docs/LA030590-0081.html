			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REBEL TROOPS SEIZE POWER IN BLACK HOMELAND;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN AFRICA: THOUSANDS CELEBRATE AFTER CISKEI'S PRESIDENT IS OUSTED.  PRETORIA PLEDGES NOT TO CRUSH COUP.  </P> <P> Army troops in the troubled independent black homeland of Ciskei seized power  in a bloodless coup before dawn Sunday, toppling President Lennox Sebe in a  backlash over corruption and human rights abuses, the coup leader announced.  </P> <P> South Africa pledged not to crush the rebellion as thousands of blacks spilled  into the streets of the capital of Bisho to celebrate the ouster of the  64-year-old Sebe, who has ruled with an iron hand since the territory accepted  Pretoria's offer of independence in 1981.  </P> <P> Motorists honked horns and armed soldiers guarding government buildings raised  clenched fists in solidarity. Crowds chanting "Forward to freedom" and "Down  with Sebe" swarmed the national stadium to hear the coup leader's announcement,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> Troops maintained a generally low profile but fired shots in the air when mobs  looted and burned shops near the main bus terminal, causing extensive damage,  the witnesses said. No injuries were reported.  </P> <P> Led by Brig. O. Josh Gqozo, the coup took place in the early hours Sunday, less  than 48 hours after Sebe left the country, reportedly on a trade mission to  Taiwan.  </P> <P> There was widespread speculation in Bisho, however, that Sebe fled after  learning of his imminent overthrow. His heavily fortified private palace  appeared to have been abandoned.  </P> <P> The defense force chief, his deputy and Sebe's son, Kwane, who headed an elite  police unit, were detained, and Cabinet ministers were placed under house  arrest.  </P> <P> The military ruler of the nearby black homeland of Transkei said the coup dealt  another blow to South Africa's homelands policy, which has stripped millions of  blacks of South African citizenship since 1976 in a bid to relegate blacks to  the role of migrant workers in South African cities and in rural gold and coal  mines.  </P></p>

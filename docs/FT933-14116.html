			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US shares post strong gains as bond yields fall Wall Street US SHARE prices posted strong gains yesterday as bond yields fell to record lows following another set of bullish inflation figures, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 27.11 up at 3,542.55. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.99 at 450.08, while the American SE composite, which has outperformed other indices lately, finished 0.44 down at 438.67. The Nasdaq composite rose 4.02 to 712.49, a record high. New York SE volume amounted to 297.4m shares. Good inflation news and falling bond yields ended three days of weak, indecisive trading. Equity prices climbed from the opening after the Labor Department announced that its consumer price index was unchanged in June. This delighted dealers and investors who, earlier this year, feared that inflation was making a comeback. Analysts were particularly encouraged by the paltry 0.1 per cent increase in the 'core' CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy components. Not only was the CPI data good news in itself, but the figures spurred heavy buying of Treasury securities. The demand lifted the benchmark 30-year bond almost  3/4 point, sending the yield to below 6.6 per cent for the first time since 1977, when the Treasury began issuing the 30-year bond on a regular basis. Equity investors like falling bond yields because they lower the cost of borrowing for US corporations, and low interest rates can lure money away from short-term assets and into shares. Among individual stocks, second-quarter earnings continued to dominate trading. General Electric moved up Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 98 5/8 after the company announced a 10 per cent increase in quarterly earnings. Federal Express jumped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 53 3/8 on reporting a 56 per cent improvement in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings. Another stock helped by better than expected earnings was CBS, which put on Dollars 7 1/4 at Dollars 245. Procter &amp; Gamble rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 1/2 as investors reacted positively to news that the consumer products group is cutting its prices on laundry products and dish soap by up to 15 per cent to compete with rival brands and private labels. Profit-taking continued to take its toll of brokerage issues, in spite of some strong second-quarter earnings. Merrill Lynch fell a further Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 82 3/8 , PaineWebber declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 28, Morgan Stanley lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 68 7/8 and Dean Witter Discover slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 5/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 in volume of 6m shares after the company forecast a second-quarter loss and said it would make a pre-tax charge of between Dollars 75m and Dollars 85m to cover the cost of a restruct-uring. The charge was considerably bigger than analysts had expected. Canada TORONTO registered a modest decline in fairly heavy trading. The TSE 300 index ended 10 points off at 3,941.7 as falls outscored advances by 405 to 343. Volume was 61m shares valued at CDollars 800.3m. The gold shares index fell 2.42 per cent as the New York bullion price lost USDollars 3 an ounce. In that group, American Barrick dipped CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 31.</p>

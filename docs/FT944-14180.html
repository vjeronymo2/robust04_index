			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Kinkel smooths path to coalition Negotiations to form Germany's next government looked likely to be smoother than expected last night after the Free Democratic Party (FDP) emerged from its own strategy talks more united than before. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and leader of the small liberal party which has kept the present coalition in power since 1982, emerged from a meeting of the party's national executive to present a negotiating team that is unlikely to wrangle over details with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its more conservative sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). 'We are not erecting barriers with demands that cannot be fulfilled,' Mr Kinkel said. The opening round of the coalition negotiations between the three parties got under way last night. The CDU has said it wants negotiations to be rounded off as quickly as possible, clearing the way for parliament to re-elect Mr Kohl as chancellor in the week beginning November 14. Mr Kinkel won an easy victory yesterday over Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister who leads the party in North Rhine-Westphalia, its most important state branch. Mr Mollemann had tried last week to form a faction against Mr Kinkel, whom he blames for the FDP's poor showing in elections earlier this month - its second worst electoral result since 1949. Some party members were hoping the FDP could use the coalition negotiations to put a detailed catalogue of demands that would allow the party to present itself as the liberal force in German politics, a tag it may be in danger of losing to the Greens and other parties. One issue bound to cause problems in the negotiations is the question of dual nationality for foreigners living in Germany. The CSU has said it will have nothing to do with such proposals. Officials in Bonn said the coalition negotiations were likely to be carried through by the central negotiating team which includes the three party leaders. Time pressures meant that little would be handed down to the sort of ad hoc committees created during the last negotiations in 1990.</p>

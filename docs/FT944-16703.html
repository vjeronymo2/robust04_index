			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Blair's EU labours: A coherent Europe policy still eludes the UK's main political parties Tony Blair's spectacular debut as Labour leader has started the modernisation of the party's antiquated thinking on domestic political issues. In the process, he may well trigger a rethink of the domestic political vocabulary of British politics at large. What he has not yet begun to do is to extend this modernisation process to British thinking about foreign policy, and specifically about Europe. This is a more difficult and more urgent task than anything he has so far undertaken. The commentators applauded Mr Blair's promise to reform the Labour constitution and the Clause 4 commitment to nationalisation. But his challenge to the left is not really a heroic effort of new thinking: everybody has long known that Clause 4 is just an inert shibboleth inherited from the distant past. This was really just a piece of political theatre: easy to understand, vibrant with symbolism, but devoid of operational significance. Europe is a different matter. This is not an ancient tabernacle of old bones, but a colossal new problem that looms ahead; and the choices that will have to be made risk splitting the country from stem to stern. But the dividing line will not be between Labour and Tory; there is a fault line which may split both parties, and indeed the whole country. Until now, the dominant characteristic of the British debate about Europe has been a pretence that the issue can be fudged. At the fringes there is a small minority of uncompromising federalists; and opposing them is a larger minority of visceral anti-Europeans. But the middle ground is occupied by a vast flock of ostriches; they vaguely assume that the UK ought in some lukewarm sense stay 'in Europe', but they hope against hope that all rigorous decisions can be avoided. 'Ostrichism' has two consequences. Neither of the main parties of government has so far been able to set out a coherent European strategy. As a result, both of them are liable to be jerked about by the atavism of the anti-Europeans. This situation is deplorable, because it means that Britain does not really count in the grand debate on Europe's future. How could it, when the government is vaguely but incoherently anti-European, and the opposition has yet to get to grips with the question? It is true that Mr Blair's tone on Europe is more positive than John Major's. But he still sounds like a man who is hedging his bets. In his fullest policy statement on Europe, Mr Blair said that the UK needs a 'development in Europe of the ways in which we co-operate on foreign and security policy'; and this in turn will 'involve an assessment of our attitude to eastern Europe'. As for the programme for economic and monetary union and a single currency, Mr Blair has said the UK should keep an open mind. These pronouncements are not a bright beacon for the confused of middle England. Some people may think there is no rush. Labour's new leader still has time in hand to work out a thorough European policy, they believe. The moment of truth will not come until the Inter-Governmental Conference which is supposed to revise the Maastricht treaty, and it does not meet until 1996. Such a 'no hurry' attitude is based on a double fallacy, however. It is true that the IGC does not formally convene until 1996. But the outcome of the conference will to a significant degree be decided beforehand, in the preparatory debates over the agenda; and those debates are already under way, with the Germans (and the French) setting the pace as usual. In fact, it is the Germans who are out in front, with at least two coherent blueprints for a radical shift towards a more integrated Europe in 1996: first with the report of the European structural commission financed by the Bertelsmann foundation, published in June and soon to appear in English; and more recently with the paper from the governing Christian Democrat (CDU) party. The most fundamental question is, what is the purpose of the conference? Is it just a routine 5,000km tune-up of the Maastricht treaty in the light of experience? Or should it be, as the Germans obviously believe, a far-reaching rethink and revision of the European Union, its policies and its institutions? This fundamental choice, between a big conference and a little conference, will largely determine the agenda of 1996; and it will gradually emerge, as a result of the debates starting now. The second fallacy in the 'no rush' approach, is that it takes no account of democracy. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty was a nightmare, mainly because governments treated voters and parliaments as an after-thought. They cannot afford to repeat the experience; and governments which want a big IGC in 1996 will also want to make sure that public opinion is kept in touch with the arguments and the issues well in advance. 'We want to avoid the main mistake of Maastricht,' says Werner Weidenfeld, editor of the Bertelsmann report, 'the almost complete absence of a public debate.' The British may imagine they can have the kind of conference they want, and prepare accordingly. Obviously Mr Major would prefer a little conference, because he is hostile to the quasi-federalist notions of the Germans. The danger is that the British may rely on foot-dragging, in the hope that they can avoid or prevent a big conference, until it is too late to prepare the voters for a different scenario. For it is probable that the UK shall face a big conference anyway, partly because a majority of member states will want it, but mainly because the European Union cannot be enlarged to the east without it.</p>

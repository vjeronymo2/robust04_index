			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Earlier this month Austria, Sweden, Finland, and  Norway -- the latter with some delay -- decided to join the  European Union [EU]. But this enlargement of the Europe of 12 to  the Europe of 16 requires a reform of the institutions of the  Union. In addition, the future of the blocking minority in  decisionmaking will have to be determined. [passage omitted]  Jean-Michel Mostart has met Belgian Foreign Minister Willy  Claes, who doubts the entry of the four nations in the Union on  1 January 1995 will take place as scheduled. Willy Claes thinks  Europe is losing its credibility:    [Begin Claes recording] We are losing some of our  credibility, externally and internally. Last Friday I was in  Washington. There I met colleagues who belong to governments  that are candidates for membership. They said to me that they  failed to understand any of our talks, and, above all, the  opponents of the European Community in their countries will take  advantage and launch a likely successful campaign. This is the  external aspect. As for the internal aspect, I would like to  see some parliaments looking again into their position vis-a-vis  this European construction. Once again, I have the feeling that  this is not just a detail, but a discussion on principles that  are the basis of the fundamental orientation of Europe of the  future. [end recording]</p>

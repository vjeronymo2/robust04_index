On  Sunday, the regime announced the last result in the May 27 election for a new  national assembly, confirming a landslide victory for the opposition National  League for Democracy. The junta had promised to hand over power after the  multi-party elections, but "the military is proceeding as if the elections  never took place," said one diplomat.  </P></p>

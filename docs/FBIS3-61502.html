Lomonosov; UDC 577.352]    [Abstract] The increasing use of the simulation method in  the science of membranes which traditionally employs models  membranes--liposomes, monolayers on the water-gas surface, and  "black" lipid membranes as well as biological membranes which  are highly labile, thus limiting the selection of research  methods, and reports about the high stability of polymer  liposomes which are used, inter alia, to study the  mechanical interaction of liposomes with the cells and fix  enzymes in the lipid membranes, prompted a review of the  preparation of polymer membranes from polymerizable lipids--the  closest analogues of natural phospholipids--and using these  membranes in simulating membrane-dependent biological processes.  Various methods of initiating polymer reactions in lipid  bilayers are considered, and the stability of polymer membranes  from diacetylene-, dien-, styrene-, methacryloyl-, and  thiolipids is analyzed and compared. The issues of polymer  membrane applications in simulating the intercellular  recognition processes and examining phase transitions are  addressed. In particular, the general approaches to producing  polymer lipid membranes, the types of polymerizable  phospholipids and the properties of polymer membranes, and  biological process simulation using polymer membranes are  examined in detail. Special attention is focused on protein  incorporation in polymer membranes and polymer liposome  interaction with the blood component cells (hemocompatible  materials).

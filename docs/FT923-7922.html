			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wool takes a back seat on UK farms - Low prices discourage quality improvement EDMUND MORPHET has been hill farming in the Yorkshire Dales for almost 40 years. His 900 sheep, like many others scattered about the hills, are largely of the Dales-bred variety - black-headed with a whitish snout, adaptable to climate changes. 'Sheep with a bit of black in the shanks or the head are believed to be a bit hardier. . . buyers like them that way,' he says. The buyers he speaks of want the sheep for their meat or for breeding. Buyers of the sheep's wool have a rather different view. Stray black hairs in the white wool make it less desirable to carpet and cloth manufacturers, less marketable, less competitive internationally. 'If we could educate the producer to breed so that the effect of black hairs is minimised, we would be helping the carpet industry and the producer also,' says Mr Maurice Grass, managing director at the British Wool Marketing Board. The BWMB has a tough job ahead of it - and stray black hairs are just the beginning. The wool market is in the doldrums, having just weathered its worst three years. Britain, Australia and New Zealand have wool stockpiles which continue to depress prices. And in the next couple of years the UK government is going to end its price guarantee programme, meaning an open market for British wool. British farmers are obliged by law to sell their wool to the board, which is in turn obliged to buy it. Last year, 100,000 producers sold it 50.5m kg of wool. The board grades and sorts the wool, organises auctions for buyers every two weeks, and stockpiles that which does not sell - it still has more than 4m kg from 1991. And every year it guarantees farmers a price for their product  -a price that is historically low but still higher than it would be in a free market. Several factors have conspired to take the average auction price of wool below 65p a kilogram over the past 12 months - although the subsidised British farmer still gets an average 82p. Most British wool is used in carpet and upholstery manufacturing - markets which have been hit severely by depressed property sectors in many countries. Political upheavals in significant markets like China and Russia have further dampened demand. Meanwhile, man-made fibres and changing fashions have overtaken wool, both in carpet-making and in textiles. Wool's share of the world textile fibre market is now only about 4 per cent. Britain's main competition comes from New Zealand, which also produces mostly carpet wool - albeit a lot more. New Zealand's total annual wool production is more than 220m kg - or 9 per cent of the world market - compared with Britain's 2 per cent share. Australia is the largest producer, with a third of the market, but its sheep produce finer wools largely for the clothing industry. The BWMB's aim is to boost sales by improving the quality of the British product, so that it can compete effectively on world markets. Mr Grass says: 'The future for British wool lies in it being accepted as a truly international fibre'. The board is conducting a campaign to impress on farmers the need to deliver wool properly packaged and uncontaminated - rather than tainted by tar, colouring, other fibres, moisture, straw or feed. Breeds are another area of contention; the board not only prefers pure white sheep, but would also like to see more breeds with finer wools, to increase markets for the British product. There is a troublesome catch-22, however. In Britain, wool represents only between 5 and 10 per cent of a sheep's market value. Farmers are therefore reluctant - or even unwilling - to devote much effort to keeping the wool clean or to introducing new breeds. Without higher prices, farmers are unlikely to address the issue of wool quality; without improved quality, prices are unlikely to rise much. Hill farmer Mr Morphet explains: 'The first priority in selecting breeding stock is size and length, next is bone and colour and the wool comes along behind'. He receives an average Pounds 1.63 net per ewe for its annual wool clip, or about Pounds 1,200 a year - 'an insignificant amount', he says. Falling wool prices and the impending removal of the price guarantee - a government subsidy that will end sometime after next April - mean the board has had to clean up its own act over the past couple of years. Eighteen months ago it employed 160 people and had borrowings of about Pounds 40m, largely a result of the high cost of stockpiling unsold wool. There are now 60 employees and no borrowings. Marketing costs have been reduced by more than a quarter since 1990, to levels last seen in 1984. Most of the marketing funds - about 80 per cent - go to transporting, grading and packing the wool, and plans for further automation could help reduce costs further. Meanwhile, the board is pursuing new outlets for British wool - such as Japanese futons and Italian mattresses. More unusual applications include footpath repairs on the Pennine Way, on booms for containing oil slicks and on football pitches. Once the guarantee ends, there is then some question over the future role of the board. As one wool buyer questions: will it still be able to force farmers to sell it their wool if better prices are being offered elsewhere?</p>

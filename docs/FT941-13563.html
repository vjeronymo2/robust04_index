			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Israel Fund to raise Pounds 100m The UK's first specialist Israeli investment trust is to be launched next month by Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities. It will be managed by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The Israel Fund, which will be listed on the Stock Exchange but dollar denominated, aims to raise about Pounds 100m through a placing and offer for subscription, closing on March 3. Listing particulars will be published on February 17 and dealings are due to start on March 17. Some UK emerging markets and technology funds currently invest small amounts in Israeli companies, but this is the first specialist single-country fund outside Israel and the US. The Israeli-PLO peace process is starting to make investment in Israel more attractive to foreign investors, but Mr Roger Hornett, an executive director of Societe Generale Equities International, said that the peace process was not the main motivating factor behind the fund's launch. Russian immigrants, mostly highly qualified, have increased the Israeli population by about 12 per cent over the last few years. Mr Hornett said this immigration had first of all contributed to rising demand in the economy, and was now adding to production. 'Immigration and growth have been inextricably linked over a period of time, and the government is used to dealing with it,' he said. The fund will invest mainly in Israeli-listed companies, but will also have holdings in unquoted and Nasdaq-listed groups and will have the option to invest in non-Israeli companies deriving significant earnings from Israel.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: World jute output forecast to fall WORLD JUTE production in 1992-93 (July-June) is likely to fall by 15.2 per cent to about 2.9m tonnes, according to the International Jute Organisation, reports Reuter from Dacca. It blamed the drop mainly on declining yields in Bangladesh and India, the two biggest producers. Production is expected to fall by 22.2 per cent to 1.26m tonnes in India and by 12.7 per cent to 828,000 tonnes in Bangladesh. The IJO gave no reasons for the output falls but Bangladeshi government officials said many growers were discouraged by higher production costs and low prices in domestic market. The IJO said production of jute was expected to rise in China, Thailand and Nepal.</p>

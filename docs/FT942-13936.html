			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Observer: Age concern Lloyds Bank's bid for the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society is very neat. Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman, perhaps the ablest clearing banker of his generation, started out in the C&amp;G's mortgage accounts department and has now capped his career by agreeing to take over his old firm. If Pitman had stuck with the C&amp;G, he might have made an even bigger success of it than did Andrew Longhurst. Listening to them both yesterday, they sounded remarkably similar animals. Indeed, there must be a suspicion that one of the reasons for the deal was to line up a pushy successor to Brian Pitman, who at 62 is well past Lloyds' normal retirement. Since Michael Hepher, Lloyds Abbey Life's 50-year-old whizz-kid, defected to British Telecom two and a half years ago, there has been no obvious successor to Pitman. But Longhurst will be nearly 56 by the time the deal is done - which makes him a bit long in the tooth. Even so, he's an ambitious sort and it's hard to see him drifting into retirement contentedly running a clearing bank subsidiary. Pitman has proved that the over-60s can still run rings round the 40-somethings now running Barclays and NatWest. While they have been earnestly reorganising their management structures, Lloyds has been doing the deals that count. Yesterday's announcement is unlikely to be Pitman's last move - or Longhurst's for that matter.</p>

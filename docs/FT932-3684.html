			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Action on home income victims - SIB admits warnings were tardy VICTIMS of home income plans who have not yet contacted the regulatory authorities are being urged to come forward and register their complaints. The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the chief regulatory body for the financial services industry, has drawn up a fact sheet which is available from its headquarters and from citizens advice bureaux. This outlines the grounds on which victims may be entitled to compensation. SIB has also set up a help desk.* Investment-linked home income schemes were devised late in the 1980s as a way for (mostly elderly) investors to unlock capital in their homes. The idea was to take out a mortgage and invest the proceeds in the hope of earning a return large enough to meet the repayments as well as providing extra income. Many advisers backed the plans with single-premium investment bonds. When the value of these fell because of poor stock market performance, and interest rates rose, investors ran into financial difficulties which were compounded by the continuing slump in the housing market. Many of the schemes were sold as 'safe' investments, with people unaware of the risks. Investors spent the money they received in the belief that it was interest on their home's capital but, actually, they were consuming the capital itself. So far, SIB has received 1,527 complaints, with a further 160 in the pipeline. A total of Pounds 23m has been paid to just over 1,900 investors, but many victims have been hit by the inconsistencies of the compensation system. Those who were sold the policy by a member of Fimbra (the self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers), which then went into default, have recourse under the Investors Compensation Scheme. This limits the maximum payout per claim to Pounds 48,000, and is not obliged to return people to the position in which they would have been had they not invested. But those who dealt with a member of Lautro (the SRO for the life industry) do not have a compensation ceiling, and Lautro members in breach of the rules must ensure that clients are not worse off because of their investments. Lautro members have paid Pounds 8m to 920 home income investors. SIB does not expect many more claimants. Chairman Andrew Large says: 'We believe the worst is now over but, before we can close this chapter, I want to be sure that all investors who have suffered in this way are identified and encouraged to take appropriate action.' Although SIB's move is welcome, its fact sheet - which also details the risks involved - is a little belated. SIB admitted this week that, with hindsight, the initial measures taken to deter the sale of these highly-risky plans may have been wrong. The regulators first expressed concern about the way the plans were marketed in 1989, but it was not until 1990 that Fimbra and Lautro wrote to their members reminding them of their duty to recommend only policies suitable for each customer's specific needs. But the lack of public warnings meant that unauthorised firms were able to sell the products, with investors unaware of their dangers. A year later, the sale of investment-linked home income plans was, effectively, banned by both SROs. 'This has been a dreadful episode,' says Large. 'I want to ensure that everyone who has suffered . . . is appropriately compensated.' *SIB Home Income Scheme Help Desk, Gavrelle House, 2-14 Bunhill Row, London EC1.</p>

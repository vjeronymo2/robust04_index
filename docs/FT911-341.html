			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Management: In pursuit of repeat business - Simon Holberton concludes his series on Total Quality Management by stressing the importance of customer service and assesses Rank Xerox's attempts to achieve it Few phrases have seized the corporate imagination more in recent years than 'customer service'. Honoured, perhaps, more in the breach than the observance, serving customers better has been elevated to the top of many lists of top corporate priorities for the 1990s. Customer service - which is a way of life in Japan and, to a lesser extent, the US - is often confused in Britain with servility. It should not be. Customer service is the hard-headed pursuit of market share by winning the loyalty of customers. Serving customers better, Total Quality Management theorists and practitioners maintain, is the proven path to increased profitability. They cite studies which show that well served customers are more likely to make repeat purchases of goods and services than those who are not. Throughout the 1980s, customer service as a concept has broadened; TQM proponents applied it to the internal operations of an organisation as well. Like many management ideas, this is a self-evident proposition but a powerful one, nevertheless. Loyal, or repeat, customers can have a significant effect on a company's profitability. Studies show that they not only tend to spend more over time, but that they are also more cost-effective. This is because the costs of customer acquisition - marketing and advertising - can be spread over time. There are other benefits. A satisfied customer may tell up to eight others of the good service he has received; a dissatisfied customer may tell up to 15 others. As a study published last year by Bain &amp; Co, a management consultancy, noted, 'just avoiding this negative publicity has value' - although quantifying it precisely is not possible. For the past six years Xerox, the office equipment manufacturer, has been trying to live up to its goal of making customer satisfaction its top business priority. It has found that the pursuit of this goal has led it to reconsider its organisational structure and the way it remunerates its employees. The former is designed to place the whole capabilities of the company - especially the service side of its business - closer to the customer, while the latter aims to reinforce its rhetoric with real financial advantages to employees. In Britain, Rank Xerox's way of getting closer to the customer has been to divide the country into five regions and bring together sales, service and administration. In the words of one recent management presentation to staff: '(The regions) must exercise local, pro-active, situational decision-making in order to be truly responsive to our customers.' It added that, in a business where the office equipment market is fast becoming a commodity market, 'customer service, support and application capabilities are now the key factors that influence customer buying decisions'. Those buying decisions, says Rob Walker, director of quality and management systems for Rank Xerox UK, can be worth a lot of money. Last year, customers discontinued using 5,500 Xerox machines out of about 140,000 installed. If Rank Xerox had retained them all, the impact on its bottom line profit would have been an extra Dollars 8.5m in 1990, and, over three years, an extra Dollars 30m. 'If you then add in the opportunity cost the effect on the bottom line is large,' says Walker. 'Not all of this is, however, controllable and recoverable. But we reckon that 30 per cent of it is. So the financial impact of dissatisfied customers is large.' Rank Xerox spends a lot of time trying to understand its customers, especially the dissatisfied ones. At present the company estimates that 7 per cent of its customer base is dissatisfied, and it is aiming to reduce that level of dissatisfaction to zero by 1993. It attempts to measure the level of customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction through the responses it receives to two surveys conducted for it by an independent market researcher. The first is an annual survey, sent out to more than 130,000 customers. Last year, this survey had a 39 per cent return rate. 'We take the dissatisfied responses and try to determine the root causes for the dissatisfaction,' says Walker. The second is a questionnaire sent out 90 days after a Xerox machine has been purchased. (Before that the purchaser should have been called by a customer care officer, and the salesperson responsible for the account should also have made a call to see that everything is functioning correctly.) A 'vulnerable' report is completed which highlights dissatisfied customers. These are acted upon by people in the regions, who meet, decide an action plan, and agree with the customer what needs to be done to remedy the problem. The nature of the complaints is also analysed to see if there are any generic problems with equipment or service delivery. Walker says the company has set up three cross-functional teams - comprising people from sales, service and administration, management and non-management from all levels throughout the organisation - to look at reliability, the order-to-install life-cycle, and response time. Their job is to improve the process. Surveys, teams and analysis may be a rational way of understanding customer satisfaction/dissatisfaction and alerting management to problem areas, but senior management at Xerox soon discovered, in the words of Vernon Zelmer, managing director of Rank Xerox, that 'it is hard to distinguish customer satisfaction from employee satisfaction. You can't have one without the other.' 'Without happy and satisfied employees, who believe in what they do and who can see the managers 'walk as they talk', then the message will fall on stony ground.' For the past two years, therefore, Rank Xerox has been working on employee satisfaction. This has involved work on role clarification (understanding what the job is); employee involvement (being involved in the job specification); training; reward and recognition; and measurement. One of the more intriguing aspects of this has been the decision to tie a percentage of all Rank Xerox's 4,000 UK employees' pay to the achievement of customer satisfaction targets. The percentage of pay affected by this increases as employees become more senior in the company. Directors have 30 per cent of the value of their package riding on attainment of pre-set goals. 'We look for incremental improvements in customer satisfaction each year,' says Walker. 'Last year we set ourselves a target of growth of 4 percentage points for 1991. Xerox Europe has just told us they want it up by 6 points.' He claims that the company works hard at not allowing managers to make trade-offs between attaining customer satisfaction targets and ones relating to purely functional and financial goals. 'If we deliver customer satisfaction all the other things will follow,' he says. 'This is probably the most difficult time since 1980/81 but we are still making investment in customer satisfaction.' Zelmer is convinced that tying part of his employees' pay to the attainment of service goals is the right way to go and is working. He says there has been a positive correlation with the introduction of the new pay scheme and the company's market share in the UK. Although he believes that customer satisfaction ought to have been Xerox's prime aim from the moment it embarked on its quality drive - some 10 years ago - he is certain that to have tied remuneration to customer satisfaction goals would have been wrong. 'You can't do that until people have some control over what they do,' he says. Management evaluation has also changed. Zelmer subscribes to the view that 'experience shows that 90 per cent of the time it is management that's the problem, not the people.' Xerox, among other companies, has introduced a form of assessment where the managed evaluate the managers. Known as the 'management practice survey', employees are asked to rate their manager. The results are anonymous and the manager sits down with his staff and goes through them. Yet this survey, and others, have shown up the gulf that still exists between the aspirations of people who work at Rank Xerox and the reality of working there. As Walker notes, the four things that employees most value - fairness and respect, reward and recognition, career opportunities, and pay  -are the things managers are least successful at delivering. 'We are trying to understand what the employees are saying to us and the role of management in motivating them,' he says. 'We want the role of manager to change from director to teacher and counsellor. But we still have a long way to go; you don't change behaviour overnight. Employees have to see senior managers behave in the appropriate way. It's difficult; it's the next big leap for us.' Though Walker maintains that people are always capable of stepping outside the boundaries of their jobs/responsibil-ities they will do so only if they are given support. 'They won't if you step on them the first time they do it.' And that is a real challenge for management. While senior managers accept, intellectually, the new style and behaviour the company wants them to exhibit, '60 per cent of them got to where they are under the old style,' he says.

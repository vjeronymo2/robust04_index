			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Li Peng expected back in limelight MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, is expected to emerge from more than six weeks out of the public eye to receive Mr Mahathir Mohammed, Malaysian prime minister, expected in Beijing at the weekend, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Mr Li, aged 65, who has been variously reported to have suffered from a heart attack or to have contracted a bad cold, has not been sighted since he abruptly cancelled an appointment to receive President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines on April 26. Mr Wu Jianmin, foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters yesterday: 'Premier Li Peng is doing very well in his recovery and he will receive Prime Minister Mahathir personally.' Mr Li's lengthy absence from public view has fuelled speculation about his political well-being and has also enabled leadership rivals to assume a higher profile. He is blamed by many Chinese for ordering the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen square in 1989 that ended in massacre.</p>

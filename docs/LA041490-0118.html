			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAILING: FIRST LAYOVER IN U.S. COULD BE LAST  </P> <P> With the arrival of the leaders, this is the first time the Whitbread Round the  World Race for the Beefeater Trophy -- that's two sponsor plugs in a single  title -- has touched U.S. shores, and it could be the last.  </P> <P> However significant in sailing circles, the event is probably less historic  than Columbus' arrival in the West Indies 498 years ago. There are no American  entries -- two prospects failed to find funding -- although several Americans  are sailing on boats in the fleet.  </P> <P> The Whitbread, which started in England on Sept. 2, scheduled Ft. Lauderdale  this time only because some potential sponsors weren't thrilled that the past  four biennial races had used Cape Town, South Africa, for one of five layovers  in the 32,932-nautical-mile race. So, it was decided that it would be in  everyone's interest to scuttle South Africa and substitute Ft. Lauderdale.  </P> <P> Any old port in a political storm.  </P> <P> The switch created a strange route that included one grueling 7,650-mile leg  through the frigid and ferocious Southern Ocean from Punta del Este, Uruguay,  to Fremantle, Australia, then a second stop at Punta del Este on the way home.  Now there is discussion about including both Ft. Lauderdale and Cape Town in  the 1994 event and eliminating Fremantle and one stop in Uruguay. In other  words, the route would go from England to Ft. Lauderdale to Cape Town to New  Zealand to Punta del Este to England.  </P> <P> Stopping first in Ft. Lauderdale might be a good idea, catching Americans  before they become bored with the whole thing. Despite the danger and  excitement of survival conditions, sailing's most competitive ocean racing  event is of much greater interest in the rest of the world than it is here.  </P> <P> It hasn't been boring for the 23 boats. That would include Martela, the Finnish  entry that lost its keel and went belly up on the fourth leg in February. Two  other boats altered course to rescue the 16 crewmen, who survived and will be  able to watch highlights of their adventure on ESPN Monday at 7 p.m. PDT.  </P> <P> Sailing Notes  </P> <P> Two U.S. professional sailing series got underway last weekend. Australia's  Peter Gilmour, after a mediocre showing in the Congressional Cup off Long Beach  last month, sailed a neon pink Ultimate 30 to victory in a five-boat fleet at  Haleiwa on Oahu's north shore to earn $59,500. Following were John McLaurin,  Los Angeles, $27,500; Mike Hobson, Annapolis, $16,500; Bill Ziegler, Darien,  Conn., $12,700, and Russell Long, San Francisco, $5,500. Gilmour's sponsor flew  the boat to Hawaii from Australia via Japan by Federal Express. Brothers  Jonathon and Charlie McKee, 1984 and '88 Olympic medalists, respectively, from  Seattle, won the One-Design 14 class and $9,250.  </P> <P> Randy Smyth, formerly of Huntington Beach and now from Mary Esther, Fla.,  opened defense of his two consecutive ProSail titles by defeating challengers  Jack Halterman, Santa Cruz, 3-1, Brett Dryland, Australia, 3-1, and Randy  Hatfield, Dana Point, 3-0, in a series of best-of-five match races for modified  Formula 40 catamarans at New Bern, N.C. ProSail's new format has everybody else  sailing against Smyth. Anyone who beats him wins $100,000. Smyth gets a salary  from his sponsor, SuperLube, plus each $5,000 entry fee over three entries.  </P> <P> The Women's Sailing Assn. of Santa Monica Bay has a daysail scheduled on April  22, with non-members welcome.

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Makeshift measures filled the gap left by 23,000 fired bus workers as Mexico  City's government seized the opportunity to revamp its inefficient transport  system. The drivers went on strike and were fired Wednesday, but a spot check  made a day later showed that commuters were just 15 minutes to half an hour  late for work. The fact that nearly a quarter of the capital's 8.5 million  residents are taking this week off to mark two holidays reduced the strike's  impact. Subways and trolleys continued to operate. City spokesman Alfonso Marin  said that a panel of experts is meeting to discuss transit reorganization and  "we will come up with a solution in about a week."  </P></p>

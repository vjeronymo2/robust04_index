			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Changes to industrial structure seen as key to growth Macroeconomic structural adjustment combined with microeconomic reforms would lift economic growth in Japan by about 0.6 per cent and reduce the current account surplus to around 1.5 per cent of gross national product, a government advisory council says, Michiyo Nakamoto reports. Failure to change industry's structure would leave the Japanese economy unable to 'break out of the current impasse to achieve stable growth', warns the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory board to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In a report released yesterday, the council - whose members include leading industrialists, such as Mr Akio Morita, chairman of Sony, labour leaders and academics - recommends Japan carry out substantial upgrading of the social infrastructure to stimulate domestic demand, implement deregulation to create new industrial fields and combat business practices which restrain competition. Adopting such measures would take real economic growth rate to about 3.2 per cent in the years to 2000, instead of the 2.6 per cent or less expected if no action is taken.</p>

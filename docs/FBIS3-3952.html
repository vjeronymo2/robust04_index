Last  year, the province's gross import-export volume soared to 2.87  billion yuan, up 26 percent over the previous year.    Yunnan boasts a border that stretches some 3,000 km, and by  the end of 1993, 17 ports opening up to the world had been  built. Presently, goods exported through border ports include  steel products, building materials, electric machinery, articles  of daily use, light industrial products, foodstuffs and  beverages, not to mention farm and sideline produce, with the  trade volume increasing with each passing year. Some of the  items have become backbone products in border trade.    The sites for trade have changed from stalls on the streets  to large trade cities, shopping malls, and stores. Many ports  have built comprehensive border trade markets comprising  transportation, telecommunications, storehouses, catering,  hotels, and other services.</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / International Company News: Alitalia poised to acquire stake in Hungarian airline HUNGARIAN government officials yesterday indicated that Alitalia, the Italian state airline, was poised to acquire a minority stake in Malev, the Hungarian carrier, against stiff competition from Lufthansa of Germany. A formal announcement of the sale is expected next week, although some observers have not excluded the possibility of a last-minute push by Lufthansa, which has been keen to extend its growing east European coverage by forging a partnership with Hungary's flag-carrier. Officials in Budapest said the winning bidder would take a shareholding of about 35 per cent in Malev, at a cost of over Dollars 60m. An Air France-led consortium earlier this year paid Dollars 60m for 40 per cent in CSA, the Czechoslovak carrier. Negotiations on the Malev deal have been taking place for some time. However, the airline indicated a solution was imminent by announcing last week that it would hold a shareholders' meeting on January 8 to approve a capital increase linked to its privatisation. If Alitalia emerges as the successful bidder it will have overcome opposition from influential officials within the Budapest government, who felt that a link-up with Lufthansa would have provided a more secure future for the Hungarian carrier. Malev, which is seen as one of the better-managed and more efficient of the former Communist-dominated east European airlines, has been seeking a European partner to help it compete on new international services using western aircraft. In May, British Airways, Lufthansa and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines were identified by executives closely following the Malev privatisation as the leading contenders. British Airways subsequently said it was not seriously interested; and KLM later announced it was dropping out of the bidding. The success of Alitalia's bid appears to have been based on superior financial terms to Lufthansa's proposal. Alitalia, although appreciably smaller than the German airline, has been striving to improve quality and profitability standards in recent years. The Malev deal would mark its first equity stake in a foreign airline and would represent a departure from the cautious approach of Italian business towards buying into foreign companies. Malev's pre-tax profits rose 57 per cent in 1991 to Ft2.09bn (Dollars 25m), in spite of the worldwide recession in the airline business and the fall in passengers as a consequence of the Gulf war. However, the company needs an infusion of capital to finance the replacement of more of its largely Soviet-made fleet of aircraft with more modern and fuel-efficient western substitutes.</p>

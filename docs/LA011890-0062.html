			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS;  </P> <P> UCLA RECRUITS SHON TARVER AT HIGH DECIBEL AND IN CHORUS  </P> <P> "We want Tarver!"  </P> <P> The UCLA student section began chanting before the start of the regionally  televised game between the Bruins and Arizona on Saturday.  </P> <P> "We want Tarver!" the fans screamed repeatedly.  </P> <P> It's a cheer Shon Tarver has heard often during home and away high school  basketball games, but never at a college game.  </P> <P> Tarver appreciates the recognition, but he was caught off guard by the  reception he received at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> "I was excited like any recruit would be," he said. "I haven't heard a crowd  cheering for me to sign with a school before."  </P> <P> Tarver, who has narrowed his choices to UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and Syracuse,  attended the game with highly touted recruits 6-10 junior center Cherokee Parks  of Marina High in Huntington Beach and 6-11 junior center Eric Meek of San  Pasqual in San Diego.  </P> <P> Record-setting game: Entering Tuesday's Frontier League mismatch against Santa  Clara, Santa Paula Coach Chuck Yuncker knew his team would become the answer to  a trivia question.  </P> <P> Whom did Santa Clara beat to set the Ventura County record for most consecutive  victories?  </P> <P> The Saints answered that question by drubbing Santa Paula, 71-46, for their  31st consecutive win, a streak that includes last season's Division IV state  championship game. Ventura set the previous mark of 30 in a row during the  1948-49 season. The Saints tied that record with a 73-43 win over Santa Ynez on  Friday.  </P> <P> Santa Paula remains on a streak of its own; the Cardinals are winless in 15  games. Not a pleasant way for a Yuncker to begin his first season as a head  coach.  </P> <P> But Yuncker didn't expect to upset Santa Clara. His main objective was to  impress Lou Cvijanovich, who helped established Yuncker's coaching philosophy.  </P> <P> Yuncker was a varsity assistant and freshman coach when Santa Clara won the  Southern Section 1-A championship during the 1980-81 season.  </P> <P> "I feel excited to coach against Lou for the first time," Yuncker said before  Tuesday's game. "It would be great to beat a powerhouse. But what would be  greater to me than a upset, would be to show him how far the Santa Paula  program has come. I would like to see us put it all together and play the best  game we can with the players we have."  </P> <P> The two schools meet again Feb. 2.  </P> <P> Trying to pass a record: Multi-talented Rob Fournier has the opportunity to set  Nordhoff High records in three sports.  </P> <P> A point guard on the basketball team, Fournier has 128 assists and needs 52  more to set the school mark for most assists in a season. Larry Messer  established the standard of 180 in 1984. Messer was selected Frontier League  co-most valuable player with Santa Clara's Stacey Cvijanovich, who plays for  Nevada-Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Fournier, a 5-10 senior, has already set a school mark for most passing yardage  in a season (1,677) in football and is close to setting several pitching  records.  </P> <P> Tearing up the course: The Southern Section office has established a new rule  to help clean up the loose divots left from high school golf competition.  </P> <P> Third-place teams no longer will be automatic qualifiers for team finals unless  their leagues certify they can reach a minimum score.  </P> <P> The golf coaches advisory committee established Rule 2615.2 in the Southern  Section Constitution and By-Laws this summer. It states: "To be eligible for  team regional championship play, all third-place entries must have achieved a  best nine-hole score of 230 or lower for any eight matches during the season to  qualify for entry."  </P> <P> That total translates to an average score of 46 for nine holes by the team's  top five players. Teams play an average of 18 matches a season.  </P> <P> "The whole objective is to weed out really weak teams that are not of solid  playoff caliber," Southern Section administrator Dean Crowley said. "Those  teams tend to slow down play and take a few more divots home with them."  </P> <P> Crowley, who also is chairman of the golf committee, said he voted against a  proposal that would eliminate all third-place entries in the regionals, because  some leagues are deep in talent.  </P> <P> "I think this new rule will eliminate a dozen schools and that will solve the  problem," Crowley said.  </P> <P> Tri playing three?: At a Tri-Valley league meeting for principals and athletic  directors d Tuesday at Carpinteria High, Marc Groff of St. Bonaventure proposed  a triple round of league games beginning next basketball season  </P> <P> With Fillmore departing to the Frontier League next fall, the Tri-Valley League  will be reduced to five teams, creating two additional byes in every team's  league schedule.  </P> <P> The Tri-Valley League currently consists of Carpinteria, Fillmore, Moorpark,  Oak Park, and Bishop Diego in addition to St. Bonaventure. La Reina is a member  only for girls' sports.  </P> <P> Groff, St. Bonaventure's athletic director and basketball coach, proposed  increasing the number of league games from eight to 12 and reduce nonleague  games from 14 to 10.  </P> <P> "I think it would be silly to play almost twice as many nonleague games to  prepare for league," Groff said. "This proposal would increase the importance  of league games."  </P> <P> Groff's plan received support from four other schools. Bishop Diego Athletic  Director Norris Fletcher objected to the plan because he feared that some  schools might meet four times in a season. Several Tri-Valley League teams  enter the same tournaments, creating potential match-ups in latter rounds.  </P> <P> Athletic directors from the Tri-Valley League will decide the issue on a Feb. 1  meeting at Carpinteria.  </P> <P> Three's a crowd: With three Western State Conference road games this week, the  Moorpark College men's basketball team faces a particularly difficult early  conference schedule.  </P> <P> It wasn't intended to be so tough, but Moorpark's game against Cuesta was  rescheduled from Jan. 6 to Monday after Moorpark was delayed in transit by an  oil spill on U.S. 101 and missed the game.  </P> <P> Moorpark slipped by Cuesta, 88-66, Monday night and was to have traveled to  Ventura on Wednesday night. The Raiders finish the week with a Saturday game at  WSC Southern Division contender Glendale.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we'll get two out of three, and if we get three out of three, we'll  be super," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said.  </P></p>

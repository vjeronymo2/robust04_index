			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE AFTERMATH AND FREEWAY SAFETY  </P> <P> How do we pay for the terrible destruction done by Hurricane Hugo and the San  Francisco earthquake? I believe two or three Stealth bombers would do it. We  could use the money to rebuild, the engineers could be put to work designing  stronger structures and roads and designing a workable rapid transit system for  big cities. Workers could be given jobs rebuilding cities instead of building  bombs.  </P> <P> When we finish that, the money could be used for schools. One bomber could  probably solve the overcrowding in the area that I teach in. Building schools,  furnishing them and staffing them could create many jobs as well as filling a  vital need.  </P> <P> We don't need to raise taxes -- we just need to change our priorities!  </P> <P> ELAINE BUDIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

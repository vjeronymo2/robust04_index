			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran  President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina said today that his  government will follow up on the investigation of disappearances  of 183 people over the past 10 years in this Central American  country.    Reina, winner of the November 1993 elections, told local  media that the preliminary 29 December report presented by Leo  Valladares, national human rights ombudsman, "is a very  courageous" document and that its recommendations should be  followed.    The report, which states that civilian and military  personnel  are responsible for the forced disappearances of dozens of  people, "is a thorough study in which the truth is evident. Its  effects will be proportionate to the courage with which the  information is managed," said Reina, who will be sworn in on 27  January.    Supreme Court President Orlando Lozano Martinez announced  that the judicial branch will also follow up on Valladares'  report.    A Judicial Branch plenum resolved that Honduran judges in  charge of criminal cases in places where both citizens and  foreigners have reportedly suffered forced disappearances must  begin or continue trials to punish the culprits.    The Supreme Court also formed a special commission of  prosecutors to study the national human rights ombudsman's  report and to proceed with the corresponding legal actions.    The Attorney General's Office, which will appoint a  prosecutor next week, will continue the work done by the  [Supreme Court] prosecutors.    Human rights organizations are demanding that Division  General [as received] Luis Alonso Discua, chief of the Armed  Forces, be investigated in connection with several  disappearances that took place while he was commander of the  so-called "3-16" counterintelligence battalion in 1984.    The Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras  (COFADEH) on 7 January will request at the Legislative Assembly  that Discua be temporarily suspended so he can be investigated  in connection with the disappearances, a request which, in  President Rafael Callejas' opinion, "lacks any legal basis and  will not be considered."    Discua, who examined the report on the disappearances with  Callejas on 3 January, has made no comment, although on various  occasions he has said he had no part in the violations.    Callejas said on 3 January that the report should not be  used  to open new wounds but to unite rather than divide the Honduran  family. Carlos Sosa Coello, a deputy for the minority Social  Democratic Innovation and Unity Party (PINU-SD), feels that Gen.  Discua should be summoned by the Legislative Assembly to hear  his views concerning the disappearances and that the state  should compensate and apologize to the missing detainees'  relatives.    Legislative Assembly Vice President Marco Augusto Hernandez  said that if any conclusive evidence is found implicating Discua  in the forced disappearances, he should be separated from his  post.    Human Rights Commissioner Leo Valladares is of the opinion  that a pardon cannot be granted in the case of the  disappearances if the alleged perpetrators do not admit their  culpability.    Valladares also asked the Armed Forces to open its files to  facilitate the investigations.    "Reconciliation is sought through the search for truth and  the implementation of justice," said Valladares, who also  believes that the law will determine who is guilty.    The report on the disappearances also names U.S. and  Argentine military officers and former Nicaraguan "contra"  fighters who operated out of Honduras during the eighties.</p>

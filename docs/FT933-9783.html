			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark marches upward The D-Mark made substantial gains yesterday against all the major European currencies and the dollar, as currency markets continued to work through the effects of last week's heavy central bank interventions, writes Stephanie Flanders. The mark gained nearly 2 pfennigs against sterling to close at DM2.5425, down from Thursday's finish of DM2.5600, and against the dollar the German currency rose over a pfennig to close at DM1.6975 compared to the previous day's DM1.7165. Other European currencies were similarly outmatched by the strength of the D-Mark, in spite of the fact that the French, Danish and Belgian central banks have yet to lower overnight lending rates from the crisis levels reached during last week's currency turmoil. Few doubted that the D-Mark's gains could be traced to the after-effects of last week's central bank interventions. 'People can see that there are a lot of D-Marks sloshing about,' said Julian Callow of Kleinwort Benson in London. 'They are going to have to be drained, and that process is good for the D-Mark.' Several traders suspected that ERM central banks whose currencies were under pressure last week were now paying back they they owed to the Bundesbank by selling sterling or dollars for marks. The French franc lost 2.5 centimes on its opening level against the German unit, closing at FFr3.495. Several traders believed that the Bank of France's fragile foreign reserves position would put a downside on the French unit for some time to come, even without a rapid fall in official lending rates. 'If anything was surprising, it was the strength of the Franc earlier in the week,' said Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London. 'It will probably slip a bit more, given how much re-building there is going to have to be of the Bank of France's reserves.' Sterling finished the day a touch weaker against the dollar at Dollars 1.4980, from a previous close of Dollars 1.4910. The fact that there had been very little change in the pound's relative position against the American unit was further evidence that the weakening against the D-Mark had been driven by conditions on the Continent. 'Sterling was just caught in the cross-fire,' said Simon Callow. The same pressures were taking the dollar lower against the D-Mark. Otherwise, the markets had been little moved by the release of US non-farm payroll data which showed a rise of 162,000 in July. Observers attributed this to traders waiting to see the outcome of last night's Senate vote.</p>

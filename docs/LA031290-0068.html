			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA LEADS IN HOME BUILDING  </P> <P> Three California metropolitan areas -- Riverside-San Bernardino, Los  Angeles-Long Beach and Sacramento -- were among the top five in the nation in  single-family home building activity in 1989, the National Assn. of Home  Builders reported Friday.  </P> <P> The Riverside-San Bernardino area, with 38,200 building permits, topped the  list for the second straight year.  </P> <P> It was followed by the Los Angeles-Long Beach area, with 23,640 permits;  Washington, with 22,360; Atlanta, with 21,750, and Sacramento, with 16.540.  </P> <P> The Home Builders said 938,000 single-family building permits were issued  nationally last year, down from 1 million in 1988. Multifamily permits dropped  to 403,000 in 1989 from 458,000 in 1988  </P> <P> "High interest rates at different times during the year coupled with a sluggish  economy, affordability problems and consumer hesitance caused total permits for  single-family and multifamily housing to drop from 1.43 million in 1988 to 1.34  million last year," said association president Martin Perlman.  </P> <P> "This is the lowest number of permits issued since 1982, during the most recent  recession, when 1 million units were authorized," he said.  </P> <P> Despite heading the single-family list, the number of permits issued in the  Riverside-San Bernardino area was 11.2% below that of 1988, the Home Builders  said.  </P> <P> Permits were up 34.2% in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area and down 23.6% in the  national capital area and 23.7% in Atlanta. Sacramento posted a 16.8% increase.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-Long Beach area recorded the most multifamily permits, 24,590.  That was down 23.6% from 1988.  </P></p>

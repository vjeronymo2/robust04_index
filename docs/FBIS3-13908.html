			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Abbadi from parliament] </F>   [Excerpts] The royal decree adjourning the ordinary session  of the 12th Parliament as of tomorrow was read at the beginning  of the House of Representatives' session today. [passage omitted]    The House then discussed several issues that were not on the  agenda, in particular a proposal presented by 20 deputies  regarding acts by the U.S. Navy that include obstructing  al-'Aqabah-bound ships and conducting unjustified inspections of  these ships. Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  commented on this by saying:    [Begin al-Majali recording] I met with the U.S. ambassador  before I came here this morning. I reiterated to him all that  was in your speech [not further identified] in a very clear way.  A few weeks ago, we sent a legal memorandum to the Security  Council to prove this is wrong and illegal. The government is  following up on this issue. The assistant U.S. secretary of  state will come [to Jordan] this evening and this issue will  clearly be on the agenda. During his visit to the United States,  his majesty the king raised this issue with President Clinton,  the secretary of defense, and others. In my capacity as the  prime minister, I went to the committee [not further identified]  itself and addressed it on this issue with all the strength and  courage we have. I hope the esteemed House will know that since  the beginning of this issue the Government of Jordan has taken  the initiative to deal with it, and even this morning we  discussed this issue. Thank you. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Clarke sees sustained growth in UK 'for some years' Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night took an upbeat view of UK economic prospects, predicting sustained, low inflationary growth in Britain 'for some years to come'. In remarks that appeared further to damp hopes of an early cut in UK bank base rates from 5.25 per cent, he said Britain's economic outlook was 'extremely encouraging'. A string of hard economic data had reinforced his confidence that 2.5 per cent growth could be achieved this year. He said UK monetary policy would be conducted to keep down inflation and create conditions for sustained growth, and that recent indicators 'show we are on course'. Speaking after a meeting in Washington of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, Mr Clarke said they were more optimistic about the world economy than they could have been at any time in 1993. Other ministers echoed Mr Clarke's confidence. 'The bottom line was that we agreed the fundamentals are good and inflation appears under control,' said Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, after the meeting. Earlier Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, disclosed that he had bet Mr Michel Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund's managing director, that German growth this year would be near 1.5 per cent rather than the 0.9 per cent forecast last week by the IMF. The economy of eastern Germany was likely to achieve double-digit growth this year. Mr Clarke said ministers and central bankers from the G7  - US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada  - discussed the recent rise in long-term interest rates and concluded it was partly a reaction to strong US growth and partly to fears of inflation in the longer term. He said the latter had been exaggerated and he expected the markets to settle down. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the German Bundesbank president, suggested that the increase in long-term rates was in part a 'normalisation process' after bond yields had overshot downwards towards the end of last year and in January. The G7 ministers referred briefly to the role of derivatives in recent financial market turbulence. This is due for more substantial discussion today when the G7 will be joined by representatives of Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden at a meeting of the Group of 10 countries.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  has firmly warned the militant Kurds in Germany against taking  part in nonapproved demonstrations. The minister's spokesman,  Karl-Heinz Schneider, announced today in a DDP/ADN interview  that steps would be taken against any people participating in  such actions "with the full severity of the criminal and aliens'  law." The government and states had closely cooperated to  prepare measures aimed at preventing acts of violence. This  included the provision of a large number of Federal Border Guard  (BGS) officers.    In view of the possibility of violent clashes involving  Kurds  in Cologne, Mannheim, and other cities, Kanther called upon the  peaceful Kurdish population not to follow the calls of violent  Kurds. Bus companies were on no account to provide transport  for the banned PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. Kanther  expressed his expectation that Germany's neighbors would prevent  Kurds clearly bent on violence from crossing the border into  Germany.    At the same time, the minister asked travelers to show  understanding for any delays caused by police measures. At  railway stations, BGS and traffic police officers were also  being asked to pick up recognized violent Kurds and prevent them  from traveling further.</p>

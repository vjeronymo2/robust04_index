			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII TOUR PLANE MISSING WITH 11 MAY HAVE SENT EMERGENCY SIGNAL  </P> <P> A sightseeing plane that vanished between the islands of Hawaii and Maui with  11 people aboard may have sent out an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather  prevented rescuers from searching for it.  </P> <P> "There's an emergency signal coming from a valley, and we think it could be the  plane," said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler. "But the weather's so bad  helicopters can't go in, and otherwise it's about a 10-hour hike."  </P> <P> A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's signal from the  remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is on the northwest end and  within the flight path of the missing Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane, Spangler  said.  </P> <P> The plane disappeared Sunday on what was to have been an hourlong flight.  </P> <P> "We're getting all our information together and seeing if the weather will let  up," Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds persisted in the area Monday.  </P></p>

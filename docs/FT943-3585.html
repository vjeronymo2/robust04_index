			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Blocked bank bid leaves bruises all round - Few emerge with credit from BCP's unsuccessful attempt to win BPA No one has emerged from the battle for Banco Portugues do Atlantico with a convincing victory. Banco Comercial Portugues, whose hostile bid for Portugal's second largest bank has been vetoed by the government, is the most prominent loser. But little glory has attached to the other main forces in the struggle. BCP, which has earned a reputation for almost flawless management since it was founded in 1985, will suffer for its political misjudgement. The government has sullied its pro-market credentials. BPA's management is under fire for lacking direction and the soundness of the relationship between core shareholders and the bank has been called into question. As for the securities exchange commission (CMVM), it has been exposed as slow-moving and hampered by bureaucratic regulations. Portugal's capital markets will not benefit from the badly-needed boost expected from BCP's Es132bn (Dollars 838m) offer for 40 per cent of BPA. In addition, traders fear the international image of the Lisbon market may have been damaged by the six-week process that culminated with a government decision to block the bid. BPA shareholders have been the first to suffer. Shares fell to Es2,260 at the close yesterday, the first day of trading since they were suspended by the CMVM on August 10. After BCP announced its offer of Es3,000 a share on July 26, the shares had climbed 31.8 per cent to Es2,650 before they were suspended out of concern that a disorderly market could develop. BCP shares also closed at Es2,260 yesterday, down 1.74 points from Friday. Lisbon dealers said the CMVM's long suspension of BPA shares had prevented small shareholders from taking advantage of their first opportunity for making gains since the bank began to be privatised in 1990. They fear the bid has shown Portugal's capital markets to be burdened with an overly bureaucratic regulatory framework that could deter foreign investors. BCP was putting on a brave face yesterday. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, chairman, said the bank's determination to expand remained unaltered. But it is not clear where he will look next. The government decision has left BCP, Portugal's fifth largest bank, still straining at the leash. Unable to build a market share consonant with its strong capital accumulation through organic growth alone, it has been trying to expand by acquisition. But the finance ministry has so far blocked its every move. In January, the government rejected BCP's bid for Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor, the sixth-ranked bank, as too low. A second attempt to privatise BPSM will be made later this year. But Mr Jardim Goncalves said yesterday BCP was no longer interested. BCP control of BPA would have increased its market share from 9.5 per cent to 24 per cent in a single blow. BCP will now have to resign itself to more gradual expansion, either by redirecting its sights on smaller takeover targets or by starting a new banking operation, its eighth, from scratch. The expansion envisaged by BCP is of the kind often promoted by the centre-right government of prime minister Anbal Cavaco Silva, who regularly expresses support for the building of strong Portuguese companies able to compete at a European level. The government's decision that a BCP takeover of BPA could destabilise the financial system has drawn strong criticism from a majority of Lisbon analysts and opposition parties. They say the veto is an unwelcome interference in the free operation of the market and a brake on the capacity of Portuguese banks to gain critical mass. The government's other main argument is that BCP's planned acquisition would have perturbed the privatisation strategy mapped out for BPA. The state still owns 24.5 per cent. BPA's core shareholders, a group of 13 Portuguese companies that owns 28.7 per cent, say the government has made an unwritten commitment to keep them in control after the final stage of privatisation, for which no date has been set. Praise may be due to the government for keeping faith with the core shareholders and sticking to a pledge to disperse BPA's capital widely among small investors. But BCP's bid has indicated the uncertainties to which the protracted privatisation of BPA and other banks has exposed Portugal's financial system. Rival bids from BCP and BPA's main shareholders for the remaining state holding would also have almost certainly increased the value of the stake. BPA's management has the most reasons to toast the government decision. It has survived - but far from unscathed. BCP's offer has shown the management team of Mr Joao Oliveira, chairman, to have been slow in implementing a strategic restructuring of the bank. BCP supporters claim the core shareholders tolerated relatively passive management in return for favourable treatment. Whether or not this is true, the core shareholders will now press hard for more aggressive management. They are expected to nominate eight non-executive board members at an extraordinary meeting on October 6, when the board will be expanded from seven to 15 members. The core shareholders are not currently represented.</p>

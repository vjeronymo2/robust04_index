			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Plan to amend tax treatment of repo deals - Gilts Changes to the tax treatment of approved stock lending arrangements and sale and repurchase transactions (repos) are planned. The changes will take effect from Royal assent. Where collateral for approved stock lending arrangements is provided in the form of cash, and the lender receives interest on the cash collateral without deduction of tax and passes it on in full to the borrower, the borrower will get relief for the interest paid and will be able to pay it without deduction of tax. Anomalies in the application of existing legislation to repos will also be addressed. Stock lending is an important mechanism for supporting the liquidity of the securities and equity markets. It enables stock to be borrowed to meet an obligation to sell to a third party. The disposals and acquisitions that arise are ignored for tax purposes if the stock lending arrangements are approved. Removal of the anomalies in the application of existing legislation to repos will ensure that double charges and double reliefs do not arise. The chancellor's intention is to enable those lenders who prefer cash as collateral to take a more active part in the market. The Bank of England yesterday published a consultative document on establishing an open market in the sale and repurchase of government securities. The Inland Revenue will be consulting shortly on the potential tax implications of a gilt repo market. The consultation period will end on January 31 1995. Marketmakers in gilts can already borrow stock using the services of the stock exchange money brokers in what are in effect bilateral repo transactions. An open repo market will allow all market participants to use repos. The introduction of an open repo market would mark an important further development of the structure of the gilts market. Repos should improve liquidity and efficiency, reducing yields and the government's debt interest costs. Each reduction in yields of just one basis point - one-hundredth of 1 per cent - will save more than Pounds 25m a year of public expenditure.</p>

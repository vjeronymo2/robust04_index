			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=4 --> _Backup power supplies are recommended, especially for ventilation systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Shower and bath water should be with mixed hot and cold water faucets. Water that has been used to clean personnel or equipment should either be filtered or be collected and discarded as asbestos waste. Soap and shampoo should be provided to aid in removing dust from the workers' skin and hair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _See paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section for appropriate respiratory protection and protective clothing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _See paragraph (k) of this section for required signs and labels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 --> Preparing the Work Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Disabling HVAC Systems: The power to the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that service the restricted area must be deactivated and locked off. All ducts, grills, access ports, windows and vents must be sealed off with two layers of plastic to prevent entrainment of contaminated air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating HVAC Systems in the Restricted Area: If components of a HVAC system located in the restricted area are connected to a system that will service another zone during the project, the portion of the duct in the restricted area must be sealed and pressurized. Necessary precautions include caulking the duct joints, covering all cracks and openings with two layers of sheeting, and pressurizing the duct throughout the duration of the project by restricting the return air flow. The power to the fan supplying the positive pressure should be locked ``on'' to prevent pressure loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sealing Elevators: If an elevator shaft is located in the restricted area, it should be either shut down or isolated by sealing with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should provide enough slack to accommodate the pressure changes in the shaft without breaking the air-tight seal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removing Mobile Objects: All movable objects should be cleaned and removed from the work area before an enclosure is constructed unless moving the objects creates a hazard. Mobile objects will be assumed to be contaminated and should be either cleaned with amended water and a HEPA vacuum and then removed from the area or wrapped and then disposed of as hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cleaning and Sealing Surfaces: After cleaning with water and a HEPA vacuum, surfaces of stationary objects should be covered with two layers of plastic sheeting. The sheeting should be secured with duct tape or an equivalent method to provide a tight seal around the object.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bagging Waste: In addition to the requirement for immediate bagging of waste for disposal, it is further recommended that the waste material be double-bagged and sealed in plastic bags designed for asbestos disposal. The bags should be stored in a waste storage area that can be controlled by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workers conducting the removal. Filters removed from air handling units and rubbish removed from the area are to be bagged and handled as hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=4 --> Constructing the Enclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> The enclosure should be constructed to provide an air-tight seal around ducts and openings into existing ventilation systems and around penetrations for electrical conduits, telephone wires, water lines, drain pipes, etc. Enclosures should be both airtight and watertight except for those openings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to provide entry and/or air flow control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Size: An enclosure should be the minimum volume to encompass all of the working surfaces yet allow unencumbered movement by the worker(s), provide unrestricted air flow past the worker(s), and ensure walking surfaces can be kept free of tripping hazards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Shape: The enclosure may be any shape that optimizes the flow of ventilation air past the worker(s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Structural Integrity: The walls, ceilings and floors must be supported in such a manner that portions of the enclosure will not fall down during normal use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Openings: It is not necessary that the structure be airtight; openings may be designed to direct air flow. Such openings should be located at a distance from active removal operations. They should be designed to draw air into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosure under all anticipated circumstances. In the event that negative pressure is lost, they should be fitted with either HEPA filters to trap dust or automatic trap doors that prevent dust from escaping the enclosure. Openings for exits should be controlled by an airlock or a vestibule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Barrier Supports: Frames should be constructed to support all unsupported spans of sheeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sheeting: Walls, barriers, ceilings, and floors should be lined with two layers of plastic sheeting having a thickness of at least 6 mil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

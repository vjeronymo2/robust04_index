			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese to join Oman gas project THREE Japanese companies have announced that they will join a Dollars 9bn project to develop a liquefied natural gas industry in Oman, completing the ownership structure for the commercial exploitation of the Sultanate's gas reserves. Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &amp; Company and C. Itoh &amp; Company will together take a joint 7 per cent stake in a state-controlled company to develop the downstream exploitation of Oman's gas reserves. Proven reserves in 1991 were 9.8 trillion (million million) cubic feet, but some estimates put potential reserves nearer at 17 trillion cu ft. The Sultanate will hold 51 per cent of the downstream venture, which will oversee gas liquefaction, shipping and marketing. Shell will hold 34 per cent of the downstream company, Total 6 per cent and Partex 2 per cent, following agreement on the venture in February. These companies hold comparable shares in Petroleum Development Oman, the state-owned oil group, which will control gas production and condensate development. Shell International Gas has already completed an early feasibility study for the launch of Oman's gas industry which suggests the Sultanate could viably produce 5m tonnes a year. Further studies and development could take another eight years and first LNG shipments are expected in mid-1999. Reserves are reported to allow for 20 years of exports and up to 50 years of domestic consumption. Commercial exploitation of its gas reserves will be a welcome addition to Oman's trading position given the Sultanate's modest position among Gulf oil producers. Output is set to rise by 50,000 barrels a day to 750,000 b/d this year.</p>

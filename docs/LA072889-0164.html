			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH TO FIGHT HOUSE CUTS IN ARMS BUDGET  </P> <P> President Bush today deplored votes by the House of Representatives to cut four  major defense systems but predicted that his view will prevail by the time  Congress finishes work on his military budget.  </P> <P> At a wide-ranging news conference, Bush adopted a soft-toned approach to the  House's defense bill slashes, but he said it was "not the House's most  memorable moment."  </P> <P> The President said he will not accept further cuts in the "Star Wars" budget to  protect his other defense programs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Negotiations Noted  </P> <P> "I do not want to negotiate with the Soviet Union without as many cards in my  hands as possible," he added.  </P> <P> Bush also said he still has confidence in William Lucas, his embattled nominee  to become chief civil rights enforcer in the Justice Department.  </P> <P> "I am convinced that much of the criticism (against Lucas) is pure gut American  politics," he said.  </P> <P> Bush said he was working hard to save the nomination. Critics say Lucas lacks  experience.  </P> <P> And on a third controversy in Congress, Bush disputed critics who contend that  his attempt to amend the Constitution to prevent the desecration of the  American flag will wind up weakening the rights of all Americans.  </P> <P> " . . . I feel so strongly that a very carefully drawn amendment can solve this  problem that I don't worry about it," Bush said.  </P> <P> He declined to say if he would sign a Democratic bill that would make the act  of destroying the flag illegal but stops short of making it part of the  Constitution. A House committee approved such a measure Thursday with  bipartisan support even though many Republicans agreed with Bush that a  constitutional amendment is the proper solution.  </P> <P> Bush said he felt no "disrespect" for members of Congress who want to go the  legislative rather than the amendment route to deal with the flag desecration  issue.  </P> <P> Bush called the news conference to ballyhoo the decision by Arkansas Rep. Tommy  F. Robinson to switch from the Democratic to the Republican fold. (Story, Page  2.)  </P> <P> </P> <P> Legislative Setbacks  </P> <P> But the focus of the news conference was on the legislative setbacks that Bush  has suffered in the last few days.  </P> <P> If he had to rate Congress' record so far, Bush said, "I wouldn't give it very  high marks." He said that just because he is not attacking Congress "in a  personal way does not mean I'm happy with the legislative calendar." He said  Congress had discarded his appeal to act on the S &amp; L crisis within 60  days.  </P> <P> Still, Bush told reporters, "I think we will prevail for most of what we want."  He pointed to the forthcoming defense battle in the Senate, which he hopes will  rescue his defense program.  </P> <P> Bush foresaw ultimate victory in his fight to keep $50 billion of the cost of  rescuing the savings and loan industry out of the budget -- and the deficit.  House-Senate conferees voted Thursday night to reject Bush's plan and make the  cost of the bailout reflected in the deficit and reduce the long-term interest  cost.  </P></p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Record: A choice of Elijahs - Ronald Crichton reviews some hefty choral works IN DAYS gone by Mendelssohn's oratorio Elijah was regarded in musical circles more or less as part of the British Empire. It was indeed written for the Birmingham Festival and first given there, in 1846. But Mendelssohn set the German words, as Elias, before taking immense trouble to fit his vocal lines to an English text (like the German, based on the Bible). Now, back once more in the repertory, Elijah has become international. Two new recordings, made as far apart as Metz and Tel Aviv, both use the German words. For Teldec (9031 73131-2, 2 CDs.) Kurt Masur conducts the MDR (Middle German Radio) Choir from Leipzig and the Israel Philharmonic. For Harmonia Mundi France (HMC 901463-64, 2 CDs) Philippe Herreweghe conducts the Chapelle Royale and Collegium Vocale with the Orchestra des Champs-Elysees. Both readings stress the drama in Elijah: I prefer Herreweghe because he presents the vivid episodes (the widow, the boy scanning the sky for signs of rain, the whirlwind) even more sharply than Masur. He is more successful in disguising the musical decline during the last third or so of the work. Mendelssohn had much difficulty at this stage with his librettist, Pastor Schubring. The Pastor was all for moral uplift; the composer wanted more drama. And Mendelssohn was a tired man, sadly overworked. He died one year after the first performance. The Elijahs are both outstanding young singers: Peter Salomaa (Harmonia Mundi) and Alexander Miles (Teldec). Salomaa sounds almost too young, less a Prophet than a promising young priest highly thought of by his Bishop. Miles suggests more experience and authority. All Herreweghe's soloists are remarkable: Soile Isokoski a radiant soprano, Monica Groop (whom I admired recently as the Composer in Strauss's Ariadne at the Opera-Comique in Paris) a strong alto, John Mark Ainsley a characterful, unsentimental tenor. Masur's Helen Donath and Jard van Nes are correct, rather dull, his tenor Donald George a little too sweet. Herreweghe has the better recording chamber - the Arsenal at Metz, a new concert hall by Ricardo Bofill. In the Frederic R. Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv Masur's chorus and orchestra too often melt into a thick paste, obscuring one of the admirable qualities of this score, the orchestral tone-painting - to give one example, the gentle, Hebrides - style swirls and eddies behind the voices in 'Blessed are the men who fear Him', hardly perceptible here. Lucky owners of the old HMV/Angel LPs with the New Philharmonia under Fruhbeck de Burgos, should hold on to them. Quite apart from the impressive soloists led by Fischer-Dieskau, resplendent as the Prophet, the balance is finer, providing as it were an extra dimension. Peter Cornelius, composer of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, was even more versatile and civilised than Mendelssohn - nephew of the painter of the same name, actor, writer, poet. In Weimar and Vienna he came into the orbits of Liszt, Berlioz and Wagner, but, in Ernest Newman's words, never lost 'his modest independence of manner'. That he had something of his own to keep is proved by the Stabat Mater recorded for Harmonia Mundi France (HMA 1905206) by the Choir and Orchestra of Cannes-Provence-Alpes-Cotes d'Azur under Michel Piquemal. The stylish performance should give a sharp jolt to any British listener too complacent to believe that such a standard can be found in a region so little associated with such music. According to Grove the date of the Stabat Mater is 1849, before Cornelius went to Weimar. This may explain the absence of obvious influences but not the assurance and quiet distinction of the work. Of the four soloists the soprano has the most to do and Danielle Borst does it well. The companion piece, Requiem, is not the Mass for the Dead but a setting for unaccompanied chorus of a mourning poem by Hebbel, one of Cornelius's eminent literary friends. Two hefty choral works of the present century which one reads about but very seldom hears are the Psalm 47 (O clap your hands) of Florent Schmitt and the Psalm 80 (Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel) of Roussel. A reissue on CD (French EMI, CDM 7 64368 2) of recordings made in Paris in the early 1970s provides a welcome chance of getting to know them. Schmitt's Psalm 47 is a late-Romantic score stuffed with barbaric colour and pulsating rhythm. Meanly one wonders if repeated hearings may not reveal pinchbeck behind the sumptuous glitter, but it is a wickedly enjoyable sonic experience, hurled at one with total conviction by conductor Jean Martinon (an expert in this repertory) and the Choirs and National Orchestra of French Radio. Fanfare piles on fanfare, the soprano soloist Andrea Guiot threads her way through the tapestry, there is still room for the organ (Gaston Litaize) to top it all. The recording is surprisingly successful in accommodating so much sound. Nothing pinchbeck about the Roussel Psalm 80 (1929) which Frederick Goldbeck called 'as grand a sacred score as was ever composed by an agnostic'. Roussel insisted on setting the English text from the Authorised Version. He stressed some of it wrongly, but since the French translation is used here that hardly matters. Roussel has as much rhythmic vigour as Schmitt but his colours are bracing rather than sensuous. The final section is particularly striking, with the chorus softly pleading to the Lord 'cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved' over dying pizzicatos. Serge Baudo, a reliable conductor but less fiery than Martinon, directs the Stephane Caillat Choir (very good) and the Orchestre de Paris. John Mitchinson is the tenor soloist. A nice change from normal oratorio diet.</p>

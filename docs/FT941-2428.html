			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Atlantic flights The US and Britain have stepped back from the brink of an airline trade war. We should be thankful for that. A tit-for-tat scrap would have harmed transatlantic passengers. It would also have put back the cause of global airline liberalisation since the two countries profess to be the keenest on opening the world's skies to competition. But it would be too soon to celebrate. Washington's decision last week to extend for a year a ticket 'code-sharing' arrangement between British Airways and its affiliate USAir merely buys time to break the logjam over creating an open skies regime between the two countries. Negotiations stalled when the US pulled out of talks late last year. There are still no plans to resume discussions. What is needed is a bit more vision from the key players: Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, and Mr John MacGregor, his British counterpart. They must free themselves from a mercantilist perspective, whereby their negotiating positions have been driven by their national airlines. That is a recipe for procrastination and ultimate failure as the established players have an incentive to maintain their existing positions. Instead, Mr Pena and Mr MacGregor should look to wider national interests. From this perspective, the benefits of opening the skies is great. The present bilateral agreement between London and Washington specifies which airlines can fly how often between which airports. Freeing up the system would lead to more competition and cheaper fares. It would also enable new air routes between the two countries to be opened up. Regional airports such as Manchester and Cincinnati would be the biggest gainers. Passengers would not need to travel so often to gateways such as Heathrow and New York's JFK to catch their transatlantic flights. Lower fares and greater convenience would boost traffic. This would have a knock-on effect on trade and tourism. It would also enhance Britain's position as Europe's principal hub for US flights and allow it to build on its comparative advantage in aviation vis-a-vis the rest of Europe. This, in turn, would help Washington secure similar open skies deals with other European countries. At present, its only liberal regime covers traffic to the Netherlands. Though some progress was made last week in opening up traffic to Germany, the US has no agreement with France. If Paris and Bonn saw more of their transatlantic traffic being diverted through the UK following an open skies agreement with the US, they would have every incentive to follow suit. Such a dynamic of competitive liberalisation has been apparent in the telecommunications industry, also characterised by a maze of bilateral deals. With so much to gain, Mr Pena and Mr MacGregor must set a date for new talks. With the right spirit, it should be possible to break the logjam.</p>

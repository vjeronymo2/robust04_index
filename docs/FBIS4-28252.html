			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 9 KYODO -- Two hours of talks between  the foreign ministers of China and South Korea failed to make  any headway Thursday on the issue of a suspected North Korean  nuclear weapons program, a diplomatic source in Beijing said.    Han Sung-chu, South Korean foreign minister, explained to  his  Chinese counterpart the various consultations among the United  States, Russia, Britain and Japan, and said U.N. Security  Council sanctions against North Korea were "inevitable," a South  Korean diplomat said.    Han, who arrived in Beijing late Wednesday directly from the  United Nations, told Qian Qichen the role of China in this  matter was "very important" and urged China to "cooperate  positively," he said.    Qian said China and South Korea share the same view  concerning the seriousness of the current situation and the  Chinese Government firmly maintains the basic position that  there should be no nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, he  said.    China urged continued dialogue among the four parties  concerned and said it would make the utmost efforts and "do its  best" to closely consult with the authorities concerned,  including the members of the security council, the Beijing-based  diplomat said.    Qian did not elaborate on China's position on sanctions  against North Korea, nor did he indicate whether or not China  would veto such sanctions if the security council votes for  them, he said.    The Chinese foreign minister, however, called for the  strengthening of consultations between China and South Korea, he  said.    The diplomat interpreted the remarks of the Chinese foreign  minister as an indication of China's unwillingness to  participate in the implementation of sanctions on North Korea.    It was not clear if the Chinese side urged Han to encourage  the U.S. to engage in a third round of talks with North Korea.    Consultations among Security Council members have taken  place  since the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported to  the U.N. last Friday the impossibility of determining whether  North Korea diverted to military use plutonium from spent fuel  rods at their 5-megawatt experimental nuclear reactor.    Such an incident, if it did occur, would be a violation of  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and could be reason enough  to implement U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEBATE CONTINUES: IS MIAMI, NOTRE DAME OR SAN DIEGO ST. NO. 1?  </P> <P> What was Mike Downey smoking the day Notre Dame played Miami?  </P> <P> He obviously wasn't watching his "No. 1" team get kicked.  </P> <P> Indeed, the Irish should be "fighting mad," but not because they were outvoted  in the polls -- rather, because they were duped into believing they were even  playing for the national championship.  </P> <P> Downey blames a second-rate selection system when the fault lies in some  third-rate bowl game matchups: How the loser of the Notre Dame-Miami game ends  up playing the No. 1 team in the Orange Bowl; the loser of the Alabama-Auburn  game ends up playing No. 2 team in the Sugar Bowl; and the country's hottest  team (Florida State) doesn't even get a shot at Notre Dame, Auburn or Miami is  a mystery.  </P> <P> RON OVADIA, Los Angeles  </P></p>

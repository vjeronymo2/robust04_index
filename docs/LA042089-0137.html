			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS GIVE UP RUNS, NOT GAME AS WITT WEATHERS WHITE SOX, 7-2  </P> <P> Streaks collided in the sixth inning of the Angels' 7-2 victory over the White  Sox Wednesday night, with Chicago center fielder Dave Gallagher bidding to  extend the majors' current longest hitting streak and the Angel pitching staff  bidding to bump the storied duo of Ryan and Tanana out of the record book.  </P> <P> Heresy, you say? Well, after five shutout innings by Mike Witt, the 1989 Angels  had run their string of consecutive scoreless innings to 29 -- dangerously  close to the club record of 32 2/3 innings, set in 1974 by the staff anchored  by Nolan Ryan and Frank Tanana.  </P> <P> Gallagher's quest was somewhat more modest. At stake was an 11-game hitting  streak, nothing to notify Cooperstown about, but not bad for a team playing its  14th game of the season.  </P> <P> With Ozzie Guillen on second base and an 0-2 count on Gallagher, something had  to give. History hung in the air as Witt sent a curveball headed for the dirt.  </P> <P> It never quite got there.  </P> <P> Gallagher dug the ball out and golfed a run-scoring single into center field,  at once ending one streak and continuing another: Angel streak hits the wall at  29, Gallagher streak remains intact at 12.  </P> <P> And Ryan and Tanana ward off a rather implausible assault, the baton having  been passed from Chuck Finley to Bert Blyleven to Kirk McCaskill to Bryan  Harvey to Witt.  </P> <P> Angel Manager Doug Rader reserved his response for another four innings,  waiting for relief pitcher Greg Minton to retire Gallagher in the bottom of the  ninth for a more significant out -- the final one.  </P> <P> "The only streaks you're really cognizant of are in the W and L columns," Rader  said. "Twenty-nine, or whatever it is, is important, but four is even more so.  </P> <P> Four is where another Angel streak -- consecutive victories -- currently  stands.  </P> <P> Before Gallagher drove home Guillen, the Angels were working on a 5-0 lead.  After Guillen scored, and then Gallagher, the advantage shrunk to 5-2, and when  the White Sox put two more runners on base in the seventh inning, Rader became  keenly cognizant of the only streak that matters.  </P> <P> He moved swiftly, first summoning left-handed reliever Bob McClure to retire  the left-handed-hitting Guillen, which McClure did on a ground ball to second  base. Then, Rader called for Minton, a right-hander, to finish the inning.  </P> <P> Minton went Rader one further. He finished the game, completing 2 1/3 shutout  innings to earn his second save of the season, tying him with Harvey.  </P> <P> "We gave up two runs, but we had the chance to give up five or six," Rader  said. "That's a tribute to the guys in the bullpen. They did the job we needed  them to do.  </P> <P> "The attention the starting pitching is getting is warranted and justified, but  this has been a total staff effort."  </P> <P> Rader had to dip into his relief staff when Witt (2-2), after 3 2/3 hitless  innings, began to struggle, yielding eight hits in his next 2 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> "If Mike had continued to breeze along, we wouldn't have had the need (to use  the bullpen)," Rader said. "But I didn't want to tempt fate."  </P> <P> Witt claimed to be unaware of the record he and his fellow pitchers were  nearing but knew he was following consecutive shutouts by Blyleven and the  McCaskill-Harvey tag team.  </P> <P> "I wanted to pitch a shutout," Witt said. "I wanted to pitch a no-hitter.  Sometimes, things don't work out."  </P> <P> This time, Witt said he ran into problems when he tried to rationalize the whys  and hows of the first few Chicago hits.  </P> <P> "Right now, I'm in some frame of mind where, if a guy hits a good pitch, I  don't give him credit for being a good hitter," Witt said. "I tell myself,  'That was a good pitch -- and he hit. What do I got to do now?'  </P> <P> "Then I start nibbling and get out of the groove."  </P> <P> Witt had the luxury of pitching with a lead, courtesy of Devon White's  three-run home run in the fifth inning, which followed run-scoring singles by  Chili Davis and Lance Parrish in the fourth inning. The Angels later added  unearned runs in the seventh and eighth innings to make a loser of Chicago  starter Bill Long (1-1).  </P> <P> The shutout and the record got away, but Witt and Co. hung on and hung in for  the victory, the Angels' third in five games over the White Sox.  </P> <P> And about that drama-laden sixth-inning delivery to Gallagher?  </P> <P> "He hit a good pitch," Witt said. "An 0-2 curveball and it wasn't too far off  the ground when he hit it."  </P> <P> But it wasn't quite good enough -- and the '89 Angels didn't quite have enough  to eclipse the '74 Angels.  </P> <P> Ryan and Tanana can rest easy for a little while longer.  </P> <P> As well they should.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels have found a way to keep both second basemen, Johnny Ray and Mark  McLemore, on the 24-man roster at the same time, at least temporarily. Manager  Doug Rader said Wednesday that the Angels will place shortstop Dick Schofield,  who has a strained chest muscle, on the 21-day disabled list and replace him  with Ray, eligible to return from the 15-day disabled list. "Schoey's not  making very much progress," Rader said. "If we put him on the disabled list, we  can bring back Johnny, give him some at-bats and evaluate how much he's capable  of playing. Then, we'll make a decision regarding Mark -- what's best for him  and for the team." Rader said the evaluation will take place in the next few  days, with Ray easing his way back into the lineup by pinch-hitting, being the  designated hitter and then playing some at second base. "We want to give him a  couple of days of legitimate work and see how (the wrist) responds," Rader  said.  </P> <P> Add Ray: If and when Ray is deemed ready to return to the lineup, McLemore  figures to return to Edmonton or the bench, .306 batting average  notwithstanding. Rader said he has no plans to platoon Ray and McLemore --  "That's not really productive to anybody," -- and still regards Ray as his  starting second baseman. "Johnny Ray still has not lost his job," Rader said.  "An injury should not make it possible for someone to lose his job. Even though  Mac has done some good things for us, there has to be some deference to what  Johnny has done over his career and, especially, last year. Those things  haven't changed since we made our decision in spring training."  </P> <P> Rader was still miffed over the decision to postpone Tuesday's game because of  the threat of snow, which never materialized. In fact, Tuesday night in Chicago  turned out to be a calmer evening than Monday, when the Angels and White Sox  were allowed to play in 39-degree temperatures. "I begged those people to wait  until 4 before they called it," Rader said. When the decision was made at noon,  Rader had to decide what to do with his starting rotation -- and opted to  bypass rookie Jim Abbott's turn.  </P></p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Elder takes his bow at ENO - Max Loppert pays tribute to the end of an operatic era THE CHAPTER is coming to its close. Two Saturday's hence, Mark Elder will conduct Verdi's Macbeth - the final performance of the current English National Opera season and under the current company troika. Thereafter Peter Jonas moves to the Intendant's chair of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, while both David Pountney, ENO Director of Productions, and Elder, Music Director, take up the freelance life. Typically for a conductor whose work has always blazed with energy, commitment and a sense of purpose, Elder is not letting himself out of the job gently - his final month at the Coliseum in London has been filled with nights on the podium. Typically, too, those nights have not been splashy. Neither Macbeth nor Inquest of Love - the specially commissioned Jonathan Harvey opera, of which Elder last week led the superbly confident premiere - exactly counts as a conductor's show-off opera, even if each requires every last ounce of masterly authority in their musical direction. Indeed, in his Coliseum office, Elder pronounced the Harvey 'one of the very hardest things I've ever done'. I had gone there to cull his thoughts about the past decade at the ENO - during which time the company became one of the most exciting in the world, a company with 'attitude', where opera was put on in a spirit of innovative, sometimes provocative exuberance, and always - the key quality - theatrical engagement. Elder is the Old Boy of the triumvirate. He had joined the company in 1974, and in December 1979 succeeded Charles Groves as music director - Pountney took over from Colin Graham (as director of productions) only in 1982, and Jonas from Lord Harewood (as artistic administrator) in 1985. He had known both Pountney and Jonas for a long time (Elder played bassoon and Pountney trumpet in the National Youth Orchestra and later did opera together at Cambridge; Elder and Jonas both worked at Glyndebourne in the late 1960s). The force of will to bring these compagnons de guerre to the Coliseum is, one senses, a quality Elder possesses in abundance. What happened there - the invention of what he once defined as 'a contemporary house of entertainment, a questioning, exploratory and youthful British opera company' - was no single person's achievement. Yet Elder's share in it needs just that bit of extra underlining - above all because musical standards at the Coliseum have risen so remarkably high over the last decade, so that even on those occasions when the production style seemed devised to drive traditionalists mad, the inspired quality of music-making could hardly be denied. How had that happened? 'In a gradual and sometimes painful way I had to try and set everybody's sights a bit higher. Some people relish the challenge, and rise with it, and do better than they've done, and feel better about themselves as a result; others cannot keep up with the pace, and so you make changes of personnel, which are painful. 'One of the things that's been most encouraging and inspiring for me is to feel the company something like a liner moving away from the dock. You feel it gradually starting to happen. Throughout the period there have been crucial moments that pushed us forward in a sudden jump - such as the arrival of certain key players in the orchestra. Gradually during the 1980s, as London began to lose its position as the freelance capital of the world, opportunities for session-playing diminished - with the result, for ENO, that vacancies in the orchestra were answered by a much higher grade of applicant. 'Thirteen years ago, one of the things I most wanted was a sense that every night there would still be a good standard of orchestral playing - which I didn't always feel to be the case in the 1970s. All of this is very difficult to do without incurring a certain dissatisfaction in the house. But I kept telling myself that any dissatisfactions we might be having now are better than those I felt in earlier days.' The vision of opera-as-theatre that unfolded during the 1980s was, as much as anything else, his response to such dissatisfactions. 'When I joined the company, in 1974, I had already worked at Glyndebourne and Covent Garden and for the Australian Opera: three incredibly different companies. Right from my very first experiences I watched how things were done well, or not, and who was setting the standards. 'After I started at the Coliseum, I then had five-and-a-half years of watching the company at work, and being frustrated. Above all, the type of theatrical experience that the work offered was, I thought, not often enough vivid, acute and involving. The attitude seemed to be that the staging should never impinge. 'I just knew there was something more total that could happen. I had acted at school and university. I was gripped by theatre. Seeing such things as the Brook Lear was a revelation. In the opera house, apart from such occasional things as the Koltai designs for the ENO Ring, I never felt that design was an essential element of the theatrical experience. 'At Cambridge I had come alive to the dynamic power of dramatic music. But in 1976 I worked with Joachim Herz (the producer from former East Germany) and Jo Barstow on Salome at the Coliseum. We'd never seen anything so consummately organised, with such theatrical integrity and unity. The way Herz worked the singers was infuriating - he is very dictatorial - but never at the expense of the singers' individuality: many of them showed a new concentration. I suddenly thought, 'We need more of this]''. In the 1980s, 'more of this' was what we started to get: productions by Pountney, Herz, Harry Kupfer, Graham Vick, Nicholas Hytner, and - most enraging to traditionalists - the American David Alden, all demanding a new openness from audiences, and spurring performers to give their utmost. 'The outstanding example of that was Alden's Mazeppa, in 1985. The '70s were full of producers who said, 'You lift your spear here]' Anathema to me: that's completely anti-music. What was so great about David was his way of listening to the music, but trying to cajole the singers into finding the scale for themselves. They all loathed having to do that, but they performed like possessed gods.' One of the points sometimes raised against the Elder-Pountney-Jonas regime was its apparent favouring of the repertory margins, and corresponding neglect of 18th century composers other than Mozart, or bel canto operas (of which Elder, unlike Pountney, is actually a devotee) other than those by Rossini. Did Elder accept the criticism? 'We all bring certain enthusiasms. George Harewood certainly had his: I know he was sorry I was rather dismissive of a certain type of French opera. That may have been me being too hasty and arrogant. 'You're right: there were some types of opera we could have been persuaded to think were part of our responsibility to the public; but we wanted to be more robust, to say - this is a big theatre in the middle of London, and we want to make a lively experience for the public, give them something colourful, full of zest and attack and balls, if you like. 'But I failed to get this bel canto idea across only because there were so many other enthusiasms. OK, I didn't get my Linda di Chamounix, even a nice Lucia or Elisir, but I gave those up so we could do Janacek, Busoni, more Verdi. It was a question of balance. One reason it will be interesting for the company to have new leadership is that the balance will be re-set, the decisions will be made with different enthusiasms.' Does he want to lead another company, one day? 'Yes, I think so. I believe in company life. There are still certain pieces I've never done, and others I haven't done enough. When it is good, it seems better than anything else. That won't change for me.'</p>

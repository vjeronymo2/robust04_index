			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : MINISTRY AT HOLLYWOOD PALLADIUM: DON'T FENCE US IN  </P> <P> The metal-grate fencing that went up around the stage just before Ministry's  set Friday at the Hollywood Palladium put one in mind of the chicken wire  famous for protecting bar bands down in the South. Except, if anything, this  fence wasn't erected to protect the band from patrons throwing bottles on  stage, but from fans hurling themselves on stage.  </P> <P> Then again, this barricade between performers and audience more likely served  some unknown symbolic purpose, like a scaled-down version of Pink Floyd's wall.  Lest bruising contact between singer and crowd be preempted altogether,  knee-pad-clad frontman Alain Jourgensen did climb over and lob himself into the  sweaty sea of faces again and again, in visually arresting if not altogether  convincing acts of atonement.  </P> <P> The two-man Ministry expanded to an octet for live reproduction of its  percussive punk, speed-metal and industrial noise-type grinding and wheezing --  truly exhilarating in double-time, and exasperating when the minimalism slowed  to a cacophonous crawl. If vocals are already rendered incomprehensible by  arrogant distortion on record, imagine how much less actual content seemed to  figure into things at the Palladium. To quote Pink Floyd: Tear down the wall.  CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

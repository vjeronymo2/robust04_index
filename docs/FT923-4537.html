			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Farmers to invest in urban invasion FARMERS from the Shropshire village of Wem have decided they might make a better living by coming out of their rural hideaways and staging an urban invasion. Led by Mr David Hurren, secretary of the local branch of the National Farmers' Union, 12 of them are contemplating an investment of Pounds 5m to take the business of the land to the doorstep of townsfolk in the west Midlands or the north-west of England. They plan to buy a farm of up to 250 acres on the edge of one of the conurbations, work it as a model rural enterprise, set up craft units and a teaching centre and then a shopping complex to sell its products and those of other farms. Such shops would not be like normal farm shops - 'not cobbled together with string and tacks' - Mr Hurren hastened to assure. But they would cock a snook at the power of the supermarket chains. 'You can't beat them at their own game,' Mr Hurren explained. 'You can't join them at it. But there may be a way to slip in between them.' The plan gives a new slant to rural diversification: the scramble for farmers to find means of compensating for diminishing subsidy income from the European Community. 'The difficulty we have found is that farmers want to do things in their own backyard,' Mr Hurren said. 'But you've got to go to where the market is.' Preliminary research for a feasibility study by Venture Business Consultants of Shrewsbury indicates that the idea has proved successful on a smaller scale. 'We'll need some venture capital,' Mr Hurren said, but at this stage he does not know how much.</p>

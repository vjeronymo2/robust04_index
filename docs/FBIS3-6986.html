			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Recently, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet held a working  session with the Central Steering Committee for Debt Solvency  [CSCDS]. After listening to reports on the second stage of the  debt solvency and opinions from the Finance Ministry, the  Vietnam State Bank, the State Planning Commission, the Interior  Ministry, the Supreme People's Organ of Control, the State  Economic Arbitrators, and the State Finance and Monetary  Council, the prime minister concluded as follows:    The second stage of the debt solvency is a burdensome and  very complicated issue. If it is not satisfactorily settled and  quickly accomplished, its bad effects will be multiple.  Therefore, the second stage of the debt solvency must be  urgently conducted, solved, and basically concluded in 1994.    In executing the second stage of the debt solvency, the  government has mobilized a moderately large force of cadres.  However, after more than one year, the task has still not been  concluded. This is partly due to the complicated and difficult  characteristics of the second stage. But on the other side, it  is also due to the lack of regular checks, encouragement, and  guidance from different organs from the central to local levels,  including the Standing Central Steering Committee for Debt  Solvency. They still wait for the government to solve the bad  debts. This is a great shortcoming of leaders of all echelons  and levels. Therefore, it is necessary to solemnly review this  responsibility.    In executing the second stage, the Standing Central Steering  Committee for Debt Solvency must coordinate with related  ministries and sectors to compile the necessary legal documents  before presentation to the government for issuance to create a  basis for the debt solvency committees at all levels to carry on  their work. These documents must cover thoroughly all  requirements and working principles.    All objective and subjective causes of bad debts must be  considered carefully in line with the related structure and  policies in effect when the debts were raised. At the same  time, we must be very strict in cases where violations have been  intentionally committed or committed due to irresponsibility.    We must classify each debt group for suitable measures.  Debts among active state-run enterprises must be solved  quickly, with proper attention paid to index adjustment and loan  interests. We can provide some capital to create conditions for  the debt settlement. Loans between active state-run enterprises  with inactive or dissolved state-run enterprises, other  organizations, and individuals must be separately listed before  applying resolute and final measures with clear instructions to  reclaim the money or settle the debts with assets, capital,  land, or goods. In these cases, we must establish the  responsibility of each sector, level, and individual, including  administrative measures and legal proceedings against incumbent  officials.    After that, debts will continue to be collected. The rest of  the debt which is unable to be collected will be considered for  subsidy from the government. While doing this, the  responsibility of every sector and echelon must be clearly  established to restore order and discipline in the state  mechanism and purify the contingent of cadres, especially the  cadres who manage the state finance and assets.    In dealing with debt solvency, the responsibilities of both  sides must be established. Causes for prolonged debt must be  defined by the debtors and favorable conditions must be actively  created so that the debtors can repay their debts. Reasons from  both sides, debtors and creditors, must be established for  better dealing.    In the implementation process, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  stressed the organization management of the debt solvency  committees at all levels. If necessary, their power must be  increased so that they can work better with other sectors and  echelons. The number of specialized cadres sent to the standing  debt solvency groups must be reviewed. A necessary number of  cadres must be retained to carry on the work. After receiving  instructions from the cabinet, the CSCDS will hold meetings with  10 provinces with acute problems in their debt solvency and with  some key ministries and departments to execute the second stage  of the debt solvency.</p>

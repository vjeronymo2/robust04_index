			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'GAY-BASHING' NETS MAXIMUM SENTENCES FOR 3  </P> <P> A judge in Santa Ana handed three young neo-Nazi skinheads the maximum possible  sentences Friday in a "gay-bashing" attack on a man in a Laguna Beach park last  summer.  </P> <P> Accusing the three of a "wolf pack" mentality, Superior Court Judge David H.  Brickner sentenced Aaron F. Compean, 18, who assaulted the victim with a lead  pipe, to seven years in prison. John M. Moore, 23, received four years and  eight months for assault and attempted robbery, and Stephen Walther, 18, was  sentenced to four years.  </P> <P> The three men, all from Huntington Beach, attacked 48-year-old Robert Joyce as  he walked along the coastal cliffs. But, the jury that convicted them of  assault charges two months ago rejected prosecutors' contention that the crime  was attempted murder, which could have carried a 15-year sentence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Remorse Claimed  </P> <P> At a sentencing hearing before Superior Court Judge David H. Brickner in Santa  Ana, defense attorneys said the men were extremely remorseful and asked the  judge for less than the maximum sentences.  </P> <P> The judge said, however, that he found the crime "especially offensive because  of its wolf pack modus operandi . . . beating (the victim) seriously for no  comprehensible reason."  </P> <P> Compean's attorney, Gene E. Dorney, asked the judge to consider that Compean  was the only one of the three not wearing steel-pointed shoes.  </P> <P> "He didn't have to," Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef said. "He was the one  with the pipe."  </P> <P> Compean and Walther could have been eligible to serve their sentences at the  California Youth Authority. Their attorneys said, however, that both wanted to  go to state prison.  </P></p>

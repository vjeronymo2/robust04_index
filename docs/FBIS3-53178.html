			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has declined  to receive the U.S. Congress delegation out of respect for the  U.S. law that bans U.S. Congressmen from visiting Lebanon, as he  announced today.    Parallel to this position, the delegation's visit created a  wave of criticism among party circles, which saw in the visit a  disdain for the dignity of the Lebanese people because the  delegation's mission was confined to searching for Israeli  soldiers while ignoring the destiny of Lebanese detainees and  captives in Israeli prisons.</p>

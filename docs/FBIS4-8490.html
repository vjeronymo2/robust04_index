			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, April 13 (AFP) -- The Yugoslav  government officially withdrew press accreditations from AFP  correspondents here Wednesday [13 April], accusing them of  waging a "media war" against Belgrade.    The information ministry withdrew accreditations from bureau  chief Nicolas Miletitch and three other journalists to cover  events in Serbia and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], but not for Serb-held areas of Croatia and  Bosnia.    On Tuesday the ministry accused AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE and  Cable News Network (CNN) of "waging a merciless media war  against Yugoslavia, from its territory." [passage omitted]    The AFP journalists whose accreditation was withdrawn can  continue to coordinate coverage of events in Macedonia and  Albania.</p>

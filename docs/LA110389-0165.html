			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. REJECTS PLEA TO MEND ITS TIES WITH NEW ZEALAND;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION TO NUCLEAR ARMS CITED  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, reaffirming the U.S. strategy of nuclear deterrence,  rebuffed an Australian call for a resumption of close political and military  ties with New Zealand, senior officials of both countries said today.  </P> <P> Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said it is time for Washington to  consider repairing the relationship with New Zealand that was downgraded two  years ago after the Wellington government refused to permit nuclear armed or  nuclear-powered U.S. warships to call at New Zealand ports, an Australian  official said.  </P> <P> But Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney  replied that nuclear deterrence remains a key element in U.S. policy despite  the recent relaxation of superpower tensions.  </P> <P> A senior Bush Administration official said the breach was caused by New  Zealand's anti-nuclear policy.  </P> <P> "They made the decision on this issue," the U.S. official said. "They will have  to live with the result."  </P> <P> New Zealand's new prime minister, Jeffrey Palmer, has reaffirmed his nation's  anti-nuclear policy. But he complained that President Bush is prepared to meet  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev while retaining a policy that prohibits  high-level political and military contacts with New Zealand, one of  Washington's oldest traditional allies.  </P> <P> But a U.S. official said, "We live in an age where the United States plays an  important role in terms of deterrent capabilities around the globe. Those in  part depend on our ability to project force with our Navy. Our Navy relies in  part on nuclear propulsion as well as nuclear weapons."  </P> <P> For years, the U.S. government has expressed concern that a growing worldwide  abhorrence of nuclear weapons might upset the global military balance which,  officials argue, has prevented a new world war for almost 45 years.  </P> <P> The disagreement over New Zealand, combined with a somewhat similar rift over  Washington's continued coolness toward an Australian-backed South Pacific  Nuclear Free Zone, marred otherwise harmonious U.S.-Australia security talks at  a naval base in Sydney.  </P> <P> Baker, Cheney, Evans and Australian Defense Minister Kim Beazley attended the  annual meeting to set policy for the alliance, which is still known as ANZUS  (for Australia, New Zealand and the United States) despite New Zealand's  suspension in 1987.  </P> <P> Australian officials said they gained "the very strong impression" that the  United States will abstain from a U.N. General Assembly vote endorsing the  recently signed compact that prohibits the stationing of nuclear weapons in the  South Pacific although it does not ban the passage through the region of  nuclear-armed ships flying the flag of an outside nation.  </P> <P> "We like it," one Australian official said of a U.S. abstention in the United  Nations. "We like it a lot more than if they voted no."  </P> <P> U.S. officials said, however, that no decision has been made concerning  Washington's position on the U.N. vote. But they left little doubt that the  United States opposes creation of nuclear-free zones anywhere in the world.  </P></p>

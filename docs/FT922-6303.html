			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Investors view PSBR projections with composure WHEN forecasts of a 1992-1993 public sector borrowing requirement of about Pounds 30bn began circulating shortly before the general election, investors in gilt-edged stock reacted with alarm. Their fears were hardly surprising. Faced with slow growth, how would a new  -possibly Labour - government cope with such a big public sector deficit? Fears of rising long-term interest rates were compounded by forecasts of sharply growing borrowing requirements in future years. Worries over the size of the deficit appear, however, to have been allayed, or at least postponed. The election result, the ease with which the Bank of England is meeting its funding requirements and recent anti-inflationary policy statements from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and the Bank suggest that gilt-edged investors can look upon current public sector borrowing requirement projections with equanimity. The Treasury is sticking - so far - to its Budget forecast of a PSBR of Pounds 28bn in 1992-1993. This is slightly less than many City forecasts which predict a figure of about Pounds 30bn. Last week's figure of Pounds 3.6bn in April was the biggest for that month since 1987, suggesting the deficit is on course to fulfil the gloomier prophecies. But it now appears that the Bank has met more than a third of its funding requirements for the entire 1992-1993 fiscal year since the election. The City has gained a better insight into the matter since publication of the latest Bank of England quarterly bulletin last week. Two tranches of stock were issued in the early hours of April 10 as the country awoke to the Conservative election victory. These amounted to Pounds 1.6bn. But the bulletin says that 'including sales made on April 10, gross official sales of some Pounds 4bn were made in the first 10 days of April'. This suggests the Bank sold a further Pounds 2.4bn of 'unofficial' stock that was on its books from the period of buying-in in the late 1980s, by April 10. Since then, a further Pounds 5.7bn of issues and a call of about Pounds 600m took the total of known funding to Pounds 10.25bn, says Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at S. G. Warburg. He estimates a further Pounds 1bn of unofficial sales, taking gross sales since the start of the financial year to about Pounds 11.25bn, or over a third of the Bank's funding requirements. Recent policy statements have also helped foster a more relaxed view of a PSBR which, if forecasts prove correct, will amount to 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992-1993. Neither the chancellor nor the Bank are satisfied that the battle against inflation is over. A new anti-inflation drive appears to be in the offing. Last week Mr Lamont said Britain should aim to match the inflation performance of the Japanese, which is around 2 per cent, if it wants to be a 'first rank commercial power'. Even so, there are precious few signs that the recovery has begun; and the combination of high real interest rates and high levels of consumer and commercial debt suggest it may be sluggish. The longer it takes to arrive and the slower it is when it does, the bigger the future fiscal headache. The Bank of England issued Pounds 800m of partly-paid 9 per cent conversion stock due 2000 at a price of 100.75 per cent on Friday.</p>

We regret any inconvenience caused."]    [Text] Beijing (CEIS)--The people's bank of China, the  country's central bank, has agreed to the circulation of the  Hong Kong dollar in Shenzhen and Zhuhai, two special economic  zones in Guangdong province. Experts and officials of the  central bank said in line with internationalization, special  economic zones need a monetary system different from that in  inland cities. They suggest that the Hong Kong dollar, while  circulating with renminbi at the same time, should become the  main currency in these two zones.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Use of life assurance ratios data for cost comparisons deemed to be 'inappropriate' Sir, It is a great pity that the article by John Authers ('Hidden costs that can make life policies so expensive', February 22) further confuses the debate about life office expenses. The data on which the quoted ratios are based have been available in the public domain since the current regulations came into force in 1984. That it has not been used before for the purpose quoted is probably because it is inappropriate to do so. The results can be misleading, as they could be for the Securities and Investments Board comments on lapses which were drawn from a similar source. An example is that the new business figures in the form reported to the Department of Trade and Industry returns are based upon certain definitions. In the case of this office, that results in an understatement of the true position. Similarly, it is likely that the author has left in his calculations the society's unit-linked and non-profit business despite the claim to deal only with with-profits business. Similar discrepancies must arise with the other offices quoted and must cast doubt on the figures. A further serious deficiency is that the DTI returns show absolute expenses. With contracts like endowment assurances, there is almost certainly for all life offices some netting down of those expenses when passing on to policyholders to allow for the effect of tax relief. Life offices are much criticised for resisting pressure to move away from the 'reduction in yield' concept - a concept which makes comparison of expenses between life offices and between the life industry and deposit taking institutions straightforward. For example, one life office might say, 'if we can earn 10 per cent on investments, the effect of our expenses will be as if we had earned 8 per cent', whereas another might say 'the effect is as if we had earned 7 per cent'. A clear, simple way of identifying differences. The life offices continue to resist other types of disclosure not because of a wish to hide their expenses, but simply because they know that all other methods so far advanced by commentators, whose knowledge and understanding of our business is unlikely to be so deep, do not do the job adequately. The range of contracts on the market and their variety of charging methods is so great that it is difficult to find a method of expressing the effect of different charges and their incidence in a way which is not misleading. Rather than subjecting the life industry to a continuous barrage of criticism and putting forward ill-founded alternatives, it might be more helpful to the consumer if commentators attempted to explain the life offices' stance a bit more objectively. Since my office appeared as the most competitive regarding charges in your article, no doubt you will accept that I have no particular axe to grind. My concern is to generate some objective discussion. R H Ranson, managing director and actuary, Equitable Life Assurance Society, Walton Street, Aylesbury, Bucks HP21 7QW</p>

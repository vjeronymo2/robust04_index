			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention - Currencies The dollar will remain the centre of attention, even if intervention by the Federal Reserve last week effectively put a short-term floor under the currency. The focus of market attention will now shift to the November 15 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is widely expected to sanction a further rise in US interest rates. In the interim, the dollar is likely to be protected from the full force of market bearishness by the prospect of further intervention, possibly on a co-ordinated basis. The dollar is sure to be a subject of discussion when G10 central bankers meet today in Basle. So far, however, there has been no indication of intervention spreading beyond the US and Japan. Dollar selling pressure among institutional investors also appears limited. 'They are very aware that the crowd psychology in the market is moving towards a position of extreme bearishness,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London. 'They are not really in the mood to sell the currency from these sorts of levels.' With mid-term congressional elections this week, and the quarterly treasury refunding, the US authorities have ample reason for wanting to stabilise the dollar. Mr Robin Aspinall, strategist at Panmure Gordon, the broker, comments: 'A stable dollar may win more votes; it certainly makes it easier to sell bonds to foreigners.' The elections are unlikely to have much market impact, except in the unlikely event of the Democrats doing much better than expected, or the Republicans making gains on traditional Democratic strongholds. One event that will distract attention from the US is the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday. As Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, has stressed recently, German rates can go in either direction. This is more than can be said for many of the other leading economies, where the direction of rates can only be up.</p>

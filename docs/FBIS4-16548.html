			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Remarks by Vitaliy Churkin, Russian special envoy and </F> deputy foreign minister, to correspondents on 15 April; place  not given; from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Our talks in Belgrade were  centered on the difficult problem of concluding an all-embracing  agreement on cessation of all hostilities between the Serbs and  the Muslims in all the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There  were three extensive, serious, and constructive conversations  with Serbian President Milosevic. We continued our contacts  with the leaders [words indistinct]. It is not without  satisfaction that I can now say that, in my view, I have a  serious basis for concluding such an agreement. It envisages  disengagement of the fighting sides; in other words, it will be  a real agreement on ending the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and not  just another declaration on ceasing hostilities. [passage  omitted]</p>

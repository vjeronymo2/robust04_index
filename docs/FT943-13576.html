			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: House price trends and recovery Sir, Samuel Brittan is right to point out that soaring house prices are unhealthy for the economy (Economic Viewpoint, July 7). But he fails to comment on the problems caused by a depressed housing market. Without a strong housing market - remembering that the phrase refers as much to the number of transactions as to prices - the economy cannot reap the benefits of the increased outlay on goods and services that go with moving house. The 'wealth effects' that a modest rise in residential property prices create cannot be measured, but without their reassuring presence to the home-owner, consumer spending is unlikely to play a large role in facilitating the economic recovery.

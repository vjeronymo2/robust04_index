			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Leaders set to back shake-up of benefits The Labour leadership is preparing to back a radical shake-up of the benefit system for the unemployed and low-paid alongside the full integration of the tax and benefits system for the retired. Anticipating a report in two weeks' time from the party's Social Justice Commission, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Mr Donald Dewar, social security spokesman, indicated that a future Labour government would preserve the principle of universal child benefit and the state pension. But the leadership is keeping open the option - raised in the commission's report - of extending the taxation of universal benefits. It is understood that a large part of the commission's recommendations focus on ways to remove poverty traps which discourage the unemployed from taking part-time or low-paid jobs. The focus on improving what are known as 'in-work benefits' is in line with Mr Tony Blair's insistence that Labour's approach to the welfare state will be to encourage self-help rather than dependency on state benefits. Mr Dewar underlined the point by telling the conference that Labour's aim was 'a nation at work, not a nation on benefit'. He also underlined the party's support for the social insurance principle embodied in the present system of National Insurance contributions. The commission's report articulates concern that the present system of rapidly withdrawing cash from low-income households when one member takes any form of employment discourages those on benefits from seeking work. Among those are women who are forced to give up part-time work when their partners become unemployed to prevent the family's benefits being withdrawn. Unemployed men are also discouraged from part-time work by the structure of income-support payments. One suggestion is that benefit payments should include a 'guaranteed' element which the unemployed would be allowed to keep if they took part-time or low-paid jobs. Another possibility would be to allow the jobless to keep all of their unemployment benefits for a limited period. The plan to integrate the tax and benefits system for pensioners aims to give a guaranteed minimum income for the retired while scrapping means-testing for poor pensioners. About 2m are eligible for some form of income support but about a quarter do not claim. Mr Dewar said the aim was 'to help pensioners living in poverty without leaving them exposed to the crude means-test which is income support'. But an automatic 'top-up' of state pensions for the poor would allow Labour to drop the expensive pledge given at the last election to restore the link between the state pension and earnings. Only a small part of the money would be needed to raise the incomes of the poorest pensioners. Because most pensioners have stable financial circumstances, the assumption is that the majority would have to complete only one new tax and benefit return during retirement. Those with changing incomes would be subject to regular assessments.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Granada extends LWT offer Granada, the leisure and television group yesterday extended its offer worth some Pounds 700m for London Weekend Television, after LWT shareholders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The number of acceptances grew by only 0.3 percentage points to a total of 2.61 per cent. This gives Granada, which bought 17.5 per cent of the company last summer, a total of 20.12 per cent. The offer was extended to January 26 - a shorter period than expected. The current terms are six new Granada shares for every five LWT shares with a cash alternative of 528p. The shorter than expected extension gives Granada the obvious peg to make a final improved offer - something that City analysts believe will be needed to clinch the deal. It might, for example, pay a final LWT dividend. No decision has been taken on an improvement - Granada wants to wait at least until Friday, the final date for LWT introducing new information. Another factor is the continuing investigation by the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT is believed to be looking carefully at the implication for advertising sales of any takeover. Last night Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), said his board believes that 'LWT shareholders should not exchange their investment in a valuable television company for shares in a conglomerate, nor accept a poor cash offer. We continue to advise shareholders to reject the offer'.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOSS TO LAKERS COULD BE CASEY'S FINALE AS COACH  </P> <P> The end of the Clipper season came Saturday night, with the end of the Clipper  coach's tenure expected today.  </P> <P> Though no one will comment officially, all indications are that Don Casey's 1  1/2-season run will be terminated during an afternoon meeting with General  Manager Elgin Baylor. Technically, it will not be a firing since the Clippers  hold only an option on Casey's services for next season.  </P> <P> "It doesn't look good," one source said.  </P> <P> Casey's hopes to be retained were buoyed by showings in recent weeks, including  a 125-115 loss to the Lakers before 15,350 at the Sports Arena, finishing the  most successful Clipper season since 1985-86 at 30-52. Unlike a year ago, when  the Clippers also finished strong and the search for a permanent replacement  for Gene Shue lagged well into the summer, a decision this time will be made  quickly.  </P> <P> "That doesn't make sense," Baylor said before the game. "I don't believe it  should drag on. Quicker is better for everyone. I'm not going to say how it's  going to be one way or the other. I'm going to sit down with Casey so he will  know first what I'm thinking."  </P> <P> At the latest, Baylor and Casey will meet Monday morning, before Casey departs  for the East Coast and a weeklong vacation.  </P> <P> Casey has a 41-85 record, on both an interim and a permanent basis, in his  first NBA head coaching job. This season, the Clippers had several notable  accomplishments -- 10 road victories, equaling the last three seasons combined;  the first time out of last place in three years -- but Casey will ultimately be  remembered for the emotion he stirred in his players. Unfortunately for him, it  was mixed.  </P> <P> Last season, as the Clippers finished a 21-61 season, he had practically  unanimous support from players. Feelings were upbeat and that carried over to  the start of 1989-90.  </P> <P> Then, things fell apart. Players said Casey had changed and they also were  unhappy about substitution patterns and the offense. They met with owner Donald  T. Sterling in mid-February to air complaints, some going so far as to ask that  Casey be fired.  </P> <P> That never happened, things began to look good again heading toward the end of  the season, even as the starting backcourt of Ron Harper and Gary Grant mended  from injuries. The Clippers were still losing, but they were making good  impressions -- falling by seven points to San Antonio, seven to Phoenix, seven  to Portland, seven to the Lakers in another recent meeting, four to Atlanta.  </P> <P> Apparently, that won't allow Casey to keep his job, though he said he has not  been told anything.  </P> <P> "I thought our guys, despite what anybody else thinks, played to their ability  at this juncture," he said, sounding like a man making a last defense. "I think  we extended them (the Lakers). That's a team that wins 50 to 60 games a year,  and a bunch of young guys played them close.  </P> <P> "To me, the meeting should be very simple. We are discussing the situation and  it should either be: A, you are the coach now; B, you are not the coach now; C,  you have a place in this organization after being with us seven years; or D,  hit the road. I don't know what you have to take a lot of time with. I am not  on that jury."  </P> <P> He paused.  </P> <P> "But I would be an excellent tiebreaker."  </P> <P> He smiled.  </P> <P> "My feelings in this business change with the wind. When you're not hearing  anything, you grope to watch body language, whether you get an Easter card,  things like that. But those are things you can't control. Just like I can't  control meetings I'm not in attendance at.  </P> <P> "I'm only hearing the conjecture that you guys are hearing. But nothing would  surprise me."  </P> <P> Clipper-Laker Notes  </P> <P> Magic Johnson had 30 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds for the Lakers and  James Worthy added 28 points on 12-of-13 shooting. Danny Manning led the  Clippers with 30 points. . . . As expected, Byron Scott did not dress because  of a sprained left ankle, and the Lakers are hoping he will be ready to  practice Tuesday. The new lineup had a three-forward offense with Orlando  Woolridge added.  </P></p>

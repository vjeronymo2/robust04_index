			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY SPOTS: RIDES, FISHING AND HOOPLA AT KIDS' DAY  </P> <P> A chance for free rides on the carrousel, bumper cars and a giant slide would  be enough to lure many families to Kids' Day today at the Santa Monica Pier,  but there's much more to keep families busy throughout the day. Early risers  can head for Douglas Park, at Wilshire Boulevard and Chelsea Street, for a  fishing derby in the park's pond from 7 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The rest of the activities (all free) will take place from noon to 5 p.m. on  and around the pier. At the south parking lot at the foot of Bay Street, a  skateboarding competition begins at noon and is open to all comers, who will be  grouped by age.  </P> <P> Sand sculpting, supervised by volunteers from the Westside Children's Museum,  will take place on the beach north of the pier. A "Super Kids" contest, with  Hula Hooping on the list of events, will be held nearby.  </P> <P> Entertainment on the stage at the west end of the pier begins with a creative  dance demonstration at noon, followed by a karate demo at 1 p.m. and a  gymnastics demo at 2. The festivities also include storytelling by librarians  from the Santa Monica Library, from 1 to 3 p.m. at the carrousel park. Fire and  police vehicles will be on view in the parking lot north of the pier from 1 to  5 p.m. Information: (213) 458-8311.  </P></p>

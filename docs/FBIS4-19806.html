			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government supports U.S.  President Bill Clinton's attitude in seeking to follow a tougher  course in Bosnia. On Thursday [21 April], Government Spokesman  Dieter Vogel stated in Bonn that the continuing aggression by  Serbian combat troops and their political leaders' constantly  broken promises grossly violate the basic rules of humanity and  international law.    The military and economic countermeasures mentioned by  Clinton are part of the options of the allies to bring the  Bosnian-Serb leadership to its senses. The Federal Government  calls for close political coordination between the European  Union, NATO, the United Nations, the United States, and Russia.  The Federal Government particularly welcomes the intention  expressed by Clinton for political coordination, above all with  Russia, to prepare further steps. This is the basic condition  for clear and consistent action against the forces of  aggression, Vogel stated.</p>

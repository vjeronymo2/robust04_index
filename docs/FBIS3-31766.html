Asked about his position  on Aleksander Kwasniewski's statement that the president had no  right to withdraw his representative from the Constitutional  Commission, Lech Walesa said:    [Walesa] "If postcommunists and Kwasniewski were to have the  real power, his idol Stalin would surely lock me up for that."    [Announcer] Lech Walesa said that he is ready to talk with  the Sejm speaker about issues which have prospects for being  resolved.    [Walesa] "The president has to talk and will talk with the  speaker on issues which have prospects for being resolved.  Nothing can be done on this issue of constitutional conflict,  unless the speaker secures different voting."    [Announcer] President Walesa probably will not visit the  Sejm  building again.    [Walesa] "As I have noticed, there is no point, and I think  that we are going to have ever fewer things in common."</p>

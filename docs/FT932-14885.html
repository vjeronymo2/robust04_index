			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine to give details of further DTI changes MR MICHAEL Heseltine will next week unveil fresh details of his plans to revamp the Department of Trade and Industry to develop a closer partnership between the government and business. The trade and industry secretary is expected to use a keynote report to outline the conclusions of his review of the department's structure and to explain how he intends to refine it. He is also likely to give a summary of the changes he has made so far. Completion of the exercise has been delayed by the length of time Mr Heseltine has had to devote to resolving the coal crisis. In his first year in the job Mr Heseltine has taken a number of steps - including reorganising the DTI's industrial divisions along sectoral lines - which have been designed to make the department a more effective advocate of the interests of British industry. Recent moves have added to suspicions that he might be preparing to give his interventionist instincts a more free rein. He is likely to emphasise in public that his notion of intervention does not entail spending large sums of money, however. Earlier this month Mr Richard Needham, a trade and industry minister, announced plans to encourage British companies to work more closely together in bidding for large projects in foreign markets as part of a wide-ranging effort to boost UK exports. Mr Heseltine recently started recruiting some of the UK's biggest companies to help with an initiative to monitor economic activity independently of the Treasury. The group of about 20 companies would give Mr Heseltine confidential information about their sales trends in the critical period as Britain attempts to move into an upturn, as well as advising him on long-term industrial goals. The move has been portrayed as an attempt to turn his department into an economic powerhouse to rival the Treasury.</p>

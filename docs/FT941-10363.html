			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Politicians call for new board at BNL A group of politicians yesterday called upon the Ciampi government to appoint a new board to BNL, the treasury-controlled commercial bank, whose chairman Mr Gianpiero Cantoni was forced to step down on Monday because of magistrates' investigations into alleged corruption. The call came from senators in the parliamentary commission investigating the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.7bn) worth of unauthorised loans issued to Iraq by BNL's Atlanta branch which came to light in 1989. Mr Cantoni was brought in to clean up the problems left by BNL-Atlanta and there has been no suggestion he has been linked to Atlanta. But he was a Socialist appointee: as such the latest problems at the bank have highlighted how Italy's ruling parties have carved up the top posts in the state-dominated banking system. In a statement the group of senators said: 'The government should intervene immediately. The leadership needs to be renewed to provide stability for the bank.' At the same time, a majority of the senators on the BNL-Atlanta commission rejected the view that the bank was a 'victim' of the Atlanta scandal. This view was contained in the conclusion of a report delivered yesterday by Mr Giampaolo Mora, the commission's president. The majority backed the line taken by the US Congress' Banking Committee, headed by Mr Henry Gonzalez, that the Rome head office was aware of the operations of its Atlanta branch. Both BNL executives and members of the then Christian Democrat-led government have denied such knowledge at headquarters. Yesterday in a potentially significant related development, US president Bill Clinton gave the green light for new guidelines permitting a more liberal declassification of documents relating to the BNL-Atlanta affair. In turn this gave renewed impetus to the efforts of Mr Gonzalez' Banking Committee to establish the truth. The call for management changes at BNL also focused attention on the issue of BNL's under capitalisation. In a treasury paper outlining government plans for privatisation prepared in November 1992, BNL was estimated to need at least L2,000bn (Pounds 797m) to improve capital ratios. Speaking to journalists in Milan yesterday, Mr Mario Draghi, director-general of the treasury, said the latest developments at BNL had reinforced the urgency of putting the bank on a stronger financial footing. He said the treasury remained committed to the recapitalisation and implied this might come about within the year. Mr Cantoni himself was yesterday required by Milan magistrates to confront Mr Achise Marcori, former Socialist councillor at Segrate, a Milan suburb. This followed claims by Mr Marcori he received L200m from Mr Cantoni linked to a residential property development. According to the Ansa news agency, Mr Cantoni said he was forced to pay L400m as the price for being able to carry out the development. Meanwhile further details emerged yesterday about papers the Bank of Italy had sent to Rome magistrates on BNL loans to Mandelli, an engineering group recently placed in liquidation. BNL's London branch is alleged to have extended a L75m credit facility to Mandelli for dealings with a subsidiary allegedly linked to Mr Cantoni's family business interests.</p>

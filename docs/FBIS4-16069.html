			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] Dushanbe demonstrates "satisfaction" with the  situation at the negotiations between Tajikistan's leadership  and Tajik opposition underway in Moscow. On Tuesday the parties  adopted a joint statement on the necessity "to abstain from any  actions able to aggravate the negotiating process" and  "compiled" the agenda; this fact gives the ground for "a  restrained optimism." Tajikistan's Foreign Minister Rashid  Olimov voiced this statement in his interview with INTERFAX on  Wednesday.    In his words, "the warming-up" has concluded at the  negotiations and "the major process" has started. "We hope for  a breakthrough. Tajikistan's political leadership shows  appropriate good will to solve all issues constructively," said  Olimov.    He indicated that Tajikistan's Government "has neither  started nor initiated hostilities." "We expect that the armed  opposition will demonstrate sound sense and will respond to good  will," said Olimov.    As he said, three major problems are covered in the  coordinated agenda of the negotiations. "These are cessation of  hostilities, granting of an additional impulse to the  repatriation of refugees, and participation of all `Tajiks' in  the constitutional process within the Republic irrespective of  their political adherences. We hope for a constructive talk of  these partners on these issues. Further negotiations will be  devoted to this," said Olimov.    He disagreed with the opinion that the delegations of the  parties at the negotiations in Moscow "are inappropriately  represented." "In any case, Tajikistan's governmental delegation  has all necessary authorities and its composition corresponds to  the frameworks of the preliminary agreements. As far as the  opposition's delegation is concerned, it will participate in the  negotiations in a reduced composition," said Olimov.    At the same time he underlined that "it is not so important  for Tajikistan's leadership who sits opposite but how the  responsibility for the reached results will be implemented." "We  do not need negotiations for the sake of negotiations. The main  thing is that Tajikistan's citizens should feel themselves  secure," stressed Olimov.    Olimov highly appreciated activity of the Russian Foreign  Ministry and of the special representative of the UN General  Secretary Ramiro Piriz-Ballon in establishing the inter-Tajik  dialogue. "As the hostess of the first round of the negotiations  Russia has done its utmost so that they would be held in the  atmosphere of constructiveness and the search for mutually  acceptable decisions," said Olimov.    As he said, it's early to speak about the time and place of  the next round of the negotiations.</p>

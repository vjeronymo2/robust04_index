			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Commission finds tax harmony The European Commission yesterday heralded a new approach to tax harmonisation by adopting a recommendation aimed at ending discrimination against non-resident taxpayers. The Commission is calling on member states to grant the same tax benefits to 200,000-300,000 EU citizens working beyond the borders of their home country as they currently do to residents. Many cross-border workers are unable to claim family and married couple tax allowances at home or abroad. The Commission has asked governments to bring national legislation and bilateral tax agreements with other EU members into line with the recommendation by 1995. If national rules are not harmonised, a formal directive could be proposed. Brussels will continue to pursue governments through the European Court of Justice, using the recommendation as a basis for complaints. Senior Commission officials said yesterday the approach was one way of unblocking proposals on tax, which require unanimous approval from member states. Such measures are often opposed by governments which fear losing revenue and sovereignty over tax matters. A broad recommendation could be used, for example, to speed harmonisation of tax treatment for small and medium-sized companies. A similar proposal on non-resident taxation was first proposed by the Commission in 1979 and held up by member states until last year, when it was abandoned. Court cases against individual governments were hampered by the Commission's lack of clear principles about how to harmonise such taxes. The Commission is recommending that citizens who receive at least 75 per cent of their income in a member state other than their home country should be eligible for residents' benefits in the state where they work. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, tax commissioner, said yesterday the proposal would benefit EU citizens who live on one side of a border and work on the other, and those who take advantage of the single market by working away from home.</p>

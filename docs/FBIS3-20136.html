			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has reiterated that he is  opposed to any changes in the confidence-building measures  [CBM's] that favor the Greek Cypriots. We will not accept the  addition of new elements to the CBM's just to satisfy the Greek  Cypriots, he stressed, adding that the Turkish Cypriots expect  the promises made in the first parameters to be brought to life.  The negotiations can continue only with this understanding, he  added.    In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency] on the  latest political developments, President Denktas pointed out  that Greek Cypriot propagandists and sympathizers began to  mislead the world about the CBM's. The aim, he stressed, is to  influence the UN Security Council to pass an anti-Turkish  Cypriot resolution.    Denktas said: The Greek Cypriots try to make it look as if  we got the close to 20 changes we asked for and now have the  gall to insist on a couple of remaining points. This is not  true.    The president stressed that the Turkish Cypriots expect the  parameters cited in the UN secretary general's reports and  affirmed by the experts' reports to be maintained, and the  rights and powers promised to the Turkish Cypriot side be  brought to life. He said: The Turkish Cypriot side is opposed  to any changes in the CBM's in favor of the Greek Cypriots. We  will not agree to the addition of new elements to the CBM's just  to satisfy the Greek Cypriots.    Denktas explained that while the Turkish Cypriots were  waiting for the advantages cited in the first parameters to be  brought to life, they were told that the Greek Cypriot side does  not agree to this or that point or that they cannot be forced to  accept this or that point. In this way, he said, no efforts  were made to bring to life the rights of the Turkish Cypriots.    Denktas charged that even such proposals as allowing the  Turkish Cypriots to work in Maras [Varosha] went up in smoke.  He added: If the promises made in the first parameters are  properly assessed, it will become clear that the Turkish  Cypriots were not given 20 additional rights, as is being  alleged.    Denktas said that the negotiations can continue only with  this understanding. It is not we who are creating difficulties  in the negotiations, he said, but those who keep on changing the  CBM's to favor the Greek Cypriots.</p>

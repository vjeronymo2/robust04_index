			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: UK interest rate plans prove final straw - Talk has revived of a 'fast track' to Emu, with a few currencies creating monetary union ahead of schedule THE Irish government fought valiantly for five months to stave off devaluation of the punt, but late last week Dublin finally threw in the towel. The UK government's decision last Tuesday to cut interest rates by 1 percentage point to 6 per cent was a blow; but more damaging were reports that British ministers were contemplating further rate reductions to stoke economic recovery. According to European monetary officials, the prospect of even lower UK interest rate cuts - plus the likely further weakening of sterling - persuaded the Irish they could no longer hold on. Reluctantly they requested a meeting of the EC's monetary committee in Brussels on Saturday to propose a 10 per cent devaluation of the Irish punt against all the currencies inside the exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The meeting on Saturday lasted just under four hours. Irish officials who earlier had been dropping hints about leaving the ERM temporarily, like the British and Italians in the wake of last September's currency crisis, were bruised but satisfied. A 10 per cent devaluation should help restore the loss in competitiveness caused by sterling's decline. Because one third of Ireland's trade is with Britain, some EC officials are tempted to view the punt as a special case. They argue that its problems are largely unrelated to the crisis inside the ERM, whose grid of fixed but adjustable exchange rate parities is intended to serve as the vehicle for European monetary union set down in the Maastricht treaty. In fact, says one official, the punt was under attack well before sterling began to slide last year. Central banks, operating under ERM rules, intervened heavily on the punt's behalf; the Belgian central bank bought Dollars 1bn-worth of punts in three hours one Friday morning last year. The Irish government did its best, raising interest rates sky-high to deter speculators; but the punt was never viewed as a fully paid-up member of the premier currency league, headed by Germany, France, the Benelux countries, and possibly Denmark. Thus it is possible to argue that the punt's devaluation - following the floating of the lira and sterling and the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo - completes a general realignment of weaker ERM currencies which should have happened before black September. But the Irish can still argue that the system has let them down. Only two weeks ago EC finance ministers issued a statement welcoming the new Dublin government's determination to defend the punt's existing party inside the ERM as 'entirely justified'. Elsewhere, senior German officials have regularly appeared on Irish television or issued statements praising the government's anti-inflation credentials and dismissing a punt devaluation as unwarranted. These statements were made at Dublin's request. That they failed in the end to count is unnerving - which may explain why some observers in Brussels are convinced that fresh speculative attacks inside the ERM are inevitable, the obvious target being the franc. This threat has revived talk of a 'fast track' to Emu, whereby a nucleus of hard-core currencies would create some form of monetary union ahead of schedule. 'The possibility of devaluation of the franc is too big, it's too destabilising,' said a diplomat who described a putative Franco-German initiative as 'not the first option' but one designed to 'save the ERM and Emu'. According to several officials in Brussels, Germany and France are considering how to take further steps toward monetary co-operation to restore credibility to Emu. These moves would not necessarily amount to a full union; but they would aim to impress markets that the two allies were serious about Emu, perhaps by narrowing the margin of fluctuation between the franc and D-Mark or even declaring the intention to swap observers on the boards of the Bundesbank and a future independent Bank of France. Paris and Bonn deny concrete proposals are in the offing, but last week Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, took the talk of an accelerated Emu seriously enough to set his formidable presence against it, on the grounds that it was not compatible with Maastricht. And the venue he chose to deliver his speech was where the talk is loudest: Brussels.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Long haul ahead for Canadian railways - A spate of US mergers has increased pressure on CN and CP The harsh realities of the North American transport business are catching up fast with the Canadian National Railway System. Hobbled for years by regulators and trade unions, CN is the federal government's biggest crown corporation and has a reputation as one of Canada's most bureaucratic organisations. It lost CDollars 1.1bn (USDollars 820m) between 1991 and 1993 and is weighed down by debts of almost CDollars 2bn. However, recent events have cleared the way for the biggest upheaval in CN's 75-year history. Its main rival, the investor-owned Canadian Pacific, has offered to pay CDollars 1.4bn for CN's rail operations east of Winnipeg and Chicago. In response to the CP bid, the government has set up a parliamentary task force to investigate the 'commercialisation' (privatisation) of CN. The committee will hold hearings across the country and is due to report before the end of the year. In the meantime the two men who will probably play the most decisive role in deciding CN's future have indicated that they favour radical change. 'The time has come for a decision,' Mr Doug Young, transport minister, said last month. 'We have to face today's economic realities and ensure that over the long term CN becomes a competitive and efficient operation.' Mr Paul Tellier, CN's chief executive, said in a speech earlier this year that 'the train is still seen as a symbol of our country's glorious past. But we must focus on measures to develop its full potential.' The background to the CP offer and the hint of privatisation is CN's inability to keep pace with the fierce competition and aggressive cost-cutting which have marked the recent history of North American railways. Canadian railways' share of domestic goods traffic has dropped from 70 per cent to 28 per cent since the early 1960s as more shippers have turned to road and air transport. The story is different in the US, where the railways carry more than two-thirds of the container traffic from the Far East to central Canada, and have more traffic per kilometre of track and per employee than CN or CP. They also benefit from more friendly government policies and a more co-operative workforce. All in all, says Mr Tellier, it costs CDollars 10,000 more to run a train from Vancouver to Toronto than from Seattle to Chicago. US railways are far ahead of Canada in adopting more flexible labour practices, such as switching from three-man to two-man train crews. Mr James Higgins, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, says that Canada's powerful rail unions and antiquated labour practices are likely to discourage any US railway from making a bid for either CN or CP. A spate of mergers among US railways is likely to put even more pressure on the Canadian companies. In one such move, Conrail and Norfolk Southern are reported to be negotiating a merger that would form a regional railway criss-crossing the eastern half of the US. Such an arrangement would worry the Canadian railways, whose main markets are also in the north-east of the continent. The two Canadian companies have launched a series of initiatives in an attempt to make themselves more attractive to shippers, especially foreign ones who have a choice between channelling their goods through a US or a Canadian port. CN is building a CDollars 200m tunnel under the St Clair River between Ontario and Michigan which will accommodate double-stack container trains and cut 12 hours off the journey from Toronto or Montreal to Chicago. It has also forged marketing and operating alliances with US railways and trucking companies. But Mr Tellier has indicated that his top priorities are to improve productivity and to find a solution for the loss-making eastern Canadian operations. Others have begun to question whether Canada can afford the luxury of two national railways whose lines run virtually side by side in some parts of the country. CN and CP have lost almost CDollars 2bn combined on their eastern operations over the past five years. CN's eastern network contributes about 47 per cent of its revenues, but almost all its profits come from western Canada, where the bulk goods which make up most of its traffic - such as coal, grain and sulphur - are less suited to competition from trucks. CN's plans have provoked strong opposition from trade unions, which face extensive job cuts and demands for more flexible work practices. One union representing more than a third of CN's 23,000 unionised workers is on the point of calling a strike following a breakdown in contract talks. CN's railway operations have recently returned to profitability, with second-quarter net earnings of CDollars 113m. This has led the unions to claim that the company's problems are largely over, but management counters that the improvement is due solely to the economic upturn and the company is still constrained by structural problems. It will soon be up to the government to choose which side has the stronger argument.</p>

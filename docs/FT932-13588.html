			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Dealers disappointed by slight reduction in Bundesbank repo THE Bundesbank yesterday disappointed European government bond markets with the announcement of a tiny easing at its weekly repo and some unfavourable economic news. German government bonds fell back during the day, pulling the other European markets lower. The Bundesbank said the lowest allocated rate at its regular securities repurchase tender had dropped to 8.09 per cent from 8.11 per cent, which confirmed the recent very gradual easing in rates by the German central bank. The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM60.6bn of 14-day securities repurchase funds, representing a net injection of DM5.8bn in liquidity. Dealers had expected a drain of funds and a bigger reduction in the repo rate, and the bund market fell back in the morning after the repo results were announced. Further disappointing news came with the announcement that the M3 money supply aggregate expanded at a seasonally-adjusted, annualised 3.2 per cent during the first three months of the year, having contracted in recent months. The central bank reported a February M3 contraction of 0.3 per cent following January's contraction of 2.4 per cent. Dealers said the market was particularly worried by the acceleration in bank lending. Supply fears contributed to the market's doldrums after Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, was reported as saying the federal budget deficit would be slightly more than DM65bn, compared with a DM39bn shortfall in 1992. The size of the deficit has raised worries in the market about the amount of borrowing required. In spite of the news, some dealers expressed faint hopes that the Bundesbank might announce at cut in the Lombard rate at today's council meeting. The Lombard rate - now 9 per cent - acts as a ceiling on overnight money rates, while the 7.5 per cent discount rate provides the effective floor to call money. The Liffe bund future, which opened at 96.08, fell from its high of 96.13 to a low of 95.66 before ending at around 95.68 in heavy volume. UK government bonds lost between  1/8 and  1/4 of a point yesterday in the middle and longer-dated maturities, taking their cue from the German bond market. Some of the sluggishness was attributed to residual disappointment over the March public sector borrowing requirement and the rise in inflation, announced in the past few days. The gilt market will be closely watching today's labour market figures, including average earnings and unit labour costs, for positive news. Dealers added that some positioning was taking place ahead of the April 28 gilt auction. JAPANESE government bonds rallied as the yen reached an historic high against the dollar in Tokyo trading and the stock market continued to slip back. The yen touched 109.90 to the dollar, ending at 110.35 in Tokyo. The strength of the yen against the dollar raised hopes of monetary easing, dealers said. The fall in the stock market, which closed lower for the fourth consecutive day, also helped to lift bond futures. The Nikkei average index closed down 55.42 points at 19,773.01. The futures contract, which was heavily traded, rose from its opening price of 109.29 to a high of 109.45 before ending the day at 109.40. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 bond moved in a range of 4.19 to 4.235 per cent, and closed at 4.225 per cent against its opening level of 4.205 per cent. Dealers said the new supply of 10-year bonds at Tuesday's auction was probably the main explanation for the underperformance of the cash market. US Treasury prices firmed slightly in dull trading yesterday as the market patiently awaited more news on the economy. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 104 7/8, yielding 6.740 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also up  1/16 at 100 1/4, to yield 3.722 per cent. The day opened quietly, with dealers and investors trading cautiously ahead of the next set of economic data - today's weekly jobless claims report. The only action in the morning was the Fed's buying of two-, three-, five- and seven-year notes, apparently on behalf of the Bank of Japan. The Japanese central bank had intervened earlier in the week to support the US currency against the soaring yen. It was believed yesterday that the BoJ was using those newly-acquired dollars to buy Treasury securities, via the Fed. In the afternoon, the Treasury announced it would sell Dollars 15.25bn in two-year and Dollars 11bn in five-year notes next week. The figures surprised analysts, who had been expecting the Treasury to cut the size of each issue.</p>

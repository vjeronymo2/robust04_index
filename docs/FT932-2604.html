			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Cabinet agrees tough limits on public spending THE CABINET yesterday set the toughest limits for at least 15 years on public expenditure in an attempt to curb Britain's public borrowing, presaging a summer of attrition between ministers over tax and spending policies. As the cabinet agreed spending ceilings that should see public expenditure falling as a share of national income over the next three financial years, Mr John Major urged cabinet colleagues to 'sing from the same hymn sheet' on tax policy and manifesto commitments. His instruction was a scarcely-veiled rebuff to Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who have clashed publicly over whether income tax increases should be on the government's agenda. The prime minister sought to minimise further damaging cabinet splits by seeking collective agreement on 'new control totals' for the three financial years from 1994-95 to 1996-97. However, the deal disappointed some Conservative rightwingers looking for a firm grip on spending rather than tax increases. Mr John Townend, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, said low inflation meant spending would remain broadly unchanged in real terms. But Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, said 'difficult decisions' would be needed. The totals foreshadow a further tight squeeze on public sector pay but cabinet ministers have still to reach agreement on whether to extend the 1.5 per cent ceiling on pay rises for another year. Broader and more flexible limits on the total pay bill for public sector workers could emerge as a compromise option. Other targets will include the budgets of the Welsh and Scottish offices, regarded as the most interventionist in Whitehall. Several cabinet ministers are lobbying hard for still fiercer controls on local authority spending and on the Environment Department's housing budget. Prison building and overseas aid budgets will also be under pressure. However, Mr Major wants manifesto commitments honoured. In the Commons he emphasised that National Health Service resources would increase. Previous spending rounds where spending totals have been set for three years in advance have seen figures for later years revised substantially upwards. But after Mr Clarke's assesment of the economic and fiscal outlook, the cabinet agreed no change in the new control totals of Pounds 253.6bn and Pounds 263.3bn set last summer for 1994-5 and 1995-96. Real growth in the new control total for 1996-97 will be restricted to 1 per cent or below. The totals exclude cyclical spending on benefits and debt interest. A cabinet statement said the agreement was 'intended to keep real growth in spending over the whole period within the underlying growth rate in the economy. It will also make a contribution to reducing the fiscal deficit in the medium term to accompany the increases in taxes announced in the last Budget'. Clarke seeks investment, Page 9</p>

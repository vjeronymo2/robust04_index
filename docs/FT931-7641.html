			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to 'welcome' foreign oil cash - Local funding is insufficient to revive the sector 'I WELCOME foreign investment,' says Mr Vaguit Alekperov, appointed head of Rosneft, the Russian state oil company now being created to manage the industry. His direct endorsement of overseas investment will be good news for the increasingly sceptical and discouraged foreign oil majors who have found getting more than a toe-hold in the Russian oil sector arduous and time consuming. Mr Alekperov, still head of Lukoil, one of the new vertically-integrated oil companies, sees the new state corporation as 'a central agency permitting effective management of the industry' during the next three years, when the industry will be transformed into a series of joint stock companies the bulk of the shares in which will be held by the state, through Rosneft. The new corporation will replace Rosneftigaz, widely seen as an ineffective voluntary agency grouping the oil production associations, but constantly undermined by the energy ministry and other state bodies. 'We will be a managerial body responsible for the enterprises' performance. Our job is to create a series of vertically integrated companies, and we will be present on the boards of every one of them' - except for Lukoil, which will remain independent. The new state boss knows the condition of the industry he is trying to revive - its production plunging; its easily recoverable reserves mostly exhausted; its technological capacity and funds insufficient to sustain the vast investment programme needed to revive its fortunes. Hence his welcome for foreign companies. He even - cautiously - says that Rosneft may act as a guarantor for their investments 'at some time in the future' - a role the state itself now refuses to take. He believes, however, 'that we are past the worst point. The shock came in 1990 and 1991, when investments dropped sharply and when the debt to the enterprises rose to Rbs400bn (about Pounds 600m at the present free market exchange rate). But now people are learning to reorganise and live with the new conditions'. The legacy, however, has been a broken chain of production and supply, with producers unable to find refiners, refiners unable to obtain crude and garages closing for lack of supply. 'The chain has to be re-established: there is a lack of responsibility now at all levels. Our aim is to create a structure which will be responsible for the final result - gasoline at the filling station.' The contest for exploitation rights in the autonomous district of Khanty-Mansinsk, in the Tyumen region of Western Siberia, - where deposits are estimated at some 7bn tonnes - provides an example of how Mr Alekperov expects Rosneft to operate. The State Geology Committee, with the Khanty-Mansinsk authorities, have opened the tender to foreign companies: Rosneft will not be involved at this stage, but may come in later as a bidder for exploitation rights. Local rule seems, for the moment, strong. Western oil companies, which include most of the majors who have been to the region say that the first offer was for a 30 per cent stake in the field - an unattractive offer to most, especially when the basic petroleum law has yet to be adopted. Asked if he feared the interference of the state - a fate which befell Rosneftigaz - he said that 'the energy ministry is concerned with legislation and regulation of all the energy industry. We are the managers, there should be no confusion'. A bold word from a Russian manager.</p>

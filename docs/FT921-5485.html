			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: Premiums for life salesmen Sir, I fear your article 'Increased share of premiums for life salesmen' (February 26) may have had the effect of misleading some of your readers. The story correctly draws the distinction between independent financial advisers and agents who are tied to individual insurance companies. However, the Lautro survey on which you were reporting clearly distinguishes between organisations with a separate mainstream business (such as building societies) who are tied to one insurance company, and individual company representatives, such as a life office's full-time direct sales force - who are often described as life salesmen and saleswomen. Lautro's survey expressly excluded any data relating to company representatives. To refer to staff in offices such as building societies or estate agents as 'life salesmen' is not accurate, and could well confuse the reader. The matter concerns me because direct sales forces invariably tend to receive considerably less commission than that paid to both tied agents and independent financial advisers, and it would be unfortunate if your article failed to make itself clearly understood in that respect.

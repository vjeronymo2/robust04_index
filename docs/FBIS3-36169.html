He said these  reports meant sensation-seeking and attempts to pass "white for  black".    Chiefs of the administration now draft a resolution  connected  with the Russian law on the state border. Jurists consider the  proposal to allocate in a number of districts of the Sakhalin  region five kilometre frontier belts with special regulations  for the stay of Russian and foreign citizens, but not the  prohibition of their stay.    It is yet early to dwell on specific features of the  document. One thing is certain: it will be fully in keeping with  the law on the Russian border.    The Sakhalin governor himself favours the freedom of travel  of citizens in the territory of their country in accordance with  accepted norms.</p>

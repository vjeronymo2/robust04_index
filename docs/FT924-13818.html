			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / AWD bought by defence company AWD, THE former Bedford trucks business that went into receivership in June, has been sold for an undisclosed sum to a subsidiary of Marshall of Cambridge, the privately owned UK aerospace and defence support services contractor. The purchase will almost certainly mark the end of truck making at AWD's Dunstable plant after more than 50 years - but it also means that the long Bedford tradition as a manufacturer of both military and civilian trucks is likely to be preserved and strengthened. AWD's product designs and most of its assets are being transferred to Marshall SPV (special production vehicles). Originally established as Marshall of Cambridge (Engineering) to make vehicle bodies and exploit the international market for specialist military vehicles such as field ambulances, it changed its name to Marshall SPV earlier this year. It has been seeking to extend its activities in the civilian vehicles field and its product range now includes refuse disposal vehicles, single-decker buses, and car transporters and trailers. Recently, it also acquired Carlisle, the Birmingham-based bus maker. Marshall, a reticent company that prefers to conduct its affairs out of the public spotlight, employs 2,500 people - mostly at its sprawling airfield-based headquarters near Cambridge. Under its purchase agreement with Mr Tony Thompson and Mr Roger Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick, the joint receivers, Marshall is buying AWD's product designs, global spare parts business, order book and the rights to the AWD and Bedford names. It is taking a short lease on the 45-acre Dunstable plant, where the receivers have been employing 150 former AWD workers to build about five trucks a week. AWD had stopped making trucks for several months before the receivers moved in. 'However, we wanted to sell AWD as a going concern, got some orders ourselves - mostly from the military and overseas - and were able to restart production,' Mr Thompson said yesterday. Marshall is to employ some of the Dunstable workers on a temporary basis, but is expected to move production to its Cambridge site in the longer term. Commenting on the takeover, Mr Bernard Williams, managing director of SPV, said: 'In AWD we have acquired products with a tremendous reputation in the specialist market for four-wheel-drive trucks. We believe that there is synergy between the AWD products and Marshall SPV which will prove of great benefit to us with our plans for further expansion in civil and military markets worldwide.' AWD, then named Bedford Trucks, was bought from General Motors in 1987 for about Pounds 20m by Mr David Brown, a Yorkshire entrepreneur. Under GM's ownership, Bedford had been losing Pounds  1/2 m a week in a plant that had the capacity to produce 60,000 trucks a year and which, up to the start of the 1980s, had employed 6,000 people. At its peak under Mr Brown's ownership AWD was employing more than 1,300, and he spoke of creating a company employing more than 2,000 people and building 10,000 trucks annually.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bela Kadar, minister for international </F> economic relations, by Sandor T. Bekes; place and date not  given: "Bela Kadar on the NGKM's Four Years -- We Will Repeat  Our Forefathers' Country-Renewing Activities"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bekes] You have been  leading the Ministry of International Economic Relations [NGKM]  for four years. During this time, the activities of the  ministry have been repeatedly attacked from time to time, now  again by the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Certain  opposition politicians have stated that the NGKM should be wound  up. What are your views on these accusations?    [Kadar] I have indeed been heading the NGKM's activities as  minister since 1990 in implementing the change of the foreign  economic system and emphasis, and the tasks of opening up the  economy to the world. According to international assessments,  Hungary has solved these problems more successfully than some  other countries in the same situation. This is reflected in the  essential elements of our economic diplomacy negotiations, in  our foreign trade performance, in the number of enterprises by  foreigners -- some 1,800 foreign ventures were operating in  Hungary at the end of 1989 and 19,000 at the end of 1993 --  capital investment -- at the moment, foreign capital investment  in Hungary exceeds $7 billion, which is 60 percent of the  foreign capital invested in the East- Central European region --  and, in general, in the smooth operation of the ministry. After  all this, I wonder why certain political forces and politicians,  who are noticeably annoyed about the country's successes, have  been wanting to eliminate the NGKM with a stubborn consistency.  We are now dismissing the statements that are made regularly  every month, showing that those who make them want to eliminate  a professional culture. Even the most obstinate of these people  have to admit that the ministry is doing a good job and its  elimination would not result in budget savings. Therefore,  "just because" remains the most convincing reason for  eliminating the ministry. It is especially interesting to hear  this from those who had very different views on this issue a few  years before the elections. [passage omitted]    [Bekes] Can you please give a general assessment on  Hungary's foreign economic performance over the past four years?    [Kadar] It should never be allowed to assess the foreign  economy on the basis of subjective views because statistical  information is available. As a result of the change of the  regime, the U.S. dollar value of exports of the former CEMA  countries was reduced by 10 to 60 percent between 1989 and 1992.  In that period, only Hungary of the former socialist countries  managed to exceed the peak export level of the 1980's. The  exceptionally long Western recession, the decrease in Russian  imports, the consequences of the south Slav [Yugoslav] war, and  a Hungarian economic policy that had very little support for the  foreign economy, caused a halt to the Hungarian export offensive  in 1993. Our exports calculated in U.S dollars decreased by 17  percent. The export-stimulating measures taken by the Hungarian  Government in September 1993 have brought the improvement of the  economy's competitiveness to the forefront. As a result of  this, the 27-percent fall in the first half of 1993 had finally  been dampened by the end of the year. In my view, the  assumption is not without basis that these -- rather limited --  measures, in addition to slowing the decrease in 1993, have  actually helped exports to start to increase in the first  quarter of 1994. The fact is that certain members of the mass  media who only yearn for bad news do not even bat an eyelid in  saying that it is all success propaganda when I note that  monthly exports in dollars exceeded the monthly average of the  first three quarters of 1993 by 15 percent in November and 20  percent in December 1993. [passage omitted]    [Bekes] You have said it many times -- also at the Uruguay  Round of the GATT talks -- that the central axis of the world  economy has moved away from Europe. What are the prospects of  Hungarian foreign trade in the Pacific region and what can we  expect on the traditional European markets?    [Kadar] For almost two decades, Hungary has been struggling  with the problem that the focal point of the world economy and  world trade increases have been shifted further away from  Hungary to countries in the Pacific and the Far East. The  resources and experience of the new domestic foreign trade  salesmen and entrepreneurs do not yet make it possible for us to  rely more on the Far Eastern markets, which are expanding more  rapidly than the average. Naturally, Hungarian foreign economic  policy has already been doing all it can to promote this, but we  must not forget about the realities. In Hungarian foreign  trade, the proportion of foreign economic cooperation with the  world's most dynamically developing area will for a long time  continue to reach only a few percent. Our place is in Europe.  Some 90 percent of Hungarian foreign trade is with the  countries of old Europe. In this area, it is a positive result  that, except for Serbia and Montenegro, we managed to halt the  decrease in turnover with our neighbors in 1993. In Russia and  the CIS countries, the general crisis and slump are still having  their effects. In the near future, we will extend our system of  free trade agreements to Slovenia. We also assume that the  improving economic situation in Western Europe, the lifting of  the market restraints affecting Hungarian goods, and our free  trade agreements will contribute to an increased Hungarian  foreign economy and exports. The current major proportions show  that, in 1993, some 47 percent of our exports went to the  countries of the European Union [EU] and 14 percent to the  countries of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]. Our  free trade agreement with EFTA has been in force for six months  now. If the EU accepts Austria and the Scandinavian countries  as members in 1995, nearly two-thirds of Hungary's exports will  be going to the EU. This clearly indicates to what the  Hungarian economy and society must adjust. [passage omitted]</p>

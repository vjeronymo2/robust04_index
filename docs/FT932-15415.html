			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Rise in confidence lifts hopes of upturn THE UK can look forward to an early economic recovery as sales and new order books pick up and companies hire more staff, a business confidence survey says today. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company, reports that six out of 10 businesses expect sales to increase in the second quarter, against only two expecting them to fall. The findings are significantly more optimistic than in the previous quarter and will add to a growing impression that the economy has reached a turning-point. House prices have perked up recently, while car registrations for the first quarter rose sharply compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, domestic air travel showed its steepest rise for more than a year during March, indicating greater confidence among UK businesses which buy most of the tickets for internal flights. The latest traffic figures from the BAA, which operates London's airports and three in Scotland, show a 5.5 per cent increase in domestic passenger traffic last month compared with March 1992. Heathrow airport showed the biggest gain in the south with an 8.3 per cent year-on-year rise in total passengers to 3.8m last month. On the foreign exchanges the pound was stronger against the D-Mark, closing 1 1/4 pfennigs higher at DM2.4625. In New York, it finished at DM2.46025. Share prices were also more buoyant. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose 25 to 2,846.8. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which interviewed just under 2,000 managing directors between March 17 and 31, reported that expectations about employment have improved. More companies nationwide plan to hire staff than to fire them, with optimism particularly high in London, the south-east, the east, Wales and the north. The outlook is brightest in the service sector, with 35 per cent reporting an intention to hire more staff against 19 per cent expecting to cut back. Although pressures on prices remain weak, the survey suggested that the deflationary momentum of the economy was slowing. A higher proportion of companies than in the previous quarter plan to pass on price increases to customers, according to the survey. Half the companies, however, expect to hold prices at last year's levels. Official figures yesterday confirmed that producer price inflation remains subdued although the effects of sterling's devaluation are continuing to put pressure on manufacturers. The Central Statistical Office reported that in March the prices of manufactured goods leaving UK factories rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent on the month. This left the annual rate of increase unchanged at 3.7 per cent. However, raw materials and fuel prices rose by 8.3 per cent in the year to March, the highest rate of increase since July 1987. The biggest jump in optimism was recorded among businesses in the service sector. The optimism index, the percentage of respondents forecasting an increase in sales minus the percentage expecting a decrease, leapt from 25 to 52. Confidence in the construction sector also rose.

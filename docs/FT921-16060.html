			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Back to basics for the key to survival - Big issues facing small firms The new year has started on a sombre note for Britain's smaller companies. There will be little respite, in the first few months at least, from the continuing battle to withstand the pressures of the recession. Even if the economy starts to improve, the likelihood is that failure rates will continue to rise for a further 12 to 18 months. For some firms, an upturn in their order books may just make matters worse. Financing new orders could prove the last straw for overstretched businesses. The first rule for 1992 will, therefore, be to keep a close eye on cash flow. Businesses will need to review every step in their sales and production cycle to see if the time taken can be reduced, if each stage could be started earlier or the system reorganised to limit the amount of money tied up. Success, or survival, will depend very much on this return to the basics but prospects for the small firms sector are also subject to other influences. Government policies, the activities of business support organisations and the effectiveness of the small business lobby groups all play their part. The key issues which will determine the prosperity of the small firms sector in 1992 and beyond are: The attitude of the banks. Many of the large banks have produced 'business charters' intended to lay down clear guidelines for their dealings with business clients. But suspicions still remain among small business organisations about the degree to which the banks have changed their attitudes. The large provisions which the banks have made on loan losses have made them tighten up on their lending policies. Just how the banks will reconcile the need to avoid losses with their desire to present a more kindly face to their small business customers has yet to be revealed. The next 12 months will show whether they are capable of establishing a new relationship. Government-backed schemes to channel funds to small businesses. Several small firms' lobby groups have been lobbying for the creation of a special fund to provide low-cost, long-term loans to smaller businesses. The lobbyists believe government is now more positive about their proposals and they hope for action in the Conservative party's election manifesto. Traditionally, however, the government has been sceptical of any special form of small business finance and there have been no official signals of a change of heart. Meanwhile, the Loan Guarantee Scheme, which guarantees most of the risk of a bank loan to businesses which cannot meet normal security criteria, is undergoing review. The guarantee scheme has not turned out to be a particularly popular means by which small firms raise finance. Nor is it a source of cheap funding. The cost of the guarantee means it is usually more expensive than a normal bank loan. Government policy on late payments. The past year has seen growing pressure from credit rating groups, debt collection agencies and the banks for action on the late payments question. Small firms in the UK wait on average 81 days to be paid, far longer than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. The government has for many years resisted a change in the law but its attempts at exhortation have clearly failed. The clamour for legislative action, or for a change in court procedures for the collection of debt, is increasing. The administration of VAT. Dealing with VAT is a significant burden for many businesses and the penalties for making a mistake - let alone deliberate attempts to avoid payment - are severe. Customs &amp; Excise is currently reviewing suggestions for an easing of its 'serious misdeclaration' penalty and business and accountancy organisations hope a less draconian regime will emerge later this year. A second VAT issue with important implications for business is the decision to decentralise the handling of routine queries to regional VAT offices. Customs believes this will speed up the process of providing answers but some business organisations fear it will lead to less consistency. The effects of decentralisation will show through as the year progresses. Training and Enterprise Councils and chambers of commerce. These two important providers of business support services are both at cross-roads. Many of the TECs are still struggling to get established and to devise an effective network of small business support in their area. They face the prospect of further upheaval later this year when the civil servants who make up the bulk of the staff in many TECs decide whether to opt for the private sector terms and conditions being offered by the TECs or whether to move back into another civil service department. If too many leave, the ability of the TECs to provide services will be hit. Whatever happens to civil service staffers, many of the TECs will have to readjust their approach to take into account the realities of their local economies and of travel-to-work areas, rather than the administrative boundaries on which they are based. Some TECs are already starting to work together but many more will need to do so if they are to provide a useful response to local and regional needs. One existing business support network with which the TECs will need to co-operate is the chambers of commerce. Talks are already under way between the two groups. But the chambers themselves are also on the threshold of change as they beef themselves up to provide a more effective service to the business community. How successful they are remains to be seen. Quality. Businesses will have to decide whether they need to register for the British quality assurance standard BS5750. Some firms will have no choice because large companies are starting to insist that all their suppliers conform to BS5750. Registering to this standard can be costly and time-consuming while the benefits only show through over the medium to long term. There is some pressure for a simplified version to be devised for the very small business but many companies will simply have to grit their teeth. Finally, 1992 itself - the year of the single European market. In fact, the barriers are not due to come down until December 31 and many may take well into 1993 to be dismantled. Surveys indicate that many smaller British companies have still not realised the likely implications of the single market for them. No one can predict with any degree of accuracy what a single market will do for many of the sectors, such as services, where small firms are particularly active. But there are few areas of business life which have not already been touched by one European Community directive or another. Even those companies which have decided that there is nothing they can do to prepare themselves in advance need to keep a close eye on the single market as it develops. Staying close to their customers, their suppliers and their competitors is likely to give them an earlier indication of change than any formal sources of advice.</p>

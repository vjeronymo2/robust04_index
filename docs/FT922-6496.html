			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Brazil and Colombia stir coffee THE COFFEE markets in both London and New York tumbled yesterday after moving slowly ahead throughout the early part of the week after talks between Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers, about possible action to halt the slide in prices. The talks were initially seen as bullish, but the details of what was agreed when the two countries met at the beginning of the week have been hard to come by. In early trading yesterday New York's nearby July arabica contract fell by more than 2 cents a lb as uncertainty over the producers' position grew. The London July robusta contract closed at Dollars 732, down Dollars 17 on the day and Dollars 2 on the week. Yesterday's fall was boosted by news that Costa Rica was resuming exports. Ironically when it suspended exports on May 12 in protest against low world prices there was no market reaction on the upside. A report that the Mexican coffee industry still favours a free market, coupled with a statement in support of the free market by the US National Coffee Association added to the bearish tone. Brazil and Colombia are thought to be aiming for a transitional accord at the September meeting of the International Coffee Organisation in September. They have been spurred into action following the unexpectedly sharp fall in coffee prices after an indecisive ICO meeting last month. But the two giants of the coffee world are treading warily because they do not want to upset either their fellow producers or the consumers. Mr Jorge Cardenas, of Colombia's National Coffee Growers Federation, said on Thursday that nothing had been signed by the two countries, according to a Reuters report. 'We have some documents as reference points,' he said. 'But obviously we don't want to turn those documents into a concrete proposal for the other producers  . but to start a dialogue with them regarding the same issues and to reach a consensus, one as open as possible.' Next week Brazil and Colombia will join the other coffee producing countries for a series of meetings at the ICO headquarters in London. Their ideas, which are thought to include a world export quota level of 64m bags (60kgs each) to counteract large consumer stocks, are expected to be presented informally. Cocoa prices have taken a downward path again following a cut to 107,000 tonnes in the estimated 1991-92 world supply-demand deficit by Gill &amp; Duffus, the London trader. Production is put at 2.26m tonnes, down from 2.55m the previous year, but consumption is estimated to be virtually unchanged at 2.34m tonnes, mainly because of a collapse in grindings in the former Soviet Union to a mere 25,000 tonnes. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said the market was worried more by the slow growth in consumption than the decline in the deficit. The point when stocks were drawn down to the level where a bull market could take off appeared to have been postponed at least until 1994-95. The London July contract touched a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 548 a tonne yesterday before closing at Pounds 556, down Pounds 22 on the week. The London Metal Exchange base metals markets have had a quiet week, although volatility in the tin market, which hit a 19-month high on Thursday, has provided some interest. Yesterday cash tin closed at Dollars 6,190 a tonne, unchanged on the week, as the market erased earlier steep losses incurred after a rise of 665 tonnes in LME warehouse stocks. The London bullion market has also been quiet during the week in which two important annual books were published - Johnson Matthey's Platinum 1992 and Gold Fields Mineral Services' Gold 1992. The platinum market regarded Johnson Matthey's publication as bullish for the market with its predictions that exports from the former Soviet Union would fall, Japanese demand would hold, and problems with South African production would persist. Platinum was fixed yesterday at Dollars 365.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 4.25 on the day and Dollars 7.25 on the week, and the highest fix for three months. Heavy trade buying pushed it through the Dollars 364-Dollars 365 resistance area, dealers said. The gold market closed yesterday at Dollars 337.70 a troy ounce, down Dollars 1.70 on the week, and was described by one analyst yesterday as 'a haven of inertia' - a fitting tribute given that nine weeks ago it closed at Dollars 339.05.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +6,050 to 1,239,500 Copper       -475 to   265,725 Lead          -25 to   136,650 Nickel        +30 to    27,390 Zinc         +800 to   256,950 Tin          +665 to    12,775  -------------------------------------</p>

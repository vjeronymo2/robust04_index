			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US poised to announce oilseeds sanctions after election THE US could announce punitive tariffs on European Community goods as early as November 4, the day after the US presidential election, the US indicated yesterday. Most sanctions, in retaliation over EC oilseed subsidies, would initially target French and German goods. If the US goes ahead the move could trigger a global trade war. Retaliation would mark an end to protracted efforts by US and EC negotiators to resolve disputes on subsidised farm trade. It could jeopardise hopes for a wider agreement on trade liberalisation as part of the Uruguay Round. The EC has been told that a date has been set for imposition of sanctions. Telephone conversations between US and EC negotiators, since talks broke off last week, have produced little progress, the US says. Both sides have confirmed that the US has offered to move towards the implicit EC oilseeds production ceiling of 9.5m tonnes. But EC negotiators have refused to meet US demands for binding restrictions on oilseeds output  -at least none above the mechanisms in the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC's farm commissioner, said the EC was willing to carry into international agreement the CAP reform provisions on restraining oilseeds and cereal output, which are already Community law. 'I don't know what other assurances they need,' Mr MacSharry added. A senior US official said: 'We have sent proposal after proposal to Europe, but we don't see a lot happening. We see proposals coming back in forms they know are unacceptable to us.' Mr MacSharry was standing by to fly to the US, but Mr Edward Madigan, his US counterpart, was understood to have no plans to meet him, because the EC was 'still in a backsliding mode'. The EC has told the US that it cannot step outside what the 12 agreed unanimously in the new CAP, which sets severe targets for price and production cuts. Only in this way can France, the main opponent of a Gatt deal, be held to its undertakings. Within the US administration it has been agreed to aim a first 'tranche' of sanctions - prohibitive tariffs on roughly Dollars 300-350m worth of products - against the French, who are seen as the primary cause of the row, and the Germans, who are viewed as aiding and abetting them. The administration is likely to wait 30 days before putting the sanctions into effect. US officials still hope that the EC might recognise that they are firmly committed to proceeding with sanctions. The White House decided to delay sanctions until after the presidential election to demonstrate in Europe that they were not designed to boost the president's popularity among US farmers. US officials say the administration will proceed whether or not Mr Bush wins the election. The administration's will has been stiffened by the US farm lobby, which has vowed to fight any Uruguay Round deal in Congress if the president 'caved in' on oilseeds. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, yesterday seemed to be preparing for US sanctions 'in a matter of days' but hoping to limit the dispute to prevent a full-scale transatlantic trade war. Framing her argument in purely legal terms, she talked of the 'litigation' in which the US had brought and won two complaints about EC oilseeds to Gatt, and she referred to the EC as a 'defendant' which had lost. 'We face having a judgment without payment on that judgment,' she said. 'But we are not igniting a trade war if we can find no settlement to the judgment we have lawfully been rendered not once but twice. It is only appropriate that we withdraw concessions earlier given.' For the EC to counter-retaliate would be 'totally Gatt illegal,' she said, and would seriously erode the credibility of the Gatt dispute settlement mechanism. As for the French, who have blocked a deal, they 'must consider whether their destiny is as an agrarian nation or otherwise ..if, as the second largest provider of services worldwide, they do not see the benefits that come from reducing trade barriers.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "VMRO-DPMNE Public Announcement"] </F>   [Text] In its announcement for the public, VMRO-DPMNE  [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party  for Macedonian National Unity] most bitterly criticized latest  staff purges in the Interior Ministry, which turn the ministry  into a committee of protection of the current ruling coalition,  especially SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia] and  the Liberal Party. Mr. Gogov's [former deputy head of the  Interior Ministry Operative Department] press conference clearly  showed police leaders Frckovski [minister of internal affairs],  Bogoevski [undersecretary in the intelligence service], and  Gjurev must leave immediately. Fabricating political processes  against innocent people was a feature of totalitarian  Stalinist-communist regimes, but Macedonia is obviously not  immune to this. Democracy and human rights are continually  being narrowed by the current true dictatorship, the  announcement says. The party demands that the Interior Ministry  officially explain the role of the recently killed high  inspector Dimce Ristovski in revealing a crime including over a  million German marks, with a presumable involvement of the  minister of health, Jovan Tofovski. The party also appealed to  Pavle Trajanov, in the name of democracy and the future of the  Macedonian state, to publicly reveal government's attempts to  discredit him in the eyes of the public, and state other  fabricated cases, as well as the government involvement in  organized crime in the country.</p>

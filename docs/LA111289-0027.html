			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: MORTON OUT TO PROVE HE'S SALT OF THE EARTH  </P> <P> Peter Morton doesn't necessarily want to save the world -- but he wouldn't mind  helping save the planet. The Los Angeles-based restaurateur -- who owns  Morton's and the Hard Rock Cafe here and additional Hard Rocks in San Diego,  San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, Honolulu, New Orleans and Sydney, Australia  (with yet another in the works in Las Vegas) -- has even established a Save the  Planet Department in the corporate offices of his 1,600-employee company.  </P> <P> And what does this department do? "It coordinates and undertakes activities  that will help the environment," says Morton. For instance? "To begin with," he  replies, "we recycle every bottle that comes into our properties -- beer  bottles, wine bottles, Coke bottles. We recycle all our cardboard. We have  discontinued the use of Styrofoam, and buy only line-caught albacore tuna (nets  are undesirable because they trap and kill dolphins along with tuna). Any money  we earn from recycling, we give to local charities. Besides that, we donate any  extra food we have to the local missions on both a daily and a weekly basis in  all Hard Rock cities. We hold benefits to raise funds for the Natural Resources  Defense Council. We put out a newsletter for all our employees, telling them  what they can do personally -- like recycling paper at the office, not throwing  their newspapers out at home, and getting rid of fluorocarbon products."  </P> <P> In addition, his company has started using a biodegradable plastic bag to  package the immensely popular Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts the restaurants sell --  some six to seven million of them a year, he adds.  </P> <P> "We didn't suddenly start doing this since environmental issues have become  rather fashionable," Morton continues. "The phrase 'Save the Planet' has  appeared above the Hard Rock logo for seven years, and we established our  department two years ago."  </P> <P> Of course some environmental issues are easier to face than others. "All the  products at both Morton's and the L.A. Hard Rock come from the Malibu Herb  Farm," says Morton, "and are pesticide-free. But California is always in the  forefront of things like organic farms, and the same situation doesn't  necessarily exist everywhere. For the Hard Rock in New Orleans, it's much  tougher to think about using organic produce, because the community there just  isn't making the same kinds of demands on produce growers." And what about the  problems said to be caused by existing commercial refrigeration systems, which  release Freon-12 into the atmosphere? "Well," says Morton, "we're looking into  it. But it's real tough to suddenly convert all your refrigeration to a new  system."  </P> <P> (Freon footnote: The Bruce Marder/Michel Richard/Marvin Zeidler Broadway Deli,  scheduled to open next spring in Santa Monica, will reportedly be the first  restaurant in the L.A. area with a Freon-12-free refrigeration system.)  </P> <P> What does Morton hope his Save the Planet Department will ultimately  accomplish? "We're just trying to be as socially responsible as we can," he  replies. "And we're hoping to encourage other restaurateurs in the communities  we serve to do some of the same things. If anybody's interested, I wish they'd  call me up. I'd have somebody from our department drive out there and show them  how to do it."  </P> <P> WHAT'S COOKING: Duplex in the Los Feliz district welcomes Groth Vineyards  winemaker Nils Venge on Tuesday, with a four-course dinner accompanied by his  wines. Cost is $65 per person, and the event begins at 7:30 p.m. . . . The  American Institute of Wine &amp; Food will hold an International Wine Auction  Saturday night, at the Four Seasons Hotel -- with a supper to be provided by  chef/restaurateurs Evan Kleiman (the Angeli restaurants), Bruce Marder (West  Beach Cafe, Rebecca's, DC-3), Michael McCarty (Michael's), Laurent Quenioux  (Seventh Street Bistro), and Mauro Vincenti (Rex il Ristorante, Pazzia), among  others. Admission to the event, which begins at 8:30 p.m., is $250 per person,  with proceeds benefitting the AIWF. Among the items to be auctioned will be two  magnums of 1961 Chateau Latour, a magnum of 1917 Chateau Palmer, and dinner for  six at the home of Julia Child. . . . Indigo in Los Angeles plans a gala dinner  and silent art auction to benefit two local AIDS care facilities next Sunday,.  Tickets are $100 per person.  </P></p>

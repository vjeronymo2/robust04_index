			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Technology: An Olympic paperchase The first race of the 2000 Olympics begins on February 1. On that Monday, each city competing for the Games has to submit 30 copies of its final draft bid document to the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne. This will be equivalent to Beijing, Berlin, Brasilia, Manchester, Milan and Sydney taking to their marks. They will be held in the 'set' position for two weeks while IOC officials decide what amendments they want. The winner will be the first to produce 300 copies of an amended, completed document. The prize will be the undivided attention of IOC members before the second-placed city's bid arrives. The IOC will make its choice of venue for the 2000 Olympics as early as September of this year. The IOC wants simple bid documents in standard A4 size, printed on both sides to reduce weight and designed to make it easy to copy broken-out sections for experts to study particular details. Since each bid document will run to hundreds of pages and several volumes, the race is a production management challenge. Manchester has decided to do the job in six days with the help of Rank Xerox. Its bid document will total 520 pages in three volumes, with parallel columns of English and French. Since some sections and illustrations will be in colour, potential problems seem enormous. If text is lengthened or shortened, or some illustrations have to be changed or dropped, the whole running order of pages could be affected. Conventional printing methods could make this a nightmare. Just getting the imposition of pages correct on the presses, so they appeared in correct order in the finished product, would be difficult in a rush. Remaking hundreds of printing plates would also be time-consuming and expensive. Manchester's approach will be to marry the converging high technologies of laser scanning and printing with photocopying, so that printing presses - and plates for them - will not be involved. Russell Forsyth, Xerox's accounts manager for local government, claims the combination of kit assembled in Manchester is unique. It uses the flexibility of a unix operating system, combining Apple and Hewlett Packard equipment with Rank Xerox's own. Pictures, artwork and graphics can be scanned in, while text comes in word-processed, digital form. Rank Xerox's own cut and paste system allows electronic assembly and page editing, while computerised imposition makes sure they are produced and copied in the right order. Programmed collation puts them together, while automatic binding turns them into book form.</p>

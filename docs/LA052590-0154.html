			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO GETS JUST ENOUGH OFFENSE TO STOP PALMDALE  </P> <P> Offense has been a scarce commodity for El Toro much of this season, but the  Chargers generated enough hits Thursday to complement their usually strong  pitching and defense.  </P> <P> Four hits and some shaky fielding by Palmdale added up to a 3-0 victory for  top-seeded El Toro in a quarterfinal softball game.  </P> <P> El Toro (24-8) advances to the semifinals for the first time since 1986, taking  on Saddleback Tuesday.  </P> <P> The Chargers took a 2-0 lead in the third inning, taking advantage of two  Palmdale errors. With two on and one out, Karie Yoshioka hit a ground ball that  bounced wildly off the knee of Palmdale shortstop Cheree Rogers into right  field. The error allowed Kymm Maniscalco to score from second.  </P> <P> An errant throw home by right fielder Rachael Medina went to the backstop and  Charger Corrie Yauney beat the throw to the plate by catcher Debby Dimeglio for  the second run.  </P> <P> El Toro added its other run in the fourth on an infield single by Maniscalco  with the bases loaded. The senior center fielder was two for two with one run  batted in.  </P> <P> The lead was more than enough for Paige Lauby, who earned her third victory of  the playoffs. Lauby (14-2) struck out 10 and gave up three hits while running  her playoff scoreless streak to 28 innings. Lauby has compiled 44 strikeouts  during the postseason.  </P> <P> Lauby, a senior right-hander, said the effects of pitching all 14 innings in a  1-0 victory over Trabuco Hills Tuesday took its toll.  </P></p>

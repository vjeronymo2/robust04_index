L. 102&hyph;569) made significant changes in rehabilitation service provisions under Title I of the Act. Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and applicants of available benefits under the Act. Section 302 of the Act includes personnel specifically trained to deliver services in CAPs to be among the personnel that the Rehabilitation Training program must consider in reviewing personnel shortages and training needs. Through the 1992 Survey of Personnel Shortages and Training Needs in Vocational Rehabilitation, CAP directors have reported critical training needs for both CAP administrative and service-delivery personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months.

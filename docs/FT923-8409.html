			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Limit set on insolvency probes INSOLVENCY practitioners need not mount detailed investigations into the conduct of directors of insolvent companies, according to guidance from their professional bodies. An advisory note, issued yesterday, provides guidance on the D-forms, or statutory reports, that must be submitted to the directors' disqualification unit of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) after each insolvency. It appears to place little responsibility on insolvency practitioners to be satisfied with directors' conduct of a business. The guidance, from the Society for the Practitioners of Insolvency and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, says practitioners should base their reports on information gained in the ordinary course of their work. It suggests that practitioners 'may find it useful' to issue questionnaires to directors asking for information and 'inviting comments' on the reasons for an insolvency. It cautions against defamation and says the report to the DTI, to be submitted within six months of an insolvency appointment, should be based on proper evidence. Insolvency guidance notes 3.1008-3.1010. ICAEW, Gloucester House, 399 Silbury Blvd, Central Milton Keynes MK9 2HL. Free with SAE.</p>

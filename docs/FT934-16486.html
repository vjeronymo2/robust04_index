			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Monetary union in UK no triumph Sir, Mr John Szemerey (Letters, October 4) says: 'There has been a British monetary union in the UK for years. No one challenges or questions that. Its advantages are so obvious that it is taken for granted.' I notice that Mr Szemerey writes from Belgium. He may not be aware that the pound sterling has lost about 85 per cent of its domestic purchasing power in the last 25 years. This debasement of the currency may have been deliberate government policy. Or perhaps the incompetence of the authorities has frustrated their genuine attempts to maintain the value of sterling. Or maybe it was all just bad luck. Whatever the reason, the average annual decline in purchasing power over the last quarter-century of more than 8 per cent a year has caused very serious problems to those on fixed incomes, to the foreign exchanges, to the tax system, and not least to commercial accounting. In each case political interference has exacerbated the problems caused by the government's monetary monopoly. In short, I can assure Mr Szemerey that the British monetary union of which he is so enamoured has by no means been an unmitigated triumph.

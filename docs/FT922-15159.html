			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Deposition by Names may affect losses DETAILS in an affidavit submitted to a commercial court and due to be made public today could have a significant effect on losses faced by Names on Lloyd's syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency. Names on the syndicates - which specialised in catastrophe reinsurance business and ran up losses of more than Pounds 200m in the 1989 year - are among the 820 Names taking action in the case, which was adjourned by Mr Justice Saville on Tuesday. The Names, who are advised by solicitors Michael Freeman, are seeking injunctions to prevent Lloyd's drawing down on their deposits in order to meet cash calls. Hearings are set to resume on Monday. Names are the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. The affidavit is understood to have drawn on information about the affairs of one Gooda Walker syndicate gathered by GW Run Off, a body which has administered the syndicates since the Gooda Walker and related agencies went into liquidation last year. Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, the chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said the group had been pressing GW Run Off and Lloyd's to make the information public. Lloyd's marine syndicate 475, which underwrote re-insurance business, will report a loss of more than Pounds 12m for 1989, about five times the figure previously expected. Spratt &amp; White, manager of the syndicate, says in a letter to the 956 Names on it that losses from hurricane Hugo, which devastated the Caribbean and parts of the US in 1989, will exceed the syndicate's reinsurance protections. Spratt &amp; White took over management of the syndicate from RJ Bromley (Underwriting Agencies) last year and has reviewed the syndicate's exposures to Hugo. Managers have been unable to complete their assessment of likely losses and are leaving the syndicate's accounts open for the 1989 year. They are expecting to make a cash call of at least 50 per cent (Pounds 5,000 for every Pounds 10,000 traded by Names on the syndicate) in July, but say this depends on the continuing co-operation of the syndicate's bankers. Names were told in February that the loss might not exceed 10 per cent. Letters, Page 19</p>

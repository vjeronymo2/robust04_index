			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEW YORK GROUP SHOWS INTEREST IN CSUN SPORTS ARENA  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge administrators are working with a New York-based  conglomerate, gathering information that may lead to a joint venture in the  construction and management of a multiple-purpose sports arena on the CSUN  campus.  </P> <P> Representatives from the Ogden Corp., which manages concessions at major sports  arenas nationwide, including the Forum, have met twice with school officials  since the start of the year, Elliot Mininberg, vice president for  administration at Northridge, said Tuesday.  </P> <P> CSUN is scheduled to jump to NCAA Division I in athletics in September, 1990.  The Matadors currently play at the Division II level, using the school's  3,000-seat gymnasium as their home court for men's and women's basketball games  and volleyball matches.  </P> <P> The extent of Ogden's interest in financing an arena will depend largely on a  feasibility study by Ogden that is expected to be completed by the end of June.  </P> <P> Northridge first must compile information on its past attendance figures and  concession sales and formulate future projections in those areas. Also under  scrutiny will be the school's need of home dates for athletic events and  practices. It is expected to take two weeks to gather the information.  </P> <P> Ogden's subsidiaries are capable of handling everything from building and  financing the proposed complex to managing the facility. Ogden Financial has  the capability to finance the project, with Ogden Projects doing the  construction and Ogden Allied handling management and concessions  responsibilities.  </P> <P> "It's a total, full-service project," said a member of Ogden's management team  who spoke on the condition his name not be used.  </P> <P> Mininberg said that Northridge and Ogden were brought together by the  architectural, engineering and planning firm of Howard, Needles, Tammen and  Bergendoff. HNTB has been involved in the design and construction of the Harry  S. Truman Sports Complex in Kansas City, Mo.; Giants Stadium at the  Meadowlands, N. J., and more than 50 other sports facilities.  </P> <P> Ogden has been particularly active on the West Coast lately. It already has  secured the exclusive rights to build an arena in Anaheim and has made a bid to  do the same in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "We're hopeful that their review will result in continuing interest on their  part and the opportunity to realize a first-class arena on this campus in less  time than it might take us if we were forced to go independently," Mininberg  said.  </P> <P> The school would prefer to finance construction of an arena with private  donations, which would allow exclusive use by Northridge teams with less regard  to profitability. The odds on that happening, however, are close to zero.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's a closed door," Mininberg said, "but our ability to  accomplish something like that in the matter of a short time is somewhat  remote."  </P> <P> Better are the chances that Northridge will ask for public donations to  supplement a partial offer of financing by Ogden.  </P> <P> "We are, in fact, talking to some people of significant wealth who have  interest in the university," Mininberg said. "To accomplish a first-grade arena  of the quality that Ogden is looking at, I don't think we can do it without  some outside assistance."  </P> <P> In addition, state money might become available for the project if classrooms  and office space are incorporated into the complex.  </P> <P> "If we get some folks like Ogden interested to help capitalize this, and some  private donations, and the state's appropriation process to participate, then  we have more than a lick and a promise of getting this thing done in a  reasonable amount of time," Mininberg said.  </P> <P> That's three big "ifs," if you're keeping score, but school officials seem to  reason that they will be better for the experience even if Ogden's interest  wanes.  </P> <P> At least they will have a professional opinion about the obstacles that lie  ahead.  </P> <P> "Right now we know in a generic sense that we need a facility, but we don't  have a good sense about what size it should be in order to pay for itself,"  Mininberg said. "Hopefully, they can give us a clear focus on the total cost,  which will give us an idea of what we need to attract from the state and from  our private donor's list."  </P> <P> The arena project, considered little more than a pipe dream only a few months  ago, is now considered vital for the school's ever-improving image.  </P> <P> Or, as Mininberg put it, "This is a step toward becoming first-rate  athletically, which we feel will lend itself to a quality surge in the academic  environment as well."  </P></p>

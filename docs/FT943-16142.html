			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Hunt tells TUC of unions' limited role: Polite applause for employment secretary after stewards are firm with hecklers Employers, unions and the government yesterday committed themselves to the goal of full employment, but differed sharply over the means, at the Looking Forward to Full Employment conference organised by the Trades Union Congress. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary - whose presence caused a demonstration outside and the non-attendance of several union leaders - said Britain had to 'combine US-style job creation and enterprise with the kind of social standards we in Europe expect'. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, raised the spirits of the 300-strong audience by saying 'it is possible to create a million jobs during a period of government'. Mr Hunt is the first cabinet minister to attend a TUC conference for more than a decade. His reception was not enthusiastic, but hecklers were firmly dealt with by TUC stewards and he received polite applause at the end of his speech. He welcomed the growing consensus that active labour market measures had to concentrate on the long-term unemployed. But he also said that some unemployed people needed to change their attitude to the new service-sector jobs. He said there was still a role for unions in the battle against unemployment but this should be in the workplace. He attacked the 'discredited' union link with the Labour party at national level. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, contested the de-regulatory approach of the government. He said: 'We need new national institutions to improve competitiveness and employment. We have a good record in health and safety at work because we have strong national regulations. If we did the same with training we might get better results.' Mr Monks said that there was 'strong suspicion in trade union circles that mass unemployment had been a deliberate act of policy'. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said that 'if a government with a policy commitment to full employment were elected we would not take our bat home'. He also revealed that the CBI was surveying employers about the skills of the unemployed who present themselves for work.</p>

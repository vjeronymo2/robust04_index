In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Journalist Francisco  Gonzalez  Aruca said the most influential media in the United States as  well as an important sector of the Cuban immigrant committee  "consider the blockade to be an obsolete policy." "Little by  little the more moderate segment of the U.S. Cuban community is  expressing its rejection of this measure," said Aruca, director  of Radio Progreso Alternativa in Miami, Florida.    On Monday, Havana announced a meeting it calls "The Nation  and the Immigrant Community." It will be held during the last  week of April with the participation of approximately 200  representatives of the Cuban community residing in other  countries.    According to analysts, the blockade imposed by Washington on  the island for three decades could be one of the subjects  discussed.    Aruca agreed with other immigrants who were asked about this  issue, meaning that, for the time being, a policy change is  difficult "because there is still no group strong enough to  bring about that change in the United States."    He said: The influence exerted by the most conservative  segment of the community, led by the right wing of the  Cuban-American National Foundation (FNCA) which favors the  blockade, is equally considerable.    Another Cuban immigrant, ARIETO magazine director Andres  Gomez, said: "The FNCA favors maintaining that policy because it  coincides with its own interest."    "Unquestionably the group within the U.S. Cuban community  which favors a suspension of the blockade has grown in recent  years, and states its position more openly," he said.    There are those who advocate the unconditional elimination  of  the blockade; others endorse it up to a certain point so as to  negotiate the rest later on, Gomez said.</p>

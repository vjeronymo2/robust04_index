			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Summit call for more UN assertiveness likely WORLD leaders due to attend the first UN Security Council summit in New York at the end of this month are expected to call for a much more active UN peace-keeping and peace-making role in world affairs. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the new UN secretary-general, is to be asked to recommend to the council, by May 1, new ways to identify potential conflicts and to make suggestions on the additional resources the UN will require for strengthening its so-called 'preventive diplomacy'. 'The world now has the best chance for peace, security and development since the foundation of the UN,' a draft statement drawn up by Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of the council, states. The UN charter specifically prohibits interference in a state's internal affairs but that clause has been interpreted less strictly in recent years. The draft notes that the range of UN peace-keeping tasks had been broadened considerably in recent years, and that the monitoring of elections and human rights had become 'integral parts of a wider effort to maintain international peace and security'. The final statement is expected to be in the form of a presidential text to be read out by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, who invited the other security council members to the meeting. Among those who have accepted Mr Major's invitation are US President George Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng, all from permanent members of the security council.</p>

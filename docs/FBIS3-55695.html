			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Comment on the president's refusal to endorse  the law on property declaration was presented today by Andrius  Kubilius, head of the Seimas opposition.    [Begin recording] [Kubilius] This draft law was prepared by  the efforts of the opposition, and I can even say that thanks to  the efforts of the opposition it was adopted by the Seimas  before the New Year. Today, the president announced that he  would probably not endorse this law, saying that allegedly it  runs counter to the Constitution of Lithuania.    I would like to say that according to our point of view, and  as far as I know, judging by the reports I read in the press,  when this law was adopted this point of view is supported by  some representatives and the leaders of the government, and this  law is one of the main laws in the struggle against corruption  because there is no other way to fight corrupt officials except  by means of this law. This law binds every official to declare  his property and income. At the same time the source of their  income must also be revealed.    The president said that this law runs counter to the  Constitution because the Constitution indicates that all  citizens of Lithuania are equal before the law. However, he  said that this law allegedly singles out certain officials in  Lithuania and places some additional obligations on them.    I would like to say that the Constitution should be regarded  as a certain general document, and when one specific clause is  taken out then, of course, different points of view can be  adopted.    However, I must say that there is also a clause in the  Constitution, Clause number five, which reads that government  institutions should serve the people. Therefore, this clause  defines clearly how the officials at the governmental structures  should work, i.e., they have to serve the people, the public and  the state, and in no way should they serve their own interests.  Extensive documents have been worked out in the West, called the  code of practice of state officials, say, of the United States.  Personal interests of a state official and those of the state  are clearly defined. [passage omitted]    I think that in refusing to endorse this law the president  is  making a mistake, because the refusal to endorse this law, which  is a rather complex law and which will became fully operational  only in 1995, means that this law will not now become valid in  1995.    On the other hand, I fully agree with the president when he  says that we must have a general law on income declaration by  all citizens of Lithuania. However, I must say that the  government believes that such a complex law can only be  implemented at the beginning of 1996. This means that until  then, i.e. 1996, corruption in our governmental circles will  continue to flourish.    [Unidentified correspondent] Could this unwillingness to  endorse the law on income and property declaration by state  officials be regarded as an apprehension by some, or rather  individual, officials?    [Kubilius] Absolutely. I can say firmly that, I am 100  percent sure, that...[pauses] I do not want to say that the  president is concealing something because the president is also  obliged to reveal his income. I think that Lithuania is in no  way different from any Western country where, at times,  corruption scandals shake a state.    Rimantas Smetona, chairman of the Nationalist Union of  Lithuania, said earlier at a news conference that while running  away from socialism, Lithuania is now approaching Sicilism -- he  means the Sicilian mafia.    In this sense, both corruption and the mafia in Lithuania  are  flourishing and we must make all efforts to fight it. The West  could not invent anything else in the fight against corruption  but this law on the declaration of income and property by state  officials.    [Correspondent] [Passage omitted] The law was somehow linked  to the elections. Can you comment?    [Kubilius] What the president said today reminded me of the  words spoken by deputy chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas, Juozas  Bernatonis, when he spoke during the debates on the law in the  Seimas. The same articles of the Constitution were mentioned  and the same problems were raised.    Already during the parliamentary debates on this law  Bernatonis somehow said, half in joke -- although nobody speaks  at the Seimas half in joke, and quite often very serious matters  are spoken half in joke -- well, he said that instead of  adopting this law let us declare new elections to the Seimas.    [Correspondent] Elections and the adoption of such a law:  The Seimas is dismissed, and in this way the officials escape  responsibility.    [Kubilius] In principle this would be so. I think that here  some officials do not want to reveal their income and the source  of their income, therefore, they think that it would be better  to leave the parliament in a nice way through new elections.

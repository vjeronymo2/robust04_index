			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE SOUTH BAY  </P> <P> Antonia Martin can breathe a bit easier nowadays.  </P> <P> Officials announced Friday that affordable housing has been located for the  59-year-old Torrance woman and that the impending court battle between her and  the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has been resolved.  </P> <P> Although the archdiocese is still asking the disabled widow to leave the small  wood-frame house she has lived in for 20 years, at least Martin now has a place  to go.  </P> <P> Next month she will move into a senior citizens apartment complex in Redondo  Beach and leave the 600-square-foot house on the grounds of St. James Catholic  School in Torrance.  </P> <P> There her husband, Angel, worked as a custodian from 1968 until his death in  July, 1987. While he worked at the school, the church allowed the couple and  their two daughters to live rent-free in the previously abandoned house.  </P> <P> But after Angel died, the church asked his widow to move out.  </P> <P> Martin, who lives alone on $340-a-month disability checks, argued that she  couldn't afford to move. And besides, she said, church officials told her in  November that she could stay  </P> <P> until she could afford to move.  </P> <P> Martin had asked the church to let her stay until June, when she turns 60 and  becomes eligible for the Social Security benefits that would enable her to  afford an apartment.  </P> <P> The archdiocese said it couldn't wait and decided to ask a South Bay Municipal  Court judge to evict Martin. The case was scheduled for Jan. 11.  </P> <P> But now that Martin has agreed to move out by  </P> <P> February, church officials said they are willing to forgive and forget.  </P> <P> "The case has been settled and everyone is happy," said Mark Todd, a paralegal  working for the archdiocese.  </P> <P> Martin agreed. "Estoy contenta," she said in an interview Saturday. "I'm  happy."  </P> <P> Martin, who came to the South Bay from Cuba in 1967, will be living at Casa De  Los Amigos, a federally funded senior citizens apartment project that charges  rent according to the tenant's income.  </P> <P> Martin's attorney, Margaret Kirby, was told about the inexpensive housing  opportunity by a parishioner at St. James Catholic Church who had heard about  Martin's situation.  </P> <P> The apartment complex usually has a lengthy waiting list, church officials  siad, but because of Martin's situation, she was given priority.  </P> <P> Martin's attorney, Margaret Kirby, said she is glad the case was settled  without a legal battle.  </P> <P> "I'm happy and excited," she said.

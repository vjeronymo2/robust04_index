NODONG SINMUN today in a by-lined  article in this regard quotes the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song as saying:    "Our task at the present stage is to follow up the success  in  the rural technical revolution to advance the industrialization  and modernization of agriculture to a high level".    The article says:    The promotion of the technical revolution is one of the most  important tasks in the efforts for the ultimate solution of the  rural question under the banner of the rural theses. The task  of the technical revolution laid down in the letter represents a  just policy based on a scientific analysis of the present state  of the development of agriculture in our country.    This state shows that only when we consolidate and expand  the  achievements made in the technical revolution while accelerating  the ideological and cultural revolutions in the countryside, can  we steadily raise the standards of industrialisation and  modernisation of agriculture and win a shining victory in the  efforts to finally solve the rural question.    The technical revolution makes it possible, above all, to  solidify the material and technical foundations of agriculture  by stepping up the technical reconstruction of agricultural  production and thus make a dramatic progress in the solution to  the socialist rural question.    In the past period the technical revolution has made a fast  progress along the road indicated by the rural theses in our  country, bringing irrigation and electrification to completion  in the countryside and successfully bringing into reality the  mechanisation and extensive application of chemicals as well.    The technical revolution also makes it possible to push  ahead  with the process of organical combination of cooperative  property and all-people property while continually enhancing the  leading role of the latter over the former.    To enhance this leading role is an important demand for the  ultimate solution to the rural question and it is definitely  guaranteed only by solid material and technical conditions. The  technical revolution is an important way of creating material  and technical conditions for constantly enhancing the leading  role of all-people property over cooperative property and  combining them organically.    When we energetically accelerate the rural technical  revolution, faithfully fulfilling its tasks set by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his historic letter to the  national agricultural conference can we make a signal progress  in the development of the socialist rural economy and constantly  increase agricultural production.</p>

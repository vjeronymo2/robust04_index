			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Sefi Hendler] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It looks as though Prime  Minister Rabin is seriously pursuing the move to expand the  coalition. Today, he held a phone conversation with Minister  Shulamit Aloni and explained to her that not all the reports  regarding this issue are accurate. Rabin told Meretz leader  Aloni he wants to meet Meretz ministers tomorrow in order to  explain the situation to them.    Meanwhile the Meretz Knesset faction convened in Tel Aviv  today and decided to reject Tzomet's inclusion in the coalition  at the present time. Environment Minister Yosi Sarid explains  the decisions of his party:    [Begin Sarid recording] Meretz believes that the inclusion  of Tzomet in the government at the present time is unwarranted  and should be rejected. In the wake of the Hebron massacre and  its grave repercussions Tzomet's inclusion would send out a  negative message to our Palestinian interlocutors, Israeli Arabs  and their public and Knesset representatives, and would have an  adverse effect on the peace process' chances of quickly  proceeding toward a positive conclusion. [end recording]    It is worthwhile to note that Minister Sarid put the  emphasis  on the present time. Meretz believes that at the present time  Tzomet's inclusion would harm the peace process, but in a few  months -- after the first stage of the Oslo agreement is  implemented -- conditions could change.    Meretz's statement also mentioned SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim], calling on it to return to the coalition. Meretz is  perhaps signalling to Rabin that they are willing to compromise  on SHAS' return to the coalition. [passage omitted]</p>

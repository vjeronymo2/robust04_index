			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP], received two telephone calls yesterday  afternoon from his brothers, Egyptian President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak and Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan al Nuhayyan, the president  of the United Arab Emirates. President Muhammad Husni Mubarak  and Shaykh Zayid expressed their great concern over the  situation in Yemen and the continued fighting there. They  stressed their strongest determination to continue making all  possible efforts to stop the fighting between the sons of the  united Yemen.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid reiterated his thanks and  appreciation for the efforts of both presidents, Husni Muharak  and Shaykh Zayid. Those efforts were aimed at stopping the  bloodshed in Yemen, which began after the launch of the doomed  war by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his secessionist and  adventuristic gang after he lost patience with the widespread  agreement and overall national consensus regarding the pledge  and accord document. The brother deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council briefed his two brothers, Muhammad Husni  Mubarak and Zayid Bin-Sultan, about developments in the military  situation along all the axes of the fighting.    Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid has also spoken on the telephone  with his brother, His Majesty King Husayn of Jordan. He briefed  him on the situation in Yemen which resulted from the ill-fated  war sparked off by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Brother 'Ali Salim  al-Bid expressed great appreciation for the role played by  Jordan in attempting to stop the deterioration of the situation  in Yemen. He confirmed his earnestness in responding to all  fraternal and friendly efforts to return to political dialogue,  and to submit to the true and serious implementation of the  pledge and accord document.</p>

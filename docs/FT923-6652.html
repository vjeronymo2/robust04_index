			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Week in the Markets: Cautious response to coffee rally LONDON COFFEE traders, having repaired most of the damage done in their market last week, yesterday remained far from bullish about the near-term prospects for coffee prices. As the December position closed at Dollars 752 a tonne, representing a rally of Dollars 29 following last week's Dollars 40 setback, dealers noted that the market remained extremely thin - average daily turnover was 2,772 lots of 5 tonnes, compared with 5,581 in the corresponding week last year - and suggested that more fundamental support was needed to lend strength to the recovery. Most thought the rise was a correction to a fall last week that had been unduely influenced by the weakness of the New York coffee market. The market for the mild arabica coffee variety that is traded in New York had become heavily oversupplied and that had pushed prices down to 17-year lows. But supplies of the coarser robusta type traded in London remained relatively tight and dealers saw no reason why they should have followed last week's fall in arabica prices. New York coffee futures recovered from a fresh 17-year low of 51 cents a lb reached on Monday and in late trading yesterday the December position was quoted at 53.95 cents a lb, 0.55 cents up from the end of last week. Brazilian and Colombian officials are to meet in Bogota on Monday to prepare for the next round of talks on renegotiating the moribund International Coffee Agreement. But Mr Celsius Lodder, director of the Brazilian Department of Supply and Prices and one of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation, was at pains this week to play down the significance of the meeting. He said the countries, the two biggest coffee producers, frequently met to exchange ideas prior to the London sessions. He added that they would not be discussing a change in position at next week's meeting. 'We don't think that a unilateral producers' accord would be appropriate,' he said. Under the ICA producing and consuming countries co-operated in an export quota system intended to ensure reasonable prices for growers. But the pact collapsed in July 1989 when the two sides failed to reach agreement on renegotiation proposals. London cocoa prices began the week with an extension to last week's sharpish fall, before recovering on trade buying in New York and deepening concern about dry growing conditions in West Africa. But the more buoyant sentiment, which lifted the December futures position to Pounds 657 a tonne on Wednesday, quickly evaporated and by yesterday's close December cocoa was quoted at Pounds 641 a tonne, Pounds 3 lower on the week. At the London bullion market the gold price traded in a fairly narrow range following last week's fall of Dollars 15.50 a troy ounce. After falling 20 cents yesterday on reports Middle Eastern selling the price closed at Dollars 337.45 an ounce, up Dollars 2 on the week. Platinum, which fell even more steeply last week - by Dollars 31 to Dollars 346.25 an ounce - continued the decline on Monday as market confidence was hit by a further fall in Japan's Nikkei stock index. Japan is traditionally platinum's chief buyer. But most of that day's Dollars 4.50 fall was recovered on Tuesday, in response to a wave of Japanese buying, and a Dollars 5.40 rise yesterday, encouraged by a rally in the Nikkei, left the white metal Dollars 6 up on the week at Dollars 352.25 an ounce. Trading at the London Metal Exchange remained in the doldrums and the only substantial price movements were for copper and zinc, both of which were firm. The copper market reversed the downtrend of the past few weeks with cash metal gaining Pounds 23.50 to close yesterday at Pounds 1,318.50 a tonne. The rise started in New York on Monday night when short-covering was prompted by concern that last week's 2.4 cents a lb fall had left the market oversold. There were suggestions that the continuing rise was fueled by locals (traders operating on their own account) who had been caught short by the initial rally. After a pause for consolidation in mid-week the rise was resumed, despite news that Polish copper workers had suspended their month long strike. Technical tightness appeared to be the chief factor behind the Dollars 27.50 rise in the cash zinc price to Dollars 1,364 a tonne, which defied a further rise in LME warehouse stocks to a fresh record. The cash premium over the three months price widened from Dollars 7 a tonne at the end of last week to Dollars 29.25 at yesterday's close.  ---------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------- Aluminium    +15,825  to  1,341,400 Copper        +3,900  to    262,325 Lead             -50  to    150,550 Nickel          +576  to     42,732 Zinc          +2,250  to    348,125 Tin             +150  to     14,650  ----------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Heileman May Buy Interest in Stroh: G.

But analysts question whether such a deal could clear federal  antitrust laws. Stroh officials several weeks ago announced their willingness  to sell a minority interest in the Detroit-based company, the third-largest  brewer in the United States. The speculation about a merger was touched off  when Murray Cutbush, president and chief executive of La Crosse, Wis.-based  Heileman, disclosed that representatives from his company were in Detroit to  meet with Stroh officials.  </P></p>

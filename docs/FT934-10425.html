			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: The spirit of Russian worship - Patricia Morison is intrigued by the icons from St Petersburg at the V&amp;A Gates of Mystery; The Art of Holy Russia at the Victoria and Albert Museum is the most revelatory exhibition to be seen in London this year. Not for 60 years has Russia lent such a collection of sacred art. Paintings, embroideries, sculptures, carvings and liturgical objects all come from the vast collection of the Russian Museum created in St Petersburg a century ago by Tsar Alexander II. At a glance, one sees that Russian sacred art owes its essential character to Byzantium, which is to say the eastern Roman Empire. Gates of Mystery confronts us with an art familiar to the extent that we recognise figures like the Virgin Mary, St George and the dragon, or St Nicholas - although not one particularly delightful scene of his encounter with a carpet-seller. But the function and, to a large extent, the form of icons is alien to Europeans with roots in a faith dominated by the Word rather than the Image. Worship of the image (eikon in Greek) developed out of the Roman official cult of the emperor's portrait. During the persecution carried out by six iconoclast emperors, monks and nuns died in defense of the icons which permeated Byzantine society. In 787 at the Council of Nicaea, the Iconodule party won, but the news was badly received in the west where churchmen had long taken a dim view of 'idolatrous' Greeks. In 794, the decisive moment came when Frankish bishops at Frankfurt condemned icons as non-Christian. Relics were to be venerated; images were not. Two centuries later, icons became central to Russian life when Prince Vladimir of Kiev abandoned the paganism of his Viking forbears. His problem was to decide whether the Rus should become Catholic or Orthodox, Jews like the Khazars, or even Moslems like the Bulgars. Every Russian knows the story of how St Vladimir sent out envoys to discover which religion offered most. Rome was easily outshone by the wealth and beauty of Byzantium. Constantinople's churches, particularly Hagia Sophia, impressed the envoys as indescribably grand. God, they assured Vladimir, must certainly dwell there. Drink clinched the matter. I quote the catalogue, which is remarkably well-written and interesting (Pounds 25) and has sold like hot cakes. 'The Moslems' alleged idea of heaven which offered unlimited fornication was alluring for a man of Vladimir's alleged habits, but was more than cancelled by their ban on alcohol. 'Drinking' said Vladimir, 'is the joy of the Rus. We cannot live without it.'' It is fascinating to consider the consequences if Vladimir had not thought that the Rus should mix spirits and spirituality. As it was, the Russians were baptised into the Orthodox faith. Russian religious culture became almost inseparable from that of Byzantium, with the difference that Russians worshipped in Slavonic and knew nothing of Homer or Virgil. The catalogue points out that attitudes to Old Russian art have changed since Soviet times, when emphasing the debt to Byzantium was frowned on. The 11th-century Chernigov gold pendant shows the Greek influence in an unexpected way. On one side stands the warrior figure of St Michael, beloved of Byzantine emperors. The reverse shows a creature who is half woman, half snake and appears on late Roman amulets as a protectress of women in childbirth. Inscriptions in both Greek and Slavonic show that she had been adopted by the then rather dubiously Christian ladies of Kiev. Apart from the Chernigov amulet, everything in the show dates from after the Mongolian invasions when a distinctively Russian style had developed. Choral music plays and lights flicker in an attempt to create the right mood for an art which is liturgical, focused on the worship of God and his saints through their miraculous images. So intriguing is the theology of icons that you may want to go beyond the catalogue, in which case I recommend Jaroslav Pelican's Imago Dei (Yale, 1990). Christians should worship icons but reserve the highest form of worship for God. 'The icon is a reminder', taught St John of Damascus, the great apologist of iconodulism. It is a reminder of the miracle of the Incarnation when the godhead put on mere flesh and blood. The artist miraculously transforms matter to represent forms through which shine the divine light; windows on to eternity. With its chalices in silver and wood, the exhibition draws attention to the centrality of the eucharist. Particularly evocative are the Royal Doors from a 16th-century icon-screen, or iconostasis, which divided the congregation from the mysteries beyond. They opened when the priest brought in the eucharist which had miraculously become the body and blood of Christ, a reminder of Christ the King's entry into Jerusalem and a promise of his eventual return. When the doors were shut, graceful icons of the annunciation, the evangelists, and a priestly Christ celebrating the eucharist, reminded worshippers of the mystery within. Such a rich symbolism is typical of these icons, and nowhere more so than in a particularly lovely Trinity from Novgorod. Beneath the oak of Mamre, the three angels are served dinner by Abraham, Sarah, and their tiny servant boy. Angels and humans are linked in a circle in whose centre stands a chalice holding the minute head of a calf. Vermilion and gold predominate, the colours of sacrifice and love. Admittedly, the immaterialist vision of the artists of 15th-century Novgorod or Kiev makes contemporary Bruges or Florence feel terribly far away. These monks cared nothing for the seductions of the natural world - nothing for a landscape seen through a window or for the shadow cast by a string of pearls. This oak of Mamre never rustled in the wind. To anyone wedded to a sensual western aesthetic, icons may for ever seem strange rather than beautiful. Nonetheless, Gates of Mystery opens our eyes to a belief in the miraculous power of art lost 12 centuries ago at Frankfurt. Sponsors, BAT Industries plc, the De Beers Centenary AG, Marc Rich &amp; Col AG. Exhibition runs at the V&amp;A, South Kensington, until January 8 (071-938-8361).</p>

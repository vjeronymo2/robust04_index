			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Ladbroke Pounds 82m HK bonus Ladbroke, the leisure and property group, is to reap an Pounds 82m windfall this year from the early termination of a management contract for its Hilton hotel in Hong Kong. The funds will be used to reduce the UK group's Pounds 1.3bn debt. Ladbroke has already announced its intention to withdraw from commercial property, valued in the books at Pounds 860m, to cut borrowings. Ladbroke said yesterday that Hutchison Whampoa, the Hong Kong conglomerate which owns the hotel, had offered to pay Dollars 125m in compensation for the management contract. The proceeds will be included as an exceptional profit in the group's results for 1994. The Hong Kong Hilton had been one of Ladbroke's most profitable management deals, and was due to run for a further 20 years. In the year ended December 31, the hotel contributed management fees of Dollars 6m. The contract is due to expire before the end of next January, when 'Hutchison Whampoa will . . . review and evaluate the hotel's future,' Ladbroke said. Hutchison Whampoa is believed to be considering a sale of the centrally located site, given the buoyant property market in Hong Kong. An alternative use of the site would have been impossible due to the conglomerate's obligation to Ladbroke.</p>

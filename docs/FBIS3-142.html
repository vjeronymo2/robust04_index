			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Captain Joao Nhancumba, head of the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] team to the Cease-Fire Commission  [CCF], has categorically denied reports that his movement is  training men in South Africa. Such men had allegedly come from  the former base at the state-owned farm in the Salamanga area.    Confronted with the statements made by Mozambique Liberation  Front, Frelimo, Party first secretary to our newspaper last  week, that Renamo soldiers were constantly involved in movements  to South Africa, Capt. Nhancumba said: "That is false! It is  true that our soldiers left the base and moved from one place to  another, but they never crossed the border. It is likely that  people have seen our men moving around and they may have thought  they were crossing the border into South Africa."    Asked about a helicopter that the DOMINGO reporters had seen  overfly at a low altitude the Renamo base at the state-owned  farm in Salamanga, our interviewee said that "Renamo controls no  air space whatsoever. What is more, I think everyone knows that  we do not have any helicopters!"    Capt. Nhancumba also confirmed the complete withdrawal of  his  900 men from Salamanga and added they had moved to the  Chinhaguanine assembly area. He explained that not all men are  carrying weapons because Renamo did not have weapons for all its  soldiers, adding that "during the war, we used to rotate our  weapons among the men."    The Renamo team leader to the CCF also said that his  movement  is not removing weapons from assembly areas and taking them to  the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, regional depots because  there are still many weapons in the hands of militia and  paramilitary forces.    He said, by way of conclusion: "There has to be some sort of  equilibrium between the government and Renamo concerning the  arms collection process."</p>

			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS STREAKING WRONG WAY  </P> <P> The contrast was so apparent.  </P> <P> There were the Sockers, smoldering and wondering. A group of players slipping  to depths they've never experienced.  </P> <P> And in the other locker room a few feet away were the Wichita Wings, laughing  and shouting. A team on the ascent, one that is burning.  </P> <P> No, make that Byrne-ing.  </P> <P> Anybody who questioned last weekend's trade, in which Wichita acquired forwards  David Byrne and Keder for defender Mike Stankovic and forward Peter Ward, need  only to have witnessed Friday's game before 8,887 at the Kansas Coliseum.  Wichita (13-11) won, 5-4, to hand the Sockers their fourth consecutive loss.  Byrne had two goals and an assist.  </P> <P> So there was Byrne, a guy who, some whispered, wasn't giving his all in  Baltimore, standing in front of his dressing area after the game looking  pleased as punch. Why, his biggest problem Friday was finding a post-game beer.  There were none left in the cooler. He had done too many interviews. Finally,  someone found an unopened can in the corner, handed it to him and put a smile  on his face.  </P> <P> This was Byrne's first appearance as a Wing. Not bad.  </P> <P> "When you come to a new team, you want to make an impression," he said. "This  is a good team to come to. I want to do well, and I want the team to do well."  </P> <P> That's about all the Sockers want, too. They just can't seem to make it happen.  All they earned in this game was a dubious record. Wichita became the first  team ever to win six in a row against the Sockers, who are now 10-14 and in  last place in the Western Division of the Major Indoor Soccer League, 4 1/2  games behind first-place Dallas (15-10).  </P> <P> Socker Coach Ron Newman emerged from the locker room looking as if he had gone  five or six rounds with Mike Tyson.  </P> <P> "My, my, my," he said. "Just a lack of concentration. I don't know what was  going on out there."  </P> <P> A few samples:  </P> <P> First half. Dale Ervine, Wichita's leading goal-scorer with 23, scored first on  the power play. Soon after, midfielder Ben Collins tied it on a Socker power  play. Byrne made it 2-1, touching the ball passed goalie Zoltan Toth with his  right foot. Then, the Sockers tied it again, defender George Fernandez tapping  in a close-range shot on a crossing pass through traffic by forward Zoran  Karic.  </P> <P> But things began to get tricky as the half drew to a close. With 15 seconds  remaining in the second quarter, Collins was whistled for tripping Wing  defender Gregg Willin -- and given two minutes. The Wings were given a power  play. Collins said the referee told him it was because he already had five  fouls in the game. But Collins finished with just three.  </P> <P> Anyway, the Wings capitalized as the man advantage extended into the third  period, Ervine scoring 31 seconds in to make it 3-2.  </P> <P> Minutes later, Byrne struck again, with the Sockers on the power play.  Midfielder Brian Quinn made a pass that was intercepted at midfielder by Mike  Fox. Then Quinn made the mistake, by his own admission, of trying to win the  ball back. Byrne slipped by unnoticed, and Fox knocked a pass upfield. Byrne,  now well behind Quinn, dribbled, pulled Toth out of the box, shot off the right  post and followed with a diving header into the goal. Wichita 4, Sockers 2.  </P> <P> There was one more snafu before this one was over. With 19 seconds remaining in  the third quarter, after Karic had scored on a Wing power play to make it 4-3,  they decided to put in a sixth attacker. Hirmez got the nod but couldn't get  the big, multi-colored shirt pulled all the way down to his shorts. He took a  few steps onto the field still struggling with the shirt. Tweet. Illegal  substitution. Hirmez was not properly attired as a goalie. Wichita power play.  </P> <P> According to Hirmez, the conversation went about like this:  </P> <P> Ref: "You have to be fully dressed."  </P> <P> Hirmez: "Look at me. Can't you tell I'm the sixth attacker?"  </P> <P> Ref: "That's not the point. You're not fully dressed."  </P> <P> That power play passed without a goal, but Wichita midfielder Pedro DeBrito  ended the suspense when he scored off an assist from midfielder Goran Hunjak  with 2:42 remaining to make it 5-3.  </P></p>

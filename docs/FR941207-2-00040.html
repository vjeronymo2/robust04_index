L. 95&hyph;622) which requires the Secretary to publish an annual report that contains ``a list of all substances (i) which either are known to be carcinogens and (ii) to which a significant number of persons residing in the United States are exposed *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The law also states that the reports should provide available information on the nature of exposures, the estimated numbers of persons exposed, and the extent to which the implementation of Federal regulations decreases the risk to public health from exposure to these chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of the Report, ``known'' carcinogens are defined as those substances for which the evidence from human studies indicates that there is causal relationship between exposure to the substance and human cancer. Substances ``which may reasonably be anticipated to be carcinogens'' are defined as those for which there is limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans or sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substances in the above categories, for which potential exposure of persons residing in the United States has been demonstrated, are included in the Report. The Seventh Annual Report does not contain all known carcinogens or substances reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens. Additional substances with identified carcinogenic properties as defined above will be included in subsequent Annual Reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New entries in the Seventh Annual Report were chosen from those designated by the agencies participating in the preparation of the Report, from those tested within the National Toxicology Program and the National Cancer Institute Carcinogenesis Bioassay Program; or from those evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component of the World Health Organization (WHO), located in Lyon, France. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens Summary does not contain specific information on regulations promulgated by regulatory health agencies. In most other respects, the information is the same as that in the full report.

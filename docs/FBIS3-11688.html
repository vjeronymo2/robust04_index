			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] The finance minister said taxes will have to be  increased to pay for the salary readjustment for members of the  Legislative and Judicial Branches. Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso said he cannot accept converting salaries into  Real Value Units on the 25th of each month, as the Federal  Supreme Court wants. If the conversion is done on that day, the  government will have losses totalling $1.25 billion. According  to the finance minister, the government will have to create more  taxes to cover these losses:    [Begin recording] I am giving them the results. If they want  to change the conversion date to the 25th, they will have to  collect taxes equivalent to $1.25 billion. It will be very clear  in the eyes of the people that everyone is paying for this  salary increase. Calculations, however, will have to be made. It  will not be 5 percent over a small portion, because the minister  will not agree to that. This readjustment cannot be granted only  to a small sector and not to everyone. The federal  administration minister does not agree to that, the president of  the Republic does not agree to that, and I do not either. The  famous discussion about the Treasury, the budget, and about  these valuable people who work hard... [pauses] Some people are  even saying that I am adopting two different concepts, but I am  not. [Word indistinct] and they are right. The administration  minister comes to me and says: If we agree to increase their  salaries, we must increase everyone's salaries. What do you  think of that? Therefore, we cannot increase anyone's salary. It  is the same thing. Unless we adopt a new procedure in Brazil and  begin saying things clearly and openly, nothing will work out.  If we agree to change the date from the 30th to the 25th, we  will have to do it for everyone. If we do it for everyone,  someone will have to get me the $1.25 billion. [end recording]    Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso also commented on the  possibility of running in the presidential elections. He is  analyzing whether it is really the time to leave the government,  particularly now that there is such confusion among the three  government branches.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ANKARA TO LIFT BAN TODAY ON TRAINS WITH ETHNIC TURKS FROM BULGARIA  </P> <P> The Turkish government today will lift a ban on European trains entering from  Bulgaria that it imposed to stem the influx of ethnic Turks, the Foreign  Ministry said Saturday.  </P> <P> "Assuming that Bulgaria will no longer board any of its citizens without entry  visas, the train will be allowed to enter Turkey from Sept. 3," ministry  spokesman Murat Sungar said.  </P> <P> Turkey reimposed entry visa requirements for Bulgarian citizens on Aug. 22 and  stopped the Munich-Istanbul train crossing the border three days later.  </P> <P> "We can always resume the ban on the train if Bulgaria does not comply," Sungar  said.  </P> <P> Over 310,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria have entered Turkey since June when  Ankara waived visa requirements for ethnic refugees fleeing what they see as  forced Bulgarian assimilation.  </P> <P> Turkey said it had insisted on visas in a bid to force Bulgaria to sign an  emigration accord to protect the rights of refugees and those ethnic Turks  remaining in Bulgaria.  </P></p>

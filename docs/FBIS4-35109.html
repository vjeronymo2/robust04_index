			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The wave of rumors, instead of ebbing, is swelling  with each passing moment. Today it was learned that during  statements made to French television, the director of a private  organization headquartered in Paris and which specializes in  investigating drug trafficking, linked Vice President-elect  Humberto De la Calle to one of the drug cartels. The  allegations prompted a strong reaction from Vice President-elect  De la Calle.    Ever since the so-called narcotapes appeared, Colombia's  image overseas continues to be tarnished. This time the reports  came from France. (Alain Labreuse), director of the  nongovernment organization Geopolitical Narcotics Observer  alleged that Vice President-elect Humberto De la Calle has links  to the Cali Cartel.    De la Calle, who just yesterday received a message from  French President Francois Mitterrand reiterating his support for  the new Colombian Government, vehemently denied the allegations:    [Begin De la Calle recording] I have no information about  this gentleman. This is simply international gossip -- which is  all we need. Now we are seeing all sorts of international  garbage being thrown at Colombia. I strongly protest this sort  of information. All of you know me very well. It is nothing  more than a delusion to try to link Humberto De la Calle with  the Cali Cartel. [end recording]    De la Calle labeled the campaign against the country as  despicable, and he reiterated President-elect Ernesto Samper's  determination to fight the drug cartels.</p>

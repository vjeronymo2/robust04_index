			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [V. Voropayev report over video; from the "Dalniy Vostok" </F> program]    [Text] China's Heilongjiang Province, which is our  country's main partner in the PRC, is threatening to switch its  trade contacts with Russia to the dynamically developing states  of Southeast Asia. The province's leadership made a statement on  revising foreign economic priorities due to the new situation in  the region. Simply put, our Chinese neighbors are very unhappy  about the new Russian visa regulations and new customs dues.  These measures significantly reduced the flow of goods across  the border -- according to Chinese sources, the reduction  reaches 45 percent. Official Beijing has already adopted  retaliatory measures that limit the import of raw material and  semifinished products from Russia, and Heilongjiang firms have  been advised to look for new foreign sources of income. Only  time will show how real these threats of our affronted neighbors  are, but China is far from being our only partner in Asia to  justify our creating some kind of special conditions for it. It  is hardly worth to dramatize the reduction of goods exchange --  after all, the reverse side of the frantic trade relations with  China has amounted to the noticeable complication of the  situation in Far East border districts.    The first stage of the `Foreigner' [inostranets] operation  carried out in the Maritime Kray showed the necessity of  tightening the monitoring of entry of Chinese, Vietnamese, and  DPRK citizens. Many of them break visa regulations, forge  documents, and try to stay in the Maritime Kray through fair  means or foul. During the 10 days of purposeful inspection,  about 1,000 foreign citizens who had broken Russia's laws were  deported from the kray. However, the number of PRC tourists who  have lost their way here amounts to thousands, and, therefore,  operation `Foreigner' will not be limited to the first stage.</p>

Technically, Stanislav Shushkevich remained the head of  the republic's highest legislative body until the outcome of the  26 January vote was made public. But in fact, he has long lost  support of the legislative majority and the opposition as well.  In spite of the high speed with which everything happened, the  recent events did not come as a surprise at all.    The speaker was accused of failing to take anticorruption  measures, exercising inadequate control over law enforcement  agencies, and personal misconduct. However, genuine reasons  that led up to the removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from his  post lie much deeper. The deputies could have presented an even  longer list of his faults on Wednesday [26 January]. In the  first place, most were extremely displeased with the legislative  speaker's downright negative attitude toward the CIS collective  security treaty, with numerous uncertainties about the merger of  the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems, and with him  vacillating on issues of the Republic's state system. On the  other hand, Shushkevich became inconvenient to the legislative  opposition, too, which has lately adopted a radically  nationalistic stance and a distinct orientation toward the West.    The clash came to a head during the examination of a new  draft constitution. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Soviet  found itself in a political deadlock then. At that time, many  realized that a quick and decisive outcome was imminent. I  think that there is another reason for the removal of the leader  of the country's highest legislative body, who was not supported  by the majority. The deputies had to find and show society the  main culprit of the delayed constitutional process that could  somehow justify their poor work. Otherwise, the situation would  have called for early elections -- a prospect that most of the  legislators do not particularly welcome.    Not only does Shushkevich's removal not settle any troubles  of the Supreme Soviet, it may produce a whole range of new, and  even nastier, ones for the parliament. Although the "buffer"  policy of the former parliament's leader did not hasten the work  on the draft constitution, it sometimes allowed opposing  factions and groupings of the Belarusian legislature to reach  compromises. Will such compromises be possible when the Supreme  Soviet splits into two unreconcilable camps, especially on key  issues requiring the constitutional majority?</p>

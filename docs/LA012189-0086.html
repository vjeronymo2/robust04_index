			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARNES SETS INDOOR BEST MARK IN SHOTPUT AT 74-4  </P> <P> Last week, after a meet at Jonesboro, Ark., shotputter Randy Barnes found  himself at the wrong end of a semi-automatic rifle held by an alleged drunk in  a hotel parking lot. This week, after arriving in Los Angeles, Barnes was  jolted out of bed by an earthquake. Some people thought it was just him  practicing.  </P> <P> This guy never knew the indoor track and field season could be so much fun.  </P> <P> Barnes, 22, caused a rumble of his own Friday night at the Sports Arena before  a crowd of 10,004 in the Sunkist Invitational. It may not have registered on  the Richter scale. But officials measured the fifth and last of his throws at  74 feet, 4 inches, a world indoor best mark and the ninth best throw of all  time, indoors or outdoors.  </P> <P> The previous world indoor best was held by Switzerland's Werner Guenthor at  73-0 1/2.  </P> <P> Barnes' record, naturally, is an American indoor best. But it might also count  as an American record, period. The only American ever to throw farther is Brian  Oldfield, but his 75-0 doesn't count as a record because the performance came  while he was a professional.  </P> <P> After Barnes' throw, the shot was impounded by officials of The Athletics  Congress, which governs the sport in the United States. It will be measured to  determine whether it meets size specifications for record consideration. Even  though they both weigh 16 pounds, indoor shots usually are larger in  circumference than outdoor shots.  </P> <P> That was the only world best set in this meet, but there were some other  competitive events. Two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom beat Greg Foster in  the 55-meter high hurdles, avenging a loss last Saturday at Dallas, and Jackie  Joyner-Kersee, in her first sprint ever, won the women's 60-yard dash. Evelyn  Ashford didn't run because of the flu.  </P> <P> In an upset, Doug Padilla won the 3,000 meters in a meet-record 7:57.02. Or at  least it would have been considered an upset if the Olympic steeplechase  champion, Kenya's Julius Kariuki, had been in any kind of shape at all. He  failed to finish. Or at least that was the official word.  </P> <P> "I think he's still running," meet promoter Al Franken said.  </P> <P> Franken had a right to be chagrined, considering that he consented to  renegotiate Kariuki's appearance fee, upward, of course, earlier this week.  </P> <P> Steve Scott proved that he wasn't ready to relinquish his title as the United  States' best miler, at least not on this night. He won in 4:00.80, holding off  2 runners who are supposed to be the event's future in this country, Olympian  Jeff Atkinson and NCAA champion Joe Falcon of Arkansas.  </P> <P> Even if Barnes had decided to sit out the last throw, he wouldn't have had a  bad night. He had three other throws over 70 feet. The second-place finisher,  Jim Doehring of San Clemente, had a best of 64-10.  </P> <P> "I knew the record was very attainable," said Barnes, who had the second- best  throw (71-10) ever by an American in the Dallas Morning News Games last  Saturday at Dallas, despite the incident early that morning in Jonesboro. The  rifle wasn't loaded, but the man and his companion still were arrested.  </P> <P> "I knew that if I didn't get the record, somebody else would. I don't want to  spend my entire career on the heels of somebody else. I wanted a world record  sometime in my career."  </P> <P> Barnes, who lives in College Station, Tex., said the record means more to him  than an Olympic gold medal would have. Going into the last round last summer at  Seoul, Barnes was leading. But East Germany's Ulf Timmermann won with a clutch  throw. Barnes finished second.  </P> <P> "That gave me a title, silver medalist," Barnes said. "I needed that. I was  tired of being considered this young kid with so much potential. But this is  even more special. Breaking a world record means that you've done something  that nobody has done before. They give Olympic medals every 4 years."  </P> <P> MEN'S 55-METER HURDLES -- Through the first four hurdles, it looked as if  Foster might win for the second time this indoor season against Kingdom.  </P> <P> But the fifth and last hurdle proved too much for Foster.  </P> <P> Kingdom won in 6.98 seconds to Foster's 7.02. Tonie Campbell, bronze medalist  at Seoul, was third in 7.13.  </P> <P> For the second straight week, Foster false-started and had to sit in the blocks  on the second start or risk disqualification. And just like last Saturday at  Dallas, he was able to catch Kingdom.  </P> <P> They were even through the fourth hurdle, which they both scraped. But then  Foster collided with the fifth hurdle.  </P> <P> Even though he was relieved to win, Kingdom didn't feel as if he has gained an  advantage over Foster, a two-time world champion who didn't qualify for the  Olympic team last year because of a broken arm. They are scheduled to meet  several more times this season.  </P> <P> "I don't care how many races you win," Kingdom said. "You still have doubts. I  didn't erase them tonight. I still didn't run a clean race."  </P> <P> Foster said he has to work on his start.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S 60-YARD DASH -- Joyner-Kersee was invited to Friday's inauguration, but  she didn't attend. Nothing personal against George Bush. She just said that she  is tired of traveling.  </P> <P> That turned out to be a wise decision. Ashford, who was supposed to run against  Joyner-Kersee, went to the Inauguration Gala Thursday night in Washington and  came home with the flu. She attended the meet but wasn't able to run.  </P> <P> Still, Joyner-Kersee, competing in a sprint for the first time since she used  to challenge her brother, Al, outside their house in East St. Louis, Ill., had  to beat a good field. Also entered were Olympians Gail Devers-Roberts, formerly  of UCLA, and Juliet Cuthbert of Jamaica.  </P> <P> Even though she didn't get a sprinter's start, standing almost straight up out  of the blocks, Joyner-Kersee won in 6.68, just off Ashford's meet record of  6.66. Devers-Roberts was second in 6.76 and Cuthbert third in 6.81.  </P> <P> "I felt like a big old Clydesdale out there," said Joyner-Kersee, who is  sprinting so that she can improve her speed for the long jump. "I'm too big to  be in the sprints."  </P> <P> MEN'S 60-YARD DASH -- Emmit King won in 6.15 to Brian Bridgewater's 6.27. But  the most interesting aspect of the race was former high school sensation  Houston McTear's comeback after 4 years away from the sport. He finished fourth  in 6.49.  </P> <P> He said he didn't feel too badly except that he would have liked to have gotten  a better start. He had to stay in the blocks after false-starting once.  </P> <P> "They took my start away from me," he said. "That's one thing I can still do. I  can still react to the gun."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PUTTING THE SHOT  </P> <P> All-time best performers in the shotput. * denotes Oldfield's mark does not  count as an American record because he performed it as a professional.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.20IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Athlete, Country  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Distance  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Ulf Timmermann, East Germany  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 75-8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Alessandro Andrei, Italy  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 75-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  *Brian Oldfield, USA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 75-0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Werner Guenthor, Switzerland  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 74-7 3/4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Randy Barnes, USA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 74-4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> GENERIC NOVEL WITH A FAMILIAR PLOT;  </P> <P> STARTING WITH SERGE BY LAURIE STONE DOUBLEDAY $18.95, 224 PAGES  </P> <P> Though you may not find this story in your tattered copy of "100 Sure-Fire  Plots," it's bound to be in the revised and updated edition, used by thousands  of satisfied authors; reviewed by smaller numbers of patient critics --  smaller, because most of us have read at least 100 variations of "Starting With  Serge." What we have here is the generic novel of the last three decades, in  its most fundamental form.  </P> <P> The narrator is Julie Stark, precocious daughter of Herschel, a man risen from  humble beginnings to affluence. Though the novel begins while the family still  lives in New York's Washington Heights, they soon move to the suburb of Luna  Island, a posh enclave that immediately disappoints them.  </P> <P> Julie's mother, Thea, dutifully goes to a PTA meeting, only to announce after  her first exposure that "it's not for me." Father Herschel joins the Kiwanis  club; he buys a set of golf clubs and a barbecue, but none of these bucolic  diversions turn out to be for him, either.  </P> <P> Every Friday night, Thea meets her husband in The City for diversion, returning  to the island with bags of delicatessen. "When I'd ask how the old neighborhood  was, they'd say 'Horrible. Horrible then and horrible now.' But they kept going  back."  </P> <P> The year is 1959, a time frame that provides Julie with a generous supply of  squareness to excoriate. When her sister Madelyn comes home from college in the  midst of her first semester after a minor nervous breakdown (that term was  still current), the entire Stark family eagerly embarks upon psychotherapy.  </P> <P> The guru is Serge, a Russian emigre shrink recommended by sophisticated brother  Wolf, whose wife and two daughters also are being treated by him. Though Serge  bears an uncannily close resemblance to Rasputin, the Starks have little in  common with the Romanovs, except for their geographical origins. Even so, they  fall under Serge's spell in exactly the same way as the Czar and Czarina,  believing absolutely in his ability to work wonders.  </P> <P> Madelyn stops "acting morose," loses weight and takes courses at NYU. Thea  registers at the New School and broadens her horizons by reading Swift and  Conrad. When family tensions become unbearable, Serge is called, and "the  yelling would stop, and my father would look content." Herschel was only a  phone patient, but soon young Julie becomes a full-fledged analysand, visiting  Serge for preventive therapy the year she enters a new private day school.  </P> <P> She's enchanted. Serge is her passport to maturity. "When I turned, Serge was  standing in the doorway, a man in his mid-60s, looking nothing like Moses and  everything like Charles Laughton in his Henry VIII period. . . . What can I do  to help you? he asked."  </P> <P> For the next quarter of the book, Julie tells him at considerable length, a  useful device that allows her to fill us in on the trials of growing up on Long  Island in the early '60s: girlish crushes, sexual awakening, alienation from  mother, adoration of father -- the lot.  </P> <P> Throughout this period, Julie is becoming stunningly attractive and amazingly  worldly for her years. By the time she's 15, she's invited by Serge for a  weekend at his summer house, proving conclusively that she can hold her own  with a gaggle of European intellectuals who sound like send-ups of Sartre and  De Beauvoir in the Deux Magots cafe.  </P> <P> "Men mistake their fears for reality and call this the world. Women are right  to be mistrustful." During this epochal weekend, Serge reveals himself for what  he is -- a dirty old man -- but Julie never tells anyone until 1980, when Part  II begins.  </P> <P> Julie is now a painter, the jaded veteran of several love affairs. Madelyn has  pulled herself together and become a tycoon, owning a chain of pizza shops, in  which her retired parents work until Herschel's grueling death. After this  event, Julie calls upon Serge's old friend Wildeweiss, whom she met at the  house party 20 years earlier. "I want to talk about Serge," she says, and he  promptly turns over a cache of letters to her.  </P> <P> Reading these, we become even more ambivalent about Serge than does our  narrator, but then, he wasn't our first Serge, not by a long shot.  </P> <P> Next: Carolyn See reviews "Springs of Living Water" by Karen Lawrence  (Villard).  </P></p>

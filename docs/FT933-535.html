			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (31): The billionaire king of sex and shopping / Media HOWARD HUGHES: THE SECRET LIFE By Charles Higham Sidgwick &amp; Jackson Pounds 16.99 360 pages THE MOST popular form of modern fiction is the sex and shopping novel, mainstay of airport bookstalls worldwide. The genre mixes a racy plot with generous bouts of sex, conducted in titillating places or positions, and orgies of shopping, usually for designer clothes. Charles Higham's new biography of Howard Hughes, the late American playboy, eccentric and businessman, is the non-fiction equivalent of a sex and shopping novel. Hughes' life, by turns romantically adventurous, sordid and bizarre, is racy enough for a dozen novels. The son of a Texan oil wildcatter who invented an immensely profitable drilling bit, Hughes took charge of the family tool business at the age of 18, on the death of his father. He developed a passion for the movie industry and by 24 had become established as an important independent producer in Hollywood. Simultaneously, he became hooked on flying, and one of America's most daring pioneer aviators. Bankrolled by his father's fortune, Hughes was able to indulge these enthusiasms with fabulous shopping sprees: he bought RKO, the Hollywood movie studio; he bought TWA, the airline; and he founded Hughes Aircraft, the aerospace manufacturing business now owned by General Motors. After moving to Las Vegas and becoming a recluse, he proceeded to buy up a good part of America's gambling capital. He died, aged 69, in 1975, in appropriate surroundings - an airplane cabin, on a flight to Houston. Hughes generated controversy. In Jewish-dominated Hollywood, he had a reputation for anti-semitism. His sexually suggestive films had trouble with the censors. He was, suggests Higham, a master of the art of bribery. 'I can buy any man in the world,' he is said to have declared. He fought an epic, ultimately successful legal battle with TWA. Higham asserts that Hughes' shady dealings even included involvement in the Watergate burglary which toppled Richard Nixon. Always prone to eccentricity, he became especially bizarre as he grew older: holed up in hotels, he would spend hours constructing neat piles of Kleenex boxes or sitting on toilet seats. And then there was his sex life. Higham portrays Hughes as a bisexual with an insatiable appetite, particularly for Hollywood stars. His conquests are said to have included Ginger Rogers, Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Cary Grant and Tyrone Power. The author even asserts that Hughes may have been an early, but undiagnosed, victim of Aids. However, Higham, whose previous books are mainly biographies of film stars, largely ignores Hughes's career as a businessman - dismissing him as a hopeless manager so obsessed by sex, flying and partying that he left the running of his empire to others. In Hughes' youth, says Higham, 'when balance sheets and tax charges reached him, he tossed them impatiently aside. Had he been the industrialist he was credited with being, he would have lost everything.' This seems too harsh a judgment. Hughes may have been an unpleasant human being and a poor manager, yet he was also a man of no small vision who played a pioneering role in the growth of the modern US aviation industry. Higham is also disappointing in his handling of his stated subject - Hughes' private life. The reader gets bogged down by his flat writing style, wealth of detail and strict adherence to chronology. Worse, Hughes never really comes alive, remaining a two-dimensional enigma. In biography, as in life, an unremitting diet of sex and shopping makes for a pretty shallow experience.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BORDER AREA TO GET 120 NEW CUSTOMS INSPECTORS  </P> <P> The U.S. Customs Service says it plans to place an additional 120 inspectors  along the California-Mexico border, but authorities say little immediate relief  is in sight to alleviate the frustrating traffic delays that plague the busy  crossings.  </P> <P> The new hires -- representing an increase of more than one-third of the  inspection staff here -- are not expected to be posted to the border area until  almost next spring, customs officials said, after the busy holiday season that  usually brings some of the biggest traffic jams.  </P> <P> The congestion in the lanes of traffic leading to San Diego, Calexico and other  U.S. border cities is a major irritant for travelers and businesses on both  sides of the border.  </P></p>

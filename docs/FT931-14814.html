			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner files shelf registration TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday offered a fresh indication of its determination to reduce its debt burden when it said it had filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise as much as Dollars 2bn. Although such shelf registrations are commonplace among US companies, Time Warner said that the net proceeds from the sale of up to Dollars 2bn of debt securities - to be sold from time to time depending on market conditions - would be used to repurchase or redeem preferred stock or bank debt. In particular, the company said some of the proceeds might be used to repurchase or redeem its Dollars 6.5bn of Series C or Series D preferred stock. The preferred stock, which in 1991 cost Time Warner Dollars 579m in dividend payments, was issued as a result of the 1989 merger agreement between Time and Warner. Yesterday's shelf registration came just a week after Time Warner launched a fully underwritten Dollars 1bn debenture issue also aimed at reducing its preferred stock. That move followed the company's recent statements that it could sell up to Dollars 3bn of non-strategic assets over the next couple of years to lower its debt load, which now totals Dollars 9bn. On Wall Street, yesterday Time Warner's share price was Dollars  1/8 higher at Dollars 32 1/8 at the close of trading.</p>

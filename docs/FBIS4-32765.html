			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, June 23--Poland and Romania are natural  partners with similar strategic goals and common security  interests, Romanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  Teodor Melescanu told a press conference in Warsaw on Friday.  According to him, both countries may cooperate in economy,  tourism, communications and on third markets.    Speaking about his two-day visit to Poland, Melescanu said  that it aimed to develop cooperation between the two countries,  especially between the Polish and Romanian parliaments. He said  that the Romanian president will visit Poland this autumn.  Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has also been invited to  visit Romania but the date has not been fixed yet.    During his visit Melescanu has presented some concrete  proposals how to boost mutual cooperation. He talked about the  reconstruction of an old railway route connecting the two  countries and setting up a Polish-Romanian tourist enterprise.  Melescanu thinks that such projects could be supported by the  European Union.    Speaking about Romanian debt to Poland now amounting to 50  million transfer roubles, the Romanian minister said that his  country will pay it off. He also hoped that any delays will not  hamper economic cooperation of the two countries which are of  similar size and which have similar problems.    In the morning, the Romanian guest laid flowers at the grave  of Jozef Beck, Poland's pre-war foreign minister who died during  the Second World War in Romania.</p>

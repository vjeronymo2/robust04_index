			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nasir Qamash] </F>   [Text] In a statement to AKHIR KHABAR, Information Minister  Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has said several reasons led to Prime  Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali's decision to cancel his  visit to Bucharest, where he was due to participate in the Grans  Montana Forum, in which politicians and businessmen from Europe  and the Middle East take part.    He said the most prominent of these reasons is the  inauguration of the extraordinary session of the House of  Representatives, and the rumors that Prime Minister al-Majali  would meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the  sidelines of the forum meetings. Al-'Anani said these reasons  called for adopting the decision not to go.    Meanwhile, Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan was not officially  informed of the schedule of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's tour in the region, and Jordan did not ask for  this schedule.    Al-'Anani was answering a question on AFP report that  Christopher will not stop in Amman and will meet with His  Majesty King Husayn in London next Monday.</p>

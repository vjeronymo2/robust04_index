			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Gardening: Rare varieties are blooming / A look at new marketing methods and specialist services TRADITIONALLY, most nurseries both grew their plants and sold them retail to the gardening public, many of them in the dormant or semi-dormant period between early October and the end of March. Then, some 30 years ago, came the development of container grown plants, which made it possible to sell plant varieties throughout the year. This brought a great increase in the number of retail outlets, most of which bought in the majority of the plants they sold. To supply them, many large wholesale nurseries developed, some of them the old multi-purpose nurseries, and there was a great increase in the total number of plants sold. But the range of plants tended to diminish since for some there was only a limited demand and this kind of trading favoured the popular, fast-selling plants. But the demand for specialities was still there and actually increased as a result of many people becoming interested in gardening who would not previously have been attracted to it. Such specialist nurseries began to appear in increasing numbers, each with its own range of plants and often based on a family who supplied all the labour, so that costs could be kept low. Though most of these grew plants in containers so that they could be planted on impulse at any time of the year, some also carried on a mail-order trade in the traditional way and were greatly helped by the appearance of The Plant Finder. This is an annual publication which lists alphabetically all the plants that are known to be available and gives the names and addresses of the nurseries, large and small, from which they can be obtained. From just small beginnings, it has grown rapidly until it now contains 55,000 varieties of plants, cross-referenced to many hundreds of nursery addresses. The 1992 edition costs Pounds 10.99, is published by Headmain Ltd in association with The Hardy Plant Society and can be obtained through any bookshop. Now comes Hillier Nurseries, Ampfield House, Romsey, Hampshire, with an entirely new method of marketing plants, which is intended to combine the best of the old with the best of the new. Hillier's Nurseries have for a good many years been one of the great nurseries of the country, probably with the longest list of rare species of trees, shrubs and climbing plants of anyone, but facing the difficulty that if varieties were only in small demand, it did not pay to propagate them. The basic idea behind the new way is to make the Hillier specialities more familiar to the gardening public and much more readily available. In the changing conditions of recent years, Hillier Nurseries have become wholesale suppliers to many retail nurseries and garden centres. Some of these have been organised as suppliers of Hillier's specialities under special order direct from the customer, just as one might order a special book from a bookseller who might not be prepared to stock it on the off-chance that someone would come along and buy it. A special list has been prepared known as Hillier Nurseries Premier Plants and will be revised quite frequently so that it can be kept right up to date with plants of which the nurseries do have stock available for immediate supply. This list contains simply the names of the plants, the sizes available and the price ready for collection at the supplier of the customer's choice. Further information, if required, can be had from a variety of other sources, including several well-illustrated books published by Hillier Nurseries and also the excellent Illustrated Encyclopedia of Gardening published by the Royal Horticultural Society. The Hillier Nurseries Premier Plants edition which I have before me is the autumn and winter edition 1992 and another is promised by February and will include plants for the conservatory and other tender species. This one is concerned primarily with trees and shrubs but also includes some bamboos, grasses and just a few roses. The special catalogue lists 78 retail outlets in Britain, one in Jersey, Channel Islands, and one at Lisieux, France. The plants supplied are bare-rooted which is possible by this form of delivery direct by lorry from Hillier Nurseries to the point of sale. There is considerable advantage to this, especially with trees and the larger shrubs, since the roots have not all become bound together in an unnatural ball. They are protected by polythene film during travel but must either be planted promptly on arrival or heeled-in temporarily if the soil is not in a suitable condition for permanent planting. Heeling-in involves digging a wide trench, laying the plants at an angle with their roots in this trench and covering with soil, treading well down. Treated in this way they will remain in good condition for weeks. It would, of course, be possible for any wholesale nursery to do something similar and it will be interesting to see if the idea catches on.</p>

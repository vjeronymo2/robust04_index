			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Incentive to make ships safer Sir, Charles Batchelor's article, 'US 'black list' worries world shipowners' (June 27), quite rightly pointed out many of the problems associated with the black list approach to controlling sub-standard ships. While not denying the value of the work done by some port state bodies, the escalation of regulatory zeal embodied in the black list approach unfortunately is not the solution to this world wide problem. A better approach is the development of a 'white list' mooted by Paul Slater of First International last year. This approach overcomes many of the problems raised by Captain Joyce of the International Chamber of Shipping, referred to in Charles Batchelor's article. The white list would include only ships that meet clearly specified safety criteria. Thus there would be substantial pressure on sub-standard owners to ensure their ships are in a suitable condition to secure charters, to lower insurance premiums etc. Large-scale charterers could establish an inspection service, the results of which they could share for a fee. This alternative to the black list would be more effective as there is a positive incentive for shipowners to achieve and maintain a position on the white list rather than doing just enough maintenance to avoid being detained if the ship is unlucky enough to be inspected by port state bodies. As with the port state control solution there are costs of developing such a data base, but these would be minimal in comparison since the onus is on the shipowner to meet white list criteria by offering his ship for inspection. The white list is a lower cost market based solution to the charterer's problem of avoiding unsafe ships. Absence from the white list should automatically attract the attention of regulators. The list has an inbuilt positive incentive for compliance rather than creating an expanding regulatory structure which can be abused by the true targets of the legislation as easily as current legislation is avoided.

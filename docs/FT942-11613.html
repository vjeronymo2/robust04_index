			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US hits at barriers to film, TV exports The US audio-visual industry, the country's second largest exporter, claims it is under siege around the world, fettered by quotas, discriminated against by tax laws and a target for pirates who sell illegal duplicates of films and television programmes. This, at least, is the contention of the Motion Picture Export Association, and its colourful chairman, Mr Jack Valenti, who in a new report cites what he says is a 'catalogue of artificial barriers erected by governments on every continent, whose aim is to shrink the reach of American visual entertainment and to baffle the movement of our products in world market places.' According to MPEAA, China's piracy costs the US industry an estimated Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.5m) in exports; it has also thrown up 'a vast array of market restrictions' to legitimate US exports. Until recently there were few pirate videos of US products in China, according to a US lawyer. But the market has grown with rising purchases of VCRs. Political relaxation has made enforcement a more important issue. Europe remains the film industry's largest market, which is why 'cultural protectionism' which limits US TV programming has become a live issue. Italy and Turkey were singled out for 'continuous and unacceptably high levels of piracy exacerbated by lack of legal protection and insufficient penalties for enfringement.' Piracy is also a problem in Poland and Hungary along with concerns on currency convertibility, freedom to remit earnings and distribute filmed entertainment with minimal government control. In Latin America, there are worries about 'an emerging trend' toward use of revenues from the sale of foreign films to support the national industry. The Middle East has become 'a transshipment centre' for pirated products. A long crusade on intellectual property rights has won the industry powerful Washington friends in both Congress and the White House. Hollywood campaigns for politicians and helps finance their campaign. Film directors, such as Mr Steven Spielberg and Mr Martin Scorsese, issued statements equating artistic freedom with open markets. Even clout could not contend with the intricacies of US-China trade relations. When the deadline came for Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, to release the Special 301 lists designating countries for talks and potential sanctions for intellectual property rights violations, naming of China as a 'priority foreign country' was delayed until June 30. Mr Valenti expressed disappointment. 'It is an open and shut case,' he said. 'Piracy in China is visible and confirmable.' Inclusion of intellectual property rights in the planned new World Trade Organisation, if it is approved, will allow the US to take many of these complaints to a multilateral forum. But, according to the US lawyer, the US will still have to sometimes act unilaterally because 'even copyright laws consistent with the WTO may not be adequate because of advances in technology.'</p>

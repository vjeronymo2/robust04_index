			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S THE COOLEST JOB AROUND;  </P> <P> VENDOR: INTO THE HEAT RIDES A TRUCK WITH FROZEN DELIGHTS FOR KIDS. FOR JIM CASE  AND OTHERS LIKE HIM, IT'S A CHANCE TO MAKE A LIVING AND BECOME A NEIGHBORHOOD  HERO.  </P> <P> With music tinkling from its loudspeaker, the Mel-O-Dee ice cream truck prowled  subdivision streets near Avenida de Las Flores.  </P> <P> At the wheel, 33-year-old Jim Case -- a former carpenter now better known as  the Ice Cream Man -- was scanning the sidewalks for customers and explaining  what he does.  </P> <P> "It helps if you like kids, of course," Case said with a grin. "And it helps if  you're still a kid yourself. . . . You have to do a little schmoozing with the  clientele. You have to relate to them."  </P> <P> It was another hot day in Case's territory -- the fast-growing, new towns of  eastern Orange County.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana an hour earlier, as Case loaded his truck with Sno Cones, Slimers,  Blue Ghosts, Cowabunga Bars and other icy delights, the temperature was in the  70s. But by early afternoon on this backcountry route, his cab thermometer was  hitting 90.  </P> <P> It was ice cream weather, Case observed -- but then nearly every day is a good  day to sell ice cream.  </P> <P> As if to prove his point, a band of children waved at him, and, clutching  fistfuls of money, ran to his truck.  </P> <P> "Hi, guys," Case said casually. "Whatcha gonna have?"  </P> <P> Eileen Ramirez, 11, asked for a UFO, a circle of vanilla ice cream wedged  between chocolate cookies that also goes by the name Unidentified Frozen  Object. Mike Strizik, 12, wheeled up on neon-laced, black roller blades to buy  that old-time favorite, a Drumstick -- a 75-cent cone laced with  chocolate-and-peanut topping.  </P> <P> "It's good stuff," Mike observed. "But he (Case) always has good candy, good  food. Everyone likes the Ice Cream Man."  </P> <P> Ice cream men and women like Case are part of a longstanding American  tradition.  </P> <P> Around 1905, someone got the idea of selling ice cream from a horse and cart,  said Dave Sarin, owner of Santa Ana's Mel-O-Dee Ice Cream, which leases compact  white trucks to drivers like Case.  </P> <P> Over the years, as vendors traded their horse-drawn carts for trucks, ice cream  sales flourished, Sarin said. A major setback came with the oil crisis of the  mid-1970s. As fuel prices soared, national firms like the Good Humor Corp. sold  off their trucks, concentrating instead on making ice cream for the dairy case.  </P> <P> Still, local and regional ice cream vendors have remained. This year, Sarin  estimated, Orange County boasts perhaps 100 vendors, some leasing the 30  Mel-O-Dee trucks, others leasing 40 trucks from a rival Santa Ana firm,  Tropical Ice Cream, and still others driving their own vehicles.  </P> <P> The competition is friendly, said Tropical owner Hossein Nabati. "Everybody has  enough business out there. You go out. The kids are gonna buy. . . . There's  something about ice cream. When you see it you smile. It brings the kid out of  you, no matter what your age."  </P> <P> But not everyone is smiling. Leaders in half a dozen Orange County cities have  declared ice cream trucks a nuisance -- even "a menace."  </P> <P> After a 9-year-old was run over and killed near an ice cream truck, Santa Ana  officials in 1984 enacted regulations that bar vendors from playing music in  city limits and require them to carry $1 million in liability insurance.  </P> <P> Other cities have similar restrictions. Yorba Linda, for instance, bans the  vehicles entirely. And in an effort to cut congestion on narrow streets, a  Newport Beach ordinance prohibits street sales of any food south of Coast  Highway -- which includes west Newport and anywhere on the Peninsula, said City  Atty. Robert Burnham.  </P> <P> The vendors call such ordinances an unfair restriction of their business.  </P> <P> But in new communities such as Rancho Santa Margarita, Robinson Ranch and  Portola Hills, Case hasn't had to contend with regulations. His biggest  problem, he said, comes from some of his customers -- the indecisive ones.  </P> <P> After all, to make a living he needs to close sales quickly and move on to the  next customer, he said. But, "Have you ever tried to get a 5-year-old to hurry  up?"  </P> <P> Still, he enjoys the children, so he tries be nice when they procrastinate.  </P> <P> "You want 'Um'? " he said patiently that afternoon to a little girl who  couldn't make up her mind. "I don't have any 'Um.' " When, finally, she settled  on a "Fun Dip," he helped her count her pennies to get the correct change.  </P> <P> In his three years of selling ice cream here, Case said the subdivisions have  grown so fast that his route has lengthened considerably. When he began, he  served four housing tracts and finished his route in 90 minutes. Now it takes  him six to seven hours.  </P> <P> Still, he knows many customers -- children and their parents -- by their first  names.  </P> <P> With his shoulder-length blonde hair, sleeveless T-shirt and faded jeans, Case  admits he doesn't resemble the legendary Good Humor Man. As the old ads  depicted them, the earlier vendors wore close-cropped black hair and a uniform  -- crisp white jacket, white pressed pants and a slim black tie.  </P> <P> "That's a little overly formal for this day and age," Case said.  </P> <P> Case also admits something close to sacrilege: He doesn't like ice cream. "No,  I rarely eat the stuff," he said. He doesn't like all the artificial flavors.  And "I just don't care for sweets," although occasionally he'll eat a fruit  bar.  </P> <P> Overall, he enjoys the job. Being the Ice Cream Man, said Case, is "like any  job. It's got its good points and bad points. But it's kinda neat being like a  hero to the kids."  </P></p>

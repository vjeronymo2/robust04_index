Mahler, closing out a 4-day preliminary  hearing in the Newport Beach court, ruled there was enough evidence to order  Allen J. Lindsey, 23, bound over for trial on a murder charge.  </P> <P> Chulapatrcheevin, 45, a native of Thailand, was found dead of a stab wound Jan.  19 in his Balboa Peninsula duplex. Five days later, police arrested Lindsey in  Hollywood after he was found driving the doctor's missing Mercedes-Benz 560-SL.  </P> <P> Lindsey and his attorney have maintained that the Hollywood man killed the  doctor in self-defense and have suggested that the pair may have been  homosexually linked.  </P></p>

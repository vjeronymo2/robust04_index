			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has  expressed regret that the Sudanese opposition is seeking  protection from foreign forces to achieve its goals. He said  the foremost concern of the so-called opposition is now an  attempt to impose sanctions against Sudan. He added that the  meeting in the British House of Commons in which the scattered  remnants of the opposition are participating is not of concern.  He said the opposition's talk of a war of extermination taking  place in the south is completely devoid of truth and that Sudan  denies the prejudiced allegations against it. He said what is  going in the south at present is fighting between the various  factions of the rebellion and that the Sudanese Army is doing  its duty to spread security and to preserve the unity of Sudan.</p>

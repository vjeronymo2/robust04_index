			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME OFFICIALS DUBIOUS ON AID TO ARTS;  </P> <P> FUNDING: SEVERAL SUPERVISORS REACT DOUBTFULLY ON PROPOSAL TO HELP SUPPORT  COUNTYWIDE ARTS SERVICE ORGANIZATION BUT TAKE A WAIT-AND-SEE POSITION.  </P> <P> Some members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors sounded a somewhat  dubious but familiar note Tuesday about prospects of funding a proposed  countywide arts service organization, which made its recommendations public a  day earlier. But top county officials also say it is premature to assess those  recommendations fully.  </P> <P> The ad-hoc Committee to Form an Orange County Arts Council, which delivered its  recommendations to supervisors last week, is proposing that the county  contribute $125,000 "in cash and/or in-kind services" toward a $285,200  first-year budget for the agency. Other money would come from the state and  federal government and the private sector.  </P> <P> The county, now one of only two in the state without an arts service agency,  has been without one since 1988, when the 14-year-old Orange County Arts  Alliance dissolved.  </P> <P> County supervisors contacted this week said they want to reserve final comment  on the recommendations until the County Administrative Office evaluates them.  That office, at Supervisor Thomas F. Riley's request, is studying the county's  role in arts support and is reviewing the committee's recommendations as part  of the report, Riley said. The study is to be completed April 2.  </P> <P> "There's not much to talk about," Riley said. Asked if it was likely that the  county, whose support of the arts historically has been close to nil, would  fund the proposed agency, he said, "I don't want to discourage anybody . . .  but I don't believe the Board of Supervisors' past performance certainly has  indicated that (the arts have) a higher priority than the homeless or some  other projects.  </P> <P> "I'm really not sure how much support there is today when money for (social)  programs is such a difficult thing to find," Riley said, repeating a position  he has espoused in recent years.  </P> <P> Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also spoke of competition for county dollars. "I'm  not closed to evaluating merits of (the committee's) proposal . . . but  $125,000 is a significant request in the face of other budgetary demands we  have. It will have to compete with other priorities for county services."  </P> <P> The 27-member committee composed of arts and community officials is  recommending that the council be established by July 1 and that it develop ways  to substantially increase local funding and arts education, draft a long-term  strategic cultural plan, be designated by the county as a "state-local  partner," its official arts representative to the state, and serve other needs.  </P> <P> Committee officials have stressed that county support is critical to the new  agency's survival.  </P> <P> But Charles Desmarais, committee president and director of the Laguna Art  Museum, said Tuesday that the recommendations are "suggestions only," and that  he'd "rather not concentrate too much" on the committee's proposed budget. The  committee would welcome any ways the county could help meet the needs of the  arts community as outlined in the committee's recommendations. The list of  needs is based largely on information gathered last year during committee  meetings attended by more than 175 local arts officials.  </P> <P> "It is our hope that sources of funds could be identified that wouldn't be in  direct competition with money for the homeless, etc.," Desmarais said. But "if  the basic needs we've outlined can be met with half as much money, that's  wonderful. We'd enthusiastically support any alternatives."  </P> <P> According to Gloria Woodlock, manager of the state program for county arts  agencies, most of these 56 "state-local partners," even in "rural and  economically depressed areas," receive some county funding. The committee has  applied for $12,500 from the California Arts Council, money it could receive  only if designated by the county as a "state-local partner."  </P> <P> Woodlock also said that $285,200 to launch the proposed agency is a "good  start." But, she added, "in a community the size of Orange County, they'll have  to find additional funding to be able to accomplish anything."  </P></p>

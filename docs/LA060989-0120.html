			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ILLEGAL ENTRIES FROM MEXICO HELD UNABATED  </P> <P> The landmark overhaul of the U.S. immigration law enacted in 1986 has thus far  failed to substantially reduce the huge numbers of Mexican nationals entering  the United States illegally, an academic study here has found.  </P> <P> The conclusions, reached by researchers for the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies  at UC San Diego, contradict statements by U.S. immigration authorities and  congressional representatives who assert that the law is working as designed.  </P> <P> The academicians, who conducted a two-year study of the effects of the 1986  law, reported that Mexican migrants are continuing to flow northward, with or  without documentation, and that 41% of those who had jobs and were interviewed  had resorted to using false or borrowed immigration documents in order to  secure work, thus circumventing the law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work Available, Study Says  </P> <P> Despite new legal sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, the  study found that most migrants continue to find work in the United States and  that few were returning to Mexico, which is believed to account for more than  90% of the illegal immigrants entering the United States.  </P> <P> Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies and head of  the study, said: "No viable alternative to migrating to the United States has  developed in these communities, so they're continuing to send people."  </P> <P> Moreover, Cornelius, an expert on Mexico and immigration, said migrants were  increasingly arriving from areas of Mexico relatively new to the migrant  stream, such as Mexico City and the states of Mexico, Guerrero and Oaxaca. The  development is an ominous one for U.S. policy-makers seeking to deter illegal  immigration, Cornelius said, as it indicates that new migrant networks are  being created.  </P> <P> The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, the most comprehensive revision of  the nation's immigration laws in more than three decades, was designed largely  to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants, mostly Mexicans, into the United  States via the U.S.-Mexican border.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Link to Economy  </P> <P> Cornelius and others have argued that the law likely would be ineffective as  long as Mexico's economy continued to deteriorate.  </P> <P> INS and congressional officials disputed the results of the study, asserting  that the law was indeed deterring illegal immigration. Among other things,  authorities noted that arrests of illegal aliens along the U.S.-Mexican border  -- long considered the best single indicator of undocumented immigration -- had  declined precipitously since passage of the new immigration law.  </P> <P> U.S. authorities have attributed the decline in arrests at the border in part  to the deterrent effect of the "employer sanction" sections of the new law.  Those provisions require that all employers check prospective workers'  documentation to determine that they are authorized to work in the United  States.  </P> <P> The decline in arrests at the border, Cornelius said, is more likely linked to  the fact that more than 3 million one-time illegal residents have been granted  legal status via the amnesty program, and are now able to cross the border  legally.  </P></p>

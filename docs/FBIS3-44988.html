In the course  of building a socialist market economic system, we should regard  as an important task supporting major grain and cotton  production areas in developing their economies and ensuring a  steady increase in grain and cotton production; we should ensure  that this task is properly carried out.    From 13 to 18 December, Wen Jiabao inspected the  agricultural  production and rural work and visited peasant households in  Suqian, Shuyang, Hongze, Jinhu, and other cities and counties of  Huaiyin City, and held discussions with local cadres on issues  concerning the current rural reform and development.    Over the last few years, while ensuring a steady increase in  grain production, Huaiyin City, located in the heartland of  northern Jiangsu, has made use of local resources to forcefully  develop a diversified economy and the processing of agricultural  and sideline products, opening up a path for rural economic  development that is in line with local reality and bringing  about big changes in local rural areas. Wen Jiabao fully  approved Huaiyin Prefecture's experience in agricultural and  rural economic development and offered his opinions on deepening  rural reform. He said: Rural reform is an important part of our  efforts to build a socialist market economic system. From the  very beginning, China's rural reform has been market-oriented.  It has two important characteristics: First, peasants are given  full decision-making powers such as what to produce and how to  deal with their products to rally the masses of peasants'  enthusiasm. Second, the agriculture and rural economy have been  made market-oriented to give play to market mechanism.  Actually, these are a successful practice of building a new  socialist market economic system in rural areas. To continue to  deepen rural reform, currently we need to do a good job in the  following three areas: First, while making the household  contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to  output more firmly established and making efforts to refine the  system, we should strive to budget rural economic resources in  the optimum manner and to enable production elements to flow  more freely. Second, we should develop rural markets, invigorate  rural circulation, and take various measures to link the  decentralized productions of individual households to a unified  market. Third, the government should provide better guidance  for agricultural production, give greater support and protection  to it, strengthen regulation and control over it, and develop a  better socialized service system. Wen Jiabao continued: Next  year is a crucial year for our reform; various major reform  measures will be instituted next year. We must place importance  on rural work, strengthen agriculture's position as the  foundation of the national economy, ensure a steady growth in  grain and cotton production, ensure the supply of agricultural  and sideline products, and ensure a stable market of these  products to create a favorable economic climate and a stable  social environment for the reform.    Commenting on the fact that Huaiyin City had reaped bumper  grain harvests in the past few years but its peasants' income  had been comparatively low, Wen Jiabao pointed out: Major grain  and cotton production areas are extremely important to the  country's grain and cotton production; therefore, we should take  effective measures to speed up these areas' economic  development. First, we should regulate the current grain and  cotton prices by implementing reasonable price policies, so to  reasonably raise the relatively low prices and to improve the  relative economic efficiency of grain and cotton production.  Second, while ensuring a steady increase in grain and cotton  production, we should make the rural industrial structures more  rational; should forcefully develop a diversified economy and  town and village enterprises in rural areas -- in particular, we  should develop the livestock and poultry industry and the  processing of agricultural and sideline products; and should  choose the development path of combining efforts to increase  production and to develop value-added processing industries.  Third, governments at all levels should appropriately pool  their financial resources to support economic development of  major grain and cotton production areas.    Wen Jiabao stressed: The key to deepening rural reform and  to  accelerating the economic development in major grain and cotton  production areas is to have good leaders. Party members and  grass-roots cadres in rural areas not only should take the lead  in getting better of, but also should lead the masses to achieve  common prosperity. He urged grass-roots cadres in rural areas  to earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, to carry through the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the Central Rural Work Meeting, to emancipate  their minds, seek truth from facts, be self-reliant, work hard  to pioneer new spheres of endeavors, and further advance rural  reform and economic development.    Those accompanying Wen Jiabao during his inspection tour  included Cao Hongmin, deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial  CPC Committee; and Wan Baorui, vice minister of agriculture.</p>

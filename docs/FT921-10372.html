			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Mohammed is favourite name for Israeli babies IN ISRAEL last year, the most popular name for newborn babies was not Moshe, or Rachel, but Mohammed. Third most popular, according to Interior Ministry figures, was Ahmed. The explanation lies in the fact that the birth rate among Israel's Arab minority is much greater, proportionately, than among the Jewish population, a trend which has profound long-term political implications. Official figures show that in 1991, Israel's 4.1m Jews produced 71,000 babies, while the Arab population of 900,000 produced 30,000. The official Arab numbers include 150,000 in occupied East Jerusalem but not those in the West Bank and Gaza. Israeli concern to prevent a steady erosion of the Jewish majority is one of the reasons the country's leaders have rejoiced at the flood of Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union over the past two years. It is also one of the reasons why there is anxiety over a recent fall in the numbers of olim, or immigrants, arriving from the Commonwealth of Independent States. In 1991 and 1990, immigration totalled more than 370,000, the vast majority coming from Russia and other former Soviet states. This boosted annual Jewish population growth to more than 5 per cent, ahead of the Arab rate of about 3 per cent for the first time in some years. With officials confidently predicting the arrival of a further 600,000 to 700,000 Jews from the CIS by mid-decade, the Israeli fear that the Arab minority would within three decades account from more than one quarter of the population - gaining, for example, enough electoral power to make or break governments - receded. Officials talked of the Jewish state gaining 'critical mass'. However, the severe economic difficulties engendered by immigration, particularly unemployment of 10 per cent and rising, have recently been blamed for a sharp decline in the the numbers of immigrants from the CIS. In January, immigration totalled just under 7,375, of whom 6,237 were from former Soviet territories, the lowest monthly count since the explosion of Soviet emigration in late 1989. 'I think we are on the verge of missing a big opportunity for immigration because of the hardships of severe unemployment and housing problems,' said Mr Uri Gordon, a senior official at the Jewish Agency, the body responsible for immigration, last week. 'Continuation of the current situation could slowly extinguish immigration.' That view is seen by many as too pessimistic. A few years ago, monthly Jewish immigration of more than 5,000 would have been seen as a spectacular achievement by the government. If so, the Jewishness of the Jewish state will be cemented. But in the broader context of both Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, the immigration wave is not expected to delay for very long the catch-up effect of a faster Arab birth-rate. Reuter adds from Washington: Mr James Baker, the secretary of state, said yesterday the US would not grant Israel the Dollars 10bn loan guarantees unless it was sure the money would not be used to promote policies it opposed. Speaking to the Senate foreign relations committee, Mr Baker made it clear the US was by no means committed to giving Israel any or all of the aid it has requested to pay for the immigration of hundreds of thousands of people from the former Soviet Union. He did not mention the word 'settlements' but that clearly was his intent when he said: 'We should give consideration to those things that would make it clear that if we were going to do this we would do it in a manner that supported United States policy and not in manner that ran counter to United States policy.'</p>

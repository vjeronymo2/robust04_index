			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Brussels urges UN troops for Somalia THE European Commission yesterday joined the call for an urgent United Nations military intervention in Somalia as UN officials in Mogadishu said they were nearing agreement with the battling warlords on the arrival of armed UN guards to protect relief operations. The Commission said the EC's 12 member states should immediately put pressure on the UN to ensure food and medical supplies were 'protected by a greater number of blue berets. Without protection,' the Commission went on, 'international organisations and non-governmental organisations face strict limits on their activities.' According to the Commission, UN intervention is now 'extremely urgent'. The Commission also said it could unblock funds to assist with greater humanitarian action. Aid workers say the security situation and massive looting and banditry make it impossible to distribute food to the most malnourished. Gen Mohammed Farrar Aideed, a warlord who controls the south of Mogadishu, has consistently blocked intervention of foreign troops, saying it threatens Somalia's sovereignty. However, a UN official in Mogadishu said yesterday that Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, the UN secretary-general's representative in Somalia, was close to getting Gen Aideed's agreement for limited military intervention to secure the port and international airport and perhaps to establish safe food corridors. 'It's looking much better and we could have an agreement within 48 hours,' he said. In Nairobi Mr Abdul Mohammed, an expert on relief in the Horn of Africa, criticised the lack of action. 'It is absolutely immoral for the UN and the world to listen to warlords who talk of sovereignty while they fail to feed their people or provide basic law and order,' he said. A UN mission is now in Somalia considering how to improve delivery of massive food aid. They will report to the secretary-general by the weekend. Their report will form the basis of further action by the Security Council. In Mogadishu Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, told Irish radio the catastrophe in Somalia was a 'worse obscenity' than Bosnia and called for the European Commission to double its aid. Another African organisation added its voice yesterday to criticism of the poor efforts of the international community to alleviate the horrendous plight of millions of starving Somalis. Ms Rakiya Omar, the executive director of Africa Watch, said: 'The world is only acting now on Somalia because of intense media and public pressure. They have known about the tragedy for months and their record is a disgrace.'</p>

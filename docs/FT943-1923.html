			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Ireland's only steel mill to close Directors of loss-making state-owned Irish Steel have recommended the closure of its Cork-based steel plant - Ireland's only steel mill - which would involve the loss of 520 jobs. The decision, taken at a board meeting yesterday, follows the failure of the company to win agreement from its craft unions on a survival plan which has been backed by the board, the government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and other Irish Steel workers. The survival plan was aimed at increasing flexibility among the workforce but Irish Steel said yesterday that 'despite public statements it is now clear that there is no basis for any agreement forthcoming' from the craft unions. Mr Pat Dineen, Irish Steel chairman, and Mr Leslie Buckley, acting chief executive, were due to meet Mr Ruairi Quinn, minister for enterprise and employment, last night. If Mr Quinn accepts the recommendation, a liquidator will be appointed.</p>

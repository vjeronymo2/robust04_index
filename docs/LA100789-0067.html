			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWISH RECONSTRUCTIONISTS PRINT PRAYER BOOK FOR MODERN TIMES  </P> <P> A new prayer book recently issued by the Jewish Reconstructionist movement is  breaking new ground in American Judaism in its concern for feminist language,  ecology and personal spirituality.  </P> <P> "It's a do-it-yourself prayer book. . . . It doesn't have to be used only in  synagogues, so more Jews will use it at home," said Rabbi David A. Teutsch,  editor-in-chief of the prayer book.  </P> <P> Called in Hebrew "Kol Haneshama," the prayer book was introduced in September.  It will be used first on an experimental basis for Sabbath eve and synagogue  services in the approximately 60,000-member Federation of Reconstructionist  Congregations and Havurot.  </P> <P> Reconstructionist Judaism was founded by Mordecai Kaplan in 1940. The movement  does not see the Jewish religion as having been supernaturally revealed to  Moses but rather as a civilization that adapts tradition and beliefs to  changing times.  </P> <P> The new prayer book is the second such book for the Reconstructionists since  1945. According to Teutsch, the book reflects the changes that have taken place  in the American Jewish community since 1945, while also addressing  Reconstructionist concerns on current issues.  </P> <P> "When our first siddur (prayer book) was published nearly half a century ago,  Jews were struggling to assimilate into North American society. Today a great  ethnic awakening among Jews has taken place, and many Jews are trying to find  their way into Judaism. This prayer book is for them," he said.  </P> <P> The book is suited for use by individuals and small groups, known as havurots.  </P></p>

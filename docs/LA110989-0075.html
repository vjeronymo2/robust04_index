			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> CHURCH CONSTRUCTION OKD  </P> <P> The City Council approved construction of a Jehovah's Witnesses church in the  city's Sunset Park area.  </P> <P> The mayor and one council member said the large turnout in favor of the church  -- more than 100 supporters attended Tuesday night's council meeting -- helped  sway their votes. The vote was 5 to 1, with Councilman David Finkel absent.  </P> <P> The project was technically denied by the city Planning Commission in October  because the commission cast only three votes in favor of the plan, instead of  the mandatory four.  </P> <P> The structure, to be built at 2119 Virginia Ave., will replace the Jehovah's  Witnesses building on Pico Boulevard, which will probably be sold, a church  attorney said.  </P> <P> A small number of people opposing the church said it would create greater  traffic congestion on narrow Virginia Avenue. Supporters, however, said it  would not create significant traffic and would be a good neighbor.  </P></p>

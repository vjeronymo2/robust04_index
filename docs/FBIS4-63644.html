			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Nona Maravava] </F>   [Text] The Georgian opposition is actively utilizing the  Abkhazian problem in the fight against Shevardnadze.    [Maravava] If Eduard Shevardnadze does not resign by 26 May,  then on Georgian independence day the Georgian people should  demonstrate for the resignation of the head of state. This  statement was made by Irakliy Tsereteli, the leader of the  National Independence Party. The idea of holding a protest  action has been supported by several other opposition parties.    Today the republic's internal political life is like a time  bomb. The agreement on Abkhazia signed in Moscow on 14 May has  caused an explosion of indignation in the parliamentary  opposition. Demands for the head of state's resignation  followed immediately, as did calls for a boycott of parliament  sessions until the institution of head of state is abolished and  an exclusively parliamentary form of government adopted.    Boris Kakubava, the leader of the Abkhazian Liberation  Union,  has appealed to the Georgian Supreme Court to instigate  proceedings against Shevardnadze as a traitor to his country.  Thus, the opposition has set off along the path of radical  struggle.    As regards the majority it is in full battle readiness, and  is calling for a boycott of supreme legislative body sessions,  accusing the opposition of trying to drag Georgia into chaos and  war.    The head of state himself, in regard to Georgian statehood  day, today appealed to all political forces to make the maximum  effort to achieve unity and accord and not put narrow party  interests ahead of state interests.</p>

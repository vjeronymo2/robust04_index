			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Japan's Auto Exports Decline: Japan's auto exports in October dropped 13.6%  from September and 11.4% from a year ago to 462,548 units, mostly because of a  substantial decline of shipments to the United States, the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers Assn. said. Exports to the United States, the biggest overseas  auto market for Japan, declined 24.3% from a year ago to 191,369 units, while  those to Europe increased to 128,792 units, up 15.4%. October exports totaled  $5.17 billion, down 15.7% from September's $6.14 billion and down 8.7% from a  year ago.  </P></p>

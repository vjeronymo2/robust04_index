			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa by </F> Korea Broadcasting System reporter Choe Tong-ho held in the  Japanese prime minister's residence in Tokyo on 11 March --  recorded; Choe asks questions in Korean, and Prime Minister  Hosokawa answers in Japanese with a simultaneous translation  into Korean]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Choe Tong-ho] During the  recent Japan-U.S. or U.S.-Japan talks, you, Mr. Prime Minister,  said no to the United States with confidence. A photograph of  the summit talks in the White House shows President Clinton and  you turning your faces away from each other. The United States  is now threatening to revive the Super 301 provision.  Nevertheless, a global trend is that the center of the global  economy is now moving from Europe and the United States to the  Asia-Pacific region. What will be Japan's role in the  Asia-Pacific economic sphere?    [Hosokawa] Regrettably, no agreement was reached on the  comprehensive economic consultations during my talks with  President Clinton. However, Japan-U.S. relations cover not only  automobiles, financing, and the insurance markets but politics,  security, and international cooperation.    It is very regrettable that no agreement was reached on  economic issues. However, President Clinton and I have  continued our dialogue to ensure that this does not adversely  affect overall bilateral relations and that the two countries  handle this issue cool-headedly.    The report that President Clinton and I turned our faces  away  from each other is not true. The two of us left the meeting  room shoulder to shoulder. The photograph recently carried in  newspapers was taken when President Clinton looked back a little  bit earlier than I did.    Frankly, it is regrettable that no agreement was reached.  However, President Clinton and I agreed to continue  consultations. I have continued phone consultations ever since.    Concerning the Super 301 provision, I expect that the United  States will make a sensible judgment and action. It is  unthinkable the notion that Japan will make no effort just  because no agreement was reached on comprehensive consultations.  Japan will make positive, substantial efforts in the future.  We are hurriedly making efforts at cabinet meetings and on  other occasions to map out meaningful measures before the end of  March. [passage omitted]    [Choe] The North Korean nuclear issue is a matter of concern  not only in the ROK, Japan, and the United States, but also in  the world. In particular, by using the nuclear card, North  Korea is trying to hold negotiations with the United States and  Japan to establish diplomatic relations with them. How do you,  Mr. Prime Minister, think the North Korean nuclear issue should  be handled? And, what do you think are the prospects for  reunification on the Korean peninsula?    [Hosokawa] I have serious concerns over the North Korean  nuclear suspicions. I hope the nuclear inspections which  started on 1 March will make smooth progress and bring clear  results. I think the ROK, the United States, and Japan must  cooperate among themselves, pay attention to North Korea's  violent nature [nanpokham], and take a countermeasure [taeung]  against it. I think it is necessary for China to positively  have a hand in this matter. I will soon visit China. At every  opportunity, I have expressed this hope of mine to the Chinese  leaders and proposed that China show positive action to ensure  that North Korea choose good approaches.    I think resolving the North Korean nuclear suspicions is the  most important prerequisite for North-South reunification. If  the North Korean nuclear issue is not resolved, I think, no  discussion on the normalization of relations between Japan and  North Korea can take place, and the North-South reunification  issue cannot be resolved smoothly. Therefore, I think the  nuclear issue, a prerequisite for reunification, must be  resolved first of all.    [Choe] There is a dominant view that, after the end of the  Cold War, the United States appeared as the sole big power in  the Far East region. I would like to know the Japanese  Government's stance to the newly mapped out security order in  the Far East region. In addition, what is your opinion on voices  expressing concerns over the revival of Japan's militarism?    [Hosokawa] Japan would like to make contributions to the  peace and stability of the international community within the  possible range on the basis of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.  This is the basic stance of the Japanese Government toward this  region's security.    Regarding the voices worrying about the revival of Japan's  nuclear armament, I want to assure you that Japan will never  change its attitude of only concentrating on self-defense under  the present peace Constitution, considering the Japanese  people's sentiment.    The Japanese people, who have horrible nuclear bomb  experiences, are highly allergic to nuclear weapons. In this  connection, the three principles on denuclearization -- not  possessing nuclear weapons, not manufacturing nuclear weapons,  and not bringing in nuclear weapons from overseas--have been  passed at the Diet. Under such conditions, it is impossible for  Japan to have nuclear weapons or become a major nuclear power.    [Choe] The United States is assuming a high-handed attitude  by bringing forth the Super 301 provision. The trade war  between the United States and Japan is also expected to have a  great effect on the ROK. What is Japan's strategy regarding a  countermeasure in the Japan-U.S. trade war?    [Hosokawa] As I have mentioned earlier, it is necessary for  Japan and the United States to make a sensible, calm judgment  and act upon the trade issue. I think Japan should put more  efforts into easing regulations; further accelerate the policies  of mutual cooperation; and promote market opening.    We are trying to arrive at a conclusion within March.  However, regarding macroeconomic policies, we will probably  need more time. But since the comprehensive economic  consultations between Japan and the United States, which started  last July, are made on a one-year basis, we are trying to put  more efforts into solving various pending issues between the  United States and Japan until the G-7 summit talks are held in  Naples next July. Fortunately, nothing has yet been concluded  and the issue on mobile telecommunications involving Motorola is  entering into a phase of reaching an agreement.    Small problems can be solved one by one. Regarding the trade  imbalance between Japan and the United States, Japan will make  efforts to reduce trade surpluses sector by sector.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Wei (6392 5898)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- At a news conference  held by the Press Center for the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Eighth  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference today, Zhu Kaixuan, the minister in  charge of the State Education Commission, announced: According  to the briefings from people's governments and educational  departments of 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and  municipalities nationwide, the government has basically solved  the problem of delays in the payment of teachers' salaries  across the country before this Spring Festival.    Zhu Kaixuan announced this news while answering a question  from a XINHUA News Agency reporter. He affirmed the  achievements in solving the problem of delays in the payment of  teachers' salaries and pointed out at the same time: Some  individual localities still owe teachers a small amount such as  bonuses and subsidies, which are not included in the basic pay.  Zhu Kaixuan said: We should give in-depth thought to ways of  preventing the problem of delays in the payment of teachers'  salaries from recurring. At present, the State Council,  government departments in charge of education, and local  governments are working hand in hand in three fields: 1)  improving and perfecting current regulations on managing and  raising funds for education, and those on managing and paying  teachers' salaries; 2) establishing a legal system to protect  the basic rights and interests of the broad masses of teachers.  The main thing we should do now is to publicize and implement  the "Teachers Law." In the "Teachers Law," two articles concern  legal actions against delays in the payment of teachers'  salaries. 3) arousing people's awareness of respecting teachers  and valuing education. The key to carrying out these tasks is  to establish a responsibility system for major persons in charge  in governments at all levels. Zhu Kaixuan said: The State  Education Commission is paying close attention to the problem of  delays in the payment of teachers' salaries to prevent this  situation from recurring.    A reporter asked him about the issue of requiring students  at  institutions of higher education to pay tuition, Zhu Kaixuan  said: Changing the situation in which the state is responsible  for arranging students' schooling and jobs is an important  aspect of China's educational reform. The future reform goal is  to gradually require students to pay for their tuition and to  look for jobs on their own. Zhu Kaixuan said emphatically:  Asking students to pay their tuition does not mean that  students have to go to school at their own expense. In light of  the current practical situation, it is difficult for students to  attend schools at their own expense. After we took two major  factors into consideration -- the cost of education and the  people's financial capabilities, we asked students to pay some  fees for their schooling. Zhu Kaixuan said: The fees for each  student at colleges and institutions under the State Education  Commission are 1,000 to 1,500 yuan this year. The cost will go  up in coming years. However, students who enrolled in colleges  before the new regulations took effect will not be affected.  Now more than 50 percent of the 2.5 million college students  nationwide are from rural areas. They have difficulty paying  for tuition, which is why we must establish relevant scholarship  and student loan program. The state has established  profession-specific scholarships for students trained in some  special and vigorous professions and in specialized fields which  enable them to attend school free of charge. Zhu Kaixuan said:  Under the socialist system, we cannot let students drop out of  school for economic reasons.    Answering a reporter's question on how the educational  reform accommodates the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, Zhang Xiaowen, vice minister in charge of  the State Education Commission, said: First, we should reform  the administrative system of higher education by changing the  current multilevel administration to a two-level administration  by the state and localities and by giving more decision-making  power to localities and universities. At the same time, we  should vigorously and smoothly reform the enrollment of college  students, the collection of tuition and other fees, and the  employment of college graduates. Second, we should adjust the  current structures of personnel and courses and should  accelerate the development of courses related to finance,  economics, politics, law, and high technology, which are  urgently needed for social development.    When asked whether China was able to realize the goal of  making nine-year compulsory education universal by the year of  2000, Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education  Commission, said: China needs and is able to basically realize  nine-year compulsory education by the turn of the century. "To  basically realize this goal" means that around 85 percent of  China's population and regions will have nine-year compulsory  education by that time, while the other 15 percent probably will  have only six or four years of compulsory education.    As for Chinese students studying abroad, Zhu Kaixuan said:  China has sent 210,000 students to more than 100 countries and  regions worldwide for study. Of these students, more than  70,000 have returned home after finishing their studies. The  Chinese Government has adopted a policy of supporting people  studying abroad, encouraging Chinese living abroad to return to  the motherland, and allowing them to come and go freely. We do  not have any reason to change this policy. We can understand  that some students want to stay longer in foreign countries for  various reasons, and some of them have applied for "green  cards." These students are keeping in close contact with China.  Some countries use various pretexts or even make laws to  prevent Chinese students from returning home. In view of this  situation, the Chinese Government has made serious  representations to the countries concerned.    At today's news conference, persons in charge at the State  Education Commission also answered reporters' questions on  investment in education, raising and managing educational funds,  and maintaining the ranks of teachers.</p>

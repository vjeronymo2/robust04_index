			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Bonds: Aggressive pricing for Dollars 500m five-year Canadian offering THE Export Development Corporation of Canada yesterday launched its anticipated Dollars 500m offer at an aggressive yield of only 22 basis points above US Treasuries, taking the unusual step of restricting the transaction to just three underwriters. The five-year issue was led jointly by CSFB, Merrill Lynch and UBS. Restricting the transaction to three banks increases these institutions' control over the distribution of the bonds, though the transaction runs the risk of undermining the borrower's standing with banks not invited into the deal. The underwriters reported that while the pricing had been aggressive, more than half of the bonds had been sold by the end of the day. Also in dollars, the Republic of Austria came with an unusual 15-year offer, a maturity which is seldom traded and for which some bankers said there was little demand. However, at just Dollars 200m and given the relative scarcity of the name, the bonds were said to have sold well in eastern Asia and continental Europe. With no current-coupon benchmark bonds over which to price the deal, the bonds were pitched at 42 basis points over 10-year Treasuries. The slope of the US yield curve between 10 and 15 years implied an increase in yield of 4-4 1/2 basis points a year, giving a spread of 20-22 basis points over the interpolated curve, banks involved in the deal said. The yield spread held up later in the day, after the bonds were freed to trade. On a busy day across a range of currencies, the French franc was again a focus of attention. McDonald's and Toyota Motor Credit Corporation launched FFr1bn deals in the international market, at 10 and five years respectively. Aeroports de Paris raised FFr1bn over 10 years in the domestic market. The tight yield spread at which the Toyota deal was completed - 25 basis points - reinforced the recent trend for the Eurobond market to offer more competitive pricing than the domestic markets, as international investors have bought into a rising currency. As a result, the European Investment Bank, which was planning a domestic issue today, was reported to have switched its attention to the Eurobond market. It was said to be planning a FFr2bn three or five-year issue at a spread of 12-15 basis points over French government bonds, some five basis points less than it would have paid in the domestic French market. Both the Kingdom of Sweden and New Zealand launched offerings in currencies where they have existing issues maturing. Sweden's CDollars 300m deal was pitched in the less-heavily used 10-year area and, with a payment date on May 12, was positioned to benefit from a CDollars 250m issue from the same borrower which matures on May 5. New Zealand, not seen in the public markets since 1990, raised Pounds 150m, one day after its existing Pounds 100m issue matured.</p>

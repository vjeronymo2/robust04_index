			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 9 (YONHAP) -- As IAEA nuclear  inspectors were reportedly experiencing difficulties in North  Korea, the United States and South Korea have decided that  Washington will be compelled to postpone a third round of talks  with Pyongyang unless the Stalinist state changes its attitude.    As of Thursday (KST), the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) team had not been able to inspect the 5-megawatt nuclear  reactor and radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon, sources in New  York and Washington said.    Moreover, even if South and North Korea agreed to exchange  special envoys at their sixth working-level contact at Panmunjom  on Saturday, it would be too late for the exchange to occur  before March 21, when the United States and North Korea are  scheduled to hold the next high-level meeting in Geneva.    The United States has said these two conditions -- IAEA  inspections and an inter-Korean exchange of special envoys --  are prerequisites to the third round of talks between Washington  and Pyongyang.    North Korea wants to continue its negotiations with the  United States on normalizing relations and economic assistance,  among other things.    The sources said, however, they will have to wait until the  weekend to see whether the IAEA inspection team is permitted to  inspect the two nuclear facilities at Yongbyon before returning  to Vienna.    In this connection, Deputy State Department Spokeswoman  Christine Shelly said she understood the IAEA inspectors were  encountering "some difficulties" in Yongbyon.    "We, of course, regret that they (IAEA inspections) have not  proceeded as smoothly as we would have liked up to this point"  she told a regular weekly press briefing.    But noting that there is still some time left, Shelly urged  North Korea to meet its commitments that they have made.    She also recalled that the third round of U.S.-North Korean  high- level talks can be held only when South and North Korea  exchange special envoys to discuss the nuclear question.    Prior to Shelly's remarks, the U.S. State Department was  reported to have conveyed the American position on inter-Korean  envoy exchange talks to the North Korean Mission to the United  Nations in New York on Tuesday (EST).    North Korea has said it did not agree to exchange special  envoys as a precondition for further U.S.-North Korean talks.  It is also refusing to open the five-megawatt reactor and the  radiochemical laboratory to IAEA inspectors.</p>

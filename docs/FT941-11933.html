			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Purchasing index at highest in five years The US Purchasing Managers' Index rose to its highest level in more than five years last month, boosted by a rise in new orders and providing the first clear sign that the robust economic growth of the fourth quarter carried over into the new year. Separately the Commerce Department reported a 2.6 per cent increase in construction spending between November and December, further evidence of the positive impact of falls in long-term interest rates last year. The purchasing index - a guide to the health of manufacturing industry  - registered its fifth consecutive monthly increase, rising from 57.1 per cent to 57.7 per cent. This was stronger than expected, as Wall Street analysts feared the arctic weather last month might cause a temporary fall in the index. A sub-index measuring new orders rose to 66.2 per cent, against 65.0 per cent in December, the highest reading since 1983. The strength of new orders more than offset a slight decline in an index measuring production which was affected by bad weather. Analysts were disconcerted by a sharp rise in a sub-index measuring inflationary pressures, which rose to 59.8 per cent against 51.3 per cent in December, the highest level since November 1990. Mr Robert Bretz, for purchasing managers, said the very low level of inventories and the strength of new orders indicated the economic expansion would continue.</p>

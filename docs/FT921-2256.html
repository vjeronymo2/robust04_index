			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / France, Italy and Spain leadrevival in sales of new cars NEW CAR sales in western Europe in February rose by 1.3 per cent to an estimated 1.104m helped by higher demand in France, Italy and Spain. In the first two months of the year sales were 2.2 per cent higher than a year ago at 2.36m according to industry estimates. Sales for the full year are still expected to show a small decline, but several car makers have revised upwards their forecasts for west European new car sales in recent weeks, due to stronger than expected demand in Germany, France, Italy and Spain in the first two months of the year. New car sales in February were higher than a year ago in 12 of 17 markets across west Europe and lower in five. The long-lived recession in the UK deepened further, with sales plunging by 12 per cent in February to 109,414, while sales in Germany fell by around 5.5 per cent from last year's record level to an estimated 324,000. These declines were compensated, however, by a 4.1 per cent jump in Italian new car sales in February to 224,291, while new car registrations rose by 4.7 per cent in France to 161,100 and by 26 per cent in Spain to 85,479. Among the smaller European markets the strongest growth this year has been achieved in Belgium and Luxembourg, Portugal and Denmark, while sales remain weakest in Finland. Among the volume car makers the Fiat group of Italy, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, narrowly regained second place in the west European sales league, but it continues to lose ground to the Volkswagen group of Germany. The Fiat group's car sales in west Europe fell by an estimated 5.1 per cent in the first two months of the year, while its market share shrank to only 12.9 per cent compared with the commanding 16.9 per cent held by the VW group, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda. Fiat's grip on the domestic Italian market is still slipping alarmingly this year with a fall in its market share in the first two months to 43.5 per cent from 47.4 per cent a year ago. Ford, which is suffering heavily from its exposure to the depressed UK market, has also slipped back in the first two months with an estimated 4 per cent decline in sales volume across Europe. By contrast Renault is emerging as the fastest growing of the big six volume car makers this year, helped by the success of its Clio small car range. It increased its sales by an estimated 7.6 per cent in the first two months of the year allowing it to raise its share to 10.7 per cent from 10.1 per cent a year ago. BMW has also been boosted significantly by the successful launch of its new generation 3-series.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                        January-February 1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Volume      Volume      Share (%)    Share (%)                        (Units)     Change(%)   Jan-Feb 92   Jan-Feb 91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET           2,360,000       +2.2        100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen***(incl.      399,000       +6.3         16.9         16.2 Audi, SEAT&amp;Skoda) Fiat (incl.

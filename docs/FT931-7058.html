			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): A direct line to cholesterol Biotechnology specialist Genzyme, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been granted clearance to sell a test kit to US laboratories for measuring the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - or 'bad' cholesterol - in the patient's bloodstream. LDL is recognised as a primary factor contributing to coronary heart disease and atherogenesis - clogging of the arteries. The kit enables laboratories to measure directly the levels of LDL in a sample and so cuts down the time needed to get the test results to the doctor and patient. The traditional method of determining LDL involves indirect measurements using calculations and means the patient has to fast for 12-14 hours before the test is conducted.

The AMP, which controlled Australian investments valued at more than ADollars 37bn at last balance date, has formed a separate company to manage its investment operations called AMP Investment Australia Mr Andrew Threadgold, managing director, said the changes would allow the AMP more fully to focus on investment management while at the same time reducing costs.

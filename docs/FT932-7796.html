			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: French Connection returns to the black with Pounds 102,000 AFTER a plunge to losses of Pounds 8m last time, French Connection, the USM-quoted clothing wholesaler and retailer which is 80 per cent owned by Mr Stephen Marks, scraped back into the black with Pounds 102,000 pre-tax in the year to January 31. Mr George Wardale, chairman, pointed out that second-half profits were Pounds 637,000, a position with which he said he could be 'cautiously positive.' Operating profits emerged at Pounds 2.48m (losses Pounds 3.94m). The year saw further rationalisation and reorganisation of the group. This restructuring followed the management changes, and the consequent shifts in activity, of a year ago. Exceptional costs of Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 2.93m) included some Pounds 800,000 for the closure or disposal of seven French Connection concessions. There are now 31 outlets in the UK and eight in the US. Mr Wardale said that, all things remaining equal, the rationalisation of the retail business was complete. The Pounds 500,000 balance in the exceptionals was for the closure of the warehouse in France and professional fees connected with the group refinancing. These moves were part of the concentration on the core - made up of the brands and outlets of French Connection and Nicole Farhi. Although sales in French Connection Wholesale declined Pounds 2m to Pounds 10.3m operating losses were cut to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 2.8m). Nicole Farhi Wholesale lifted sales to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 5.4m) and, with improved margins, made profits of Pounds 1.6m (losses Pounds 300,000). Retail sales grew Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 13.6m and losses shrank to Pounds 200,000 (Pounds 300,000). Profits of Pounds 900,000 (losses Pounds 100,000) were struck in the US. The French operation broke even (Pounds 400,000 loss) on lower sales, and in Hong Kong profits were held at Pounds 300,000 because of adverse currency movements. Group turnover decreased to Pounds 47.4m (Pounds 49.9m). Losses per share were 3p (40.6p).</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / US and EU close to trade deal: Brittan and Kantor hope to reach outline agreement in talks on Monday The US and European Union last night appeared close to a comprehensive bilateral deal on market access for industrial products and on trade in food products. But the absence of a definitive breakthrough because of last-minute snags is still holding up overall progress in the Uruguay Round trade negotiations in Geneva, involving 116 countries. After 36 hours of intensive talks in Brussels between Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, both sides said they hoped to reach an outline deal in a new bargaining session on Monday. Sir Leon won a vote of confidence at a meeting of EU foreign ministers late last night. France, which has taken the hardest line, particularly over international farm trade, threw its weight behind the tight timetable for a deal with the US. Officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva welcomed France's 'clear willingness to do business', but they cautioned that little time was left to meet the December 15 deadline for concluding the Gatt talks. They said other Gatt signatories were still holding back their best offers in expectation of a US-EU deal. 'What we really need here is for market access to move,' said one Geneva official. The most significant progress appears to have been made in farm trade, an issue that has dogged the Uruguay Round since it was launched in 1986. In prospect is a deal providing improved access for US and other farm exporters to Europe's market for grains, meat, dairy products and 'other speciality crops'. Negotiators were also confident of satisfying French demands for amendment of the US-EU Blair House agreement regulating Europe's subsidised farm exports. Mr Kantor said: 'We are talking of an overall agriculture package that not only the EU, but every country in the Community can agree to.' However, Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister who chaired last night's meeting, sounded a note of caution after most countries raised concern about the scope of the potential market access deal and the lack of detail provided by Sir Leon. Mr Claes said: 'We are convinced that progress is being made constantly, but it would be dangerous to draw conclusions at this stage.' Sir Leon and Mr Kantor spoke of 'tangible progress' at their talks in Brussels which allowed negotiators 'to see the outlines of a final package'. Later Sir Leon indicated that the plan was to reach a broad deal on Monday and for him to accompany Mr Kantor to Geneva to accelerate the multilateral negotiations. Little detail emerged from the talks as officials stressed that premature publicity could jeopardise a deal. But Brussels indicated that the US was taking a tough line on textiles and was still pressing Europe to further open up its market in films and broadcasting.

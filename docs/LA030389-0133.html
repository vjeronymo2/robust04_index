			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRB FILES FORMAL ACCUSATIONS AGAINST LUKAS AND LAZ BARRERA  </P> <P> The California Horse Racing Board Thursday lodged formal accusations against  trainers Wayne Lukas and Laz Barrera in its continuing crackdown on drug abuse  in thoroughbred racing.  </P> <P> Lukas and Barrera each are accused of running horses last summer at Del Mar  that subsequently tested positive for cocaine. Both have denied the charge.  </P> <P> Under racing's "absolute insurer" rule, the trainer is ultimately liable for  the condition of his or her horse, however, and Lukas and Barrera are "subject  to discipline, including revocation or suspension" of their licenses, according  to CHRB papers filed Thursday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The next step in the process is for each trainer to have a hearing before the  board of stewards, probably within the next two weeks.  </P> <P> The horse in question in the Lukas case is Crown Collection, who won the  seventh race at Del Mar last Aug. 29 and was unplaced in another race there  Sept. 14. Initial tests conducted by Truesdail Laboratory in Tustin showed "no  prohibited drug substance" in the post-race urine and blood samples on either  occasion. More sensitive retesting last month revealed traces of cocaine in  each sample.  </P> <P> Barrera's horse, Endow, is involved in the same scenario, winning the sixth  race at Del Mar on Aug. 31, at first testing negative and then retesting  positive for cocaine last month.  </P> <P> In another drug-related case at Santa Anita, trainer Richard Mulhall was fined  $500 by the stewards and his horse, Its Royalty, has been disqualified from its  Jan. 11 victory. Its Royalty's postrace test showed the presence of procaine.  GRAHAME L. JONES  </P></p>

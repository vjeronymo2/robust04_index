			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Washington Conveyed Israeli </F> Ultimatum to Lebanon"]    [Text] Beirut, AL-HAYAH -- Official Lebanese sources have  told AL-HAYAH that, some days ago, the United States conveyed to  Lebanon an Israeli ultimatum that Israel would hit Lebanon hard  if Hizballah retaliated to its bombing of Hizballah's bases and  centers with suicide operations abroad or across the Lebanese  borders.    The sources said that U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley  conveyed that ultimatum to the senior Lebanese officials he met  with in the past few days, pointing out that Israel's ultimatum  was in reply to Hizballah leaders' declarations that they would  retaliate to the Israeli raid on 'Ayn Kawkab camp near Ba'labakk  last week with suicide operations inside [Israel] and abroad.  The raid left 35-40 Hizballah members dead, of whom 27 have been  named, and 70 others injured.    The ultimatum, as conveyed by the American side, was that no  Hizballah position in Lebanon would be safe, and it held the  Lebanese Government responsible.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that the ultimatum was repeated by  Uri Lubrani, head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations  with Lebanon, in statements he made the day before yesterday  threatening a relentless war if Lebanon continued to embrace  Hizballah. Senior Lebanese officials said they feared a major  Israeli operation in the coming days as a consequence of that  ultimatum and Lubrani's warnings. They have been concerned,  particularly as the Western states and the United States clearly  opposed their desire to have the Security Council issue a  statement condemning Israel's violation of Lebanese sovereignty  when it launched these raids last week.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Pak Sung-yong] </F>   [Text] The border contacts resumed by South and North Korea  after a break of four months on Thursday have produced few  results, only endangering the possibility of envoy exchanges  taking place before March 21 when the third round of  Washington-Pyongyang high- level talks is supposed to be held.    At the working-level talks, the North, on one hand,  positively responded to the Southern demand that presidential  envoys be exchanged as early as possible.    As for the procedural decision, on the other hand, the  communist country showed little desire to act, saying, "Since  there are few differences on the issue, both sides can reach an  agreement at any time."    Accordingly, the South had to be satisfied only with  securing  continuity of inter-Korean dialogue by agreeing to meet again at  10 a.m. at Tongil-gak on the Northern side of the truce village  of Panmunjom, failing to make up for the four months of  inactivity since the last contact was made on Oct. 25 last year.    Until the South Korean delegation came to the border village  of Panmunjom, Seoul had expected the Thursday meeting to make  considerable progress unless Pyongyang repeated its earlier  demands that Seoul stop "nuclear war exercises" and "seeking  international cooperation to stop a non-existent nuclear arms  program."    A clause in Tuesday's North Korean message saying that it  recognized South Korean proposal for resumption of inter-Korean  dialogue as acceptance of its earlier demands was especially  taken as grounds for optimism.    Based on this judgment, the South prepared a draft agreement  which made concessions on which side will visit which first and  on what the envoys can negotiate, among other things.    The 13-point draft, which Vice Unification Minister Song  Yong- tae, Seoul's chief delegate, presented at the contact,  pointed out five aims of special envoys.    This was reflection of a strong will on the part of the  South  that the envoy exchange issue be concluded at the contact since  it had virtually accepted what the North had demanded as envoys'  missions in the last three working-level meetings.    At the Panmunjom contact, however, the South could not even  discuss the details of procedural questions because the North  erected a new hurdle by demanding Seoul scrap the plan for  deployment of Patriot anti-missile batteries on the Korean  peninsula.    Pyongyang's head delegate Pak Yong-su also required an  explanation of the two of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's  statements in news conferences.    Kim's remarks which the North took issue with were one  saying  that he could not "shake hands with anyone possessing nuclear  arms" in a press conference marking the 100th day of his term  and the other saying that there is no substantial proof that the  North has an atomic bomb in a recent press meet.    Along with the new complaints, the North repeated its  earlier  demands.    According to Vice Minister Song, the Northern side said,  "Without resolution of these issues, the envoy exchange is  unlikely to take place," adding that the Southern answering of  the four complaints "is indispensable" for the envoy exchange.    Many government officials take the North Korea's  intransigent  stance as a sort of tactic to gain the advantage in the process  of exchanging presidential envoys, delaying the exchange a  little bit.    "Pyongyang is well aware that the envoys must be exchanged  before March 21 when the third round of high-level talks between  Washington and Pyongyang is scheduled," said a ranking  government official, adding that the North's attitude can be  taken as a "transient action."    This rather optimistic viewpoint predicts that the South and  the North will agree on the process of envoy exchanges in the  next border contact slated for next Wednesday [9 March] and that  the envoys will be exchanged before March 21. However, as  Seoul's chief delegate Song pointed out after the Thursday  contact had failed, "North Korea's will to realize the envoy  exchange in an early date is not strong," the timetable South  and North Korea and the United States have prepared for eventual  solution of the nuclear issue is unlikely to be kept, other  government officials said.</p>

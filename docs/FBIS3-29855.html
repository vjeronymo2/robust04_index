The executive for a private broadcasting company asked to  remain anonymous.    Akimasa Egawa, director general of the Broadcasting  Administration Bureau at the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, earlier Wednesday reversed his position on  HDTV development, saying the ministry will continue to support  an analog HDTV system developed by Japan Broadcasting Corp.  (NHK).    Egawa had told reporters on Tuesday his ministry will  promote  the development of a digital HDTV system to replace NHK's  hi-vision system.    The remark stirred protests from Japanese consumer  electronics companies, which are already selling hi-vision  television sets.</p>

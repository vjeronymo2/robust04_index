			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Lion's Den"] </F>   [Text] The prime minister's address at the United Kibbutz  Movement [UKM] Central Committee in Ef'al on 21 April should not  be seen as only an appendix to his remarks at the Knesset  Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee earlier last week. The  remark was a pointed and profound expansion of the earlier  statement. Rabin chose to address the UKM of all forums for a  good reason; it is tantamount to a lion's den for a person who  previously said that he does not accept the extent of withdrawal  on the Golan Heights as recommended by the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] General Staff because it is too slight.    Yitzhaq Rabin did not tell the UKM where exactly the line of  withdrawal he finds acceptable in terms of Israel's security  needs lies and which takes "the necessitating political reality"  into account. Rabin stressed that "the government is trying  with all its might to struggle against repeating the precedent  set by the Likud, which opposed a compromise (in the Sinai) and  eventually gave everything back." The sincerity of this promise  should not be doubted, yet he believed he should make clear the  limited ability of the government to hold the line:  "Settlements may be removed for peace, and I am for removing  settlements for the sake of peace -- which is more important for  the future of the State of Israel than such or other group of  settlements."    Jerusalem political circles have for a long time maintained  that al-Asad cannot accept the continued existence of  settlements on the Golan Heights, even if the IDF totally  withdraws from it. This assumption is probably based on  reliable information. The above quoted remarks by the prime  minister should have dispersed the remaining illusions the UKM  may have entertained, and this is probably why they were made.    Yitzhaq Rabin can be trusted to place the security aspect in  a prominent place among his consideration, but he does not cling  to the myth attributing a decisive security weight to  settlements. Collective memory cultivates the stories of heroism  of Deganya, Negba, and Yad Mordekhay, while discarding the  stories of the evacuation of 'Atarot, Neve Ya'aqov, and Bet  Ha'arava, and the loss of the 'Etzyon Bloc in 1948. Without  explicitly reminding the UKM members of what happened on the  Golan Heights in 1973, Rabin taught them a lesson: "Tanks on  the Golan and a strong air force are the main guarantee that war  with Syria would be prevented; the truth must be said."    Rabin's Ef'al appearance can also be viewed as a move meant  to assist the U.S. secretary of state on the eve of his Syria  visit. The secretary should be equipped with evidence that  Israel is willing to uproot settlements from the Golan Heights.  Rabin's appearance at the UKM Central Committee was meant to  encourage the U.S. mediator. The State Department's reaction  indicates that this goal was achieved. The unanswered question  remains, however, whether al-Asad would settle for a partial  withdrawal from the Golan Heights, even if it includes the  evacuation of settlements.    It may well be that Rabin made the two gestures in vain, but  even so, they are not unnecessary. A protest can be made  against Rabin's statement that "if this year or by mid-1995 no  progress is made with Syria and the Palestinians, the result  might be military tension and political freeze." Such a warning  might encourage al-Asad to insist on a full Israeli withdrawal.  It appears, however, that Rabin believes that peace with Syria  is the most solid guarantee against war with Syria, and that we  should not be intimidated by the high price we might pay for the  attainment of this goal.    Also, there is no telling whether al-Asad would be willing  to  make a territorial compromise on the Golan Heights should the  United States in return eliminate Syria from the list of  countries which support international terrorism and drug  trafficking. Much will depend on the amount of pressure the  secretary of state is willing to exert while in Damascus.</p>

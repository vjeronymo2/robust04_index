			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> RTC Oversight Board OKs Major S&amp;L Sale Plan: Officials of the Resolution  Trust Corp.'s oversight board approved a plan to sell or close about 192 failed  savings and loan institutions over the next six months. Officials of the  oversight board said its implementation would bring to 479 the total number of  thrifts whose financial problems have been resolved by liquidation or other  actions since Aug. 9, 1989. But they noted that the plan is subject to the  congressional appropriations process and cannot be completed unless it receives  full financing.  </P></p>

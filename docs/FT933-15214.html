			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / International Company News: Amcor accounts row AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging company, has agreed to print a notice in its next annual report disclosing an accounting dispute with the Australian Securities Commission, Reuter reports from Melbourne. The Securities Commission is disputing the treatment of a ADollars 50.5m (USDollars 34.1m) expense charged by Amcor against retained profits in the year ended June, 1992. The regulator said the expense, relating to the re-planting of forests by the company, should have been charged against operating profit. Such a charge would have reduced Amcor's after-tax profit to ADollars 216m from ADollars 266.5m, the figure reported. Amcor has agreed to print a note in its annual report outlining this dispute with the commission. The regulator said it would not be taking any further action against Amcor.</p>

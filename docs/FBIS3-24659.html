			<p>SUMMARY                                 Both newly installed President Liamine Zeroual and spokesmen for  the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have affirmed a desire  for political dialogue to find a way out of Algeria's violent,  protracted political crisis.  Neither side, however, has thus far  indicated a clear willingness to adopt positions sufficiently  flexible to permit serious negotiations.  In addition, pressure  from both hardliners within the regime and the Islamist  opposition as well as apparent divisions among militant Islamists  further diminish the prospects for an easing of current tensions.                             END SUMMARY     In his first major speech to the nation on 7 February, Zeroual  evidently attempted to strike a balance between indicating his  readiness to negotiate with Islamist opponents of the regime and  reassuring regime hardliners that he will not back off from a  nationwide campaign to crush violent opposition.  Algeria's  political crisis, he said, "can be solved only through dialogue  and with the participation of the national political and social  forces--without exception."  He pledged broad reforms, saying  that "radical solutions to the political, economic, social, and  cultural issues are inevitable," but as has generally been the  case in major speeches by regime leaders, he failed to go beyond  generalities.  Moreover, despite his implicit appeal to Islamists  to negotiate with his government, Zeroual went on to vow that the  government "will use all resources to contain violence and end  the bloodletting" and "will never tolerate those who are trying  to sow the seeds of sedition and chaos."  "No religious,  political, or cultural reason," he asserted, "can explain or  justify the crimes that have been committed against people and  property," and he warned that "political pluralism and democratic  practice do not mean the weakening of the state." (Algiers TV).     While clearly warning that the military-dominated regime will  continue its fight against opponents whom it regards as  terrorists, Zeroual nonetheless adopted a more accommodating tone  toward Islamists than he did in the weeks preceding his  installation as president on 31 January.  For example, speaking  in his former capacity as defense minister on 16 January, he  acknowledged the need for reform but, in alluding to Islamists,  repudiated the claims of some leaders to be seeking genuine  negotiations with the regime, denouncing their "parasitic  political tendencies" and the "blatant contradictions between the  programs and ideas of some parties and their noncompliance with  the terms of the Constitution" (Algiers TV, 16 January).     Measured FIS Response     Interviewed from exile in Germany, prominent FIS official Rabah  Kebir reacted cautiously to Zeroual's 7 February speech,  attempting to shift to the government the onus for making  concessions to start negotiations.  Kebir asserted that  ''negotiations are the key to a solution in Algeria" but added  that "we must wait for actual deeds" from the government and  charged that Zeroual's speech contained "contradictions."  "On  the one hand," Kebir said, "Liamine Zeroual insists on using  violence . . . while on the other he is insisting on dialogue."  To prove its "serious desire" for negotiations, Kebir said, the  government must begin by "releasing all prisoners," most notably  the FIS' two top officials, Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj.  FIS  leaders, Kebir added, could reach a "final decision" on any  regime offer to negotiate "once they are able to meet with their  historic leadership," that is, prominent leaders imprisoned by  the regime (London MBC TV, 8 February).     Anouar Nasr-al-Din Haddam, identified as head of the FIS  "parliamentary mission in Europe and the United States," echoed  Kebir's cautious position in another interview.  He first  dismissed Zeroual as "just the other side of the same coin" and  charged that the current Algerian regime, through Zeroual's  appointment, "is trying to remain in power but with a new face."  He went on, however, to voice hope that "this new face will focus  on the basic factors behind the Algerian crisis and extricate the  country from it."  Haddam also hinted several times at quiet  contacts between FIS and the government, saying in one instance  "we always prefer that our contacts with Liamine Zeroual or  others remain away from the limelight."  Nevertheless, he  insisted that the government must recognize "free popular choice  as the basis for any political authority" and, lest there be any  doubt, explained his allusion by recalling the FIS victory in the  1990 elections, which prompted the current regime to seize power.  Haddam also warned that FIS would not be satisfied with a token  release of prisoners, saying that "we are not primarily  interested about one person or a small group of persons" (Paris  Al-Watan Al-'Arabi, 11 February).     A Regime Gesture to Islamists?     In an interview conducted while he was in Brussels for a meeting  of the European-Algerian joint economic council, a principal  vehicle for European aid to Algeria, Algerian Foreign Minister  Mohamed Saleh Dembri reiterated Zeroual's call for dialogue but  hinted that the government is still not willing to deal with some  fundamentalist leaders.  Dialogue, he said, is "open to all the  children of Algeria . . . without exception," but he added that  "the only people excluded would be those for whom violence and  terrorism are a way of achieving or maintaining power," a charge  that the regime has at times leveled at Islamist opponents in  general.  Dembri answered "absolutely" when asked if the proposed  dialogue would include Islamic fundamentalists, explaining that  "Algeria needs all its children to get out of a crisis with many  aspects."  However, again seemingly excluding some Islamists from  such a dialogue, he attached the ambiguous condition that "there  were more qualified formulations concerning certain persons who  had violated the laws" (Brussels La Libre Belgique, 8 February).  On 9 February, the London-based Saudi daily Al-Sharq Al-Awsat  reported that Dembri had told the paper "a general amnesty will  be issued soon for all political prisoners," but the paper  provided no details.     Islamists' Divisions Hamper Dialogue     Even if the government were to make significant gestures toward  Islamists, both the refusal of some militant fundamentalists to  renounce violence and reported rivalries within various Islamist  movements would seriously complicate any attempt at negotiations.  For example:     --The London weekly Al-Wasat carried an interview with Sayfallah  Ja'far, identified as a leader of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA),  a shadowy organization linked with numerous recent terrorist  attacks in Algeria, in which he denounced FIS leaders for having  "sold out the cause" and even professed not to recognize the name  of FIS.  Ja'far vowed to continue "direct military action,"  including attacks on foreigners in Algeria, whom he branded as  "part of an infidel, colonialist scheme" and "spies for the  infidels in the Islamic world."  Moreover, he explained, by  "killing and fighting" foreigners, his organization establishes  "practical evidence of the weakness of the infidel regime" [in  Algiers] (24 January).     --On 7 February, the French news agency AFP reported receiving a  communique from the GIA announcing the "execution" of 70 members  of another violent, underground Islamist organization, the Armed  Islamic Movement (MIA).  According to AFP, the communique accused  the MIA of trying to "suppress" the GIA and accused its leader of  being a "traitor and agent of the government services."     --An article appearing in the London daily Al-Hayah may have shed  further light on the reported GIA communique.  Citing an unnamed  source in the FIS, the paper reported differences between  political and "military" wings of the organization, adding that  some FIS members are planning a "serious" escalation of anti-  regime violence.  According to the source, FIS members have  formed their own "Islamic Salvation Army" after resolving a  dispute with the MIA and have successfully recruited "most  members" of the GIA away from that organization (4 February).     Implications     It is unlikely that any concessions President Zeroual might offer  will persuade many Algerian Islamists to abandon their opposition  to the current regime.  In particular, those actively engaged in  violent attacks seem almost certain to remain unmoved.  In  addition, the regime faces a formidable task in rallying support  among a broader, disaffected Algerian public, most of which  probably does not embrace militant Islamic fundamentalism but  which has also lost confidence in the existing government  following three years of unfulfilled promises of reform.

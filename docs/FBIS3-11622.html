			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Wilfredo Cordoba from the "KL Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the  Nationalist Republican Alliance [ARENA], said a few minutes ago  that he is ready to defeat the leftist coalition in a runoff  election and added that he is unafraid of facing a  centrist-leftist coalition. The politician also mentioned the  irregularities that emerged in last Sunday's elections.    [Begin recording] [Calderon Sol] It has been proven that the  Salvadoran people do not want the radical left. It has been a  vote to reject them. I do believe they have won a political  opening for democratic opposition and an opportunity to  demonstrate their adherence to the system. We hope they can  finally join the country's political life.    [Unidentified reporter] Is there going to be a vote recount?  Are you going to call for a vote recount to see if you can  [words indistinct]?    [Calderon Sol] We are not interested in discussing the first  round. If a runoff election is needed, we will support it  because we want a clear, impressive, and marvelous mandate. We  know we are going to have 70 percent support or more, perhaps 75  percent. It is going to be a clear, definitive, five-year  mandate.    [Reporter] What were the most serious problems surrounding  the elections?    [Calderon Sol] I believe it was the situation at the voting  centers, the lack of information for voters, and the logistics  problems that existed that day. The real problem was the lack  of information for voters.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Calderon Sol] On the contrary, we have a month to tell the  truth to the Salvadoran people. I believe the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal will be forced to do an evaluation and correct the  mistakes that were made. That way we can have a massive turnout  in the next elections, and I am sure that all the Salvadoran  people will accompany us. [end recording]    That was a portion of the statements made by Dr. Armando  Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling ARENA.  Meanwhile, at the vote counting center, there is speculation  about the number of deputies' seats that could have been won by  the various political parties after certain percentages were  made known. According to unofficial figures made available so  far, ARENA would have obtained 40 deputies; the FMLN, 20  deputies; the Christian Democratic Party, 16 deputies;  Democratic Convergence, three deputies; the National  Conciliation Party, three deputies; and the Unity Movement, one  deputy. These are unofficial figures that could change once the  total number of votes obtained from each of the departments is  made available.</p>

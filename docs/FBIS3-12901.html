			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Amman radio and television carry live  broadcasts on 4 March of Friday prayers from mosques in Amman.    Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic at 0900 GMT on 4 March  carries a live broadcast of Friday prayers from al-Husayni  Mosque in central Amman. The broadcast includes a 36-minute  "religious lesson" by Dr. Dawud al-Fa'uri of the University of  Jordan's Islamic Sharia college.    Al-Fa'uri begins by hailing those who died in the Hebron  massacre on 25 February. The preacher questions the behavior of  those who claim to be "the chosen people of God, and the sons  and beloved of God, only to appear in their true colors in front  of the whole world as enemies of God, humanity, and peace."    He says: "How can they describe as extremism the behavior of  the innocent child who hurls a stone at the man who attacked him  and took all of his possessions, and fail to call extremism the  flagrant shooting of those who are prostrated before God in  prayer at the Khalil al-Rahman [Abraham] Mosque?"    Al-Fa'uri adds: "The first party responsible for the kind of  extremism and murder that has taken place is the Israeli  Government, which fights extremism elsewhere while nurturing it  at home. It gave weapons to the settlers and has watched the  extremism of Jewish religious groups such as the Kakh Movement,  the Kahane Movement, and Shas. The least the Israeli Government  should have done was to withdraw weapons from the settlers and  the extremist religious organization, at least during the peace  talks. The least it should have done is to execute all those  who carried out the murders in front of the whole world, as it  does when it brings down homes on the heads of their residents  based on a suspicion or for throwing a stone."    Al-Fa'uri blames Arabs and Muslims for their disunity,  despite factors of similarity among them. He blames the  international community for closing its eyes to anti-Arab and  anti-Islamic crimes. He congratulates those who are steadfastly  defending "their brothers, honor, and property" in the occupied  territory and calls on believers to help them in every possible  way. He urges the people to follow the example of King Husayn  in contributing to their Palestinian brothers and praised the  Jordanian people's stand in support of the Palestinian people.    Al-Fa'uri devotes the remainder of his "lesson" to the  merits  of the fasting month of Ramadan and al-Qadr night, during which  the Koran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.    Amman radio also carries another a 23-minute "sermon" on  obedience to God's teachings. The unidentified preacher laments  the poor condition of Muslims, which he attributes to their  failure to follow their true religion, and praises ancient  Islamic tradition. The preacher refers to massacres and  injustice committed against Muslims in the world, including the  Hebron massacre committed by "the Zionists". He praises the  Hebron victims, who will have their "reward in the hereafter."  He asks the people to contribute to the support of the  families of the victims.    Amman Jordan Television Network in Arabic at 0945 GMT  carries  a live broadcast from King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman that  includes a 24-minute sermon on religious values and the merits  of the holy month of Ramadan.</p>

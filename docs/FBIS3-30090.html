			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The working-level contacts, which were held one  after another in New York between the United States and North  Korea surrounding the issue of the entry of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team, faced difficulties  [nangwane pongchakhada], including the abrupt return of the U.S.  delegation to Washington amid attempts of the two sides to shift  the responsibility onto each other.    Correspondent Nam Son-yong reports from New York.    [Begin Nam recording] Thomas Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant  secretary for East Asian-Pacific affairs who is a working  delegate from the U.S. side, said that he was disappointed by  the fact that North Korea did not agree on the date of  inspection, and suddenly returned to Washington this morning  Korean time.    Noting that he was returning to Washington because there was  no reply from North Korean authorities to the proposal by the  U.S. side, delegate Hubbard said that he has no plan at present  to meet the North Korean delegation.    In particular, Deputy Assistant Secretary Hubbard warned  that  if nuclear inspection is not conducted at an early date, the  IAEA Board of Governors will review the next steps against North  Korea within next week. He stressed that all responsibility  rests on the North Korean side.    In a telephone conversation with KBS a reporter, Han  Sung-yol, councilor and delegate of the North Korean side, said  that because the U.S. side put forward the resumption of  North-South dialogue as a precondition even after North Korea  decided to accept the IAEA inspection, the step to issue visas  has not been taken. He then claimed that all responsibility  rests on the U.S. side, thus suggesting that the issue of  resuming North-South dialogue has emerged as the core issue in  the working-level contact.    However, a reliable source said that the North Korean side  has not received the instruction from Pyongyang on adjusting the  date after the meeting took a recess, and is now waiting for the  instruction. As soon as the North Korean side receives the  instruction, it will hold a working contact tomorrow. Thus,  there is a possibility that the two sides may reach a basic  agreement on issuing visas, on the third round of U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks, and on North-South working contact for  the exchange of special envoys.

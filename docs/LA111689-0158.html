			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OUTBREAK OF POISONING AMONG COWS CURBED  </P> <P> An outbreak of lead poisoning in Dutch and British cows is under control, and  all precautions have been taken to stop their milk and meat from endangering  people, a European Community official said Wednesday.  </P> <P> He said the Common Market, which launched an investigation last week, decided  it was not necessary to declare an alert.  </P> <P> Cows on about 1,700 farms in the Netherlands and Britain were poisoned earlier  this month after eating food pellets contaminated with lead. The problem is  believed to have been caused by a consignment of rice bran contaminated while  enroute to Antwerp from Burma in September.  </P></p>

Slezevicius met with Minister in the Chancellor's Office  Friedrich Bohl, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, and Economics  Minister Guenter Rexrodt on 4 May. At a meeting with the  Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce,  Slezevicius said that German investment was welcome in his  country. Today he will hold talks with the "Initiative Circle  of the Ruhr Area."    Slezevicius said in an interview with this newspaper: "The  only alternative for Lithuania is integration into the European  Union [EU] economic structures to guarantee prosperity."  Slezevicius thanked Germany for its support and voiced the hope  that a free trade agreement with the EU that is currently being  negotiated can be signed in July and become effective by the end  of 1994. He said that, beyond association, the goal remained  Lithuania's EU membership. The agreement signed on "Partnership  for Peace" should be followed by a further rapprochement to  NATO. "We are hoping for a decision on association with the  Western European Union [WEU] by the end of 1994, following the  signing of the free trade agreement."    Slezevicius expressed concern about Russia: "Because of  considerable uncertainties, we can hardly predict anything about  events in Russia or relations between Vilnius and Moscow." The  documents signed in November last year with Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin have not yet been ratified by the Moscow  government. Slezevicius said Russia was trying to link the  coming into force of these documents with the demand that  Lithuania permit the transit of Russian military transports from  the Kaliningrad (Koenigsberg) area across the Baltic state  uncontrolled: "Lithuania cannot accept that." Lithuania has  introduced a visa system for border traffic: "It is a foregone  conclusion that Lithuania, not Russia, decides whether we are  going to have a visa system." Lithuania is trying to have  friendly, good, and sound relations with Russia and its other  neighbors: "However, the dialogue must not proceed upon  pressure from the great neighbor, but must be conducted  constructively."    The last Russian troops have been withdrawn from Lithuania,  but no transit agreement has come about. Lithuania wants an  arrangement "that should be fixed by both sides." Slezevicius  said that Russian troops and the respective military equipment  from eastern Germany arrive in Lithuania by ship and are  transported on to Russia. In each case, Lithuania issues  transit permissions. "The Kaliningrad area represents a  problem, not only for Russia and Lithuania, but also for Europe."    In view of the concentration of Russian troops in the  Kaliningrad area, Slezevicius added: "Regional security could  be improved by demilitarization." He said Lithuanian  negotiators had asked experts from Denmark and Germany to advise  them in negotiations with Moscow by making suggestions on the  transit problem. Separate negotiations were being held on the  less difficult transit of civilian persons.    With Western technology and access to the Eastern market and  its raw materials, Lithuania could form a "bridge between East  and West," said Slezevicius. However, this required more  stability in Russia. Slezevicius said he was concerned about  nationalist Zhirinovskiy's popularity with the Russia people.  It was only "under the European shield" that Lithuania could  protect itself against dangers. Fifty "lost years of  occupation" had to be made up. That is why Lithuania was making  a considerable effort to accelerate its European integration.  The only way was the free market economy.    Slezevicius spoke about successes. He said that since his  government took office on 31 March 1993, the average income in  real terms, which had decreased in the first three years of  Lithuania's independence, increased more than 12 percent for the  first time. Since the middle of 1993, the currency was  stabilizing. After a rate of inflation of more than 1,000  percent in 1992, an inflation of less than 50 percent had to be  expected in 1994, because in cooperation with the International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank, a strict monetary policy was  being operated. That is why there were "good prospects" for  investment, without which the economic sector could not be  restructured. Political stability was useful for economic  stability, said Slezevicius: "Following three years of  independence, Lithuania now has the absolute majority of a party  in parliament and a new constitution." Privatization would be  accelerated, and the banking sector restructured. Slezevicius  mentioned a Swedish financial aid of $10 million for developing  the banking system in Lithuania and said that it was a signal of  foreign confidence.    Slezevicius said he was satisfied with the Lithuanian-Polish  agreement that was concluded last week. In the agreement  Lithuania had dropped its demand that Poland apologize for the  occupation of Vilnius in 1920. It was more important now that  Lithuania's borders were recognized and remained secure. Poland  had expressly called Vilnius the Lithuanian capital. Lithuania  had dropped its original demand that Warsaw apologize for  Poland's military action after World War II, because "a positive  negotiation result is better than none." "It is no good to  burden the future with the past." Lithuania was also trying to  achieve progress in the negotiations with Russia on the  recognition of the borders along the Kaliningrad area and in the  Baltic Sea. Slezevicius said that agreement had been reached  with Latvia on the border line. There were still problems with  Belarus. Following the change of president in Minsk, the  negotiations were not progressing. An area of 513 hectares was  at issue.    Slezevicius said it was a success of his government to have  concluded free trade agreements with the other Baltic states,  Scandinavia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, and a most favored nation  agreement in trade with Russia. Negotiations were now being  held with Brussels, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Germany  was Lithuania's largest European trading partner and investor:  "Our relations are developing in a helpful and dynamic way."</p>

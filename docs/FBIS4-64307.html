			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Russia and Latvia have now agreed on  the conditions for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from  Latvia. The presidents of the two countries will meet in Moscow  tomorrow to sign the agreement. [passage omitted] [Begin  recording] [Correspondent Goeran Skaansberg] The Swedish  Government has offered 16 million Swedish crowns to Latvia  toward dismantling the Skrunda radar station and the cost of  Russian pensioners moving back to Russia. Prime Minister Carl  Bildt, why did Sweden make this offer right now?    [Bildt] To make it easier for Latvia and to make possible an  agreement that means the withdrawal of the last Russian troops  from Latvia. In part, it is aid to start the dismantling of the  modern part of the big radar station in Skrunda as soon as  possible, and in part it is aid to the supplementary protocol on  which I hope there will be agreement in Moscow tomorrow, whereby  we can give some support to Russian retired officers who want to  move back to Russia from Latvia.    [Skaansberg] There has been [word indistinct] in this  connection, many Latvians are opposed to this agreement exactly  because it gives the retired Russian officers the possibility of  remaining in Latvia. Do you believe this money will make it  easier to get them to move back to Russia?    [Bildt] I believe one should look at this agreement very  much  like a social question. I can understand the feelings that  exist both on the Russian and the Latvian side in this matter,  but this is a matter of taking into account each individual.  What we want to do here is to create maybe slightly better  conditions for those who would like to move--Russian officers  and pensioners-- to move from Latvia to their original homeland.  That will now be slightly easier and I believe this can be a  benefit. [end recording]    [Announcer] This was Prime Minister Carl Bildt on Swedish  aid  to Latvia and the reporter was Goeran Skaansberg.</p>

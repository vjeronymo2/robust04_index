			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle pays FFr480m for Suez stake NESTLE, the Swiss food group facing the threat of opposition from the European Commission in its attempt to complete the takeover of Perrier mineral water, is paying FFr480m (Dollars 90.5m) to buy 1.5m shares in Suez, the French industrial and financial group. Nestle, which formed a joint venture with Banque Indosuez, the Suez banking subsidiary, to stage the Perrier bid, is buying the shares from Exor, the French property company that controls Perrier. Exor, after fighting fiercely against Nestle's FFr15.46bn bid, finally agreed to support it. Nestle which last week disclosed that European Community anti-cartel investigators were challenging its bid for Perrier, paid FFr320 a share for the Suez stake yesterday. Exor, which is controlled by IFINT, an investment vehicle for Italy's Agnelli family, originally owned a 2.3 per cent stake in Suez, which is a 10 per cent shareholder in Exor. Under the terms of the settlement of the Perrier battle, Nestle agreed to buy part of Exor's stake in Suez. Credit Agricole, the French bank which is one of Exor's minority shareholders and which came to the fore in the early stages of the Perrier battle when it objected to IFINT's original partial bid for Exor, had earlier bought some of Exor's shares in Suez.</p>

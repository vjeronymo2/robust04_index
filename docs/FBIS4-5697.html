Pak Yong-kon, director of the board of the International  Institute of the Chuche Idea and chairman of the Association of  Korean Social Scientists in Japan, in a speech on the subject  "Changes in current international relations and significance of  the chuche idea" said the chuche idea helps successfully tide  over the confusion, disorder and unrest that have surfaced with  changes in international relations after the end of the cold war  and establish a new international order based on independence,  peace and friendship.

Vishwanath, secretary general of the council of  "International Kim Il-song Prize" and secretary general of the  Chuche Idea Study Society of India, in his speech titled "Great  contribution of respected President Kim Il-song to the human  cause of independence" said it is a distinguished contribution  made by the great President Kim Il-song for the human cause of  independence that he has made socialism take deep roots among  the masses by combining it with the independent nature of social  being, thereby indicating a way along which socialism can make a  long drive, unshaken by the anti- socialist manoeuvrings of the  imperialists.

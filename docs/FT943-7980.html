			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: Inflation fears hit Treasuries The US Treasury market was rocked yesterday by fresh signs of inflation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 5/32 lower at 100 1/32 , with the yield rising to 7.491 per cent and the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.209 per cent. After a late slump in the previous session in the face of surging oil prices, the market stumbled again soon after trading began yesterday morning. The latest bit of troubling news was contained in the monthly survey of economic conditions conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Its August report revealed an acceleration of the regional economy, with the overall index of business activity climbing to 13.9, from 11.3 a month ago. Even more unsettling to fixed-rate investors, indices designed to gauge the prices paid and received by manufacturers were up sharply. The data sent the 30-year issue tumbling. Its fresh losses, combined with Wednesday's decline, wiped out the big gains rung up in the hours before and after Tuesday's announcement of a sharp tightening of monetary policy. The inflation data immediately raised suspicions that the Fed might bring forward its next rate increase. Early on, bonds slipped in response to the dollar's renewed weakness against the yen after news that the US trade deficit with Japan had widened during June. European government bond markets remained in a skittish mood yesterday following the Bundesbank's decision to keep leading interest rates unchanged. A fall in US Treasuries and weakness in sterling also undermined bond prices. The central bank also left the repo rate fixed at 4.85 per cent for another two weeks. Analysts said the Bundesbank was clearly postponing any decisions on interest rates until the market's nerves were less frayed. Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt, said that in view of the uncertainty about interest rates and the forthcoming federal elections, it was possible that the Bundesbank would stick with a fixed-rate repo for another six to eight weeks. He noted that the Bundesbank had no compelling reason to move on interest rates, given the stronger than expected economic data recently and the chances of a disappointing cost of living number next week. Even yesterday's superficially pleasing M3 money supply data for July did not justify a rate cut since they showed bank lending growth at its highest level for eight months. 'The Bundesbank's stance allows it to review the situation in two weeks,' said Mr Reid, but the markets would be left wondering whether this was a pause before another rate cut or the end of the current downward trend. On Liffe, the September bund future traded at 91.65 in the late afternoon, up 0.11 point on the day and off the day's low of 91.08. UK gilts failed to build on the previous day's gains as weakness in sterling worried some dealers. Although recent economic data has given the government ample excuses to leave interest rates alone, they fear that further pressure on the pound, and a poor M0 number for August, could force the government to raise rates as early as September. On Liffe, the September long gilt future fell  25/32 points to 100 1/2.</p>

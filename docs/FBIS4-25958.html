			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China's new automobile  industry policy has been approved and put into operation by the  State Council, according to Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State  Planning Commission.    At a press conference held today by the Information Office  of  the State Council, Ye said that the new automobile industry  policy especially encourages enterprise annexation and auto  parts production.    He said that after 40 years' development, China's auto  industry had made great achievements.    But with the progress of China's drive to reform and open to  the world, and the country's fast economic development, the auto  industry had been increasingly suffering from a number of  defects, he said, adding that the main ones include the  decentralized layout of factories, small scale of production,  low technological level, and repeated imports of foreign  technology.    He said that in the coming few years China will restructure  the layout of the auto industry, try to establish a number of  trans-provincial auto centers with reasonable output capability,  through market competition. By the year 2000, some three  auto-making giants will be set up, he disclosed.    To raise the overall level of China's auto industry, he  said,  China will pay great attention to the production of auto parts,  especially key parts for cars.    Foreign businessmen are welcome to cooperate with China in  this field, and preferential policies will be provided for auto  parts producers.    Sources from the Ministry of Machinery Industry said that  China has already selected more than 20 key parts for cars to  enjoy the government's special support, including preferential  policies and policy-oriented loans.    China also encourages auto parts enterprises to introduce  foreign technology and funds, in a bid to promote their product  level and development capability.    The auto industry is one of China's industries with the  fastest development speed. In the past few years it maintained  an annual average increase of over 20 percent. Last year China  produced a total of 1.34 million automobiles, and this year's  output is predicted to exceed the figure.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis spin-off priced at Dollars 23 a share An initial public offering of 60m shares in Pactel, the mobile communications arm of Pacific Telesis, the Californian-based Baby Bell telephone company, was priced last night at Dollars 23 a share, raising nearly Dollars 1.4bn, writes Martin Dickson in New York. The offering is the first stage of a plan by Pacific Telesis to spin off the company as a separate entity. The remaining Pactel stock - amounting to 80 per cent or more of the total outstanding - will be distributed to existing Pacific Telesis shareholders in the new year. The company had been expected to offer the shares at between Dollars 21 and Dollars 23. The lead underwriter is Lehman Brothers. Some 42m of the shares are being sold in the US and the remainder in international markets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.A. Bostan, I.G. Botez, and V.Ye. Dulgeru; UDC </F> 621.757:002.72]    [Text] The manipulator is a mechanical structure with a  large number of articulated elements and, as a rule, a large  number of degrees of freedom. In a perfect structure, such a  manipulator may assume any shape in the three-dimensional space.  This exceptional flexibility makes it possible to employ  manipulators in various fields of industry where the  maneuverability space is highly constrained.    This flexibility engenders new problems: how to monitor each  element when the arm is moving within a constrained space with  obstacles and eliminate collision with them, what is the optimum  control of various arm elements which can realize the necessary  trajectory, etc.?    It is obvious that in order to improve this manipulator's  maneuverability, the number of elements must be quite high.  Assuming that each element has two-to-three degrees of freedom  relative to the preceding one, it becomes necessary to use a  large number of actuators and devices which leads to an increase  in its mass and worsens the manipulator's technical  characteristics, such as its speed of response, positioning  accuracy, load-bearing capacity, etc. The solution to this  problem amounts to positioning actuators beyond the elements and  transmitting energy to a distance with the help of an adequate  mechanical, pneumatic, or electric system.    An original simplified manipulator design (Figs. 1a and b)  and an analysis of some of its parameters are presented in this  article.    The manipulator contains base 1 which houses the following:  stepping electric motor 2 and precision reduction gear 3  containing a satellite gear cluster 4 consisting of roller gear  rims 5 and 6 and sun gears 8 and 9 installed on crank 7. Gear 8  is linked to the base while driven sun gear 9 with gear-type  coupling 10 and clutch 11 is linked to the first link 12 after  the base. The manipulator also contains moving links 13-15  connected to each other by ball and socket joints 16-18.  Flexible tie 19 one of whose ends is connected through spring 20  to link 15 and the other end--to the screw of the ball and screw  transmission 21 located in the hub of the driven sun gear 9  passes through moving links 12-15. Each moving link 12-15 is  connected to the flexible tie by a centering mechanism.    <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-14A>           Fig. 1. Manipulator Design. </FIG>       Each centering mechanism is executed as two controlled  fixtures: controlled fixtures 22 and 23 are installed in link  13, controlled fixtures 24 and 25 are installed in link 14, and  controlled fixtures 26 and 27 are installed in link 15. The  screw of the ball and screw transmission is connected to link 12  by the second clutch 28 while link 12 is connected to the  flexible tie by controlled fixture 29. Each controlled fixture  is executed as an electromagnet whose core is articulated with  the flexible tie.    The manipulator operates as follows. When the electric motor  is switched on, the satellite gear cluster performs a precession  movement whereby the roller gear rims engage the sun gears.  Furthermore, driven sun gear 9 rotates with a reduction which is  determined by the number of rollers in gear rims 5 and 6 and the  number of teeth in sun gears 8 and 9. When the clutch is  engaged, gear 9 begins to rotate, and rotation is converted by  the ball and screw transmission into reciprocation motion of the  screw linked to the flexible tie. Thus, given a certain  combination of controlled fixture operations, one can obtain the  necessary slope angle of any moving link. For example, if  controlled fixtures are engaged simultaneously, the manipulator  may assume the position shown in Fig. 1. In this case, the  controlled fixtures operate in different directions in each  pair. For example, in order to link 13 around the center of the  ball and socket joint 16, it is necessary that controlled  fixture 23 pull flexible tie 19 in one direction, while  controlled fixture 24--in the other direction relative to the  longitudinal axis of link 13. The link rotation angle is  determined as the arc tangent of the ratio of the core  displacement _D_ S to the distance between the center of the  ball and socket joint 16 and the longitudinal axis of the  corresponding controlled fixture   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15A>           Equation </FIG>      Thus, the procession reduction gear with the ball and screw  transmission and centering mechanisms with the flexible tie make  it possible to obtain any manipulator displacement in one plane  bounded by the service area while the manipulator rotation  around its axis is ensured by the procession reduction gear.  This makes it possible to increase the positioning accuracy  since the manipulator motions are determined by the kinematic  accuracy of one procession reducer.    The use of stepping electric motors is dictated by their  good  controllability which eliminates the need for using a sensor  manipulator element position monitoring system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15B>           Equations </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15C>           Fig. 2. Manipulator's Coordinate Frame of Reference. </FIG>       It is expedient to use Euler's angles _ps_, _th_, and   which  correspond to each element rotation around the axes of  revolution in order to determine the manipulator arm position  and orientation. Each element has a spherical contact surface  (Fig. 2) and is fixed to the coordinate system of reference of  the preceding i-1 element of Euler's angles _ps_, _th_,   which  correspond to elementary geometrical rotations around the axes  OZ[.sup]i[/], OX[.sub]i[/], and OY[.sub]i[/].    The geometrical rotation around point O is characterized by  the rotation angle _ps_. The transformation matrix in this case  assumes the form of:      This matrix is also referred to as the elementary rotation  matrix. Likewise, rotation around the OX[.sup]i[/] axis has  the following rotation matrix:   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15D>           Equation </FIG>      The matrix of rotation around the OZ[.sup]i[/] =  OZ[.sup]i[/] axis is similar to matrix (2):   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15E>           Equation </FIG>      The elementary matrix of rotation around the OY[.sup]i1[/]  matrix is expressed as   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15F>           Equation </FIG>      Having obtained elementary rotation matrices, one can obtain  the transformation matrix R, which is also referred to as the  rotation matrix or transition probability matrix. For an  orthogonal initial system of coordinates, we obtain the  following dependence:   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-15G>           Equation </FIG>      Dependence (6) corresponds to elementary rotations around  the  OZ[.sup]i[/], OX[.sub]i[/], and OZ[.sub]l[/] axes.  Likewise, one can determine five more combinations of Euler's  angles which differ from those cited above.    Similar computations can be performed for any element i of  the flexible manipulator.    Consequently, the manipulator gripper position can be  analytically described and programmed at any moment in time and  at any point in the service area. This significantly simplifies  the manipulator control system.    For existing ``elephant trunk'' manipulators, the proposed  design is the simplest and has the best quality indicators.    The manipulator positioning accuracy can be increased by  decreasing the number of actuators and improving the element  controllability.    An analytical description of the current position of any  manipulator element in space ensures stored-program manipulator  control.</p>

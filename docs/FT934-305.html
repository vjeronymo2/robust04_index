			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Economic Insurance sold to management for Pounds 11.5m Hafnia, the Danish insurance company, has sold its last UK operating subsidiary to a management team led by the company's existing managing director for Pounds 11.5m. Economic Insurance, which provides 'innovative and specialised 'own label' insurance products' for leading brokers as well as marketing policies under its own name, plans to seek a London listing within the next two to three years. The buy-out, backed by Candover Investments with Causeway Capital, is the latest in a series of disposals since Hafnia suspended payments to creditors in August. Investors have provided an additional Pounds 1.5m working capital for Economic. Economic came to the market in April 1993 when the sale of Hafnia's insurance and financial services operation to a company in which Sun Alliance has the dominant stake left it as an independent operating unit. Economic said Sun Alliance opted against including Economic in its own stable because of a lossmaking mortgage guarantee business from which Economic has since been extricated. Mr Peter Cullum, 43, who is leading the MBO team, persuaded Hafnia to agree to the buy-out in June after several 'opportunistic' bids had been received. Mr Cullum, who joined Economic as managing director in 1991 with a brief to turn around the lossmaking company, said pre-tax profits in the year to December 1993 would be more than Pounds 4m on a gross premium income of Pounds 40m. Losses in the previous year totalled Pounds 5.5m.</p>

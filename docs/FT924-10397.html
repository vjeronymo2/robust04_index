			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax on life policies I UNDERSTAND that life policies retained by the original policyholder to maturity are exempt from CGT by virtue of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. However, on the recent maturity of two Scottish Widows life policies taken out by me in 1969 and 1972, the company issued to me copies of a certificate of chargeable event which they had sent to the Inland Revenue, showing an amount of chargeable gain in each case. Does the issue of such a certificate mean that they are chargeable to CGT? The two policies were paid up by me in 1977. Would this make them liable to CGT. The gains shown on the certificates are chargeable to income tax, not CGT, under sections 547 and 550 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. However, the rate of tax cannot exceed 15 per cent; it may effectively be 12 1/2 per cent (on part or all of the gains) if you were born before April 6 1927. If the gains plus the rest of your income of 1991-92 do not take you beyond the basic rate limit (and you were born after April 5 1927), there will be no tax to pay on the gains themselves. It was the fact that you made the policies paid-up within their first ten years which brought the maturity proceeds into the income tax net, in accordance with the rules now reenacted in section 540(1)(b)(i) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Furthermore, although the gains do not attract CGT in themselves, their existence could increase the potential CGT Liability on any chargeable gains in excess of the exempt amount (Pounds ,5500), but we gather that you did not in fact have any gains liable to CGT in 1991-92.

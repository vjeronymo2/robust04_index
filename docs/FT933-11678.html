			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Arlen chief steps down over plans A ROW over board strategy has cost Arlen, the light fittings and electrical accessories company, its chief executive just 18 months after he was appointed to the position. Arlen said Mr Paul Cohen had disagreed in particular with plans to raise cash by introducing Fortress Trust, the investment company, as a 29.9 per cent shareholder. Fortress proposes to underwrite a 1-for-1 rights issue to raise Pounds 7m, in return for the stake and the appointment of four directors to the board. Arlen needs the cash to redeem Pounds 3.2m in preference shares which fall due next year. Mr Cohen came to the Arlen board when it took over Highland Electronics in 1990. He will be replaced by Mr Tom Forsyth, a non-executive director as acting chairman until September, when it is expected a new chief executive will be named. Speculation centres on Mr Greville Howard, Fortress chairman. Arlen refused to comment on further details of Mr Cohen's departure. However, details of the Fortress Trust proposals are expected in the next few days.</p>

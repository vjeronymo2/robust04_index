			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Although provision of an in-lieu lot is not required, make a reasonable effort to provide a lot to holders whose lots will be converted to an alternative public use and who have received notification that new permits for those lots will not be issued or who have received revocation notices (except revocation for noncompliance) (FSM 2721.23e). For this purpose, in-lieu lots must be in nonconflicting locations in or adjacent to established tracts within the National Forest containing the residences, or in or adjacent to established tracts on adjacent National Forests. Appropriate lots for consideration are undeveloped, formerly developed, and withdrawn lots in or adjacent to established recreation residence tracts and which are not needed in the foreseeable future for other public uses. Lots that are vacant because of noncompliance or other factors also may be considered as in-lieu lots. In-lieu lots should be comparable to the lots being converted to an alternative public use when possible, but authorized officials should advise holders that the Agency cannot guarantee that the available in-lieu lots will be entirely comparable. Do not establish new recreation residence tracts for in-lieu lot purposes. Offer in-lieu lots in accordance with the procedures in FSH 2709.11, sec. 41.23c. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2347.11_Preventing Unauthorized Residential Use. Prevent unauthorized full-time residential use by enforcing the terms of the special use permit. Continue to administer those recreation residences presently authorized as a principal place of residence in accordance with provisions of the special use permit. Upon transfer or sale of improvements, discontinue the residential use and authorize only recreation residence use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2347.12_Caretaker Residences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2347.12a_Authority. Authorize caretaker use of a recreation residence with an annual permit, Form 2700&hyph;4, under the Act of June 4, 1897. (Require applicants who currently have term permits to exchange them as a condition of obtaining the caretaker authorization.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2347.12b_Caretaker Residence Use. The need for a caretaker residence rarely can be justified where yearlong occupancy is already authorized in the tract. The Forest Supervisor may authorize a caretaker residence in limited cases where it is demonstrated that caretaker services are needed for the security of a recreation residence tract and alternative security measures are not feasible or reasonably available. The fees for caretaker residences shall be 25 percent more than those charged for recreation residence use of a similar lot in the tract. A tract association may own caretaker residences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Authorize no more than one caretaker residence per recreation residence tract unless factors such as size and layout of the tract call for more than one. The affected tract association, or if there is no association, at least 60 percent of the affected holders, must document approval of request for a caretaker residence. Require the applicants for caretaker use to document the caretaker services they will provide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Aleksandr Pelts: </F> "The Tbilisi Agreement: Something for Russia and Caucasian  Peoples"]    [Text] Russian-Georgian summit talks began in the morning  of 3 February in the Cabinet Ministers building located in the  center of Tbilisi. The heads of the two states, Boris Yeltsin  and Eduard Shevardnadze, spoke one-on-one.    Also held behind closed doors were meetings of official  delegations. Oleg Soskovets, first vice premier, and Georgian  Cabinet of Ministers Chairman Otar Patsatsiya discussed a  complex of reciprocal, primarily economic, relations.    Political aspects of intergovernmental cooperation were  taken  up by Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev and Aleksandr  Chikvaidze. Representing the Georgian side in the negotiations  were Dzhaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Temporary Committee on  the Extraordinary Situation in the Republic, and Aleksandr  Kavsadze, chief of the State Committee on Protection of Rights  of Man and Interethnic Relations. The agenda went beyond general  Russian-Georgian relations to include certain aspects of the  Abkhaz and South Ossetian problems and the situation concerning  rights of non-native ethnic groups, particularly the Russian  population.    Also held was a meeting between Russian Minister of Defense  Army General Pavel Grachev and Major General Guram  Nikolayshvili, chief of the General Staff of the Georgian Armed  Forces, and Major General Paata Datyashvili. Army General Pavel  Grachev was highly pleased with the progress of the talks,  emphasizing that it was found possible to realize agreement on  the entire military cooperation agenda. Incidentally, the start  of the Russian-Georgian talks was preceded by a terrorist act:  Georgian Deputy Minister of Defense Nikolay Kekelidze was killed  in an explosion occurring in his apartment on 3 February. The  minister of defense himself, Major General Georgiy  Karkarashvili, retired from his position on the eve of the  talks. A KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent was able to determine  that the reason for the retirement was "unacceptability of a  policy of establishing closer relations between Georgia and  Russia."    Completion of the talks was followed by the signing of a  package of Russian-Georgian bilateral agreements, chief of which  was the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and  Cooperation.    Also signed was a number of intergovernmental agreements  relating to trade and economic ties, status of Russian Border  Troops stationed on Georgian soil, and cooperation in science  and technology, cultural matters, education, and communications.  One of the agreements signed that is of great importance governs  the migration process and protects rights of settlers. Another  agreement pertains to cooperation in prevention and clean-up  operations in emergency situations.    A provision to create three Russian military bases on  Georgian soil was set down in writing in a protocol of  intentions signed by the representatives of the defense  ministries of the two countries. Army General Pavel Grachev  stated that they could be created as early as 1994, with the  sites being Batumi, Akhalkalaki, and Vaziani. The minister of  defense also stated that "Eduard Shevardnadze's refusal to  accept our offer of introducing Russian peacekeeping forces into  Abkhazia in September of 1993 was a mistake on Georgia's part."  Pavel Grachev pointed out that this was admitted by  representatives of Georgia's Ministry of Defense.    Following the signing ceremony, Boris Yeltsin and Eduard  Shevardnadze held a joint press conference.    Relative to prospects of Georgia's entering into the ruble  zone, Boris Yeltsin stated at the press conference that it was  necessary to organize a working group which would weigh the  positive and the negative aspects of this kind of step, and only  after that would it be possible to make a decision.    Eduard Shevardnadze in principle shared Boris Yeltsin's  view,  adding that in Georgia there are ardent supporters and persons  adamantly opposed to the republic's entering into the ruble zone.    Boris Yeltsin, responding to journalists' questions relative  to Abkhazia's concern and alarm over the article in the  agreement providing for military-technical cooperation, stated  emphatically that technical assistance to Georgia is not a  matter of the present. The military cooperation process is to  take place gradually, in phases, tied closely to the rate of  progress made in political settlement of the Abkhaz problem.    Eduard Shevardnadze in turn stated emphatically that Georgia  will not be capable of creating an army without Russia, and she  has no intention of posing a threat to anyone. He also said that  he sees nothing that could preclude resolving the Abkhaz and  South Ossetian problem. The conflict settlement process, in  Shevardnadze's opinion, should proceed under the aegis of the UN  and the CSCE, with the employment of peacekeeping forces,  including those supplied by Russia.    In the opinion of Emil Pain, Presidential Council member,  all  the provisions of the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly  Relations, and Cooperation between Russia and Georgia, which  today was signed by the heads of the two states, are "useful for  Russia largely in the political aspect."    The Presidential Council member singled out the problem of  stationing Russian troops on Georgian soil and creating military  bases. "Georgia," he said, "is giving a guarantee of setting up  Russian servicemen." Emil Pain continued by saying that there is  a complex of strategic military agreements which are of general  significance to the CIS member countries. He cited an example:  It would cost Russia tens of millions of rubles if she were to  erect a new border. Also of importance are agreements made with  Georgia which pertain to moving Russian freight through Georgia  by land and sea.    Thus, the Agreement on Friendship, Neighborly Relations, and  Cooperation between Russia and Georgia has been signed. It is a  thing already done. This is illustrated to some extent in the  photograph of the unnamed soldier - taken by our correspondent -  who is a member of the Russian peacekeeping forces stationed in  South Ossetia. Thanks to young men such as he, Ossetian and  Georgian peasants for the first time in many years of the bloody  encounters are able to do their work as before on the land of  their ancestors.    Without him, the Russian peacekeeping soldier, the knot of  Caucasian contradictions could not be cut. And it seems that  this is finally being recognized by those who only yesterday  were shouting "occupier" at him.    In the afternoon of the day, Boris Yeltsin met with  Patriarch  Ilya the Second, the head of the Church of all Georgia. Later  the President of Russia and Eduard Shevardnadze held a meeting  with representatives of Georgia's intelligentsia. In the  evening, Chairman of the Parliament and Head of State of the  Republic Eduard Shevardnadze hosted an official dinner in honor  of the President of Russia.</p>

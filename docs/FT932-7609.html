			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brent bears brunt of recession - Trading at the chemicals group has hit a wall LORD LANE of Horsell, chairman of Brent Chemicals and grandee of the Conservative party, is not a popular man in the City. In March his chairman's statement accompanying the results rang with confidence for the future; though European markets were weak, the US market was improving, and he praised the successful strategy of expanding internationally. By this Thursday, his view had changed dramatically. Lord Lane told the AGM that profits for the speciality chemicals company for the first half would be well below those for the same period in 1992. US recovery has not worked through to industrial companies, and in continental Europe - which provides 55 per cent of profits - recession, particularly in Germany and Spain, has hit hard. As a result, the shares shed 26p to 103p, down from the 165p high in March, leaving analysts floundering as to where they should pitch forecasts for the year. From owning a share that carried an above average yield and some recovery potential, shareholders must now question whether their dividend will still be paid - or at least whether it will be covered by earnings. Mr Steve Cuthbert, chief executive, chooses not make a profits forecast. Chastened and disappointed, he does say the following; 'A shareholder concerned if he would get a dividend or not would be over-reacting to the position.' But the abrupt turnround in trading is not the first time Brent shareholders have been disappointed by their board. The company's progress has been funded partly by organic growth. But it has also had a string of placings and rights issues, to the extent that earnings per share are lower now than they were in 1987. Most recently Brent followed a 1991 rights issue to buy Hebro in Germany with a March 1992 profits warning. Credibility was just beginning to be restored when this latest warning came. While the Stock Exchange might applaud Brent for favouring a public statement, rather than a series of meetings with key brokers, the City would have preferred more realism first time around. As often happens when a company's trading hits a wall, attention has focused on the balance sheet it must now fall back on. While the company has called this 'strong' and claimed no net debt at the end of last year, some analysts remain concerned. With unfortunate timing, Hoare Govett's long time bear of Brent, Mr Martin Evans, turned a buyer only days before the latest profit warning, but even then pointed to the creeping level of debt. One reason for this is deferred payments for past acquisitions. Payments of Pounds 7.8m this year - Pounds 5.7m is payable in 1994 - would have pushed gearing to 40 per cent by the end of 1993 on the pre-warning figures. Mr Cuthbert recognises it will be somewhat higher now. But Brent does not include another Pounds 6.5m of finance leases or Pounds 12m of preference shares, which some analysts think should be considered as part of debt. It is stretching definitions to call this a strong balance sheet, although Mr Cuthbert says interest is covered seven times by profits. Operationally, Brent is facing considerable constraints. It has a limited scope to improve profits in Germany - which accounts for 30 per cent of income - or in the rest of Europe, which together provided 55 per cent of the Pounds 11.5m profits in 1992. With the exception of British Vita, Brent has the highest relative exposure to the weakening Continental economy of any UK chemicals company. And the company has already enjoyed 18 months of the usual cost cutting and overhead control medicine. It therefore remains heavily dependent on these unpromising economies, slowing their slide into recession. Sales of some of its products - packaging inks and coatings, and metal treatment chemicals - are heavily dependent on an economic upturn in its markets - a factor which even better management could not control. Brent now has an exceptionally tough task to restore credibility and some shareholders may decide they have had enough. Its message about European and US markets has not been missed by a wider audience. Following Brent's warning, Burmah Castrol shares fell yesterday on fears of its German exposure through its Foseco subsidiary. Courtaulds and Hickson also slipped. Recovery may be around the corner, but it is turning out to be a longer corner than many imagined.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Accounts code planned for investment trusts The investment trust industry is to develop its own recommended accounting practice to guide the future format of company accounts within the sector. The Association of Investment Trust Companies said yesterday it had received formal approval to develop guidelines from the Accounting Standards Board. The aim will be to produce a statement of recommended practice (Sorp) for member companies for circulation next year. Mr Ernest Fenton, director-general of the association, said the move reflected a desire to record best practice and a recognition that different companies presented financial information in different ways. 'We want to help shareholders interpret financial information by making it easier to compare the financial performance of investment trusts. We also want to help those responsible for preparing financial statements by agreeing a framework which allows individual companies to provide informative and complete financial reports,' he said. He said he expected the association to consider as many as 20 accounting topics, although he did not want to provide details of the specific issuesto be examined until they had been discussed by investment trust companies. However, he said they were likely to include isses related to the distinction between capital and revenue, and on timing and recognition. The Accounting Standards Board and its predecessor, the Accounting Standards Committee, have delegated the development of similar statements to a number of sectors including oil and banking.</p>

S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. and Bayer A.G., Civil No. 94 C 50249, as to both defendants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by entering into an agreement by which Bayer licensed S.C. Johnson to use Cyfluthrin in household insecticides in the United States, refrained from licensing other firms to use Cyfluthrin, and ended its own plans to compete with S.C. Johnson in the sale of household insecticides in the United States. S.C. Johnson is the country's largest maker of household insecticides with total sales between 45&hyph;60% of the market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants from entering into any agreement to allocate markets for the sale of household insecticides, and it requires them to license others, on reasonable terms, to use or sell Cyfluthrin. The judgment also enjoins defendants from entering into any exclusive license for any active ingredient, if the license agreement has been disapproved by the United States, and it requires S.C. Johnson to provide the government prior notice of any such exclusive license with any person other than Bayer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Household insecticides are chemical products sold in a wide variety of forms ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> aerosols, bait traps) for use by consumers to kill ants, roaches, and other insects that infest dwellings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the proposed Final Judgment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments and responses thereto will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Gail Kursh, Chief Professions and Intellectual Property Section, Room 9903, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001 [(telephone: 202) 307&hyph;5799)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph H.

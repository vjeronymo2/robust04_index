			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Nigerian debt proposal too optimistic Sir, Paul Adams and Michael Holman's suggestion (April 23) that Nigeria could receive debt relief of 60 per cent on its debts through a Trinidad terms deal is more than a little optimistic for two reasons. First, because Trinidad deals only cover government-to-government debt, which, at Dollars 14.7bn, forms only half of Nigeria's debt. Second, because the amount of debt written off for the first 15 countries to receive Trinidad terms relief represents just 3 per cent of their total outstanding debts. They must wait for a review three years hence for any prospect of the debt relief they so badly need. Little wonder that the World Bank, in its World Debt Tables 1992-1993, itself concluded that 'in several severely indebted low income countries, debt burdens remain at unsustainably high levels, even after the application of the Trinidad terms'. There is the broader question that without assistance now, which the World Bank and IMF have so far refused to give, there cannot be a successful transfer of power to a civilian government later this year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that if  the new statute concerning passage from the Istanbul Strait is  not enforced, a city of 10 million will be in jeopardy, and  Turkey will in no way allow this.    Cetin met with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who  is currently in Turkey for the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council meeting. In a statement, Cetin reported that the  straits statute was discussed during the meeting. Cetin said  that he explained to the Russian foreign minister that the new  statute regulating passage from the Bosporus does not violate  the Montreux Convention. Cetin declared:    [Begin Cetin recording] If necessary, we can clarify some of  the issues again and explain that they do not violate the  Montreux Convention. It is possible that some technical issues  are not entirely clear, but Turkey cannot allow a city of 10  million people to be threatened. A new arrangement is  absolutely necessary, and the Russians also concede this point.  [end recording]    Cetin added that the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict and the  Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline issues were also discussed with  Kozyrev.</p>

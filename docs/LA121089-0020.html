			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LORD OF THE RINK  </P> <P> Jerry Crowe's "Lord of the Rink" (Oct. 1) leads one to believe that the Kings  had no accomplishments before Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall. These "perennial  losers" did produce a league scoring champion, Lady Byng and Calder Trophy  winners and the Triple Crown Line -- not to mention the first miracle playoff  defeat of Edmonton. I'm glad that new crowds are sold on the team, but as a fan  since 1967 I'd like to see a more generous view of the Kings' long tradition  and a loyalty to the jersey, old and new.  </P> <P> DON POWELL, Newport Beach  </P></p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / False ring to party chief's publicity LIKE many a Hollywood star, Mr Franz Schonhuber, Germany's most prominent far-right party boss, seems to think bad publicity is better than none, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Mr Schonhuber, who heads the nationalist Republican party, stepped into the limelight this week when it was revealed he had been selling 5,000 illegal telephone cards bearing his picture. Postreklame, a subsidiary of the German state-owned telecoms group, said yesterday it was considering suing the party organisation. Legal proceedings have already been opened against Protar, the Berlin-based company which made the cards. Meanwhile, telephone card collectors have been rushing to find the cards which show Mr Schonhuber's face against the red, black and gold colours of the Republican party. The card, issued on Mr Schonhuber's 70th birthday, gives the party's telephone number on the back. Protar is believed to have bought the cards, worth DM12 (Pounds 4.60), from post offices before changing their design. The new cards sold for DM70. Postreklame was approached last year by an advertising agency and asked if it would manufacture the cards. But the telecoms company, which has printed similar cards for German mainstream parties, refused on political grounds.</p>

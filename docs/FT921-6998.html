			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Seoul suffers record deficit SOUTH KOREA'S current account deficit hit a record Dollars 8.83bn last year, provisional Bank of Korea figures showed yesterday, and economists said the shortfall would worsen this year, Reuter reports from Seoul. The 1991 deficit outstripped the previous record of Dollars 5.32bn set in 1980 and compared with a 1990 deficit of Dollars 2.18bn, the central bank said. Economists predicted that the shortfall in the current account, which measures trade and international transactions in invisible goods and services, would widen to between Dollars 9bn and Dollars 10bn this year. Mr Park Jeong-ryong, central bank economist said: 'The deficit is not expected to show signs of dramatic recovery this year and over the next year as our exports face difficulties. 'We have to compete with China and south-east Asian countries on price while our product quality and technology seems to be far behind that of advanced nations.' South Korea, which enjoyed multi-million dollar trade surpluses in the late 1980s, has been hit by soaring imports and lagging exports. It has also suffered from the effects of economic recession in some of its main markets and a loss of price competitiveness. A domestic construction boom, excessive consumption and politically motivated government policies aggravated the deficit, economists said. The trade deficit, which makes up about 90 per cent of the current account, ballooned to Dollars 9.66bn on a customs-cleared basis in 1991 from Dollars 4.82bn a year earlier. The central bank figures showed trade deficits widening with South Korea's two main partners, the US and Japan. The chronic deficit with Japan soared to a record Dollars 8.76bn against Dollars 361m. South Korea, which had enjoyed a decade of trade surplus with the US, posted a deficit of Dollars 335.1m from a surplus of Dollars 240.2m in 1990. It was the first deficit since 1981.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Beijing today talks started between Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Chinese Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen. Our special correspondent Viktor Levin reports:    [Levin] As an official of the Russian Foreign Ministry  announced, at a closed meeting of the foreign ministers of the  two countries there was a discussion of problems raised at the  conference in Blagoveshchensk. There, the heads of  administration posed rather acutely the question that during the  regulation of border crossings and the normalization and  regulation of contacts between the two countries one should not  forget, and one cannot forget, that these links are of vital  significance to the inhabitants of these regions. The  regulation and settlement should not damage the normal  commercial and economic relations between the border provinces  of China and Russia.    There was also discussion of the situation on the Korean  peninsula. We do not know what the ministers said specifically,  but one can surmise since both sides are very concerned about  the plans of the DPRK to manufacture nuclear arms. Russia and  China's positions coincide. Such a gloomy prospect places both  sides on their guard.    In my view, many of the cards that the diplomats are holding  close to their chest, so to speak, were displayed by Andrey  Kozyrev, himself speaking at the Chinese People's Diplomacy  Institute. Speaking of cooperation by Russia and China in the  Security Council, he said that there are practically no problems  being discussed in that body of the United Nations on which  Russia and China have insurmountable differences or  confrontation. On all questions, the minister stressed, there  exists a very high degree of mutual understanding.    In his speech at the People's Diplomacy Institute, Andrey  Kozyrev also revealed the thesis of constructive partnership.  He mentioned it during the talks and now from this speech one  can draw definite conclusions. Above all, the Russian foreign  minister said, we propose making new strides on the road to  strengthening mutual trust and ensuring mutual security.    It must be said that China received guardedly the new  Russian  military doctrine in which the provision of non-first use of  nuclear weaponry is absent. But to the Chinese side's questions  a precise and clear answer was given.    In the declaration signed during the summit meeting in 1992,  or to be more precise in December 1992, when Russian President  Boris Yeltsin was in China, it was stressed that both sides  renounced the first use of nuclear weaponry and the minister  again stressed this principle.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: OMV seeks partner to take 20% stake OMV, the Austrian oil group, is to seek a foreign partner to take a 20 per cent stake in the company in a further step in its privatisation. The Austrian government was reported earlier this year to be considering a merger between OMV and the Verbund utility. But Mr Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer, OMV's chief financial officer, said yesterday it had become 'clear a merger was not realistic'. Instead, Austrian Industries, the state holding company, is to reduce the 72 per cent stake it has held in OMV since initial privatisation in 1987 to 30 per cent, and OMV will seek a foreign partner to take a 20 per cent stake. The proportion of shares in the public domain will be increased from 28 to 50 per cent through a private or public share placement. OMV is Austria's largest quoted industrial company, with a market capitalisation of Sch24bn (Dollars 2.43bn). Mr Ruttenstorfer said plans were at an early stage, but OMV was selecting an investment house to handle the proposed changes and hoped to start talking to potential partners by the end of the year. The changes in the ownership structure should be completed in 1993 or early 1994. He said OMV was seeking a partner which was a crude producer, in order to to secure access to greater oil supplies, and which would help OMV to implement its corporate strategy. That strategy includes increasing oil reserves through refocusing and higher spending on exploration and production activities, and strengthening OMV's position as an integrated energy company in central and eastern Europe. The company already has motor fuel marketing operations in the former Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, and is seeking a stake in a refinery in the Czech republic.</p>

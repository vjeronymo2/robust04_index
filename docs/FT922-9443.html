			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Getting customers taped - Philips has discovered at last the value of promotion, and is belatedly looking for ways to win over the consumer Next month, an eye-catching dome big enough to house 80 people will go on the road in the UK, visiting shopping centres. The dome is a promotional gimmick from Philips, not best known for its clever marketing techniques. The 'Entechdome' as it is called, will carry demonstration booths for products which the Dutch group hopes will become hits in the consumer electronics market. Philips is demonstrating a new-found eagerness to reach out to consumers. After years at the mercy of its Japanese competitors, it has discovered that good marketing can make a difference. It reckons that the travelling demonstration booth - a technique borrowed from Japan - is a better way to publicise its products than conventional advertising. The change in attitude is reflected in 'Operation Centurion', which Jan Timmer, Philips' president, says will 'call entrenched views and habits into question' and shake the company out of its traditional complacency. When the programme was introduced a year ago, Philips was in dire need of a shake-up. Not only was it making heavy losses, it had become a symbol of what was wrong with much of European industry - it had superior technology but could not bring it successfully to the market. Its experience with video cassette recorders is a case in point. Philips was the first company to make VCRs commercially available. Yet its own machine, called V2000, which it confidently brought to the market as technically better than competing products, was a flop because of a shortage of pre-recorded tapes in the V2000 format. Meanwhile, the VHS format, which was widely judged to be technically inferior, was skilfully marketed by the Japanese, and has become the de facto industry standard. Philips had a similar experience with Laservision, its laser disc player which failed to win over consumers largely as a result of a distribution fiasco and marketing failure. Philips did not bother to ensure that the discs were sold with the players and, more often than not, salesmen could not even tell consumers where to buy them. While its Japanese competitors were busy brushing up their publicity acts, selling products which were largely based on foreign technology, Philips appeared to be sleeping unbothered in Eindhoven, the small Dutch town where it is based. But the group believes it has finally learnt its lesson. 'We've been through all the problems now,' says a spokesman. As a result, the group's philosophy has changed substantially, it says. No longer expecting products to sell on superior technology alone, it is paying more attention to consumer needs and preferences, industry trends and product design. It has set up a number of task forces charged with keeping up to date on trends in different markets and developing a greater awareness of customers' demands. Earlier this year it hosted a Customer Day when Timmer addressed 100,000 Philips employees throughout the world on the subject of customer responsiveness. The company's new approach, it says, is illustrated by its approach to the digital compact cassette. The cassette tapes, which will be available in September, were developed after extensive market research showed a need for a product to replace conventional audio tapes, which have seen sales fall in the past few years. 'You're actually starting from a marketing need rather than take a technology and try to find a market for it,' says a spokesman. Philips is also working to improve its corporate image and product design - two areas which, it now accepts, have an impact on competitiveness. Where it had - by its own admission  - been old-fashioned in product design, it is now trying to revamp its image with products that are aesthetically satisfying as well as of high technical quality. Its new range of sophisticated audio and video products, called the Philips Collection, have a simple and elegant look. Consumers' perception of Philips' products will inevitably influence their view of Philips as a corporation. But Philips has no illusions about the challenge it faces in trying to revamp its image as a safe, if dull, company. The company is looking on enviously at the clever marketing of Sony, which is aiming electronic products at children with the catch-phrase 'My First Sony'. Those children who receive their 'First Sony' will grow up with a feeling of fondness for the Japanese manufacturer's products which they are likely to retain as adults. Philips hopes the purchase of Whittle, a US company which produces educational software, will help it in a similar way by introducing schoolchildren to Philips' products at an early stage. Many observers believe the steps it is now taking to shake up the group have been long overdue. Some still have their doubts as to whether the changes have come in time for the group to regain competitiveness in an increasingly difficult environment. Many of the changes have been accepted practice at Japanese electronics manufacturers for years. The success of those companies has been founded not only on the quality of their products, but on skilful marketing. If Japanese manufacturers are to be taken as a benchmark, Philips still has a lot of catching up to do.</p>

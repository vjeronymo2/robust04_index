			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SENTENCES ZSA ZSA GABOR TO 3 DAYS IN JAIL FOR SLAPPING A COP  </P> <P> For those who think cops hiding behind mustaches and mirrored sunglasses,  giving traffic tickets to commuters for minor infractions of questionable laws  to fill city treasuries is the biggest racket of all . . .  </P> <P> For those who laugh upon hearing Judge Rubin piously reprimand Zsa Zsa Gabor  for likening America's (and his) justice to the communists and Nazis -- and  then deny her constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech by forbidding her  to discuss his actions (the sentencing) with the press . . .  </P> <P> For those who can see the difference between petty jealousy of Zsa Zsa Gabor  and the real issue -- governmental money-making schemes in the name of law,  propaganda and governmental incursion into our lives . . .  </P> <P> For those of us, Miss Gabor's was far from "A slap in the face of all  Americans;" it was more like the slap heard 'round the world.  </P> <P> BILL DOTY  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

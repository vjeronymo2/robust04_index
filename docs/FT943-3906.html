			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Kidder shrugs off the axe While the rest of Wall Street waits for the axe to fall at Kidder Peabody, the troubled investment bank has been busy making senior appointments which suggest it is exploring ways to make the business grow, rather than shrink, writes Richard Waters. Last week, the General Electric subsidiary said it had created a new worldwide business development job for Michael Madden. The move effectively puts the long-time investment banker in line to take over as Kidder's number two next year, when GE hopes to draw back from the direct control it currently exerts. Madden, 45, was head of Kidder's investment banking for three years until 1989, when he left - apparently over a leadership tussle - for Lehman Brothers. He rejoined Kidder last year, and has now been given the rather grandiose title of head of global origination - making him responsible for drumming up business for the bank from companies looking to raise money in the capital markets. At the same time, Kidder said it had appointed Norman Liu as managing director in charge of business development. Liu comes across from GE Capital, and part of his job will be to find ways of creating new business between his former employer and Kidder. In the past, the two financial firms have had a stand-off relationship. Despite these moves, though, rival banks continue to expect significant cost-cutting at Kidder. The revelation earlier this year that previously-reported profits of Dollars 350m were fictitious - a fact that Kidder has blamed on former bond trader Joseph Jett - has highlighted the bank's disproportionately large cost base and over-dependence on one area: mortgage-backed bonds.</p>

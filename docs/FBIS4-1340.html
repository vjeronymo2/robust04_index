			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer de Sloovere] The situation is still  unclear in the Burundian capital Bujumbura. Last night a small  group of the Burundian military tried to overthrow the  government, but their coup reportedly failed. Yet calm has not  returned completely. Shooting in the northern district of  Kamenge is still being heard and the Army has given the  civilians until 1800 [1500 GMT] to hand in their weapons. Here  is a report by our correspondent Robert Esselinckx:    [Begin recording] [Esselinckx] As far as we can gauge, the  violence remains restricted to Kamenge and Kinama on the  outskirts of Bujumbura. The Tutsi-dominated Army has tried for  days to disarm Hutu civilians and much fighting is continuing.    [Unidentified person] Every 10 minutes we hear shooting,  either machine guns or other firearms. The ultimatum to the  Kamenge inhabitants to hand in their weapons by 1800 on 24 April  expired and has been extended another 24 hours.    [Esselinckx] What about the white people, the Belgians? Are  they in danger?    [Person] No, not at all.    [Esselinckx] Apart from that, a small group of the military  attempted a coup last night, which reportedly failed. Several  ministers who had gone into hiding have returned and taken up  their posts again. Everything is normal in many places in  Bujumbura. Moreover, Sabena will maintain its three scheduled  flights for this week.    In the meantime, 350 Belgian paratroopers are still in  Nairobi waiting to return to Belgium, unless, off course, the  Belgian Government decides to have them help in the evacuation  of our citizens from Burundi. But the Council of Ministers must  make a decision on that first.    Incidentally, one of the two military Boeings 727 had an  engine breakdown in Nairobi. [end recording]    [De Sloovere] We now have our reporter Faroek Ozgunes on the  line from Bujumbura for the latest developments. Faroek, have  you noticed anything at all of this failed coup?    [Ozgunes] The leadership of the Burundian Army actually is  putting the events in perspective and is not talking about a  coup, but rather of a small uprising within the Army. I have  spoken with the Burundian Army chief of staff, who told me that  10 soldiers had left their barracks without permission. They  tried to involve others in their mutiny but without success, and  they have been arrested. Also, two officers have been arrested  and are being questioned at this very moment.    [De Sloovere] Did you hear any shooting?    [Ozgunes] No. To hear shooting one must travel to Kamenge,  which everyone is being advised against doing. We tried  yesterday, but were chased away. Kamenge is blocked off and it  is impossible to gain access.    [De Sloovere] Are there any troops or tanks in the streets?    [Ozgunes] Light armored personnel carriers are driving on  the  streets, not in the center of Bujumbura itself, but more on the  outskirts and the gendarmerie have erected checkpoints  everywhere in the city. Anybody who wants to pass is being  searched thoroughly, and especially for weapons.    [De Sloovere] Yet it is clear that just one spark can make  the violence flare up.    [Ozgunes] That is correct. Right now the center of Bujumbura  is quiet, but there is a lot of movement, especially in the  adjoining areas. Hundreds of Hutus have fled Kamenge District.  One of them told me: There is no place for us to go anymore.  Kamenge is the only remaining Hutu stronghold in Bujumbura.  According to these refugees, the Army entered Kamenge yesterday  and started shooting at random. It is unknown how many victims  there are. The Burundian Army actually is ready to march into  that neighborhood to disarm the Hutus.    [De Sloovere] How about the security of the Belgians? Have  they been advised to remain inside?    [Ozgunes] The Belgians are in no, repeat no, danger. Yet  they have been advised by the Belgian Embassy to stay off the  streets after 1800. This is more a precautionary measure: many  criminals are using the current chaos to rob people on the  streets.    There was an emergency meeting at the Belgian Embassy  yesterday afternoon to discuss the situation of our citizens,  but there are no confirmed plans so far to have Belgians leave  Burundi.    [De Sloovere] Thank you, Faroek. We will hear you again in  our next newscast.</p>

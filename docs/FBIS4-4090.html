			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, April 26 (XINHUA)--The first phase of  construction of a rare-earth export center is expected to be  completed in Tianjin port shortly.    Funded by Baotou Steel and the Rare Earth Corporation of the  Baotou Iron and Steel Company, the project will turn Tianjin  Port into the largest Chinese port to export rare-earth.    Three workshops and two warehouses, plus an office building,  have already been constructed in the free trade zone near  Tianjin Port.    The center will deal with all export and transport business  of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company.    With the largest proportion of the deposits of rare-earth in  the country, Baotou Iron and Steel Company in the Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Region, exports large amounts of rare earth every  year.    In 1992, the company decided to invest 30 million yuan in  Tianjin's free trade zone to set up an industry and trade  corporation of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, which is in charge  of the construction of the center.    Huang Jianhua, deputy manager of the newly-established  corporation, said that during the construction period, the  corporation has exported rare-earth whose value was more than 6  million U.S. dollars.    He said that by the end of 1995, about 60 million tons of  rare- earth will have been exported to other countries through  the center.    He said that his corporation will import equipment worth 170  million U.S. dollars through the center.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOLD THE APPLAUSE  </P> <P> Not content with merely clapping between movements, the Pacific Symphony  patrons have now taken to clapping during movements.  </P> <P> At the Nov. 7 concert, Carl St. Clair and the Pacific Symphony turned out a  crackling performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, it was twice interrupted with unwelcome applause, once after the  close of the second movement and again in the fourth movement, where  Tchaikovsky foolishly intruded a brief pause before the final statement.  Tchaikovsky should have known better than to tempt our audience with the  briefest moment of silence.  </P> <P> Since we can't do anything about composers who want to pencil in moments of  silence, perhaps we can aid the audience. I propose the following eight rules  on when to clap and, more pertinently, when not to clap:  </P> <P> 1. When in doubt, don't.  </P> <P> 2. If the conductor still has his hands in the air, keep yours in your lap.  </P> <P> 3. Count the movements listed in the program, and don't clap between them.  </P> <P> 4. Catch the mood.  </P> <P> 5. Wait for the climax.  </P> <P> 6. Listen for resolution.  </P> <P> 7. Let the sound die before clapping.  </P> <P> 8. Ignore your neighbor -- he or she probably doesn't have any better idea of  when to clap than you do.  </P> <P> As evidenced by Wednesday's concert, the Pacific Symphony Orchestra has grown  into a first-class orchestra. Let's become a first-class audience.  </P> <P> ROBERT C. SANGSTER  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

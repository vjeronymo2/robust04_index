			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Racal wins orders from Norway and Turkey RACAL RECORDERS has won two orders worth almost Pounds 400,000 from the civil aviation authorities in Norway and Turkey for its multi-channel ICR systems to record voice communications between air traffic controllers and aircrew. Under one of the contracts, worth more than Pounds 250,000, Racal has supplied dual-deck ICR recording systems to improve ground-to-air communications at airports across Norway - from Hammerfest in the north to Kristiansand in the south. Racal will supply a comprehensive spares package as well as providing training for operators in the UK at the company's headquarters in Hythe, Hampshire. The second order, worth in excess of Pounds 120,000, was awarded by Devlet Hava Meydanlari Isletmesi (DHMI), which is responsible for all Turkey's national and international civilian airports. Multi-channel ICR64 Series recorders will be used at four locations, including Ankara International Airport, for recording voice communications as Turkey upgrades its air traffic control (ATC) system. The ICR communications recorder has a radar recording capability. This system can offer civil aviation departments a permanent record of the flight history of each aircraft. Using plot extracted radar data, it gives the last known position of an aircraft for search and rescue operations and assists in post-incident inquiries by providing full details of targets under investigation. Designed around a central microprocessor, the recorder provides a simple-to-use, individual deck control/display panel plus time and activity search facilities. It is capable of recording 64 voice channels per deck simultaneously and plot extracted data at up to 19,200 bit/s.</p>

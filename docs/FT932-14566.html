			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Arts: Lille parades its artistic legacy - Patricia Morison visits the French at the National THREE magnificent paintings, David's 'Belisarius', Delacroix's 'Medea', and Courbet's 'Une Apres-dinee a Ornans', make a compelling case for a visit to Tradition and Revolution in French Art, 1700-1880 at the National Gallery. This exhibition is surely one of the most wide-ranging and informative surveys of French art to have been seen in Britain. The exhibition comes from the Musee des Beaux-Arts in Lille, one of the best public collections in France. The museum opened in 1809, a few years after Napoleon had signed a decree permitting favoured towns to build museums at their own expense for works of art confiscated during the Revolution. The museum is now closed for rebuilding (reopening December 1994), and meanwhile parts of the collection have been sent abroad. It is a shrewd move, of a piece with Lille's commercial ambitions. The idea is that, once the Channel Tunnel is open, travellers crossing the mournful coastal reaches will flock to Lille as to a beacon of French culture. Jacques-Louis David's 'Belisarius' of 1781 is a marvellous painting, noble and pathetic. The contrast is an affecting one, between the blind old warrior and the golden child who stands between his knees. Both gaze imploringly at the compassionate lady who drops a coin into the outstretched helmet. A stormy sky casts menacing shadows over Byzantine Constantinople, an omen of the divine displeasure incurred by Emperor Justinian when he had his great general blinded. The soldier with his hands raised in horror is not one of David's happier passages, but makes the point that a state which outrages the moral sense of its citizens cannot prosper. Opposite 'Belisarius' hangs one of Delacroix's grimmest images, 'Medea', the fugitive poised to slit the throats of her two struggling infants. Sketches make clear how the artist wrestled to balance this complicated composition, drawn in essence (and perhaps with deliberate irony) from Andrea del Sarto's 'Charity'. A shadow across Medea's brow, missing in the oil sketch, is a masterly touch which shows that evil has entirely possessed this unnatural mother. These two paintings could illustrate any textbook account of French art's progress from neo-classicism to romanticism. The third huge masterpiece, Courbet's 'Une Apres-dinee a Ornans' of 1848, represents the shocking arrival of realism on the scene. It is now a wreck because Courbet used bitumen and litharge, but thanks partly to restoration, the real thing turns out to be more legible than in reproduction. After the preceding paintings, the shock is still palpable. Here is an artist who thought that his friends, unremarkable chaps relaxing after dinner with a smoke, a fiddle, and a bottle of wine, were a fit subject for a massive canvas. It was not at all the same thing as painting artists in a studio, a conventional subject here represented by Boilly's studies for his 'Studio of Isabey', part of an attractive group of paintings by this painter from Lille. Courbet's scene is powerfully rustic and yet not the time-honoured depiction of peasants, as in Boilly's 'Mon pied-de-boeuf' and a queasy Millet of a mother spoon-feeding her children. A new kind of peasant painting was about to appear, solemn moments in village ritual. The famous example from Lille is Jules Breton's 'Procession to erect a Crucifix', itself based on Courbet's 'Burial at Ornans'. And yet, so powerful is the mood conveyed by the 'Apres-dinee' that its underlying theme seems clear; the power of music over the senses. To be sure, it is a revolutionary painting in manner and technique, yet it is still rooted in a traditional subject. Such moments of realisation are many in an exhibition which fills a lot of gaps. The National Gallery's own collection of French art is patchy, even though the Wallace Collection compensates handsomely. However, Tradition and Revolution includes many unfamiliar artists who rarely find their place in textbook accounts of French art. Unfortunately, the first room marks a dangerously low point with a feeble piece of mythological eroticism by Greuze and two laughable 'Combats between Minerva and Mars'. The first won Joseph-Benot Suve the 1771 Prix de Rome. The version by David is a terrible thing, so clumsily put together in boudoir shades of sky-blue and rose, that it seems incredible he ever achieved anything great. Most certainly that was not within the grasp of Jean Raoux, specialist in Vestal Virgins, by whom there are two truly terrible paintings of Virgins Ancient and Modern. Frightful things also lurk in the later 19th century, such as Amaury-Duval's 'The Birth of Venus', and 'Achilles and Priam' by Bastien-Lepage, a painting so awful as to exert a mesmeric fascination. But there are many paintings to set against these, such as Gericault's 'Race of the Riderless Horses' and a glowing vase of flowers by Delacroix. Here, then, is a broad view of French art from Rococo to Impressionism (just, with two landscapes by Sisley and Lepine), as well as a powerful reminder that Lille vaut le voyage. Exhibition closes July 11. late opening until 8 on Wednesdays</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OVERTURNED TANKER CLOGS UP FREEWAY  </P> <P> Traffic was backed up for miles Wednesday night after a tank truck jackknifed  on the Santa Ana Freeway just north of Lake Forest Drive, the California  Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said the truck slammed into the back of a car,  injuring its two occupants. The truck driver was not hurt.  </P> <P> The accident forced closure of all but one lane on the northbound side of the  freeway.  </P> <P> CHP officers who arrived at the scene at 7:17 p.m. called for firefighters  because of fears that the tanker may have contained hazardous liquid. The  northbound rig apparently was used to carry aviation fuel, but CHP officers  said the tanks were empty.  </P></p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sensor with a taste for good beer Sensor technology is becoming increasingly important in the beverage industry, and now producers have a quick way to distinguish between the various fluids in the pipes and tanks that form an important part of their manufacturing process. A new German opto-electronic process, being launched in the UK by Carel Components, measures the refractive index of liquids to indicate what fluid the tip is in contact with. The product, says London-based Carel, has a specific application in CIP (clean-in process or clean in-place) because it can sense the difference between beer, water and cleaning fluids.

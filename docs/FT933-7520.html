			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agricuture: CIS offered 50% export cut in aluminium talks THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States tentatively offered to cut its annual aluminium exports to the European Community to about 300,000 tonnes, nearly 50 per cent below the 1992 level of 582,000 tonnes, during recent contacts with the EC. In contrast, European aluminium producers suggest imports should be restricted to 80,000 tonnes - which they claim was the 'normal' level before CIS exports began to surge in 1990. The European Commission appears to favour a limit of 150,000 tonnes which was the annual average for the past three years. This was a crucial issue when the commission recently made determined attempts to persuade the CIS industry voluntarily to restrain exports. The commission went armed with a report of its investigation into the impact of the unprecedented increase in CIS exports that came to the conclusion that 'serious damage' was being done to the EC aluminium industry. It also suggested restrictions should be imposed on CIS aluminium imports to the community. Having failed to reach a quick understanding with the CIS producers, the commission on August 7 said it would limit imports of CIS aluminium to the end of November to 60,000 tonnes. That would give the European industry some breathing space while further negotiations took place. The restrictions have been widely condemned, mainly because aluminium is a global commodity and the CIS material will simply flow to other markets and be replaced in the EC by metal from producers outside the CIS. The commission's report warned that there were drawbacks to the EC imposing unilateral restrictions. It said such action would 'unquestionably draw a particularly negative reaction' from the CIS. It also suggested that the effect on the London Metal Exchange, which sets the world price of aluminium, would be 'unclear but limited and not immediate'. Also, much of the CIS aluminium was slightly below the quality required by the LME and was therefore sold at a discount to the world price. But it could be blended with higher-grade material and was then suitable for most purposes. The report pointed out that the imposition of restrictions would give a competitive advantage to producers outside the community who still had unlimited access to this lower-priced metal. The report also concluded that limiting imports of CIS aluminium to the EC 'only addresses one of the causes of the aluminium industry's problems. A full solution would require that (the CIS) has more disciplined export policies in order to restore the world balance of supply and demand.' Although widely criticised, the EC's action does seem to be having an effect. Russia's foreign trade ministry announced on Wednesday that it would cut the number of organisations permitted to export metals from 132 to five and the number allowed to export oil from 114 to nine. Ms Tatyana Aristarkhova, adviser to Mr Sergei Glazyev, the foreign trade minister, said: 'We had big losses of foreign revenue in the past because of a number of incompetent exporters. This provoked all these anti-dumping campaigns against Russia'.</p>

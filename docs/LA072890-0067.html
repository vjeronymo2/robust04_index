			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENOUGH ALREADY -- HUNGARY WANTS VOTERS TO STAY AWAY;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: REFERENDUM ON WHETHER THE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED OR APPOINTED WOULD BE  THE FOURTH IN EIGHT MONTHS.  </P> <P> The new democratic leaders of Hungary are hoping that apathy emerges as the  winner in a referendum Sunday that will determine whether the president is  elected by the people or appointed by Parliament.  </P> <P> The referendum, called reluctantly by officials bored by the prospect of  another election, asks voters to go to the polls for the fourth time in eight  months to settle an issue that could be labeled the Socialists' last stand.  </P> <P> Unless at least half of Hungary's 7.8 million eligible voters cast their  ballots, the campaign for direct elections will fail.  </P> <P> That allows opponents to have their say by sleeping in or going to the beach,  while supporters will have to forgo Sunday outings to answer a question they  have already been asked.  </P> <P> Hungary's former Parliament promised direct presidential elections last  October, and voters endorsed the idea a month later in the first national  plebiscite in the country's postwar history.  </P> <P> Both the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum and the opposition Alliance of  Free Democrats oppose direct presidential elections, primarily because former  Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth, a Socialist, is considered most likely to win the  post in a popular vote.  </P> <P> Nemeth continues to rank as one of Hungary's most respected politicians despite  political changes that have transferred power from the Socialists (formerly the  Communists) to a center-right coalition headed by Prime Minister Jozsef Antall  of the Democratic Forum.  </P> <P> In a move that the Socialists complained was in violation of the will of the  people, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats worked out a  behind-the-scenes deal in May to install writer Arpad Goncz as interim head of  state.  </P> <P> The two biggest parties then railroaded through a constitutional amendment  giving Parliament the power to name the president, effectively canceling plans  for a direct public election.  </P> <P> The Free Democrats had earlier pushed for popular election of the president,  hoping, like the Socialists, to capture a position that could boost their  standing.  </P> <P> Head of state in Hungary is mostly a ceremonial post, but one that carries  considerable prestige. More importantly, the president is seen as above the  fray of day-to-day decision-making that in the turbulent transition to a market  economy could backfire and discredit the governing party.  </P> <P> Goncz is a Free Democrat and a respected veteran of the 1956 Hungarian uprising  against communism, making him acceptable to all major political forces. His  appointment May 2 served to buy the Free Democrats' support in the concerted  effort to ensure that the Socialists do not regain any position of prominence.  </P> <P> Communist reformers guided Hungary through the transition from dictatorship to  democracy, then last fall disbanded the political party discredited by  submission to the Soviets and reshaped themselves into the Hungarian Socialist  Party.  </P> <P> Although Socialists such as Nemeth and Imre Pozsgay are credited with bringing  about Hungary's "revolution from above," the party won little public gratitude  during the parliamentary votes in March and April.  </P> <P> The campaign for direct elections is spearheaded by the Socialists and some  independent members of Parliament who contend that voters have been cheated of  their constitutional right to decide who will be president.  </P> <P> They gathered more than 170,000 signatures on petitions demanding direct  elections, forcing Parliament to set Sunday's date for another referendum.  </P> <P> But the governing party's opposition to the renewed issue is clear in a number  of complications.  </P> <P> Zoltan Toth of the National Election Committee said Friday that the board is  still searching for dozens of substitute workers to help with the ballot  counting.  </P> <P> "This is a very bad time because everyone is on vacation," Toth said. He also  complained that the referendum has been costly.  </P></p>

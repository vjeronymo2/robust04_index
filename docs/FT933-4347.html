			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Technology: Small wonders, big realities - A look at the revolutionary scientific and industrial possibilities of micromachining Imagine a lightbulb that is thinner than a human hair or a weighing scale so sensitive it can weigh a single cell. Thanks to a marriage of scientific ingenuity with techniques developed for the microchip industry, these and other small wonders are becoming reality. Micromachining, an industry which only started 10 years ago, is growing quickly. The tiny devices - often smaller than the dot on an 'i' - can be used in all sorts of applications. The idea of micromachines conjures up images of minute motors and pumps, but practical versions are years from reality. Many of the applications are medical, such as blood pressure monitors which fit on the end of catheters, or tiny scissors for microsurgery. Researchers predict that an implantable device which senses blood sugar levels and dispenses insulin will soon be developed for the treatment of diabetes. Despite their intricacy, micromachines can be produced at low cost in large numbers. This is because much of the expense is taken up with design. So the more that are manufactured, the cheaper they are. The fabricating techniques developed for the microelectronics industry have given the makers of micromachines a head start. 'If the integrated circuit industry wasn't there, there is a whole lot of equipment that would have had to be designed that would have cost millions,' says Gordon Guild, president of the Micromachining Technology Centre, set up to develop and market devices pioneered at Simon Fraser University's Institute for Micromachining and Microfabrication Research in Vancouver, Canada. The two-micron (millionth of a metre) technology formerly used to manufacture microchips is more than adequate for micromachining. (The latest microprocessor chips use resolutions of less than one micron.) Thus research facilities have picked up very workable equipment cheaply. To date, the commercial applications of micromachining, including pressure sensors and other comparatively simple measuring devices, have been more prosaic than the visions of some researchers. Many potential applications are not 'machines' at all but small-scale structures such as membranes, valves or micro-lenses made with micromachining techniques. By far the largest existing market for micromachines is the automotive industry. This includes a wide range of functions from the accelerometers which trigger airbags to the pressure sensors in emission control systems. Micromachining is seen as a critical future technology for vehicle makers, says Jay Jackson, a vice-president at Ford Microelectronics. Ford has demonstrated its commitment by moving a large number of engineers to Colorado Springs, where it has set up a micromachining centre. The fuel injector nozzles Ford recently started manufacturing there illustrate some of the advantages of micromachining. Nozzles made by other manufacturers use an electronic discharge technique to drill small holes in stainless steel. The holes Ford is producing in silicon with micromachining techniques are very uniform, which means the company's fuel injectors are more precise, says Jackson. The automotive industry will continue to use increasing numbers of microsensors for engine control, transmission control and features such as active suspension. But the next generation of micromachines will revolutionise other areas. Many of these devices will start to see the commercial exploitation of surface micromachining (see story below). Often they will be smaller versions of existing devices. For example, some breath alcohol sensors require that an alcohol-sensitive film be heated up to 400'C, for a chemical reaction to occur. With micromachining, the surface on which the film sits and the heating apparatus can be made very small, but the chemical process and operation of the device remain fundamentally the same. The chemical industry is interested in micromachining to produce process control devices such as gas flow sensors and gas composition sensors, scattered in large numbers throughout a chemical plant. The medical possibilities have attracted the interest of pharmaceutical companies, which have visions of specialised drug delivery systems and entirely new treatments. Ash Parameswaran a professor at the Vancouver institute has developed a weighing device with a tiny arm, so sensitive it will measure the mass of a single cell. He has also developed a light element a few microns across, now being made in the US. Arrays of everything from micro-pumps to micro-sensors are expected to be common applications of the technology. One device, developed by Texas Instruments, uses more than 300,000 rotatable aluminium micro-mirrors to produce a bright colour-video display. Parameswaran says no other technology has grown so quickly. In the early 1980s micromachining did not exist; by the end of the decade, up to 700 papers were being presented at each conference on the topic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article entitled: "Mexican President Has Been Authorized To </F> Visit Havana"]    [Text] Mexico City, 1 Jun (PL) -- Today, the Mexican  Chamber of Deputies authorized President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari to officially visit Havana around the middle of June.    Once the decision was known, Deputy Rodolfo Becerril  Straffon, president of the chamber's Foreign Relations  Commission, cited the importance of Salinas' trip to Havana.  The trip will occur "at a time when U.S. congressmen want to  intensify the blockade" against the island, the deputy explained.    The media have viewed this statement as a clear allusion to  U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli, the author of the U.S. law  which bears his name and which two years ago intensified the  economic blockade the United States imposed against Cuba more  than 30 years ago.    Torricelli has just concluded a visit to Mexico where he was  bitterly criticized by all Mexican political sectors because of  his desire to supervise the federal elections that will take  place in this country in August.    Becerril said "this (visit by Salinas to Cuba) is a  demonstration of Mexican solidarity with the Cuban people and  the norms that guide Mexico's foreign policy." The legislator  called for the elimination of customs that hurt Latin American  economies.    During the session, the deputy announced the deputies of the  governing Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] have decided  to donate one day's salary to Cuba, and "this money will be used  to buy oil." The deputies of the opposition's Party of the  Democratic Revolution have joined the PRI deputies in this  decision.    Three days ago in his request to obtain permission to travel  from the legislative body, Salinas cited the respectful  diplomatic relations Mexico and Cuba maintain as well as the  profound ties of affinity between the two nations.    During that session, Salinas said the ties with the island  have produced an international agenda of cooperation that  demonstrates the importance of existing links.    Salinas also said that since 1975, all Mexican presidents in  office have visited Havana, something that has contributed to an  intense and fruitful political dialogue at the highest level  between the two neighboring nations. The Mexican presidents who  have visited Cuba are: Luis Echeverria (1970-76), Jose Lopez  Portillo (1976-82), and Miguel de la Madrid (1982-86).    Salinas also recalled that Cuban Chief of State Fidel Castro  has been in Mexico on three occasions during the current Salinas  administration (at the presidential inauguration in 1988, a  summit meeting of the Group of Three in Cozumel in 1991, and the  first conference of Iberian-American presidents in Guadalajara  that same year).    Castro's trip in December 1988 for the Salinas presidential  inauguration was the Cuban leader's first trip to Mexico in 32  years. In 1956, he had left from the Mexican port of Tuxpan  with 82 men to renew the Cuban people's armed struggle, which  culminated with the victory of the revolution on 1 January 1959.    The illustration presented at Mexico's National Congress  explained that the presence of the Mexican president in Cuba  will serve to further promote bilateral ties, analyze the agenda  between the two countries, and explore new ways of diversifying  and strengthening existing ties.</p>

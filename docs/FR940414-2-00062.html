Box 138, Garysville, Pennsylvania 15337 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(d)(4) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Bailey Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07230) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes the adoption of provisions of variance dated July 28, 1989. In addition, the petitioner would maintain a minimum clearance of 48 inches along the development and retreat section equipment located in the primary escapeway; remove all extraneous material from the area to allow for safe travel; post and maintain ``tight clearance'' signs at the inby end of the affected areas; and instruct all employees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to work in sections inby the affected areas. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

Box 100, Osage, West Virginia 26543 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364 (weekly examination) to its Arkwright No. 1 Mine (I.D. No. 46&hyph;01452) located in Monongalia County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to make mine ventilation changes after obtaining District Manager approval that will make certain check points established by granted petition M&hyph;91&hyph;35&hyph;C unnecessary. The petitioner states that the mine's 1 South/2 South longwall panel will intersect and utilize certain entries for ventilation of this panel when production starts. In addition, the petitioner states that the operator will rehabilitate this short stretch of air course to make it safe to travel prior to start of production, eliminating the need for check points 19A and 19B; that the proposed ventilation changes would result in certain air courses becoming common with the track entry, which is traveled and examined, eliminating the need for the associated check points. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Germany faces pressure not to raise rates THE BUNDESBANK came under pressure yesterday to avoid tightening German monetary policy at its council meeting today. A series of warnings from both home and abroad reflect concern that higher interest rates would prompt a wave of increases across Europe. The D-Mark registered fresh gains against the dollar and European currencies as foreign exchange dealers anticipated a decision to raise the German discount rate at today's Bundesbank council meeting. An increase in the discount rate from 8 per cent would take the Bundesbank's benchmark rate for lending to banks to the highest since September 1 1931 - three weeks before Britain left the gold standard. Mr Heinrich Weiss, president of the Federation of German Industry, issued a call for Bundesbank restraint, saying he believed German interest rates were already high enough to ensure inflation was brought down. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said UK interest rates were higher than needed to achieve the country's domestic inflation targets. The German co-operative banking association warned that attempts to damp monetary growth 'by force' could have fatal consequences. European finance ministers have for several days been urging Germany against drastic tightening. Bonn has also made clear it does not want monetary policy to be tightened. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, will attend the meeting of the 18-strong council, although he has no influence on the vote. Mr Neil Kinnock, outgoing Labour leader, in a letter to the Financial Times today, urges the government to take 'a real lead' in pressing for an immediate growth, rising at double its 1992 target. Partly as a means of mollifying opinion at home and abroad, the Bundesbank is expected to maintain unchanged its 9.75 per cent Lombard rate, which has a greater practical impact on the money market than the discount rate. Mr Richard Reid, Frankfurt-based economist with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'They are likely to take the milder rather than the stronger option.' Dealers believe, however, that the central bank could accompany a discount rate increase of  1/2 point with more technical measures to limit banks' access to central bank funds.

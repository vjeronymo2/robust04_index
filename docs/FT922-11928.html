			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Business Law: Implications of Emu and the Ecu The economic and political issues arising from economic and monetary union (Emu) are more readily apparent than the legal ones. This, and the fact that in the run-up to Maastricht talks were conducted largely in secret, means there has been little discussion of the legal implications of Emu. There are various constitutional implications with respect to institutional reconstruction and so on, but there are also practical banking and commercial implications arising out of the use of the European Currency Unit (Ecu). The Ecu came into being in 1979, together with the European Monetary System (EMS), with the intention that it should ultimately become the single European currency in the monetary integration of the Community. Within the EMS, the Ecu serves as a denominator for the exchange rate mechanism, a basis for an indication of the divergence of the market rate from the Ecu's central rate, a unit of account and also a means of settlement. Although it is not clear whether the Ecu is a currency or not under the laws of many member states, it has the economic attributes of a currency. In practice banks deal between themselves in Ecu as if it were a currency, and have established a private clearing system in order to avoid having to break down the Ecu into its constituent currencies. The Bank of England is setting up a new Ecu payments clearing system for commercial banks. Many companies use the Ecu for accounting and invoicing purposes, the Ecu is quoted on exchanges around the world and derivatives have been created based on the Ecu, Ecu bonds and Ecu interest rates. Many governments and supranational bodies have now issued Ecu denominated debt. But is the Ecu money? The question is important in English law owing to the distinction between monetary obligations or debt, and other obligations. For example, if a party's obligation to pay in Ecu is a monetary obligation, a claim can be made for the face value of that obligation, whereas, if it is not, then a claim can only be made for the amount of loss proved and the claimant is under a duty to reduce his loss. The English courts can grant judgments in a foreign currency (which could include the Ecu). However, in some cases the courts treat foreign currency as a commodity and will not treat obligations in respect of it as monetary obligations with voluntarily adverse consequences. Similar problems have arisen in the laws of other EC states. Generally, judicial thinking seems to be moving away from the requirement that legal tender should be involved in the payment process and moving towards accepting market practice. Clearly, if the legal tender requirement is maintained, there is no chance of an obligation in Ecu without a payment mechanism involving national currency being considered as a monetary obligation, because the Ecu is not legal tender anywhere. There is a vital distinction between the official and the private Ecu. The official Ecu is used within the EMS and is the unit of account used by the community institutions for payment of levies, duties, grants and other funds. The official Ecu cannot be reconverted into the national currencies of which it is composed. It is used for credits and debits between central banks and for settlement between central banks. The official Ecu has many characteristics of a currency but, owing to its limited circle of users, should be considered a quasi-currency. On the other hand, the private Ecu is a product of the official Ecu, and is used in commercial transactions. As such, the status of the private Ecu depends on the form of the contract that is made. The private Ecu can be reconverted into currencies of EC states. The ordinary law of contract is applicable to the use of the private Ecu. A distinction between the two has to be maintained, as the Community has neither created, nor does it guarantee, the private Ecu. Historically, the private Ecu could not be used as a currency of payment and, instead, payment had to be made in the component currencies of the Ecu or in a third currency. Now, however, payment by bank transfer is rarely a problem. There is no issuer of private Ecus, no lender of last resort. It is not legal tender and its supply is not legally organised. Accordingly, the private Ecu, like the official Ecu, is more a quasi-currency. The distinction between the official and private Ecu has certain legal implications. If the official Ecu were ever to be abolished, the private Ecu would cease to exist in all contracts where the two have been linked. Accordingly, most agreements specify an alternative currency to be used in such an eventuality. The private Ecu has not been issued by any national or international authority and has no monetary law defining it, or its use. However, national law cannot be ignored since that may still determine the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract, including the use and status of the Ecu. An agreement expressed in Ecu may in certain circumstances be an exchange contract, since the Ecu is not the national currency of any state, but a basket of 12 national currencies. Thus contracts using the private Ecu must never violate the exchange control regulations of any of the member states whose currencies are involved. Although the Ecu has the drawback of being a quasi-currency, this is not the only stumbling block to its further use. The area of taxation is clearly fundamental, tax rules requiring taxes to be stated and billed in a given currency. Governments may not yet allow taxes to be paid in Ecu and there may be huge problems in relation to capital tax reliefs being calculated in Ecu. Another barrier concerns company law. Can corporate capital be expressed and paid in Ecu? Is borrowing in Ecu allowed? Such issues remain to be investigated. Many issues arise in relation to payment in Ecu. If debts are not expressed in Ecu can creditors argue that they have not been paid, despite having been paid in Ecu? Can bank notes be denominated in Ecu? Limitations may exist on buying, holding or selling Ecu in national foreign exchange regulations and these will have to be removed. Can claims be made in Ecu, and can judgments be given in Ecu for debts, or in actions for damages or compensation? If Ecu values have to be converted into national currencies, questions arise as to which law determines the conversion rate, which rate should be used and what date should be chosen for conversion purposes. The UK objected at Maastricht to the imposition of a single currency and proposed an alternative evolutionary approach creating a 13th common currency which would gradually replace the 12 national currencies of the EC. The UK proposal was not supported by the other EC states, although parts of it may find their way into the final overall plan. The UK's denial of the target of the single currency, coupled with the large divergence in economic performance between EC states, led several of them to suggest that Emu could be achieved by a core of six or more EC countries which have significant convergence between their economies. This proposal would entail the remaining member states joining when they met certain economic criteria. This proposal could give rise to different types of Ecu for different purposes, making a mockery of the idea of the adoption of a single currency by a single Community. Rather than Emu, the most likely outcome seems to be gradual monetary integration. Although the inclusion of dates in the revised treaty is a welcome gesture of political goodwill, business is still unable to plan in detail for the changeover to the Ecu, since there is bound to be some slippage in dates. Nevertheless, business is in a better position to quantify the likely impact of Emu, and evaluate potential problems, after Maastricht.

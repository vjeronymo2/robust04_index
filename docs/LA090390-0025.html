			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: HOW DO THE MEDIA HANDLE BEING 'USED'?  </P> <P> Would you buy this?  </P> <P> When a Ted Koppel, Dan Rather or equivalent, engineers an interview with an  official of a nation with whom we are in conflict, say Iraq, start it this way,  full screen:  </P> <P>  Warning: According to the U.S. Censor General, the following interview  contains material that may be injurious to a proper American attitude.  </P> <P>  If you would not go that far, perhaps you wonder whether the media, TV in  particular, are being used to suit the purposes of the other side.  </P> <P> The short answer is: Of course. Everyone uses the media. Or tries to. Iraq, get  in line.  </P> <P> The "using" takes dozens of forms, up to and including outright purchase,  including the cultivation of favored reporters, the granting of interviews, the  leaking of information, true and false. Make your own list. All good reporters  know that if they are finding their jobs easy to do and information a cinch to  get they must be being used.  </P> <P> In the case of Iraq, the avenues for favorable media use have been almost as  restricted as its sea lanes. Its normal channels, none too effective into the  Western world at best, are pretty well cut off. After sitting for a while on a  pile of requests from Western journalists of all stripes, apparently it was  considered advantageous to "use" a limited number of American TV reporters,  thus trading a little access, strictly controlled, for potential propaganda and  political rewards.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the invitee jumped at the chance to get to the heart of the  story after reporting so long from the periphery. TV network news divisions are  in a perpetual scramble to be first, whether to penetrate the old Iron or the  new Iraqi Curtain.  </P> <P> Whether by choice or accident, the early inside-Iraq field was left to ABC and  CBS News, with Koppel first off the mark, but Rather shortly on scene and  remaining nearly a week, not alone, but with a hefty team, nine people in all.  Out of this came Koppel's initial news-making interview and a scattering of  solid information from Rather and staff, including the first word of foreigners  being scattered for possible use as human shields, and climaxed by his hourlong  interview with the Iraqi dictator, run in prime time.  </P> <P> Needless to say, coverage of a closed society is tricky. Wartime conditions  heighten the difficulty, and certainly the danger. Sometimes being "used" may  simply be the only way to go. When that happens, it is essential that the  viewer be made fully aware of what is, or what may be, going on. If there were  preconditions to an interview they must be made public. The presence of  censorship or monitoring should be disclosed.  </P> <P> The guiding principle is: Trust viewers. Level with them. Let them know what is  going on behind the scenes. The people who watch the news are just as smart as  the people who cover the news. Maybe smarter. In this crisis, as far as I have  been aware, the networks have been careful to spell out the circumstances of  their access in general terms, but in less detail than I would have felt both  appropriate and interesting.  </P> <P> A curious new dimension seems gradually to have been added to the ill-defined  business of "using" the media. A handful of network stars enjoy prestige of  such a nature that their presence and comment at the scene of a story can  affect national attitudes.  </P> <P> Heads of government know anchors, or at least their names. PR men in every  embassy in the United States know enough about American TV to tell the home  office: "If you want to reach Americans, have our man talk to. . . ." Fill in  your favorite anchor.  </P> <P> Anchors themselves, always on the lookout for a competitive edge, must of  course be aware that they are the prime target for being used.  </P> <P> Used or not, television, and TV's top news people seem destined to continue to  play a widening role on the stage of world events. Perhaps that age started on  Nov. 14, 1977, when Walter Cronkite talked alternately to Egypt's Anwar Sadat  and Israel's Menachem Begin, out of which came their historic meeting. Anchor  diplomacy.  </P> <P> Will Barbara Walters get George Bush to sit down with Saddam Hussein?  </P> <P> And who will be using whom?  </P></p>

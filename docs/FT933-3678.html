			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Brundtland heads for victory against odds: The reasons for Norwegian PM's confidence over today's poll MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister, today expects to pull off a remarkable electoral feat. Her Labour party, a minority government, is confident of returning to power despite being out of step with most voters on the main political issue facing the country - Norway's application to join the European Community. To compound the conundrum, pro-EC Labour not only appears set to succeed, but intends to rely for a parliamentary majority on the tacit support of two of the country's staunchest anti-European Community parties. This odd state of affairs suggests that the chance of Norway becoming an EC member has receded as a result of the election. A poll late last week showed a 54 per cent majority against membership, with support slipping to 29 per cent. It also showed only a slim margin in favour among Labour's own supporters. But the pro-EC camp in Oslo, including the main opposition Conservative party, has not abandoned the prospect of winning a referendum to decide the issue, likely to be held within the next two years. From this point of view the vital campaign to reverse Norway's narrow rejection of membership in 1972 will only start in earnest after today's election. Certainly, neither Labour nor the Conservatives have made any attempt to address the EC debate in the election campaign. On the contrary, they have deliberately sought to avoid it, knowing that at this stage it is a vote-loser. Nevertheless, smaller parties which oppose Norwegian accession - for economic reasons as well as fears of a loss of independence - have suffered no such inhibitions. The two to which Labour will look for parliamentary support, the Socialist Left party and the Centre party, have campaigned almost exclusively on an anti-EC ticket and have boosted their standings in the polls as a result. The agrarian Centre party, which even wants to undo Norway's participation in the European Economic Area agreement with the EC, looks set to double its vote from the 6.5 per cent support it won in the 1989 election. Labour, however, is unphased. Instead it has been encouraged by the way its support as the biggest party has held up in the polls and even strengthened in the latter stages of the campaign, while support for the Conservatives weakened. A poor performance by the Conservative leader Mrs Kaci Kullmann-Five - the leader of the Centre party is also a woman, Ms Anne Enger Lahnstein  - helped Labour. So too has an upturn in the oil-dependent economy. Above all, Labour has the asset of Mrs Brundtland, who has achieved commanding stature in Norwegian politics since she first became prime minister in 1981. Like Mrs Margaret Thatcher in Britain in the 1980s, she is not so much loved as respected for her determination and her projection of Norway's interests internationally. There is now a common belief, even among her Conservative rivals, that she is the only leader with a realistic prospect of persuading Norwegians to accept EC membership. The question is, can she turn around public opinion, which has consistently hardened since she delivered Norway's application in April. Assuming she wins today, the next step in the strategy is to negotiate an accession agreement with Brussels which she can recommend as a good deal for the country on the central matters of public concern - oil, fisheries, agriculture and regional policy. Only when, or if, that is accomplished will Mrs Brundtland set a date for the promised referendum and begin to take the offensive in the membership campaign. Nevertheless, there are those both inside and outside the government who think public opinion can be swayed. In their view, an acceptable accession agreement may not prove as hard to win as has tended to be assumed. On the sensitive question of fishing, Norway has agreed a series of cod quota increases for EC vessels in Norwegian waters under the EEA agreement, and diplomats say the Community is unlikely to seek further increases. For Norway, there is also vital concern about North Sea oil. Mrs Brundtland has warned that a proposed EC licensing directive, setting out rules on open competition for exploration licences, would be seen as an encroachment on Oslo's control over its most valuable resource and would damage the image of the EC in the run-up to a referendum. She wants it postponed and has won some support, notably from Germany and Denmark. For the meantime, however, conventional wisdom says the odds remain against Norwegian accession. Today's election is likely to reinforce that view. However, for Mrs Brundtland and the other pro-EC forces, the real battle has yet to be fought.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mayors of [the Croat-held towns of] Kresevo,  Kiseljak, and Fojnica today sent a [joint] letter to the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] command. In the letter they are  asking whether UNPROFOR is going to do anything to prevent  Muslim infantry units, currently being moved from Sarajevo, from  taking part in the offensive against the Croat areas in central  Bosnia.    The Muslim infantry is no longer needed in Sarajevo and they  are already moving into central Bosnia, with the aim of  occupying Croat areas, the letter says.</p>

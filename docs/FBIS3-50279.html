			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The first day of the 26th session of  the Slovak parliament contained a very interesting debate.  Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar spoke in the Slovak  parliament today [26 January] immediately after the deputies had  invited him to explain why Economic and Foreign Affairs  Ministers Jan Ducky and Jozef Moravcik did not accompany  President Kovac to Poland and why no agreements were signed  between Poland and Slovakia.    [Begin Meciar recording] Let me first thank deputy Miklosko  for starting a debate on these issues. They are really serious  and deserve the attention of the Slovak parliament.    I learned about preparations for a visit by the Slovak  president to the Polish Republic on 19 January 1994, from his  personal letter. Before that, I had neither information about  the trip nor had I put forward any requests with regard to it.  Presidential visits are, unfortunately, independent to such an  extent that they are not coordinated with the government. The  visit to Poland is not the only one with problems. Other trips  were the same--for example, the latest visit to Prague.    Allow me read out the president's letter:    Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister:    As you have already been informed, through the mediation of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also on the basis of our  talks with the highest-ranking Polish representatives, on 25-27  January 1994 I will be on an official visit to Poland, at the  invitation of President Walesa. Your official meeting with  Prime Minister Pawlak is also being prepared. Both these events  and a number of other Slovak-Polish activities that are being  planned are very important with regard to the importance of  relations between Slovakia and Poland as partners. On this  occasion, I would like to ask for your cooperation in organizing  my visit.    I would welcome in particular Minister of Economy Ducky, who  accompanied me at the talks with President Walesa in Prague,  being a member of my official delegation in Poland. In addition  to the official program, the Polish side will prepare separate  talks for him with his partners--four ministries in the Polish  Government. The Polish hosts are preparing a similar program for  Environment Minister Zlocha, and I am asking you also to  organize his participation.    After the experts' talks that preceded this visit, Poland  expects that at least two agreements will be signed, from a  whole number of agreements in preparation. It is obvious that  other agreements will be signed only during your meeting with  Prime Minister Pawlak.    I have been informed that the government, due to its heavy  schedule, was unable to discuss the agreement between the Slovak  Government and the Polish Government on environmental  cooperation. I would welcome it if the government endorsed this  agreement at a brief meeting, specially convened for this  purpose, to enable Minister Zlocha to sign it in Warsaw.    I have also been informed that the government had some  comments on the agreement on cooperation between border regions  and that this was the reason it was not endorsed.    As regards the expectations of the Polish side, I would like  to ask you if the agreement on the protection of investments or  the agreement on the prevention of double taxation, which are  not far from completion, could be offered as a substitute. I  believe in you, Mr. Prime Minister, that, owing to the pressing  circumstances that I have mentioned, you will carry out  necessary steps for our joint contribution to the successful  implementation of the tasks of Slovak foreign policy.    I thank you in advance for cooperation and understanding.    In the context of that letter, I would like to say that I  do not know anything about the results of talks between the  Slovak president and Polish President Walesa during the  president's visit to Poland or during their visit to Prague.  [passage omitted]    Acting on the basis of the letter, I took all of the steps  to  meet the minister's--pardon me, the president's--request. I  asked ministers to brief me about their progress in their tasks.  An agreement on environmental cooperation was prepared to be  signed, but, in mid-December, the Polish side presented us with  a unilateral alternative proposal not previously assessed by the  Slovak Government, and we have a lot of objections to it. An  agreement on cooperation of border regions was not approved by  the government because we are not satisfied with it. Among other  things, it did not define, for instance, what is the territory  of border regions, and thus, in fact, this term might be applied  to the entire territory of one or the other side to the  agreement. It also included other serious legal and political  mistakes. It is true that the drafting of an agreement on  prevention of double taxation and other agreements have  considerably progressed, but within the three working days that  were available to us, it was not possible to correct things and  finalize the drafts without consultations with the Polish side.    On the basis of these facts, I sent the following letter to  the president on 24 January 1994:    Esteemed Mr. President:    The Government of the Slovak Republic is determined to give  you all-around support in order to make all of your foreign  trips properly prepared and successful.    Together with Ivan Gasparovic, the chairman of the National  Council of the Slovak Republic, we have already been pointing  out for some time now that you need to coordinate your foreign  trips, including the entourage, if you are interested in being  accompanied by members of the government. A foreign working  trip by a member of the government has to be approved by the  Slovak Government. Without such an approval, he cannot leave the  country.    Next time, plan your matters more in advance. The government  should be informed about them in time if agreements between the  governments, for the drafting of which the government of the  Slovak Republic is responsible, are to be signed.    During my visit to Prague, a meeting between the prime  ministers of the Slovak Republic and the Polish Republic took  place. At the meeting, Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak  asked for a meeting between the members of the Slovak and Polish  Governments to take place not in January 1994 but later. We  agreed on this. The course of action you took contradicts this  agreement between the prime ministers of the Slovak Republic and  the Polish Republic.    Despite the above-mentioned, the Slovak Government approved  a  visit by Environment Minister Jozef Zlocha to Poland. However,  the agreement will still be subject to discussion as in  December, new amendments were sent by the Polish side to the  already discussed agreement, and we have not yet taken them into  account. As far as other agreements you propose for signing  during your visit to Poland are concerned, though their drafting  has progressed a great deal, they are not yet ready for approval  and signing.    I am making an urgent appeal for improving cooperation with  the Slovak Government. I leave it to you to reconsider whether  in this situation you insist that Environment Minister Zlocha is  among the members of your entourage, taking into account also a  stance by the Polish prime minister. Economy Minister Jan  Ducky's trip was not approved by the government, and this is why  he will not take part in the trip to Poland.    Yours respectfully,    [signed] Meciar [passage omitted]    During talks in Prague, the Polish prime minister turned to  the Slovak Government delegation with a plea, explaining that he  has such pressing duties in his country that he does not  consider any meeting between the members of the government of  the two sides in January to be suitable. We agreed only on a  meeting between his adviser and the Slovak Deputy Prime Minister  Jozef Prokes on the territory of the Slovak Republic. As the  proposal for a meeting was made by the Slovak side with great  urgency, the Polish side agreed to hold an informal one-day  meeting between government members, probably in the Tatras  mountains, to discuss cooperation questions. [passage omitted]    The course of action chosen by the President's Office is not  a usual one, but we are not entitled to express our view on it  or to control it. This is a matter for you, the National Council  of the Slovak Republic.    It is up to you to assess what has happened. The government  has done all it should have and could have done in the given  situation to assure the success of the president's foreign trip.  [passage omitted]    As I have already taken the floor, and, as there are  various pieces of information voiced by the media and in public,  allow me to brief you about yet another thing, not because it  involves me but because that action or its content are aimed at  grossly damaging the interests of the Slovak Republic and its  policy, as well as the Government of the Slovak Republic.  [passage omitted]    I assess the letter [allegedly sent by Yugoslav former Prime  Minister Milan Panic] to be one of a number of provocations  aimed partly against me, which is not important, and against the  Slovak Republic. [passage omitted]    This is a matter concerning the state. Following an attempt  to subvert our state or its economy by forging a large number of  stamped [Czechoslovak] bank notes, this is yet another one of a  big number of provocations constantly being carried out against  Slovakia.    As far as insults against me are concerned, I have forgiven  the past ones--as you sitting on the right at the back benches  well know, and I will also forgive these. I only regret that  hate toward me has led toward acts against the interests of our  state, toward acts damaging them. [passage omitted]    To put our state in danger of having to face international  isolation, international sanctions for not complying with the  embargo, I am afraid I cannot find a polite expression to  describe this. [passage omitted]    I want to say that our state has been internationally  recognized but provocations against it took place, are taking  place, and will continue to take place. As regards all those  who are in a state of euphoria that we have already overcome all  problems, I would like to draw their attention to the fact that  we have not yet overcome anything. Nothing has been solved,  nothing has been completed. Either we will unite behind our  aims, fighting for them and protecting them together, or these  purposeful provocations--and others about which we have at  present received some preliminary intelligence information that  they might be in the process of being prepared--can bring about  the situations that will be substantially more complicated and  more difficult.    Therefore, consider your every step, your every statement  and  political stance! Much is still ahead of us, and it will not be  the last thing we have to overcome.    Thank you for your attention.

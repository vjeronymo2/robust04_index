			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fred de Lange and SAPA] </F>   [Text] The pro-election faction the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] yesterday claimed there was a  plot to assassinate General Constand Viljoen if he attempts to  continue his efforts to take the Volksfront into the election.    The plot allegedly has its origin in militant groups within  the Volksfront who are violently opposed to the election. The  president of the Volks [Afrikaner people] Representative Council  of the Volksfront, Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg, yesterday expressed his  shock about the allegations and said immediate steps would be  taken to improve security for Gen Viljoen.    After a weekend of high drama which saw Gen Viljoen  desperately trying to keep the Volksfront's options open by  registering for the election without the permission of the  executive of the Volksfront, Dr Hartzenberg reluctantly admitted  there was now a small chance for the Volksfront to take part in  the election.    But sources in the Volksfront said Gen Viljoen's efforts now  placed him in real danger of being assassinated. "We have  information that elements within the Volksfront violently  opposed to the election have made plans to murder Gen Viljoen  should he decided to complete formalities on the registration of  the Freedom Front," THE CITIZEN was told yesterday.    Although the Volksraad [national council] vote was 72 to 20  against registration, it is claimed there is substantial  grassroots support in favour of it.    The pre-election group claim the Volksraad could be forced  within the next couple of days to change its decision. There  was also a strong possibility that Gen Viljoen could go ahead,  in any case, to complete the registration even if the Volksraad  did not change its decision. He would be supported, it is  claimed, by a substantial number of members of the Volksfront  who did not support the Conservative Party, but backed Gen  Viljoen himself as "leader of the Afrikaner nation".    Dr Hartzenberg yesterday admitted there still was a chance  for the Volksfront to take part in the election. While the  Volksfront was aiming for an election for a volkstaat [Afrikaner  homeland], there was a "small possibility" of taking part in the  mainstream constitutional process.    This would depend on developments today and tomorrow on  final  agreements to get the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to complete  its registration for the election. Dr Hartzenberg said while he  still maintained that international mediation was not necessary  for a solution, it all depended on what was offered by the ANC  [African National Congress] and the government before the final  deadline for the submission of candidate lists expired on  Wednesday evening.    Should this be adequate -- and he doubted it would -- the  Volksfront could still submit a candidate's list and complete  the registration. He stressed, however, that an accommodation  of the IFP did not automatically mean an accommodation of the  Volksfront.    "There is always time to save the process and we will look  sympathetically to any proposal," said Dr Hartzenberg. He  expressed his shock at the allegations of plans to assassinate  Gen Viljoen and said he could hardly believe it.    "I would believe this from our political opponents, but  never  from our own people", Dr Hartzenberg said. Although the  security arrangements around Gen Viljoen had been stepped up in  the past, Dr Hartzenberg said immediate action would be taken to  improve this even further.    General Tienie Groenewald, a member of the AVF directorate,  said yesterday that, Afrikaner Volksfront members had not  entirely surrendered their efforts to persuade hardliners to  take part in the April elections. "There will be more efforts  to convince people in the AVF that we shouldpkeep our options  open," Gen Groenewald said.    "There is little chance that the AVF as a front will  register. But I don't think the matter has been put on ice," he  said.    Gen Groenewald said it was no secret that some AVF members  supported taking part in the election and that they would  continue efforts to get the election boycotters around to their  point of view.    Today's meeting with the alliance partners -- Bophuthatswana  and the IFP -- would help determine the AVF's course of action.  Gen Groenewald said the AVF would also be examining what  results international mediation might be able to deliver.    Talks with the African National Congress on a political  accord on a volkstaat would continue. More successful talks on  the issue on Friday might have secured AVF registration by  giving Gen Viljoen something with which to convince his  followers of the need to take part in the poll.</p>

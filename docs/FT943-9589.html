			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ranger in Pounds 13m agreed bid Ranger Oil, the Calgary-based oil explorer, yesterday announced a sharp drop in first-half profits as it unveiled an agreed Pounds 13.2m bid for Union Jack Oil, the UK independent. Ranger, which already owns 21 per cent of Union Jack, is offering 75p a share for the company, valuing its target at Pounds 16.5m. Net profits in the second quarter fell from Dollars 4.7m to Dollars 390,000 (Pounds 252,000), on revenues 15 per cent lower at Dollars 32.5m. First-half profits to June 30 fell by 64 per cent to Dollars 4.3m. Average of crude oil and natural gas prices were Dollars 3.41 lower in the first half at Dollars 13.79. There is no dividend. The group said Union Jack would provide extra production and cash flow from its interest in the Claymore field in the North Sea. Ranger has recently been hit by lower oil prices and falling production out of the North Sea as exploration programmes have been reined in. Ranger has been a significant shareholder in Union Jack, originally set up as a vehicle for institutional investment in North Sea exploration, since its foundation in 1981.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRED ROGGIN'S HUMOR BELONGS IN LOCKER ROOM  </P> <P> I agree with Larry Stewart's comments regarding Fred Roggin's penchant for low  humor.  </P> <P> Another factor that detracts from Roggin's work is his ongoing lack of respect  for women. If a bikini-clad woman is in attendance at a sporting event, Roggin  will comment:  </P> <P>  -- There will be no tittering about this play.  </P> <P>  -- The play was busted up.  </P> <P>  -- It's a good day for a doubleheader.  </P> <P>  -- He's just trying to keep us abreast of sports.  </P> <P> One expects humor like this in a junior high locker room, but it has no place  in a news broadcast.  </P> <P> CHARLES GOULD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

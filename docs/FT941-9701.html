			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Milligan, is there need for remorse?: Dominic Lawson explains why he'd rather not know the details of an MP's death There are some things I would rather not know. I would rather not know the circumstances of the death of Stephen Milligan MP. Like most people, I do not feel ennobled by the knowledge of the exact method of his accidental suicide, as described in lurid detail by radio and television. But at the same time there is something compelling about the experience, this receipt of illicit and formerly forbidden information. The pulse races, the heart-beat quickens. Somehow one is drawn into the newsagents, and in a husky and embarrassed voice, one asks for a copy of The Sun, to be tucked inside one's copy of the FT, later to be read at home and in private. Perhaps it was not such a thrilling experience for Stephen Milligan's family to hear of the bizarre circumstances of his body's discovery, on the news programmes, even before the police had informed them of his death. Paul Condon, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has, to his credit, immediately made the circumstances of this leak of information the subject of an internal inquiry. We can be certain that the police inquiry will exonerate all the officers involved, not because such a breach of professional ethics did not occur, but because the professional ethics of the journalists will prevent them from revealing their sources. Last week I spoke to someone with detailed professional acquaintance of the police force. He seemed remarkably unsurprised by the suggestion that the members of the force had leaked details of Milligan's death - well before the completion of police inquiries - to the media. A former army man, he fulminated about the lack of an officer class in the police force, and, as he saw it, the consequent inability of senior officers to impose satisfactory standards of behaviour on the lower ranks. He believed it was almost commonplace for members of those lower ranks to sell information to the tabloid press. Two weeks ago I wrote about the case of Gillian Taylforth, in which The Sun newspaper was unsuccessfully sued by the actress for claiming that the police had discovered her fellating her lover in a lay by. The Sun's first line of defence was that the event took place. Its second line of defence was that it was merely passing on information given to it - quite improperly  -by the police. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how else The Sun could have been so sure of its information as to risk publication. Last year it was widely alleged that the police had tipped off the press about the timing of its arrest, on fraud charges, of Kevin and Ian Maxwell. It was, to say the least, surprising that not a single tabloid newspaper missed its 5.30am appointment outside the homes of the two men. Naturally the Serious Fraud Office conducted an internal inquiry into this incident, and naturally it found that it had acted irreproachably. I, fortunately, have had no first hand experience of the police's conduct in such matters; but I do know of one celebrated criminal from whose home the police removed - doubtless for their collection of evidence - several family photographs. These subsequently appeared in a tabloid newspaper during the man's trial, and before they were returned to his wife. The newspapers will quite reasonably claim, in the case of Stephen Milligan and others, that they are merely feeding the public's interest, and that it is up to the police force to keep its own house in order. And it is true that the events of the past few days have enlightened us to a widespread form of perverted pleasure which had hitherto been little commented on; that millions of us will pay money to read as much as we can about auto-erotic asphyxiation. But, as I am sure any newspaper medical correspondent will tell us, we should not feel too ashamed of this perversion, and it is quite possible for us to lead an outwardly normal and successful life, while indulging in such depravity. It would be quite wrong for any of the participants in this act, the police force, the newspaper editors, and the paying public, to feel the slightest degree of guilt or remorse.

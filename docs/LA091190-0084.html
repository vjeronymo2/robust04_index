			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE DEDICATES CONTROVERSIAL AFRICAN BASILICA;  </P> <P> RELIGION: BLESSING OF THE COSTLY IVORY COAST STRUCTURE AS THOUSANDS WATCH IS  THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE PONTIFF'S 10-DAY TOUR OF FOUR AREA NATIONS.  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II on Monday blessed a huge multimillion-dollar basilica praised  by some as a glorious gift to God and derided by others as a scandalous show of  opulence.  </P> <P> The consecration of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace highlighted the last leg  of the Pope's 10-day tour of four African nations.  </P> <P> Tight security was in place around this city of 70,000, the home of President  Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to prevent anti-government demonstrations by recently  legalized opposition parties.  </P> <P> Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled the country as a one-party state since  independence from France in 1960, offered the basilica as a gift to the Pope  during a private audience at the Vatican last year.  </P> <P> The colossal church, rising out of a former cocoa plantation, bears a striking  resemblance to St. Peter's in Rome with its imposing dome and long arms of  marble columns surrounding a plaza.  </P> <P> The architect, Pierre Fakhoury, has described the new basilica as the biggest  church in Christendom. Vatican officials, however, said they believe St.  Peter's is larger.  </P> <P> The hardwood pews were packed with 7,000 people. In the plaza outside, tens of  thousands of pilgrims followed the service on television monitors and  loudspeakers.  </P> <P> The cost of the basilica, which was completed last year, has been a source of  controversy in this once-prosperous West African nation now suffering its worst  economic crisis in 30 years of independence.  </P> <P> President Houphouet-Boigny, who offered the basilica as a gift to the Vatican,  says it cost $140 million, was built on his own land and was paid for with his  family's money.  </P> <P> But published reports have said the price tag could be as high as $300 million,  and the president's opponents accused him of misappropriating state money for  the project.  </P> <P> Whatever the cost, critics have said the money would be better spent on  education and health care for the poor.  </P></p>

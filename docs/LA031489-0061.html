			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN;  </P> <P> WEEKEND PROMISES TO BE AN OASIS IN CHORAL DESERT  </P> <P> In spite of sporadic efforts, San Diego is not known as a mecca for choral  singing. It remains a far cry from cities such as Minneapolis and Washington,  where many professional and semi-professional choral groups complement  adventurous church choir programs. This coming weekend, however, promises to be  an oasis in the local choral desert.  </P> <P> Saturday night, the touring University of Chicago motet choir visits Clairemont  Lutheran Church with a Palestrina "Missa Brevis,' as well as shorter works by  Debussy, Poulenc and Messiaen. Sunday afternoon, the cathedral choir of St.  Paul's Episcopal Cathedral, directed by choirmaster Edgar Billups, sings the  Requiem and "Mass for Men's Voices" by contemporary French composer Maurice  Durufle.  </P> <P> The San Diego Master Chorale, the area's oldest and most dependable choral  organization, takes over the downtown First Presbyterian Church Sunday at 8  p.m. to sing Mozart's "Coronation Mass" and the Faure Requiem. According to  Master Chorale director Frank Almond, his group is on a roll after January's  performances with the San Diego Symphony of Beethoven's Ninth (Choral) Symphony  under the dean of American choral conductors, Robert Shaw.  </P> <P> "Shaw was pleased with the group and was eager to return," said Almond. Almond  will reciprocate the compliment and spend some of his upcoming sabbatical at  Emory University working under Shaw, whom he characterized as "the most vital  72-year-old musician I've ever encountered."  </P> <P> Almond is preparing his choir for a European tour this July, during which they  will perform both the Faure and Mozart works, as well as American folk hymns  from the "Sacred Harp" and "Creation," an early composition by San Diego  composer David Ward-Steinman.  </P> <P> "Since we will be singing primarily in Catholic churches, they now require all  the repertory to be sacred," said Almond. Performances in cathedrals in Vienna  and Salzburg will be highlights of the summer tour.  </P> <P> The Master Chorale's programs with the symphony this season have turned out to  be a box-office blessing for the San Diego Symphony. After a two-year hiatus  that started with the canceled 1986-87 orchestra season, the two musical  organizations resumed working relations last December with the cooperation they  enjoyed during the heyday of former orchestra music director David Atherton.  The only symphony subscription concerts that have sold out thus far this season  have been four "Messiah" and Beethoven's Ninth programs, all joint performances  with the Master Chorale. Although the symphony's 1989-90 season has yet to be  announced, we can expect more collaboration between these organizations.  </P> <P> WAITING IN THE WINGS. Tenor Elliot Palay is not eager to get a reputation for  indolence, but he is being paid by Los Angeles Music Center Opera to sit around  and do nothing. In truth, Palay, a member of the United States International  University faculty, is covering for tenor Placido Domingo in Verdi's "Otello,"  which opens later this month.  </P> <P> Whenever Domingo is performing "Otello," Palay is required to be within 20  minutes of the theater.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles and New York, that means somewhere inside the building, not  across the next freeway. Usually, I sit in the audience and let them know where  I am," explained Palay.  </P> <P> Fortunately for the 40-year-old Heldentenor, his job is not entirely a waiting  game. During rehearsals last week and this week, while the company awaits  Domingo's return, Palay has been taking the superstar's place.  </P> <P> Although Palay has not had much of a vocal career in this country, he sings  extensively in Europe. The summer before last, he sang in the Danish National  Opera's "Ring" cycle, and this May he will repeat two of his Wagnerian heroes  in Warsaw.  </P> <P> Palay hit pay dirt several years ago while covering for the tenor lead in  Wagner's "Tristan und Isolde." The slated tenor took ill at noon, and Palay  made his debut Tristan four hours later.  </P> <P> RETURN OF THE NATIVE. Pianist Gregory Allen returns to Civic Theatre tonight to  play a solo recital for the San Diego Community Concert Assn. To be correct,  Allen, who was born in Cheyenne, Wyo., cannot be claimed as a San Diego native.  He did grow up here, however, and his influential early piano teacher was San  Diegan Florence Stephenson. While he went on to win many awards, including the  grand prize of the 1980 Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition, his  first competition laurel was a San Diego Musical Merit Foundation scholarship.  </P> <P> Allen is on the music faculty of the University of Texas at Austin. Since 1987,  the centennial year of Rubinstein's birth, Allen has embarked on a project to  record all the 20th-Century works written for and dedicated to Rubinstein.  </P></p>

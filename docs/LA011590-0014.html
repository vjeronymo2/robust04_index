			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. PLACE  </P> <P> Much said in Ernest Conine's column "The Other 'Sick' Power Needs Help, Too"  (Dec. 25, Op-Ed Page,) is true. We do have our own problems at home.  </P> <P> But what is the justification that the world must be divided into classes and  that we must stay in the first class? What is the rationale that the majority  of the Business World 1000 should be American? Where is the fairness that our  5% of the world population consumes 40% of the world's energy output? What  happened to our preaching in market economy, equity, freedom of trade and  democracy?  </P> <P> PAUL CHOW  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

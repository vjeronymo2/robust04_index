			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: A good life at the top of the charts - Robert Rice unveils the results of an FT poll of legal firms Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law practice, has emerged as the leading UK commercial law firm in the 1992 FT law firm poll of polls. The group's move to the top of the table, ahead of Linklaters &amp; Paines and Slaughter and May, both of which were ahead of it in 1991, suggests it is now reaping the rewards of the ambitious 1987 merger between Clifford Turner and Coward Chance which led to its formation. The overall strength and depth of the firm's base is reflected in its high ratings across the complete range of performance indicators used in the FT poll. Profitability remains the only area where it lags behind its main competitors, its weak showing in Legal Business magazine's table of the most profitable law firms being largely due to extraordinary costs associated with a move to new City premises. Although perhaps not yet enjoying the reputation of Linklaters and Slaughters, it appears to be 'benefiting from a more competitive pricing policy' than some of its rivals, according to one City observer. Linklaters, ranked second, also had an exceptionally good year being involved in most of the big transactional deals during 1992 and continuing to benefit from the strength of its international capital markets work. The firm would have finished as a clear leader but for its lack of involvement in the main management buy-outs of 1992. The 1992 poll also confirms the existence of a 'super group' first identified in 1991. These top five firms continued to move ahead in 1992 in spite of the depth of the recession largely through the strength of their international practices and their domestic, corporate and financial client base, which allowed them to tighten their grip on high quality, high value work. Mr James Wyness, joint senior partner of Linklaters, says 1992 was a year in which to be grateful for a strong corporate and financial client base, a view echoed by Mr Giles Henderson the new senior partner of Slaughter and May. In terms of the domestic market for legal services, 1992 was very tough and increasingly competitive. For the big firms this meant concentrating more on tailoring their services to client needs and learning to be flexible on fees. Companies began to recognise in increasing numbers that the recession had changed the marketplace and that they could now exert a much greater influence on the legal services they purchased and on what those services cost. In spite of the recognition by most law firms of the need to be flexible over fees in these market conditions, the top UK commercial practices were caught off balance in the autumn by a league table published by the International Financial Law Review which suggested that the average hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a leading City of London law firm had risen by 20 per cent in the last 12 months. IFLR labelled UK commercial law firms the most expensive in the world, charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their US counterparts. If, in practice, they had demonstrated the need to be flexible on fees, they had failed to get that message across to the public. Some firms had even found themselves attacked for apparent inflexibility. In spite of difficult market conditions, the top 10 firms all appear to have enjoyed a relatively successful year. Figures published last September by Legal Business for the 1991/92 financial year showed revenues holding up very well in the early part of the year. The top six firms all had turnovers roughly equivalent to Pounds 1m per partner. Clifford Chance the UK's largest law firm had a turnover of Pounds 244m, comparing well with American firms of similar size such as Skadden Arps (Pounds 280m), Baker &amp; McKenzie (Pounds 273m) and Jones Day (Pounds 232m). Linklaters (Pounds 154m), Freshfields (Pounds 135m), Lovell White Durrant (Pounds 120m), Slaughter and May (Pounds 113m) and Allen &amp; Overy (Pounds 112m) also compare favourably with their US counterparts. All of them say that since April they have managed to maintain revenues and that, if anything, business has picked up. The 1992-93 figures are likely to show continued growth for these six. The explanation for this success can be found partly in the counter-cyclical nature of some sectors of the legal services market and partly in the strength of the firms' international practices. Mr John Pritchard, editor-in-chief of Legal Business magazine, says that all the leading firms have benefited from the huge increase in corporate restructuring and refinancing that has accompanied the recession. But two firms in particular, Allen &amp; Overy and Lovell White Durrant, have shone out, he says. Mr Bill Tudor John, managing partner of Allen &amp; Overy says his firm has had a particularly good year because of the strength of its banking and insolvency practice. Allen &amp; Overy had a hand in most of the big insolvencies and debt reschedulings in 1992, acting for the administrators of the Maxwell private companies and Canary Wharf and for WPP, Guinness Peat Aviation, Heron Corporation and News International in their reschedulings. On the international front, Linklaters, Allen &amp; Overy, Slaughter and May, Clifford Chance and Freshfields have all benefited from their domination of international capital markets and structured finance work. The IFLR Eurobonds league table used in the poll of polls is supported by a recent survey, by Euromoney, of senior executives in the Eurobond syndicated loan and derivatives departments of leading financial institutions. That showed that international capital markets are dominated by Clifford Chance and Linklaters with Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May vying for third place. With some 40 per cent of its work now having an international element, it is not surprising that Linklaters and other such firms have found it easier than most to ride the UK recession, Mr Wyness says. To add insult to injury for those firms fighting for a share of the domestic markets, what little high quality transactional work there was in 1992 also appears to have gravitated to the top firms. Freshfields, arguably the leading corporate finance law firm, Linklaters and Clifford Chance were all involved in either the Pounds 3.7bn Hongkong and Shanghai/Midland Bank deal or the merger between Reed International and Dutch publisher Elsevier. Linklaters and Slaughter and May were involved in the public sale of Wellcome shares and Linklaters worked all last year on the ICI demerger. This domination is likely to continue in 1993. Linklaters, for example, has been appointed by the government on both the British Rail privatisation and on the sale of the third tranche of British Telecom. The picture for those outside the top 10 is not so encouraging. While the UK economy remains in recession, all law firms are likely to suffer to an extent. But it is outside the top 10 that structural problems, born of the boom in legal business during the late 1980s when many law firms grew much too rapidly in size to meet the huge demand for legal services, are likely to make themselves felt in 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             LAW FIRM POLL OF POLLS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                      Legal  Crawford's   Legal       International                           500    City         Business:   practice                                  Directory:   most        (by size)                                  most stock   profitable                                               firm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Clifford Chance         19        18          11           19 2 Linklaters &amp; Paines     18        19          19           17 3 Slaughter and May       16        20          20           15 4 Allen &amp; Overy           15        12          18           11 5 Freshfields             17        14          16           18 6 Lovell White Durrant    20        11          17           16 7 Ashurst Morris Crisp     7        16          15            0 8 Simmons &amp; Simmons       13        10          13           13 Equal 9 - Norton Rose     12        15           7            3 Equal 9 - Herbert Smith   14        17          12           12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Acquisitions   KPMG:     IFLR:   KPMG: Total                            Monthly:     leading   Eurobonds  new  (max                              M&amp;A          MBO              issues  160)                                         advisers  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Clifford Chance            17            20        17      18    139 2 Linklaters &amp; Paines        18             0        20      20    131 3 Slaughter and May          14             8        18      18    129 4 Allen &amp; Overy               9            17        19      18    119 5 Freshfields                20             0        14      18    117 6 Lovell White Durrant        0            19         0       5     88 7 Ashurst Morris Crisp       13            17         0      19     87 8 Simmons &amp; Simmons          11             0         9      11     80 Equal 9 - Norton Rose        19             8         0      14     78 Equal 9 - Herbert Smith      15             8         0       0     78  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Firms score 20 points for a first place and 0 where there are 20 firms ranked above them in a league table. The FT's table of the top 10 law firms is based on a poll of polls - from a number of publicly available lists and rankings. The polls used in 1992 vary slightly from those used in 1991 to take account of newly published information, in particular the Legal Business table of the most profitable law firms. The 1992 table also attempts to reflect the increasing importance of international work by ranking firms by the size of their international practice.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Caledonian Mining reveals interest - British Coal, The Bidders Ministers rejected the advice of Caledonian Mining, among others, that British Coal should be privatised as a single entity. But that has not stopped the company, a mining equipment manufacturer, having a look at what is on offer, writes Michael Smith. Newark-based Caledonian has qualified to bid for three regions where opencast operations rather than deep mines predominate: north-east England, Scotland and south Wales. Mr Colin MacLeod, chairman and owner, concedes that his company, which turns over about Pounds 40m a year, is likely to be among the smallest of the companies considering a bid. However, he says that turnover has grown steadily since he set up the company 32 years ago, except at the time of the 1984-85 miners' strike. Unlike several of the companies considering bids for regions, Caledonian is debt-free. Mr MacLeod says he already has bank backing for a bid if he proceeds. Caledonian operates only one pit, a small drift mine near Abergavenny, in Wales. However it has long experience working under contract for British Coal sinking shafts and driving tunnels. 'Extracting coal is the easy bit,' he says. Manufacturing colliery arches and supports for mines and civil engineering projects is among the company's other main businesses. In a submission to the government last year, Caledonian argued strongly against breaking up British Coal. 'It is doubtful if a coal industry could survive if it was split into a number of comparatively small units all competing in a market place dominated by two principal customers.' This is a reference to National Power and PowerGen, the main electricity generators in England and Wales. If successful, Caledonian intends to offer employees shares in the company. It would seek 'modern' working practices and a no-strike agreement.</p>

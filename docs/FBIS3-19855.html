			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kurt Kieselbach: "One Million for Retraining"] </F>   [Text] Bonn/Schwerin -- The Federal Employment Office (BA)  in 1994 spared 1.3 million people in the new laender  unemployment by providing them with financial means. This was  stated yesterday by FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem in  Schwerin. For this purpose, 35.6 billion German marks [DM] have  been allocated to the eastern laender. A total of DM54 billion,  42 percent, of DM107.2 billion from the BA budget are used for  "active labor market policy" in the country.    "The core of the BA's active labor market policy is the  promotion of vocational qualification," said BA President  Bernhard Jagoda, who, together with Bluem, honored the 100,000th  retrained construction worker with a certificate in the training  center of the construction industry in the capital of  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. More than 1 million people in  eastern Germany have participated in advanced training since  German unification. Vocational advanced training and retraining  is subsidized with DM15 billion in Germany, DM7.7 billion of  that in the east.    The construction industry is considered to be the driving  force of the economy in the new laender. Thus, from mid-1992 to  mid-1993, the number of people employed rose by 11 percent to  700,000.    At first, the billions poured into advanced training and  retraining also attracted dubious figures. Bluem: "Especially  in the new laender, black sheep had established themselves among  the institutions providing training in order to earn a lot of  money quickly." Together with the Nuremberg BA, this  development was counted with determination by sending groups of  inspectors on site. The latest inspection did not result in any  complaints. Bluem assumes that up to 600,000 places in  necessary advanced training measures can be financed in 1994.    Advanced traning for master craftsmen or engineers are no  longer subsidized in line with the Labor Promotion Law.  However, those affected can participate in a new loan program,  which is an instrument to bolster any adverse effects.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Minister attacks growth of seaside jobless hostels The government yesterday resisted its de-regulatory instincts in an attempt to halt the trend towards the conversion of seaside hotels into social security benefit hostels. Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said hotel owners would have to apply for council planning consent before using their premises as hostels. Mr Curry said: 'What is happening at present is that you can convert your seaside hotel to a hostel which then houses benefit claimants without any form of authorisation or planning permission.' The shift, foreshadowed by Mr John Major in an interview with the Sunday Express, is a response to the growing clamour from predominantly Conservative councils for action to halt the influx of benefit claimants to coastal resorts. The councils, backed in recent months by vigorous lobbying from Conservative MPs, argue that the influx is keeping away holidaymakers and business visitors. Mr Curry stressed that existing hostels would be unaffected and hotels denied planning permission in future would have the right of appeal. Ministers acknowledged privately that the measures - which would be in place before the local elections - contradicted the government's commitment to cut the burden of regulation on small business. But political benefits for the government were judged to outweigh economic costs.</p>

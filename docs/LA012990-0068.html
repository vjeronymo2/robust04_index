			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> TURTLE SLAUGHTER IN MEXICO PROTESTED  </P> <P> An environmental organization condemned the slaughter off the Mexican coast of  thousands of endangered giant sea turtles for their skin, which is made into  high-fashion shoes and purses.  </P> <P> Todd Steiner, a research biologist and director of the Earth Island Institute,  recently returned from San Augustimillo in Oaxaca where he and other  environmentalists reported seeing heads and flippers from olive ridley turtles  floating in the surf near a slaughterhouse. He said fishermen were reluctant to  discuss their capture and slaughter of 800 turtles, 99% of them females coming  to shore to lay eggs. Although Mexico allows the annual slaughter of 20,000 of  the turtles, Steiner said there were indications that illegal killings bring  the toll to 75,000.  </P></p>

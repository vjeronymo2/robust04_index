			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cheng Yuen (4453 0626): "Strike Movements Occur </F> Frequently on Mainland"]    [Text] In recent years, the CPC has consistently  advertised that mainland China under its rule has been "stable  and united" and has maintained good "social security." However,  the real situation has not developed in accordance with its  wishes, and today mainland China is neither "stable" nor  "secure," as shown by the fact that political disturbances have  occurred one after another, the incidence of crime has remained  high, social security has deteriorated, and some disturbances --  which were neither too big nor too small -- have occurred from  time to time.    Let us have a look at the strikes which broke out in some  mainland provinces during the current sessions of the National  People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC].  <H5>  The Reasons Behind the Series of Strikes in Liaoning Province </H5>   A number of strikes have broken out intermittently in  Shenyang, Dalian, and Fushun in Liaoning Province since March.  According to an analysis made by the Liaoning Provincial  Government, five reasons have triggered these strikes, which  include: 1) some state-owned enterprises had to be closed down,  suspended, merged, or converted to other lines as a result of  reform, so the interests of the staff and workers were affected;  2) the staff and workers were unable to receive their wages  because enterprises performed poorly and their products were  overstocked; 3) some staff and workers were forced to take a  rest break for half of their working days due to the limited  production quotas, and their income was reduced accordingly; 4)  the staff and workers were dissatisfied with the rising prices;  and 5) party and government cadres benefited more than the  ordinary staff and workers in the course of reform.  <H5>  The Staff and Workers in Shenyang Threatened To Call a </H5> Strike in the Entire City    Since last November, more than 80 enterprises and factories  in Shenyang have failed to pay wages and bonuses to their staff  and workers, and the lives of nearly 300,000 people have been  affected. More than 180,000 staff and workers received only  one-half or two- thirds of their basic salaries and were forced  to rest at home for half of their working days, and this has  created strong feelings of dissatisfaction among them. In early  March, the staff and workers from more than 40 metallurgical,  chemical, agricultural machinery, and pharmaceutical enterprises  conducted a slow-down in Shenyang. Some of them held rallies to  present petitions to the city or provincial governments, airing  their grievances against inflation, price increases, and  opposing the merger and stoppage of enterprises. On 11 March,  approximately 20 enterprises and units spontaneously sent a  cable to the State Council, proposing that the interests of  staff and workers be protected during structural reform and that  their position as masters of the country be strengthened. On 15  March, the staff and workers from some chemical enterprises in  Shenyang lodged a petition with the city government, in which  they proclaimed that enterprises and factories belonged to the  working class, and everything in them belonged to the ranks of  staff and workers, and they included the slogans "down with the  newly emerging nobility!" and "eradicate the new bureaucratic  bourgeoisie!" The strike spread to 40 enterprises and  factories, and the staff and workers even threatened to go on  strike throughout the city and province to protest against  inflation and the closing down, stoppage, merger, and conversion  of enterprises. They called for the right to administer  enterprises and factories. Up to the present, the staff and  workers from over 30 enterprises and factories have applied to  the provincial government to hold rallies in the Workers'  Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, Nanhu Park, and the Martyrs'  Mausoleum, and have called on the government to immediately put  an end to the closing down, stoppage, merger, and conversion of  state-owned enterprises. They also called on the government to  carry out the guidelines of the central authorities to vest in  representatives of staff and workers the right to participate in  making policy decisions regarding factories, mines, and  enterprises. In addition, they called on the government to  ensure that any default in payment of their salaries, bonuses,  and allowances would be avoided in the future, inflation would  be checked, their living standards would be enhanced, and their  material benefits would be increased.  <H5>  Some 10,000 Staff and Workers Planned To File a Petition in </H5> Beijing    The staff and workers in Shenyang planned to enlist 10,000  people and chartered eight trains to carry them to Beijing to  present a petition. As the event further deteriorated, the  provincial government reported the case to the secretary of the  provincial party committee and governor, who were attending the  NPC and CPPCC sessions, and asked for instructions from the  State Council. As instructed by the State Council, the  provincial leader Gu Jinchi flew back to Shenyang on the  afternoon of 16 March to handle the affair.    Trade Union in Fushun Called for Reorganizing the  Leading Body of the City Government    The coal mine in Fushun, Liaoning intended to cut 20,000  miners. For this reason, a dozen cases of slowdown actions and  petitions have been reported since the middle of February. The  provincial government had to give the miners a pledge that not  one single person would be reduced and there would be no default  in the payment of workers' wages, bonuses, and allowances. The  official trade union of the Fushun Chemical Plant acted as the  representative of the staff and workers to request a 50 percent  wage increase and an upward readjustment of factory prices for  their products, and to express their opposition to importing  chemical fertilizers, which has made an onslaught on the  domestic market. The trade union also called for reorganizing  the leading body of the city government.  <H5>  Over 300 Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Lodged a Petition </H5> to the Provincial Party Committee    Several strikes have broken out in factories, mines, and  enterprises in some cities of Shaanxi Province, including Xian,  Xianyang, and Baoji since the second half of February. In mid-  March, the strikes further escalated, and over 300 factories,  mines, and enterprises in Xianyang, Baoji, Hanzhong, and Yanan  lodged petitions with the provincial party committee.  Enterprise party committees and trade unions were among the  units lodging the petitions and in some cases even acted as the  leading petitioners. On 16 March, some party and government  leaders from Shaanxi Province, who were attending the NPC and  CPPCC sessions, hurried back to Xian to deal with the situation.  <H5>  Over 700 Cadres in Sichuan Ask for Leave </H5>   One-third of cadres working in 25 departments and offices  under the Sichuan Provincial CPC Committee and Government will  be reduced in the first half of this year. After the news was  confirmed, over 700 cadres asked for sick leave, annual leave,  and leave to attend to private affairs since 10 March, and on 14  and 15 March, another nine commissions and offices under the  provincial authority had to suspend work due to large numbers of  people asking for leave. The party committee and government  reported this emergency to the leading cadres attending the two  sessions in Beijing, and principal provincial leader Xiao Yang  immediately returned to Chengdu to handle the affair. Luo Gan,  secretary general of the State Council also went to Sichuan to  get acquainted with the situation there. It has been learned  that there were similar conditions in Chongqing, Yibin, and  other cities.  <H5>  Jiang Zemin and Li Peng Stress the Importance of Stability </H5>   The above strikes broke out during the NPC and CPPCC  sessions  and shocked the CPC hierarchy. When Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and  Qiao Shi met persons in charge of Liaoning, Shaanxi, Jiangxi,  Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, who were  attending the two sessions, they all stressed that stability was  necessary in all localities, that reforms should promote and be  beneficial to stability, and that the importance of stability  should be properly stressed. They also said that reform  measures and policies would have an impact on stability; hence,  where stability was seriously affected, reform should be  decisively suspended or stopped. This should be regarded as a  cardinal principle. Jiang Zemin said: Reform must be carried  out under a stable situation, within the tolerance of the vast  number of staff and workers, and with their support; otherwise,  the desired goals of reform will not be achieved.</p>

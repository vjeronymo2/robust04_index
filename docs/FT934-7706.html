			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (27): More joint ventures are sought - Car production WHEN a delegation of Japanese car executives arrived in Beijing earlier this month to pay their respects to a fast-growing market, they were well briefed about the difference between the alluring statistics and the hard-won opportunities of China. For the past decade, Japanese makers have been generally content with technical tie-ups and exports, not risking much of their own money or prestige in the joint ventures preferred by international competitors such as Volkswagen, which has two large projects, and Citroen. 'Chinese officials always tell us that we must pay a premium for being late to the market. They say that Volkswagen took a risk and has been rewarded - and that we should pay extra for starting up now,' a Japanese company representative explains. While the Chinese government warned the Japanese delegation about not missing out on a share of the world's fastest-growing car market, the government itself is divided over the development of the industry, and over the pace at which a tariff and tax wall of between 240 per cent and 300 per cent should be lowered. China's leading car companies are courting joint venture projects, even though Chairman Mao Zedong is reputed to have said: 'At last I'm sitting in a car made by Chinese' when the Number One Motor Vehicle Plant in Changchun began producing East Wind cars in 1958. In the meantime, Chinese makers have slipped far behind their competitors in technology and quality. Economic reform has stimulated demand for new vehicles and has highlighted the deficiencies of the local product and producers, which are among the most politically-influential of the country's companies. One sign of that influence, and of concern about the use of foreign exchange, is the unpublicised understanding within the government that imported vehicles should account for only 10 per cent of total sales. The government had aimed for a 28 per cent increase in local production to around 900,000 vehicles this year, and wanted to keep imports to between 70,000 and 80,000 vehicles. 'The pace of economic development means that the import level is likely to be between 90,000 and 100,000, and will at least be 80,000 vehicles,' a Chinese government report predicts. However, the report also reflects concerns that China's desired admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will create extra pressure to open the market . But, as in so many industries, the official Chinese figures tell only part of the automotive story. They grossly underestimate the level of imports, as Japanese companies exported 96,953 vehicles to China last year, up from 20,673 in 1990, and not including those shipped through Hong Kong. The Communist party's discipline inspection committee is apparently investigating illegal imports of South Korean cars through Shandong province, in the east. Imports of used Japanese cars have come through a Korean minority area in northern China, with much of the profit being taken by North Korean organisers. To cool the car market, Mr Zhu Rongji, the vice premier, suspended purchases by government offices, which has slowed the flow of exports from Japan. Production in the first half was running at 45 per cent above last year's level, but the China National Automotive Industry Corporation said production and sales fell by just over 10 per cent in August, compared to a month earlier. One reason for the low expectations of the Japanese delegation, sponsored by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in Tokyo, are recent hints from senior Chinese automotive officials that the government does not expectto approve another large-scale joint venture until 1996. Chinese officials have suggested that three large ventures, the two Volkswagen projects and that of Citroen, will cover demand for cars. It is also argued that three commercial vehicle and light truck plants, including Beijing Jeep, and two mini-vehicle projects, involving Suzuki Motor and Fuji Heavy Industries, the maker of Subaru cars, are enough for the next three years and, perhaps, until 2000. However, another senior Chinese official said Volkswagen dominates car production and another venture, either US or Japanese, would provide a better balance of makers. A government report also draws attention to the limited presence of US makers in the market, and the political value of increasing imports of US vehicles or approving another joint venture. Jinbei Automotive Company in Shenyang, in the north, is still looking for a joint venture partner, and has been negotiating with Toyota. Mr Zhang Defa, Jinbei's vice director, said that China 'cannot rely on car imports' to satisfy demand, but 'we can't meet the technological and capital requirements ourselves.' While the leading Japanese makers have been reluctant to commit themselves to China, the yen's appreciation this year has encouraged car parts makers to consider investment, partly to link up with ventures in which friendly companies, such as Nissan, have a small stake, but also with a longer-term aim of using the country as a base for components exports to Japan.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Glaxo in US talks Glaxo of the UK is understood still to be in talks on alliances with US healthcare companies including the drugs distributor McKesson, writes Daniel Green. Talks have been under way for several months as the company searches for a corporate response to changes in the US healthcare system. The slow progress of the talks reflects Glaxo's unwillingness to buy a US company. It does not want to follow US rival Merck and Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham which have spent Dollars 6bn and Dollars 2.3bn respectively on distribution companies. Instead it wants to sign alliances such as that agreed last week between US company Pfizer with Value Health, a distributor, in a Dollars 100m joint venture. McKesson remains one of the largest potential partners yet to sign such a deal. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, has said that deals with intermediaries and even other pharmaceuticals companies were under consideration.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> COWBOYS HANGING UP SPURS;  </P> <P> RANCHERS ARE HIRING FOREIGN HANDS WHO WILL PUT UP WITH LOW PAY AND HARD WORK.  HERDS ARE THINNED AND HELICOPTERS ARE USED IN ROUNDUPS.  </P> <P> The American cowboy, that lanky, leather-faced, bowlegged archetype of the  West, is a vanishing breed.  </P> <P> From the Texas Panhandle to Montana's Big Sky country, frustrated cattle  ranchers say the once-ample supply of savvy, reliable cowhands has plumb dried  up.  </P> <P> "Finding a good cowpuncher is darn near impossible these days," griped Lynn  Anderson, a lifelong cattleman with a ranch outside Kingman, Ariz. "There's  nobody around who's willing to put up with the hard, sweaty work, the  isolation, the low pay and the dangers of the job."  </P> <P> The decline of the buckaroo amounts to more than a sad historical footnote. The  labor shortage is redefining life on American ranches, prompting many members  of the $37-billion cattle industry to thin herds, team up with neighbors and  alter management practices to stay afloat. On some sprawling spreads in West  Texas, for instance, ranchers are saving hours of saddle time by using  helicopters to round up livestock.  </P> <P> Here in Wyoming, the situation is particularly grim -- and a tad embarrassing.  After all, there are bronco-riding cowboys on every license plate and helmeted  Cowboys on the University of Wyoming football team.  </P> <P> But dadgummit, the state's ranch owners say, there just ain't any real-life  cowboys to be found.  </P> <P> In desperation, some cattlemen have begun importing foreign workers to ride the  range. Under a provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act passed by  Congress in 1986, ranchers may hire temporary foreign help if they first prove  that no qualified Americans want the job.  </P> <P> Rory Cross struggled fruitlessly to find local hands to work his Powder Horn  Ranch in Beaver, a tiny settlement 50 miles south of Casper in the foothills of  the Medicine Bow Mountains.  </P> <P> "They either don't know cattle, don't want to work hard or tend to want to go  into town and get drunk," lamented Cross, 53, a third generation rancher and  representative in the state Legislature.  </P> <P> Frustrated, Cross opted to take advantage of the new law and hired two foreign  vaqueros -- one from Mexico, another from Peru. The process was tortuous and  expensive, but worth it, the rancher says.  </P> <P> "These guys are great workers," Cross said recently as he watched Cesario  Celestino Soto, from Lima, Peru, ride in across the rolling grassland after a  morning of branding. "They're steady and they don't complain when you ask them  to fix a fence or dig an irrigation trench."  </P> <P> Like Cross, ranchers in Montana, Arizona and Colorado have brought in cowboys  from south of the border. Cattlemen in Texas, New Mexico and Utah may soon  follow suit. Before long, some industry experts predict, foreign cowboys may be  as common a sight on the range as a white-faced Hereford.  </P> <P> "Cowboys have a romantic image, but it takes a lot of dedication, skill and  desire to do the job, and Americans don't seem to want to make the sacrifices  the life demands anymore," said Peter Decker, a Colorado rancher and former  state agricultural commissioner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source of Problem  </P> <P> The roots of the cowboy crunch go back several decades, as higher paying, less  grueling jobs in the nation's cities drained rural populations. Ranchers  "scrounged up and shared whatever hands they could find" and began modernizing  their operations to cut their use of labor, said Byron Price, executive  director of the Oklahoma City-based National Cowboy Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> Still, slicker management could not eliminate the need for manpower, and thus  many ranchers began filling the gap by hiring Mexican hands. This proved a  fruitful relationship. With cattle a major commodity in northern Mexico, most  of the undocumented workers had already mastered the rudiments of the cowboy  life -- riding, roping and branding.  </P> <P> In 1986, however, Congress broke up this friendly arrangement, passing an  immigration reform package that sought to stem the tide of illegal immigrants  entering the United States. Suddenly, ranchers -- like other employers who  knowingly hired undocumented workers -- faced the threat of hefty sanctions by  the government.  </P> <P> "The law was a big jolt," said Jack Huning, who owns a ranch outside  Albuquerque. "You started seeing articles in the papers about raids and big  fines. It made you nervous."  </P> <P> Huning said he "had to let two good (Mexican) cowboys go" because he "just  couldn't take the risk."  </P> <P> Many veteran vaqueros qualified for amnesty under the immigration reform law  and these men -- like Americans before them -- hung up their lariats and moved  into more lucrative industries. At the same time, new applicants seemed  scarcer, perhaps deterred by reports that many outfits were no longer hiring  illegal immigrants.  </P> <P> Ranchers have redoubled labor-saving efforts, such as using helicopters and  all-terrain cycles for chasing down wayward heifers and for traveling pastures  on fence-mending missions.  </P> <P> "You try to cut your calving time; you pool resources with other ranches; you  basically do anything to get by with fewer bodies," said Chandler Keys, a  spokesman for the National Cattlemen's Assn. in Washington.  </P> <P> But most cattle raisers still say they are scraping by with smaller crews than  they need to manage their herds. As Decker put it: "Of the ranchers I know,  throughout the West, they are all, every day, looking for good workers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guest Workers  </P> <P> Last year, cattlemen for the first time began importing cowboys under a guest  worker program called H2a. Established in 1952, the program has been used for  decades by sheep ranchers to import herders from Spain, Peru and, more  recently, Mongolia. Sugar cane growers in Florida also use the H2a system to  hire thousands of temporary field workers.  </P> <P> Under the law, ranchers must first advertise for cowboys and interview all  interested applicants. If the number of qualified candidates falls short of the  rancher's needs, the U.S. Department of Labor then certifies that there are  insufficient American workers to fill the jobs.  </P> <P> Foreign cowboys are given visas for a maximum of three years, but their status  must be renewed annually. The vaqueros' transportation to the ranch is paid by  the employer, and their wage is determined by the state after a market survey.  In Wyoming, the pay is $600 a month, in Arizona $650. Workers also receive room  and board and worker's compensation insurance.  </P> <P> But after hiring the H2a cowboys, ranchers must continue advertising for help  throughout the first half of the foreign workers' contract. If an American  cowboy shows up during that period, he must be given a job.  </P> <P> "This is a real concern for the rancher, because he might have to fire the  foreign worker or else pay the salaries of two men," said Oralia Mercado,  executive director of Mountain Plains Agricultural Service, which processes H2a  applications for 38 ranchers in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, and Idaho.  </P> <P> Foreign cowboys say the H2a program has been a godsend. Cesario Celestino Soto,  35, left a wife and three children in Lima. He misses them, but, unable to find  steady work in Peru, he decided to come to Wyoming after a relative heard there  was a job on the Cross ranch. He now shares a small red house -- outfitted with  a rare ranch luxury, a satellite dish -- with another hand.  </P> <P> "The work is not too hard, and I'm liking it," said Celestino, a slight man  with a broad smile. "It is difficult for my family, but they are happy about  the money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ranchers' Complaints  </P> <P> Among ranchers, the temporary worker program receives mixed reviews. Many  complain that the hiring process is too laborious and say the federal  government responds too sluggishly to their applications, often leaving them  without help during peak periods like branding or calving season.  </P> <P> In 1988, Republican Rep. Lamar Smith -- whose West Texas district is home to  some of the nation's largest ranches -- introduced legislation designed to ease  the H2a process, but the effort failed.  </P> <P> "The regulations are so burdensome, the red tape so long and the delays so  terrible that it's awfully difficult to find the cowboys you need when you need  them," said Smith, a cattleman himself.  </P> <P> In 1989, only 50 foreign cowhand jobs were approved by the federal government  -- a tiny fraction of the 26,000 H2a workers employed that year. John Hancock,  the Department of Labor's chief of agricultural certification, expects the  number of cowboys to rise as word of the program spreads.  </P> <P> Ranchers agree with that assessment because, outside of hiring illegal aliens,  they have no choice. Fewer and fewer Americans, it seems, are willing -- and  able -- to lead a life in the saddle.  </P> <P> There are, ranchers report, plenty of "TV cowboys" -- people who fancy Western  wear and Hank Williams songs.  </P> <P> "I get a lot of (applicants) who seem to think being a cowboy means looking at  some nice scenery -- kind of a dude ranch holiday," New Mexico cattleman Huning  said.  </P> <P> "Out of 15 (American) guys who come looking for a job, 13 of them want to spend  the day in a bar acting like a cowboy," Decker said.  </P> <P> In fact, an honest-to-goodness cowpuncher needs more than a drawl and a  10-gallon hat to measure up. In Arizona, the advertisement seeking cowboys  demands someone who can "round up, castrate, brand and vaccinate cattle, build  and repair fences, windmills and irrigation equipment and ride, break and shoe  horses," said Lisa Bray, who runs a Phoenix-based firm that hires H2a workers  for ranchers across the state. It helps if you're an amateur mechanic who can  fix farm machinery.  </P> <P> "Just this season I interviewed 100 (American applicants)," Bray said. "Out of  that I hired six. The first guy lied, saying he could break horses when he  couldn't, and he lasted two weeks. Two others didn't show up. A third found a  better job . . . . So we're left with two, and I'm not holding my breath about  them."  </P> <P> Theories on the sagging domestic interest in the cowboy life abound.  Conservatives blame welfare programs or the erosion of a work ethic among  younger generations. Others suggest the dip in rural populations means there  are fewer kids growing up with an interest in ranching and cowboy know-how.  </P> <P> Still others say it's simply a matter of economics. Wages and benefits lag  behind those offered by urban employers and, although many ranchers are  attempting to provide such incentives as television, most outfits are in  isolated areas and can't offer amenities to compensate for the low pay.  </P> <P> Moreover, a modern cowboy must be someone who is not really interested in  getting ahead. With land, machinery and livestock costs high, ranching is so  capital-intensive that a cowpuncher earning $900 or less a month has little  hope of ever striking out on his own.  </P> <P> C. L. Sonnichsen summed up this dilemma in his book, "Cowboys and Cattle Kings:  Life on the Range Today." A cowhand, Sonnichsen wrote, has "about as much  chance to become a cattleman as a rustler has of getting to heaven."  </P> <P> Arizona rancher Anderson, whose grandfather launched a ranching business after  building railroads in the 1870s, offers a dose of typical cowboy philosophy  when asked about the demise of his breed.  </P> <P> "It's a bit sad," Anderson said, "and I regret the loss of it because it's my  background.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, there's a lot of things more productive than sitting on  your horse and letting your feet hang down."  </P> <P> Times researcher Ann Rovin in Denver contributed to this story.  </P></p>

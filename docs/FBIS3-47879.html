On  13 January, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa denied the report,  telling reporters he is "not considering" a cabinet reshuffle.    Meanwhile, an influential member of the ruling parties said  an early cabinet reshuffle would be a good thing.    He said: "It is a fact that a cabinet reshuffle is being  discussed. This is a good time to establish a full-fledged  administration."    As far as the prime minister is concerned, it seems he has  no  choice but to be cautious in his approach to the matter because  he has no wish to cause a crack in the administration's  foundation. He needs to tread carefully because the reason the  talk of a cabinet reshuffle is the confrontation between  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    It is expected, however, that talk of a cabinet reshuffle  may  hang around for the time being.    When asked, the prime minister avoided answering questions  about the timing of a cabinet reshuffle.    He said: "That is far ahead. There are many mountains and  rivers that we have to cross before then."    However, a senior member of the ruling parties, who is  reportedly close to Mr. Ozawa, admitted that "the idea of  reshuffling the cabinet has been discussed since the end of the  last year."    He said there were two reasons why the administration had  considered the issue: 1) To get positive cooperation from the  Social Democratic Party of Japan by inviting its chairman  Tomiichi Murayama to join the cabinet after getting State  Minister for Political Reform Sadao Yamahana to leave office;  and 2) to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura.    It appears Prime Minister Hosokawa would find it difficult  to  sack Mr. Takemura because he has been a long-time friend since  well before the administration took power. Mr. Hosokawa  reportedly told the senior coalition official that he "could not  dismiss Mr. Takemura alone."    Although the prime minister has denied the possibility of an  early cabinet reshuffle, the senior official said: "It is  reported that the prime minister secretly met Mr. Ozawa and  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa at the end of last  year, and indicated he intended to carry out a cabinet  reshuffle."    As a result of the talk, Mr. Takemura told a press  conference  on 13 January: "Although I think there has been some criticism  of me, I have put all my trust on the issue of whether or not I  leave office to the prime minister. I would like to devote  myself single- mindedly to my job, though bracing myself for  what may follow."    Mr. Takemura denied the possibility that Mr. Yamahana would  resign as political reform minister after the passage of the  political reform bills.    He said: "Even after the bills are passed by the Diet, there  is a task of drawing electoral districts."    It is believed that Mr. Takemura's remarks indicated his  displeasure, seeing any cabinet reshuffle as the work of Mr.  Ozawa and others. Facing confrontation within the  administration, the prime minister will likely be forced to make  a difficult decision.</p>

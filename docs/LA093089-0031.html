			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NEWBURY PARK STIFLES ROYAL IN LEAGUE OPENER  </P> <P> Newbury Park High continued to suffocate opposing offenses as the Panthers  posted their second consecutive shutout with a 21-0 victory Friday night over  Royal in a Marmonte League opener at Newbury Park.  </P> <P> The Panther defense has not allowed a touchdown all season. Newbury Park  (3-0-1) shut out Buena, 15-0, last week and defeated Agoura, 17-3, three weeks  ago. Ventura tied the Panthers, 7-7, two weeks ago but the Ventura touchdown  was scored on an interception return.  </P> <P> The Panthers' stingy defense and ball-control offense held the Highlanders to  28 first-half yards, all by way of the pass. Newbury Park fullback Jason Sands  scored the only touchdown in the half on a two-yard run as time ran out in the  first quarter. Royal's defense committed a key blunder in the Panther drive --  a holding penalty on a fourth-and-seven play at the Royal 33. Sands, a senior,  finished with a game-high 62 yards rushing in 15 carries.  </P> <P> Newbury Park, taking a play from the Chicago Bears' book, had some fun late in  the game. Phil Pederson, a 275-pound tackle, ambled in a la William Perry from  one yard for Newbury Park's final touchdown with 1:39 left.  </P> <P> After halftime, Royal (1-3, 0-1) conducted its best drive of the game but could  not convert a 49-yard field-goal attempt by Steve Prchal. Highlander  quarterback Ryan Fien, a sophomore, completed 15 of 24 passes for 120 yards but  threw one interception.  </P> <P> Newbury Park junior tailback Walter Thomas carried 16 times for 59 yards and  caught a 10-yard pass for a touchdown as time ran out in the third quarter.  Royal gained only 25 yards rushing and 145 total yards. GREG MEADE  </P></p>

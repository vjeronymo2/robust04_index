			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NIACIN IS AN UNPROVEN CURE FOR RECURRENT HEADACHES  </P> <P> Question. My husband has had recurrent headaches for years with no doctor able  to find a cause or cure. After he read that niacin could help some types of  headaches, he started taking 50 mg daily. This has helped his headaches  tremendously.  </P> <P> I want him to check in with his doctor about this treatment program, but he  feels that since niacin is an over-the-counter vitamin it cannot be harmful.  Are there any side effects from taking niacin?  </P> <P> Answer. We were unaware of niacin being helpful against headaches, so we  checked Dr. Sheldon Hendler's excellent book, "The Doctors' Vitamin and Mineral  Encyclopedia" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990). There are other stories like your  husband's, but no controlled studies proving that niacin works for headaches.  We're glad your husband has found relief.  </P> <P> Flushing and itching are the most common side effects of niacin, which can also  cause stomach upset. Serious side effects, including peptic ulcer, visual  disturbances, changes in blood sugar control and liver damage are rare but your  husband should see his doctor for periodic monitoring.  </P> <P> Q. You recently suggested rinsing a child's ears with one part vinegar to four  parts water after swimming as a way to prevent swimmer's ear. That's wrong. For  kids, it should be half vinegar, half alcohol. For adults, straight alcohol  works better and causes no significant tissue damage.  </P> <P> A. Ear, nose and throat specialists are not in agreement about the best home  remedies for swimmer's ear. Some of the experts we have consulted believe that  plain alcohol is less effective than vinegar and water, which makes the ear  canal slightly acidic and inhospitable to bacterial growth.  </P> <P> Other specialists think that alcohol works best, in part by drying out the ear  to discourage germs that love warm, moist tissue.  </P> <P> Whether parents use over-the-counter alcohol-containing remedies like Dry/Ear,  Ear-Dry or Swim Ear or make their own vinegar preparations, rinsing the ear  after swimming is the best way to prevent swimmer's ear this summer.  </P></p>

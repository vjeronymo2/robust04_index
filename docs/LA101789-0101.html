Marcos was laid to rest  in a temporary mausoleum in a tree-lined memorial park in Honolulu at a service  attended by more than 1,000 mourners. Imelda Marcos, clutching a rosary, sang  "Ave Maria" and "Our Father" while her son, Ferdinand E. Marcos Jr., stood at  the casket. Marcos' daughter, Irene Araneta, criticized Philippine President  Corazon Aquino for refusing to allow Marcos to be buried in his homeland. The  family has vowed not to bury Marcos, who died Sept. 28 after a long illness, in  Hawaii.  </P></p>

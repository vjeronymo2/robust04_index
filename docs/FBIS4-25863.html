			<p>BFN     [Text] Chongqing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Xiao Yang, governor  of southwest China's Sichuan Province, said that Sichuan will  attract more foreign businessmen through building a large market.    At a seminar entitled "International Capital Market and  Inland Economic Development in China", Xiao said that the most  important link in economic development lies in correct analysis  of the capacity of market.    He said that the larger a market is, the more funds it will  attract.    He said that Sichuan Province has formed a large market  involving 400 billion yuan, which has even been regarded as the  ninth largest market in the world by some American economists.    As one of the largest provinces in China, Sichuan occupies  570,000 square kilometers and has a huge population of 110  million. It has rich natural and labor resources.    The governor said that now Sichuan is expanding its market  at  a rate of 10 percent annually.    He said that if his province can introduce 2 billion U.S.  dollars per year, the gross domestic product of Sichuan is  expected to grow at an annual rate of more than 10 percent.    By the end of this century, the gap between the economic  growth of Sichuan and provinces in coastal regions will be  markedly narrowed, he said.    The governor said that now some large international  consortiums have begun to invest in basic construction projects  in the energy and communications sectors.    Last year, Sichuan introduced 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in  foreign funds and approved 1,900 foreign-funded enterprises.</p>

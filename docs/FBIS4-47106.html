			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Veretennikov: "One Step Forward and No </F> Steps Back!"]    [Text] There is a silver-colored metal pillar near the  highway approximately halfway between Moscow and the Lenin  Hills. It depicts Vladimir Ilyich in bas-relief and is  inscribed: "Lenin's Cause Is Alive and Will Triumph!"    The words aroused an irate question: What kind of "triumph"  is this? The country is falling apart and lies bleeding. The  common man is drinking himself to death. The louse-infested  homeless, completely oblivious to their surroundings, are a sign  of the times, and so is the T-80 tank. Its designers probably  never dreamed that the test site of the wonder-vehicle would be  the center of our capital. This is where the regime won a  luminous victory by turning parliament into a candle with a  gigantic flame. This probably was not the kind of triumph the  creators of the propaganda visual aid had in mind. Furthermore,  where is the raykom that ordered its creation and  installation?...    In the hills, in the auditorium of the V.I. Lenin Museum,  communists from all of the republics sat down at one big table.  This was the site of the coordinating conference convened by the  UCP-CPSU and organized with the active participation of all  those present. The conference began with a brief keynote speech  by UCP-CPSU Council Chairman O. Shenin.    The conference was one of the results of the UCP-CPSU's  colossal efforts to reestablish our party.    The road to the conference was not smooth. After August 1991  the enemies of the CPSU, both external and internal, did  everything within their power to make it disappear forever. The  former did this with prohibitions, and the latter did it with  betrayal, thwarting the efforts of ethical members of the  Central Committee and rank-and-file communists to continue their  work. In summer 1992, however, a Central Committee plenum was  held and became a point of departure for the restoration of a  unified organization of Soviet communists. It was followed by  the 20th All-Union Conference and 29th Congress of the CPSU,  where the party was temporarily converted into the UCP-CPSU with  a view to the current situation in the republics. It was joined  by the majority of republic parties. Delegates from fraternal  parties at the April conference of the CPRF passed a resolution  on an extensive coordinating convention.    On the eve of the conference our Belorussian [Belarusian]  comrades presented the CPRF with a gift: a stuffed Belovizh  bison with one sawed-off horn--an allusion to Shushkevich and an  inducement to "continue the proceedings." There was no question  that there was a wish for this, and it was a unanimous wish. Was  anything else even possible?    Each speaker presented an account of trouble and suffering.  The Russians in Kirghizia who cannot speak the Kirghiz language  and see no future for themselves there are living the republic:  There is no recognition of Russian as the language of  inter-ethnic communication in the republic constitution.    Operations have stopped at 40 percent of the enterprises in  Latvia, and most of the remaining enterprises are in the  confectionery and furniture industries. The kolkhozes were  broken up, and the separate farmsteads are back, but the people  have already lost the skills of solitary labor and have no  financing. The rate of unemployment according to official  statistics is 10 percent, and the actual rate is 44 percent. A  loaf of bread once cost 16 kopecks in Riga and now it costs 16  centimes, but the average wage was once 160 rubles and is now 30  lats. The Latvian leadership is making every effort to join  NATO, to preclude Latvia's return to the union.    The Russian economy is suffering a veritable collapse, like  an avalanche. In Ukraine President Kravchuk kept his campaign  promises: Everyone did become a "gentleman" and a millionaire,  but a million karbovantsy will not buy much! Ukrainian  communists believe that the situation in that republic could  lead to a repetition of the events of last October in Moscow.    What lies ahead? I will cite just a few of the speakers'  predictions. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation is  determined, as G. Zyuganov announced, to promote the  reestablishment of the union state, defend government by the  people, protect the laboring public, and restore social justice.  The next speaker, V. Tyulkin (RCWP), clarified these goals,  however, by stipulating that what had to be reestablished was  not some kind of "union state," but the Union of Soviet  Socialist Republics. This will necessitate reliance on labor  collectives after the party's influence there has been  strengthened, the development of the labor movement, and the  organization of a general political strike.    The representative of the Communist Party of Estonia (we  cannot call all of the representatives by name) made the logical  comment that the anti-people regimes will eventually be ejected  by public indignation, but communists must be ready for this  outburst. Some of the speakers suggested that the present rulers  are dangerous because they are in the throes of defeat and there  is no crime they would not commit in order to stay on top.    A report on the draft plan "For a Renewed Union of the  Soviet  Peoples" was presented by Ye. Ligachev. Property is the main  issue. The draft envisages a multistructured economy with a  prevalence of public property for our reunited fatherland. "The  union will have a socialist foundation," Yegor Kuzmich said. The  Soviet system of government by the people must be restored. The  soviets (and the dumas, councils, assemblies, and so forth) are  the best form of democracy because they were refined by the  course of historical events. The progression toward the union,  however, will not be quick, according to A. Lukyanov. It will  begin with economic integration, followed by a common defense  structure, and only then by a political union. At this time,  Anatoliy Ivanovich stressed, it is imperative that the Belovizh  accords be denounced.    The formation of a single CPSU is also likely to take some  time. Obviously, this process will occur at the same time as the  interstate integration. Until it has been completed, said Sh.  Shabdolov, the leader of the communists of Tajikistan, each  party will have its own charter and program, because "it would  be ridiculous to talk about a single set of documents today. We  have to be united, however, in the areas in which our unity is  imperative." Representing the Ukraine, A. Martynyuk continued  the discussion of unity and reported that the Communist Party of  Ukraine had joined the UCP-CPSU as a full-fledged member, and  then asked the leaders of the different communist factions to  fight our common enemy instead of each other.    Many speakers mentioned the responsibility of the communists  of Russia and their genuinely historic mission. "Everyone is  watching you," the communists were told. "The union will begin  with Russia. The situation in Russia has an immediate effect on  its neighbors," said R. Akhmedov, representing the Communist  Party of Azerbaijan. "I listened to the comrades from the  Russian communist parties. I have the greatest respect for them,  but I did not hear how they are coordinating their own actions."  Most of the conference participants agree that the UCP-CPSU is  the only possible form of association at this time, but some  leaders are not in any hurry to join it.    Here is a brief summary of the encouraging information that  was reported at the conference.    The Communist Party of the Russian Federation now has  550,000  communist members, united in 20,000 primary party organizations,  which are active in almost all rayons, cities, oblasts, and  republics. The "red belt" of the Russian regions is growing  wider: The leaders in 70 out of 88 are either confirmed  communists or their supporters--these are the statistics of the  "democrats."    In Tajikistan the organizational structure of the Communist  Party was maintained, it occupies a strong position in the  ideological sphere, the party press has been restored  completely, and the party owns property.    In Azerbaijan, "the people have turned to us and are no  longer waiting for a knight on a white charger." There are  33,000 active communists in the republic, but the party does not  feel any pressure to grow at this time and it is preparing for  its 35th Congress.    In the Ukrainian parliament, Chornovil, the leader of the  nationalists, "bobs up and down in his chair when he listens to  speeches by communists because these people know what to say and  how to say it."    In Southern Ossetia 60 percent of the communists stayed in  the party after reregistration.    Construction workers in Turkmenistan have initiated the  study  and dissemination of V.I. Lenin's works. They buy his books and  present them to individuals capable of rediscovering the  Leninist well of wisdom....    Summing up the results of the two-day conference, O. Shenin  said: "We have taken a step forward and have not taken any steps  backward."    ...On my way back to Moscow I saw the majestic Lenin pillar  again. This time the words inscribed on it did not sound odd. It  was all true. Lenin's cause is alive, and it is certain to  triumph!</p>

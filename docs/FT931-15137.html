			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US side cuts Dixons to Pounds 14m - Shares fall 29p despite good Christmas and new year trading LOSSES IN its US chain hit half-time profits of Dixons, the electrical goods retailer. At the pre-tax level they dropped from Pounds 17.5m to Pounds 14.2m in the 28 weeks to November 14. Despite reported good Christmas and new year trading in the UK branches, the shares fell 29p to 225p. Mr Stanley Kalms, Dixons' chairman, said he was fairly confident UK sales would continue the improvement seen in the first half and over Christmas, though recovery was fragile. In the US there was more evidence that the recession was turning. Earnings were down from 1.6p to 1p but the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.6p. Operating losses in the US rose to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 10.9m), while UK profits of Pounds 20.7m compared to Pounds 20.5m, which included a Pounds 5m release of excess provisions. Mr John Clare, group managing director, said despite the higher losses, good progress had been made in rebuilding Silo, the US chain acquired for Dollars 320m in 1987. But it had now been decided to close 45 stores in the mid-West, involving 550 jobs, at a cost of Dollars 40m. A provision would be made in the second half. Further ahead, 'substantial new investment' would be needed in Silo. Asked if the acquisition of Silo had been a mistake, Mr Kalms said: 'You can form your own conclusions'. Losses from Silo in the last two years have exceeded earlier profits. Mr Clare said that 'profit recovery will take some years' but stressed that the management's view was that turning Silo round was a better option than pulling out. Mr Kalms said that sales in the Dixons and Currys chains in the UK moved ahead strongly from mid-July. Christmas and new year sales rose 17 per cent, and were ahead of budget, although margins were slightly lower because of higher promotional costs. The European property activities lost Pounds 400,000 before interest (Pounds 2.9m profit). Mr Shrager, finance director, said that no sales had been completed in the first half but seven had been so far in the second half. Group turnover totalled Pounds 873.4m (Pounds 871.7m). Interest receivable was Pounds 8.8m (Pounds 3.9m) as capitalised interest rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 6.2m, and Pounds 2.3m was charged to provisions. After tax and dividend payments there was a retained loss of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 100,000 profit). Mr Shrager said the half year statement complied with new accounting standards and the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee, including a full balance sheet and a report from the auditors.

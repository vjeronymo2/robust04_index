			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Gist of the Draft Guidelines on Deregulation Compiled by a </F> Subcommittee of the Ruling Coalition's Tax Reform Council"]    [Text] The administrative and fiscal reform subcommittee  of the ruling coalition's Tax Reform Council has issued  guidelines on 33 deregulatory measures. The essential points of  the guidelines follow:  <H5>  National Police Agency </H5> 1. A wider range of application for the ordinary driver's  license -- regulations should be revised so that vehicles  weighing less than 10 tons and carrying less than five tons of  payload will be considered "ordinary cars."  <H5>  Ministry of Transport </H5>   1. Revision of the method under which passenger fares are  fixed by railway enterprises -- a ceiling should be set on  passenger fares, while the existing method should be improved.    2. Relaxation of regulations on railway freight charges  (details are omitted).    3. Drastic revision of the tonnage adjustment system that is  applied to coastal shipping vessels (details are omitted).    4. Deregulation concerning the trucking industry -- the  ministry should increase the number of expanded operations  areas. In the end, each operations area should be expanded so  that it will correspond to each administrative district covered  by each local transport bureau.  <H5>  Ministry of International Trade and Industry </H5>   1. Phased abolition of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law --  the ministry should define the abrogation program, for example,  the law can be abolished by gradually raising the upper limit on  floor space for outlets not needing government approval.    2. Relaxation of the Electric Appliance and Material Control  Law -- the ministry should further promote harmonization with  such foreign standards as IEC (international standard) and UL  (U.S. standard). It should also encourage the reconversion of  electrical appliances and materials classified under Group A to  those classified under Group B, while relaxing the obligation to  obtain type certification for electrical appliances and  materials still falling under Group A.    3. Regulations on foreign investment in Japan and its  application -- as for industries that directly affect national  security, many of them are not mentioned clearly by reason of  the Foreign Exchange Law. This should be revised, because it  lacks clarity.  <H5>  Fair Trade Commission </H5>   1. Revision of regulations prohibiting the establishment of  holding companies (details are omitted).  <H5>  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries </H5>   1. Relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license to sell  rice retail -- in principle, the ministry should grant a license  to every capable retailer eager to sell rice.    2. Drastic revision of regulations on farmland -- the  ministry should review city planning and revise its agricultural  development program. It should promote the use of underutilized  lands located in urbanized areas. Concerning the right to  authorize the conversion of farmland covering a total area of  more than two hectares, the ministry will place the matter under  the authority of prefectural governors. As for cities meeting  certain requirements that include population size, the ministry  will also entrust the matter to the municipal authorities.    3. Introduction of a selective system to limit rice acreage  -- the ministry should implement a new system under which rice  farmers will have free choice as to whether they will continue  to operate under the government's umbrella in accordance with  the production adjustment policy, after due consideration of  such factors as market pricing and production cost.    4. Encouragement of direct sales by rice farmers to  consumers  (details are omitted).    5. Reduction of the government purchasing price and the  government selling price of rice -- the ministry will help cut  the average production cost by half in about 10 years.    6. Reduction of the government purchasing price and the  government selling price of wheat (details are omitted).    7. Reform in the pricing process of rice authorized for free  distribution -- the ministry should increase the volume of rice  authorized for free distribution, offer more bids for such rice,  relax measures aimed at curbing excessive price fluctuations,  and promote diversification of rice sellers and buyers.    8. Reduction of subsidies connected with raw sugar imports  (details are omitted).    9. Revision of import restrictions on wheat and barley for  use as feedstuff (details are omitted).  <H5>  Ministry of Finance </H5>   1 Further relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license  for retail sale of liquor--the ministry will grant a license to  every retailer considered to be capable of dealing in liquor on  his own responsibility. However, for the moment, the ministry  will first authorize retail stores having floor space of more  than 3,000 square meters. It will also shorten the period  during which sales of alcoholic beverages will be restricted so  that retailers will be able to sell any kind of liquor as soon  as they start their business.    2. Further relaxation of conditions for obtaining a license  for retail sale of cigarettes (details are omitted).    3. Reduction to 5 percent of the withholding tax rate  applied  to stock dividends paid to foreign parent companies. The  government will ask pertinent countries for revision of the tax  treaty, while it will voluntarily lower the tax rate to 5  percent regardless of negotiations to revise the treaty.  <H5>  Ministry of Health and Welfare </H5>   1. Relaxation of criteria for obtaining a license for retail  sale of medicines -- designated inspection institutions will  take care of a wider area covering several prefectures. In  principle, inspection equipment will no longer have to be set up  inside a drugstore.    2. Plant quarantine -- to remove barriers impeding food  exports, the ministry will define the medical inspection  process, stop holding public hearings, and remove the  zero-tolerance requirement.  <H5>  Ministry of Construction </H5>   1. Revision of the essential points mentioned in the  administrative guidance concerning development projects (details  are omitted).    2. Amplification of assistance by the Housing Loan  Corporation concerning the purchase of houses with a leasehold  on land. The Corporation will accommodate people with loans to  enable them to buy such houses and to pay key money to  landowners.    3. Simplification of the approval process for imported  construction materials that already meet foreign standard  requirements (details are omitted).  <H5>  National Land Agency </H5>   1. Relaxation or cancellation of supervision over specific  areas -- local governments should stop supervising designated  areas when there is no more danger of a sudden rise in land  prices.  <H5>  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications </H5>   1. Relaxation of regulations concerning the launching of a  new telecommunications business classified under the first  category [category of common carriers], or the withdrawal from  such a business. The ministry should abolish, or if not,  revise, the provision on supply-demand adjustment, and implement  impartial and clear criteria in exchange.    2. As for telecommunications companies that come under the  first category, fewer services (rates) will be subject to  government approval. Only services that deeply affect the  national economy or people's everyday life will be subject to  approval.    3. Promotion of the open network program -- the ministry  should implement the principle of the open network agreement to  help realize the hookup of different telecommunications networks  under fair conditions. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation (NTT) should further open its network to other  telecommunications companies.    4. Measures to cope with the fusion of the communications  industry and the broadcasting industry (details are omitted).    5. Revision of the standard certification system regarding  the certification of telecommunications equipment -- the  ministry should reduce the certification fee and simplify and  accelerate the application procedure. It should also gradually  integrate government offices where applications are sent.  <H5>  Other Deregulatory Measures </H5>   1. Revision of the government procurement system -- an  information system should be created to give equal opportunities  to foreign-affiliated companies. As for the advance  registration system, the government will take necessary steps so  that foreign-affiliated companies will have to register their  name only once.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Portuguese telecoms company to cut its workforce by 20% TELECOM Portugal, one of the country's three telecommunications operators, plans to cut its workforce by 20 per cent by the end of 1994. The shedding of more than 2,000 of Telecom's 11,000 employees is part of a plan to restructure the company to take account of the European Community single market and in preparation for at least partial privatisation, company sources said. Management will encourage workers to leave through early retirement and voluntary, rather than forced, redundancies. The move follows 1,500 job losses at Telecom last year. The measure will include streamlining the five-member board - one of the proposals made in a study by consultants MAC-Group. Telecom currently has accumulated loses of Es150bn (Pounds 698m) and assets of Es400bn. Tariffs will be raised 5.5 per cent later this year. The inflation rate is expected to reach 7 per cent. Telecom was recently hived off from Correios e Telecomunicacions de Portugal, which will remain the public postal service. Telecom and the two other telephone operators, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto and Marconi, will be brought together as three separate divisions of a holding company, Comunicacoes Nacionais. The Telecommunications Ministry wants to privatise the companies gradually to give Portuguese investors time to pay and keep the country's telecommunications out of foreign hands.</p>

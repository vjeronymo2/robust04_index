The massacre at the al-Ibrahimi mosque at  dawn today opens the gates to major questions relating to the  entire peace process. Are we proceeding along the correct path?  Or is there something else that ought to be seen, studied, and  paused at? This is because with such a terrible murder that our  people were subjected to today, we cannot be assured of a future  without guarantees that will insure that our murder will not  become a daily annihilation.    Perhaps one of the most important and prominent questions  concerns the settlers and the settlements, and whether a  practical consolidation of any agreement could be realized if  the settlers were living round the towns, villages, and the most  important Palestinian housing concentrations? Everyone knows  that the settlements that were built in the West Bank and Gaza  since 1967 were established on military bases; the aim was that  they should encircle the Palestinians, surrounding them with a  military belt in which zealous settlers, who are trained in the  use of arms and had served in the Israeli Army, live.  Therefore, there is a gross malfunction in the negotiations  that basically relate to the settlements and the settlers.    It is quite true that the Oslo and Washington agreements do  not place the matter along these lines, but today's massacre  gives a clear signal that there can be no solution with the  presence of the settlers, and that the problem of the  settlements should jump the list to become the priority over all  other issues. This is because the Palestinians cannot have  security while the settlers are there, and cannot feel safe  while the settlements are present. Today's massacre is terrible  and atrocious to the extent that it cannot be tolerated. It  does not only give rise to questions, but raises the issue of  protecting our people, and gives pause to the entire world --  especially the two cosponsors, the Russians and the Americans --  and the Security Council and the United Nations questions  regarding the presence of an international force to protect our  people -- forces that separate this unarmed people and the  settlers, who this morning fired the signal of the beginning,  that was received by the Israeli Army who indulged with the  settlers in the killing of the sons of our people.    We ought to understand the massacre, not only as an  atrocious  and mass crime, but as an early declaration of Israeli  intentions regarding their belief in peace. Those who allow all  those killings, and those who participate in such murders,  cannot have a definite intention to strive for peace. This, now  more than ever before, make our people and the PLO pause at our  security and the guarantees that are being offered by the world  for this security. The entire world has celebrated the accord of  principles that was signed in Washington. What does the world  say about this massacre and these killings? How can the world  guarantee for us that such a massacre will not be repeated? How  can this world punish the Israeli Government, Israeli Army, and  Israeli settlers? The United Nations and the Security Council  and all the states are now called upon to adopt a clear  attitude.    The Security Council, which in recent years has become an  establishment for intervention in the explosive spots in the  world, should take practical resolutions and steps to protect  the Palestinian blood. We will not list the issue under the  title: Settler or settlers? The issue is not like that. The  Israeli Army was not only responsible, but was the one who  carried out the massacre. The Israeli prime minister, who at  the same time is the well-known general who broke the  Palestinians bones, is also totally and practically responsible.  Matters will not be rectified in this way. Negotiations could  not be continued, not only as a protest, but because of the  bigger question of whether such negotiations and the results  they may reach are worthwhile if the beginnings witness such  terrible massacres? It is a black day in the history of our  people. It is a bloody day, a day when they violated our  sanctities in a holy month and killed and slaughtered; a day  when blood smeared the walls of the al-Ibrahimi mosque while  they went on in their celebration of our murder. How can murder  lead to peace? We ought to stop and not proceed along the path  of negotiation without being assured that the mowing down by  bullets of innocent worshipers who were kneeling in prayers to  their God would not be repeated, even if it was individual  killing. How about their ugliness and racialism?    Then there is a last question that the massacre raises. Is  the Arab situation in need of a bigger reconsideration in order  to become more solid and firm? Is such solidarity still a  costly demand, while the massacres fully expose the facts before  the Arab world? Is there anyone who is safe from danger and  threats while the life, security, and safety of the entire  region are in a most critical situation?</p>

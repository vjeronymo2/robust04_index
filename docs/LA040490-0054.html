			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRIDLOCK AND PROPOSITION 111  </P> <P> The editorial on Prop. 111 was right on target and should be required reading  for every California voter before the June 5 election.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce believes passage of Prop. 111 is  absolutely essential to California's continued economic health and vitality --  and for our quality of life.  </P> <P> This measure will finance desperately needed transportation and infrastructure  improvements.  </P> <P> Equally important, Prop. 111 will modify the state's spending limit formula and  the budget process. Without this crucial change, the state faces diminishing  funds for higher education, health care, law enforcement, and a whole range of  other critical programs and services. It could cripple California.  </P> <P> The choice is clear. We must invest in California now.  </P> <P> RAY REMY  </P> <P> President, Los Angeles Area  </P> <P> Chamber of Commerce  </P></p>

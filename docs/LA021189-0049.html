			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NHL SHOULD WISE UP, REQUIRE HELMETS FOR ALL  </P> <P> After watching the Kings' Ron Duguay smash his head on the ice in a recent  game, I have to wonder when the Kings, the National Hockey League and players  who don't wear helmets are going to wise up.  </P> <P> It seems to me it would be in everyone's best interest for the league or  individual teams to make helmets mandatory.  </P> <P> BRAD KEARNS  </P> <P> Malibu  </P></p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Time fails to heal BCCI wounds THE PASSING of nearly two years since the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International had not diminished the anger of the collapsed bank's creditors who attended a meeting at Wembley Arena in London yesterday. Several hundred creditors - predominantly from the Asian community - gathered to express their frustration with the liquidators from accountancy firm Touche Ross and to ask for details of how soon and how much they might be paid. As the afternoon wore on, frustrated members of the audience began to shout objections to the four liquidators and a lawyer, who were seated behind a large desk on a stage reminiscent of a scene from the Supreme Soviet. An English court had ruled that yesterday's meeting was necessary to elect a formal creditors' committee, but the liquidators decided also to give a presentation and answer questions. Just a few minutes into the 3 1/2 -hour meeting, they agreed under pressure from Mr Keith Vaz MP, head of the parliamentary BCCI group, to change the order of the agenda in order to allow questions and comments before the vote. Mr Christopher Morris, the liquidator who did all the talking and chaired the meeting, expressed slight surprise that there were just 524 creditors or their representatives present - compared with 105 journalists. Several creditors were angry about Touche Ross's fees, which come to more than Dollars 133m (Pounds 86.3m) worldwide. 'Why don't you just go home and give us the rest of the money?' one demanded. A number called for litigation against the government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder, instead of the proposed contribution of Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 2.2bn negotiated between Abu Dhabi and the team of liquidators. Mr Morris said the agreement was the best chance for creditors to receive money, and said that a court appeal in Luxembourg to reject the agreement was 'regrettable' and merely delayed payment. He said if the agreement was approved, creditors could expect to receive 15p in the pound by next year and, 'conservatively', 30p to 40p eventually. There was some confusion over the ballot to elect the creditors' committee. Mr Hal Skolnik, one of three creditors who has appealed to the Luxembourg court and one of the 24 standing for the committee, told the audience not to vote for him for fear of splitting the vote of other candidates also opposed to the Abu Dhabi deal.</p>

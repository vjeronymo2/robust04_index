			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US losing hope as tariff rows continue US trade officials are losing hope for any significant gains in the final drive to negotiate tariff cuts in the Uruguay Round beyond those agreed last December 15. Countries taking part in the Uruguay Round of trade-liberalising talks are still wrangling over the details of individual tariff schedules, three weeks after the negotiations should have finished. With the signing of the Round set for April 15 in Marrakesh, the negotiations have entered the 'verification stage' on tariffs, which is supposed to address only technical changes. However, the US, Japan, EU and Canada - the so-called Quad countries - continue to wrangle over tariff cuts on wood, white spirits, copper, and aluminum. The only deal in sight is a cut in Japan's copper tariffs to the equivalent of 5 per cent. Trade officials in Geneva said yesterday that talks, mostly bilateral, were continuing to try to sort out remaining differences. These mainly concern items where tariff concessions shown in the submitted schedules do not match what countries thought they had achieved in earlier negotiations. More than 60 schedules have been submitted, with 22 still outstanding. Least developed countries are not obliged to submit schedules at this stage. A US official said Japan and the EU had continued to block progress by refusing to cut their most sensitive tariffs. March 25, the date set by the Gatt secretariat as the deadline for submission of final tariff schedules, is now seen as the final deadline for the market access talks. Progress on wood, particularly, would be 'a good thing' for US-Japan relations, the official said. A 50 per cent reduction over five years has been agreed, but that will still leave Japanese wood tariffs at 6 per cent. The US industry has even joined the fray, buying advertisements in Japanese newspapers claiming that a tariff phase-out would bring the cost of housing down by 20 per cent. At a meeting of negotiators yesterday in Geneva, convened to discuss the schedules, Japan repeated complaints that the US had withdrawn earlier offers on films, electronic products and non-ferrous metals. EU officials on Monday expressed disappointment over US tariff reductions on copper and trucks. Japan is also unhappy about the EU's offer on televisions and video cameras, while Indonesia and Malaysia have complained about the link between lower EU wood tariffs and a lifting of their restrictions on export of raw logs. Concern was voiced yesterday about a US 'headnote' in the textiles and clothing section referring to Washington's intention to pursue talks with some exporting nations, such as India and Pakistan, to reduce their import barriers. The US stressed this was not being made a condition for tariff reductions. However, it urged US negotiators to pursue 'aggressively' further tariff cuts to enhance 'significantly the economic benefits of the Uruguay Round'. The meagre results of these final talks are a severe blow to US industry. The influential Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, a business and labour panel appointed by the president, said further tariff cuts were vital. The textile industry is even more insistent on progress. Mr Henry Truslow, president of the American Textile Manufacturers' Institute, threatened last week to oppose the trade pact in Congress unless the US won 'critically needed market access commitments from countries which today flood US markets with their clothing and textile products'. Although market opening offers have been received from Malaysia, Chile, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, no tariff cut offer has been received from Pakistan. India has offered small cuts, which US officials dismiss as inadequate. 'Time is running out,' said Mr Truslow. 'We see no progress on making the major offenders agree to open their markets. 'It is time for our government to take a stand and say the US will not phase out its Multifibre Arrangement quotas for countries which keep their markets closed.'</p>

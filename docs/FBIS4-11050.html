			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of speech by President Eduardo Frei upon launching </F> the National Commission on Public Morals on 6 April in Santiago]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen. We are today starting a basic  task to ensure the future of the country. I refer to the  proposal for improving the regulations, procedures, and  institutions that watch over public morals. I have invited  well-known authorities and personalities of our society to  become members of the National Commission on Public Morals that  is established today. The members of this national commission  guarantee to seriously study and achieve good results in the  areas in which the commission will work. I thank them all for  agreeing to carry out this task.    From the beginning of my administration, I stated my  commitment and that of my government to an honest public  administration and an impersonal use of power.    I recently instructed and encouraged public administration  employees to carry their duties with creativity and efficiency.  I reminded them of ethical obligations and precepts that guide  public functions. I am sure we can count on them to honor the  exemplary tradition of service of which we are proud.    We hereby establish this national commission today to  streamline the legal mechanisms established and to ward off and  suppress corruption and the trafficking of influence.    The factor that prompted me to establish this national  commission was to underscore that corruption and its attendant  problems are things that concern the whole country, as the  effort of a particular government are not enough to prevent and  overcome it. All the democratic forces of the country should be  united in this endeavor.    The sense of initiative that gathers us here today is to  serve Chile and to anticipate any isolated case of corruption  that may lead to a situation having a harmful effect on the  country. We seek to quickly prevent the dissemination of an  evil which seriously affects societies nowadays.    The crisis of values affecting the modern world tends to  weaken the moral roots that sustain political virtues.  Societies with different traditions, large and small countries  of the first and third world have been hit hard by this scourge.  In many parts of the world, bribes, fraud, embezzlement of  public funds, and sale of political influence have become a  practice that enslaves the lives of people, destroys their  institutions, weakens the state, and makes the nation vulnerable.    Chile is part of the modern world and does not escape from  this problem. Although our country is far from the described  situation and corruption is not yet a generalized vice, we must  be alert and act quickly to stop this evil at its roots. Our  responsibility is to act now and quickly.    To do that we have a tradition in our favor which must be  strengthened. If Chileans are surprised by actions that violate  ethical and legal principles, it is precisely because such  actions are alien to our institutions and traditions.  Historically, Chile has had honest officials and a dignified  political class. Both in the past and now, the slogan of our  democracy has been integrity. Acts of corruption draw attention  because historically Chilean democracy has been honored by  politicians and governments with a dedication to public service,  and honest presidents. This tradition must emerge with greater  strength in this new stage of our development.    It is the duty of the entire Chilean society, not just of  the government, to encourage public morals. The strengthening  and preservation of moral values related to common well-being  requires a great effort by all sectors of society, the family,  the education system, the media, and enterprises. Extreme  individualism that seeks material gain or power by any means  should be considered morally unacceptable in order to unmask  selfish interests disguised as higher interests and to question  actions that seek to make illegal actions and corruption appear  respectable. We must revive among Chilean people a natural  reaction of indignation regarding different forms of power abuse.    In particular, we need a joint reaction by the public and  private sector. We want to make areas of contact between the  two sectors sufficiently clear so that the legitimate and  necessary cooperation does not become a false relationship.  Irresponsible criticism of the state many times forgets that  two parties are usually involved in acts of corruption: the  public servant and the private enterprise or private individual  who illegally tries to obtain an objective.    The struggle against corruption mainly concerns the state,  but also the private sector. Upholding a corrupt system that  increases costs and distorts competition rules, in the medium  and long term, affects private interests. The state and private  sector's common task in this field is to find the best solutions  to maximize the incentives provided by a modern society and also  to protect Chile from the vices and threats of a modern society.    All democratic forces of the country must become united in  the common task of fighting corruption.    It must be well known that corruption is democracy's enemy.  It discredits the institutions before society, it discourages  youths from choosing to serve in the public sector, it  jeopardizes the inspiration and the innovative capacity of  public servants, and it sows distrust in the international  community regarding the integrity of procedures and laws.    Undoubtedly, democracy alone does not guarantee morality in  the public sector, but it makes it possible to report, it allows  the establishment of supervision organizations, and it  establishes impersonal judgment and appellation procedures and  fair punishments. In sum: Our political system is not free of  deficiencies, but it has the tools to correct these deficiencies.    Our actions to fight corruption must always be inspired by  the desire to safeguard democracy and its institutions.    From the executive branch that is in charge of  administrating  the country, from the opposition exercising the necessary role  of criticizing, from Congress fulfilling the role of legislating  and supervising, and from any public and private level, our  actions in this regard must contribute to safeguarding  democracy. With this clear objective we can jointly and with  determination progress, quietly and in an unselfish manner.    As we undertake the task of assessing and improving the  legal  and moral duties of the public activity through this commission,  we want the existing debate to result in concrete proposals so  that the many suggestions may be used productively for the  country.    The great danger is that the fight against corruption may be  nothing but rhetoric: Chilean's rightly want deeds.    I want to address a special message to the public servants.    Every upright and efficient government official ought not to  be worried. Our final goal is to turn public service into a  dignified work environment where initiative, the spirit of work,  and the disinterested effort to achieve the common good are  rewarded. We are not seeking to create a paralyzing and  stifling control system. We are interested, rather, in clearly  distinguishing illegitimate intentions from mere mistakes. We  are pursuing the betterment of the state so as to be able to  give citizens competent service rather than the construction of  an ineffective and bureaucratic state. We do not want to  duplicate the existing supervision institutions and mechanisms,  but rather want to permanently activate them, improve them, and  adjust them to a phenomenon that has aspects already known in  the Chile of the past.    On this occasion, in my capacity as president of Chile, I  want to reiterate my determination to exercise my authority  assuming my inalienable duty to govern the country and make  decisions, ultimately, respecting my commitment to do so  strictly observing the moral principles of our republican system.    Endorsed by tradition, by the modernization of the system  that guards legal and ethical duties in the public activity, and  by our will to exercise authority and prevent acts of  corruption, we will keep our Fatherland free and transparent and  will guarantee a government at the service of society and not of  itself.</p>

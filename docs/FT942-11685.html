			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of the Restructuring Eastern Germany (7): Surge in construction continues unabated German and foreign construction companies have moved quickly into a region starved of capital investment in housing, real estate and renovation in a bid to make up for lost time over the past 45 years. These companies are also playing a crucial role in providing jobs. More than 383,000 people are now employed in construction. The building boom, which shows no sign of slowing, is a welcome development for west German and foreign companies. They have offset poor returns at home because of the recession by capitalising on the expanding construction market in eastern Germany. In west Germany, total investment in the building industry last year totalled DM347.8bn, a sharp decline on the previous year. In eastern Germany, in contrast, total investment amounted to DM87.5bn, accounting for 7.1 per cent of GDP in real terms. 'Immediately after unification, there was a massive surge in public investment, but from very low levels of (previous) investment as well as a low GDP base,' said Mr Heiko Stiepelmann, a spokesman for Germany's association for the building industry. 'We can now see a pattern emerging in east Germany,' he continued. 'At first, there was a rapid and large public investment programme.' This was mainly in the non-residential state sector, including roads, bridges, public buildings, hospitals and schools. 'Then the private sector began building or modernising enterprises and offices and now, over the next few years, we will see activity on the housing front - not only renovating old stock, but particularly building new homes as well,' he added. In 1993 alone, the federal government invested more than DM18.3bn in upgrading the infrastructure, a rise of 15 per cent on the previous year. It was followed by private companies which invested DM35.3bn in non-residential property, an increase of 22 per cent on 1992, and private housing, where over DM33.9bn was invested, a rise of 42.2 per cent (all based on 1993 price levels). Mr Frank Soffner, a housing expert at the Munich-based Ifo institute, believes that investment throughout the construction industry in eastern Germany will continue to rise by 16 per cent each year. On 1991 prices, it could reach DM2,400bn by the year 2005. However, he says this level of investment would need to be maintained, if not increased, if the German east was to reach the west's standards by that time. So far, there are few indications to suggest that investment in the construction industry will slow. The governments of the five eastern states continue to offer generous financial incentives and tax holidays for investors, and as more outstanding property claims are resolved, more residential housing will require renovation. The federal government is also planning to privatise 15 per cent of eastern German housing stock over the next 10 years. In reports issued by Ifo, the Basle-based Prognos, the number of dwellings will increase even as the birth rate declines. In eastern Germany today, an average 2.4 persons live in one home. This number will fall to 2.2 by 2000 and 2.1 by 2010, creating the need for more dwellings. In addition, experts reckon that of the 6.9m dwellings registered in eastern Germany, about 500,000 are no longer suitable for occupancy. By 2000, they believe that between 7m and 7.3m dwellings will be required. In short, one-family and two-family homes will account for a very large share of construction activity for the rest of the 1990s, rising from 34 per cent in 1989 to more than 38 per cent in 2000. As a result, east German housing will soon match the occupancy - and quality levels - of its west German counterparts. Yet, the boom in the east German construction industry has had some negative side-effects for west German companies. Wages in eastern Germany's construction industry are approaching 90 per cent of west German levels, although, according to Mr Stiepelmann, productivity levels are between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of west German levels. At the same time, as more and more non-German companies enter the east German building industry, often bringing their own crews, and in some cases hiring workers from the neighbouring countries of eastern Europe, west German companies are faced with competition - 'some local authorities are contracting out to foreign companies because they can do things more cheaply,' said Mr Stiepelmann. 'The German industry's high wage levels and competition mean that west German companies have not reaped all the benefits of the construction boom in eastern Germany' - but it may bring savings for city authorities.</p>

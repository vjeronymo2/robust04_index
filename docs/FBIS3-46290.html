			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "China Radio International Commentary" program by </F> Lin Shaowen]    [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has set three major  goals for his administration in 1994. Fighting crime, promoting  reemployment, and reforming the country's welfare and health  care system were the major initiatives included in Clinton's  State of the Union Address Tuesday [25 January].    President Clinton is determined to tackle key domestic  problems this year. This is obvious from his spirited one-hour  speech before the House. He stated these goals will bring on  renewal for the United States. Clinton asked the Congress to  set aside partisan differences and pass the top crime bill.  Clinton demanded increased funding for drug treatment, top  penalties for those who choose violence, and more stringent  measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.    The United States has seen a rush of street violence,  something the President calls an American problem. To boost  crime fighting, Clinton is asking for a new contingent of  100,000 community police officers. They will patrol the streets  and allow the veterans to perform more sensitive work.    If Congress approves this plan, it could contribute to the  President's second goal -- increasing employment. Clinton said  unemployment should be solved along with improving welfare and  health care. Earlier, he indicated welfare reforms would have  to wait for the much publicized health care package; but he  seems to have reserved his stand, stressing that the two must be  dealt with at once. He explained that better welfare is  impossible without health care.    President Clinton repeated a promise that his government  would focus on workers' training. He wants to transform  America's outdated unemployment system into what he called a  reemployment system.    Clinton put forward his health care reform plan last  September. It features an employer-based system and guarantees  health insurance for every citizen by 1996. This is something  former President Richard Nixon promised more than 20 years go  but never delivered. This time, President Clinton has asked  Congress to pass the legislation on health care reform.    Clinton's State of the Union Address also stresses the  administration's deficit reduction plan. It supports cutting  the federal budget deficit by half a trillion dollars in five  years.    Analysts say Clinton's approval rating has been on the rise,  encouraging him to put forward both new reforms.    However, Congress is sure to see a raging debate this year  on  the controversial health care package, along with other issues.  Some congressmen and industrialists claim the new system will  be unfair. The President is pleading for bipartisan support from  Congress. The passage of the North American Free Trade  Agreement has set a precedent for this, and Clinton could very  well get the green light he is asking for.</p>

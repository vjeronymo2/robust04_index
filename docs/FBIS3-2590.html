It has been learned that the session today withdrew all  copies of Li Peng's Government Work Report already distributed  to CPPCC members, replacing them with copies of a revised  version this evening.    In the revised version of Li Peng's Government Work Report,  a  new paragraph has been added to the part dealing with the Hong  Kong issue.    The original version: The British side should be  held fully responsible for the breakup of the Sino-British  talks. According to the decision of the Standing Committee of  the National People's Congress, the Preliminary Working  Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region has begun its work.    Inserting a new paragraph: Tasks are arduous and  the responsibility is heavy. It is our hope that the  Preliminary Working Committee can unite Hong Kong compatriots in  the most extensive way, succeed in all fields of work in  preparation for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, as well  as its first session of government and legislature, and live up  to the expectations and great trust of the people of the whole  country.    Joining the original version: No matter what  twists and turns we may face, the Chinese Government and people  have the determination and ability to exercise sovereignty over  Hong Kong as scheduled, and to maintain Hong Kong's long-term  stability and prosperity. Britain's colonialist rule over Hong  Kong is coming to an end and no force on earth can stop it from  happening.</p>

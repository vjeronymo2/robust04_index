			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (10): Yesterday the world  -Media 'THE test of the whole global media concept really hangs now on Time Warner. If they can't make it work I'm not sure anyone can.' That is the view of a UK company which set itself up to barter TV programmes to emerging European TV channels, and has become increasingly sceptical that truly global media businesses can flourish in the face of regulatory and cultural differences between countries. It is right to point to Time Warner, the world's biggest media company, for clues to whether the corporate experiments of the 1980s will be retained or rejected in the 1990s. Time Warner performed one of the most audacious of those experiments, the Dollars 14bn merger of the magazine group Time and Warner Brothers film and television studios and cable television. The test of its success will be whether economies of scale and synergies - the 'two plus two equals five' factor - will let it pay off its debt of Dollars 8.5bn and keep growing. That hypothesis - that size brought more wealth, and justified high acquisition prices - was behind many of the most flamboyant media deals of the 1980s. But that theory is now under attack, given the spectacular collapse of some of the most aggressive wheelers and dealers. The late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire, now under investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office, may have caught the most headlines, but there is no lack of other examples. Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has spent two years negotiating with its bankers for its survival; it won their support only by agreeing to sell businesses it had fought to buy just a few years before. The French giant Hachette, whose ambitions led it to leap the Atlantic and take over US encyclopedia publisher Grolier at the end of the 1980s, now finds its room for manoeuvre tightly circumscribed by debt, while some of its investments such as the failing French TV channel La Cinq continue to inflict damage to its profits. An informal poll of finance directors of large US and UK media groups, who are now surveying the wrecks of some of the 1980s empires in search of bargains, produces the consensus that prices for acquisitions are finally falling. At the start of the 1980s a good magazine group would typically fetch a price of 10-15 times post-tax profits in the UK - slightly higher in the US because of differences in accounting for profits. However, by 1986-1988, the peak of the acquisition boom in media, those prices had more than doubled, partly driven by the availability of finance: banks were keen to offer credit, leveraged against what they saw as unshakeable, advertising -driven cashflow. According to media finance directors, prices have now fallen sharply to levels only slightly higher than the early 1980s. The spectacle of failure on a grand scale is not the only reason for the change: media companies and their bankers have been firmly reminded by the past few years that there is no natural law that says advertising must keep growing. Advertising - the revenue that drives television, newspapers, magazines, and most media - apart from book publishing - grew faster than the US, UK and French economies for most of the 1980s. Advertising agencies notably Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the UK-based company that itself came to grief through over-ambitious international expansion, were fond of arguing that advertising was 'recession proof' and that advertising budgets were among the last areas of spending that would be cut in an economic downturn. That argument has been decisively undermined by the US and UK experience in the past two years, when advertising budgets have plunged across most media as economies dipped into recession. As well as new nervousness about estimating media revenue in a particular country, there is more caution about predicting whether a magazine, book or programme will cross national borders, not just in Europe, where the linguistic and cultural barriers are obvious, but within the English-speaking countries too. Media corporate financiers on Wall Street say that banks are using less ambitious assumptions about foreign sales in valuing back catalogues of book, pop music, film and TV companies. Some media companies are tentatively returning to the bids and deals market, although the specialist media corporate finance boutiques that sprang up in the 1980s may still find it hard to scratch a living from advisory fees. Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm which is handling the dismemberment of Mr Maxwell's Maxwell Communication Corporation under UK insolvency law, reports no shortage of interested bidders once the liabilities of the companies are established. But the signs are that media acquisitions will be on a more cautious scale than in the 1980s. It is the companies that held back in the 1980s and survived with balance sheets intact who are now reaching for the bargains, such as the UK's Reed International, or Mr Conrad Black, proprietor of the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, who recently won control of the collapsed Australian Fairfax group, a pattern that some see as virtue rewarded.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE TOP TEN AND THEIR MEDIA REVENUE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company        Nationality     Revenue 1990      Activity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TIME WARNER    US              Dollars11.5bn     TIME magazine, WARNER                                                  film, cable television Bertelsmann    Germany         DM14.5bn          Books Gruner Jahr                                                  magazines, papers News Corp      US              ADollars10bn      Newspapers (UK, US,                                                  Australia); Fox TV (US)                                                  Sky TV (UK) Capital  Cities/ABC    US              Dollars5.4bn      US network TV Hachette       France          FFr30.1bn         Book publishing in                                                  France and US Sony           Japan/US        Dollars5bn        CBS records/Columbia                                                  Pictures Dun Bradstreet US              Dollars4.8bn                                                  Data, directories,                                                  market research Paramount      US              Dollars3.9bn      TV/film studio, books Times Mirror   US              Dollars3.6bn      Newspapers Thomson Corp   Canada          Dollars3.4bn      Magazines, papers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures are for media turnover at last published results.

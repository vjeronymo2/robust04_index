			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Saito, Semiconductor Division, NEC] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Current TFT-LCD issues include making them larger, giving  them higher resolution, more colors, and lower power  consumption, making them lighter and thinner, and applying them  in multimedia. The LSI driver holds an important key to solving  all these problems.    With this in mind, in this article I discuss the importance  of the LSI driver in the LCD display system, present LSI driver  technology, and future trends with special reference to LSI  drivers for TFT-LCDs in the rapidly developing field of office  automation.  <H5>  Present TFT-LCDs and LSI Drivers </H5>   1. LCD Driver Circuits for Personal Computers    The largest number of TFT-LCDs mass produced for personal  computers are 8-12 inch diagonal panels with 640x400 or 640x480  pixels, and they are mainly used in notebook and laptop  computers. Based on the number of scan lines, in mainstream  displays the gate bus line scan time is 30-40 s, the LSI  driver has 8-16 levels, and there are 4096 colors in the  display. The main drive methods include one that uses an 8-16  level digital driver (multi-level driver), and one that drives a  liquid crystal with a low cost 5 V output driver (8-16 levels)  by altering the common voltage in opposite phase to the pixel  voltage (the common inversion drive method).[.sup]1[/]    Moreover, multi-level display methods include the frame rate  control method (abbreviated FRC below) and the dither  method.[.sup]2[/] Of particular interest is the development  of the 5 V output, 64 level LSI driver that enables the  realization of 256 levels when combined with FRC. The reduction  in picture quality, which is the shortcoming of combining the 5  V output driver and the common inversion drive method appears to  have been overcome as well by a new drive method[.sup]3[/] in  which the driver oscillates.    2. LCD Driver Circuits for Workstations (WS)    This class of displays has a much higher number of pixels  than personal computer displays, with more than 4096 display  colors and more than 800,000 pixels, so the driver must work  much faster. For example, there are dot clocks of more than 100  MHz, and because the pixel signal cannot be input directly into  the driver at present, phase expansion must be used to reduce  the speed of the pixel signal clock to match the operating speed  of the driver.[.sup]4[/] For applications that mostly deal  with text, this is possible with the number of levels created by  combining FRC with a digital driver, but to utilize current  workstations to their full potential, at least 64-256 levels are  required.    For engineering workstation (EWS) applications the operating  frequency of the LSI driver reaches 50 MHz, and it is practical  to expand to two phases to convey digital data to the LSI  driver. However, 48 (8x3x2) input pins are needed to carry 8-bit  data, so this is not practical from an installation standpoint.  Therefore, development is underway to use phase expansion with  analog drivers that obtain a sufficient output accuracy and have  20 mV or less in output voltage fluctuation.[.sup]5[/]  <H5>  Present LSI Drivers </H5>   1. Present LSI Driver Device Technology    When we build an AC drive for a TFT-LCD using LSI driver  output, we need an output amplitude of about 12 V, and the 5 V  series control logic must be about 12 MHz at the personal  computer level. From a structural standpoint we need as much  commonality as we can get between the high-voltage and  low-voltage CMOS in the LSI driver device, and we need a device  formed by a consolidation process built under optimal conditions  on the same substrate.    Figure 1 shows an example of a device made by the  consolidation process. For the high-voltage CMOS it is necessary  to make the gate oxide film thicker than the gate voltage's  insulation withstand voltage, and we need a low-concentration  offset layer to mitigate the gate and drain field concentration,  which results in a complex structure. A high-concentration guard  ring layer is also needed to achieve high-voltage CMOS element  isolation. Therefore, consolidation is much more complex than  the low-voltage CMOS process alone, and higher manufacturing  costs are unavoidable. Because the mutual conductance  gm drops and parasitic capacitance increases when we  make a high-voltage CMOS, it is not possible to obtain high  speed and high accuracy with a high-voltage CMOS analog circuit.  Making the voltage higher also increases the design rule, and  this is disadvantageous from the standpoint of integration.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-24A>      Figure 1 Structure of LSI Driver Device </FIG>     Moreover, when heat diffusion is used to obtain the  high-voltage CMOS withstand voltage after the ion implantation  process of the V[.sub]T[/] (threshold voltage) control gate,  V[.sub]T[/] control becomes poor, and this limits low-voltage  CMOS miniaturization. In current 20 V class LSI drivers, the  high-voltage CMOS design rule is about 4-8 m, and the  low-voltage CMOS design rule is about 1.2-3 m. For 5 V LSI  drivers, a VLSI low-voltage process is used with a design rule  of about 0.8-1.5 m. Table 1 compares the consolidation  process and the low-voltage process.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1 Comparison of Consolidation Process and 5 V Process                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Consolidation Process                |5 V Process       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |High-Voltage      |Low-Voltage       |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Operating Voltage |-20V              |5V                |5V                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |L poly            |4 m      |1.5 m    |1.2 m    |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |T[.sub]OX[/]    |600 Ang.          |300 Ang.          |250 Ang.          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Wiring            |Al poly, 1 layer                     |Al 2 layer        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      2. Current LSI Drivers    As shown in Figure 2, LSI data drivers can be divided into  digital drivers and analog drivers. Digital drivers input  digital multi-level data, and analog drivers input analog  multi-level data. The number of output pins for both is a  relatively large 120-192.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-25A>      Figure 2 Block Diagrams of Digital and Analog </FIG>      (1) Digital Drivers    Digital drivers store multi-level data for one horizontal  time frame in data memory at a high speed. When the next  horizontal time frame begins, the output circuit is activated.  As far as operation is concerned, within one horizontal time  frame the driver needs to drive a TFT-LCD within about 30 s  for a personal computer and within about 15 s for an EWS.  Therefore, high speed is easily achieved. However, as the number  of levels increases, the number of input pins also increases,  which is a drawback.    A. 8 Level Drivers    The 8-16 level, multi-level drivers, which are the digital  drivers most often manufactured, have an analog switch for each  level in the output circuit, and they select a voltage source,  supplied from the outside, for each level. Because the circuit  construction is simple, high-voltage LSI drivers can be easily  built, and those with an operating frequency of 15-20 MHz have  been made into commercial products. Moreover, a special _g_  correction circuit is not needed because _g_ correction can be  performed merely by adjusting the voltage sources of the  different levels. Moreover, the driver itself does not require  an analog circuit, so its low power consumption is an advantage.  However, because the number of analog switches for the output  circuit and voltage sources for the levels increase as the  number of levels increases, the chip size of the LSI driver  becomes huge and wiring the voltage sources for the levels on  the LCD module becomes a problem. Therefore, its upper limit is  about 16 levels.    B. 64 Level Drivers    Right now, there is active development of 5 V, 64 level LSI  drivers that contain a D/C converter for the output circuit, and  they utilize a 0.8-1.5 m VLSI low-voltage process. In the  past, adequate drivers could not be made with the high-voltage  process, but with the adoption of the miniature VLSI low-voltage  CMOS process, it has become possible to construct a highly  integrated D/A converter with high accuracy and low power  consumption. By incorporating the D/A converter into the output  circuit, a voltage source is not needed for each level, but the  driver must have a _g_ correction circuit. If a correction is  not made inside the LSI driver with a non-linear D/A, a D/A  converter with about two bits more than the gradation data is  needed. Therefore, many of the 64 level drivers now under  development employ the method of supplementing with 3 bits  between two voltage sources from among the 9 external voltage  sources for the levels (Fig. 3).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-26A>      Figure 3. _g_ Correction Method for 64 Level </FIG>     In terms of physical properties, the drivers under  development have an output deviation of +/-20 mV, an operating  frequency of 20-35 MHz, and a power consumption of about 30 mW.    (2) Analog Drivers    Analog drivers keep analog multi-level data in an output S/H  (sample and hold) circuit by sampling pulses and make their  output through an analog amp. Therefore, in principle they are  full color, and their circuitry is simple, but it is difficult  to obtain a high accuracy analog amp and high speed/high  accuracy S/H circuits with a high-voltage CMOS.    In the past, among the analog drivers for general use, those  used mainly in commercial televisions had an output deviation of  about +/-50 mV, an operating frequency of 5-15 MHz, and a power  consumption of about 200 mW. At NEC, however, we have developed  a dynamic range, 15 V analog driver for EWS with an output  deviation of +/-20 mV, an operating frequency of 15 MHz, and a  power consumption of 100 mW through improvements in the  consolidation process (high-voltage CMOS). One example is shown  below (Figure 4).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-025L-27A>      Figure 4 Example of EWS Analog Driver </FIG>     A. Number of Input Ports    The analog signal coming into the driver directly enters the  S/H circuit, but because the S/H circuit control signal passes  through a 5 V control circuit, a dispersion in the 5 V control  circuit is necessary as a sampling dynamic margin. Based on the  sampling circuit, we can figure that this value will be several  ns, and the sampling time will be about 15 MHz. Therefore, we  chose 12 (RGBx4) as the number of analog input ports for the EWS.    B. Analog Amp    We encounter special difficulties with the analog amp at the  output stage in terms of power consumption and accuracy. With  power consumption, the TFT-LCD load capacitance of 100-200 pF  becomes a problem. At the loaded drive stage, if we consider the  source follower, to obtain a through rate of 1 V/s, we need  a  constant current source such that 200 pF x 1 V/s = 200  A.  When we reach a power source voltage of 15 V and 192 output  pins, we already have surpassed 500 mW. For the output stage  analog amp, past methods include allowing a large current flow  only at the instant when the current of the constant current  source of the loaded driver stage source follower charges and  discharges its load, or raising the output to the power source  voltage and then driving it only in the direction taken by the  analog amp drive current. The former does not lower power  consumption sufficiently, and with the latter drive time is  shortened, and a large current is stored in the panel when a  large load capacitance is raised to the power source voltage.  Therefore, we lowered power consumption by employing a  pseudo-push/pull operation by combining an analog amp to handle  the drive current during buildup and another analog amp to  handle the drive current during trail off.    In terms of accuracy, we encountered particular difficulty  in  constructing the high-voltage CMOS. The bonding depth of the  offset layers required for high voltage tends to deviate due to  heat dispersion. Therefore, the channel length formed between  two offset layers also tends to deviate, which often results in  V[.sub]T[/] deviation. The offset deviation in the CMOS  differential amp is dependent on V[.sub]T[/] deviation, so  this results in an offset deviation of several tens of mV. We  attempted to reduce V[.sub]T[/] deviation without lowering  the withstand voltage by reducing this thermal hysteresis as  much as possible to increase the accuracy of the high-voltage  CMOS analog circuit.    C. S/H Circuit    Analog drivers require a high speed, high accuracy S/H  circuit. Generally, the S/H circuits used with analog drivers  are basic, non-feedback S/H circuits consisting of an analog  switch and a hold capacitor. They are simple circuits in which  high speeds can be easily obtained without increasing chip size.  This type of S/H circuit corrects the feed-through voltage of  the analog switch, which is the cause of error voltage, with a  dummy switch half the width of the analog switch gate. In  principle, however, this does not provide sufficient correction,  and with a high-voltage CMOS the gm is low, so we  must not only increase the channel width, but it is also  extremely difficult to obtain high speed and high accuracy  because the gate voltage is so large. To solve these problems we  have reduced the surface area of the high-voltage CMOS gate and  lowered the feed-through voltage to obtain the same  gm by improving our consolidation process  (high-voltage CMOS) described above.    D. Analog Input Chip Selection    In the past the analog input capacity of an analog driver  has  been about 1 pF/pin, but with the EWS we have 1280 pF, and there  is a heavy burden on the peripheral circuits, so it is very  difficult to convey a high-speed, accurate analog signal to the  LSI driver. Because it is impossible to realize a high-speed,  high accuracy, high-voltage CMOS analog amp, we could not place  the analog amp in the analog input area, and input capacitance  of the output S/H circuit appears in the analog input. We have  reduced the analog input capacitance to 100 pF when ten drivers  (192 output) are used by setting ON only the analog input of the  chip that performs sampling, and by using analog input chip  selection functions.  <H5>  Future Trends in LSI Drivers </H5>   We can expect the 64 level 5 V digital driver that uses  0.8-1.5 m CMOS technology to bring about a diversification  of  the TFT-LCD through drive methods such as common inverse drive.  However, when we make drivers more accurate, and make larger,  more accurate TFT-LCDs, the peripheral circuit power will  increase even if the TFT-LCDs themselves consume less power. We  can manage to reduce the load on the peripheral circuits when we  make high-voltage CMOS 64 level digital drivers that consume  less power, and we can do this by improving the consolidation  process (improving processes that reduce the causes of  high-voltage CMOS deviations) and improving the circuitry.    We can expect wide use of analog drivers as well in  applications that utilize analog input and theoretical full  color properties; for example, in television, in the full color  EWS, and in analog interfaces that require CRT compatibility.  There is a report of a 5 V LSI driver that incorporates a  high-speed amp for analog input and uses 5 V miniature process  analog technology.[.sup]6[/] This greatly reduces the  capacitance of analog input. Right now the mainstream number for  driver output is 192, but in the future we can expect S-VGA  applications with an output of 240 and a slimming down in the  external dimensions of the driver.    The key points in using LSI drivers are the power  consumption  of the total system and the cost. Therefore, depending on the  application we can expect system optimization that chooses  between digital and analog drivers and between high-voltage LSI  drivers and 5 V LSI drivers.

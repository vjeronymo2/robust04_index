			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following the withdrawal of the Serb aggressor's  artillery from Sarajevo, Alija Izetbegovic, president of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, gave a statement for Sarajevo TV.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I believe this is a great  victory for us. Perhaps it is not a completely clear victory,  it is not faultless, some things have spoiled our joy a bit.  But it still remains our victory for we are not being killed  any more. You can let your children skate freely, they can go  to school, you can go to the market without fear that someone  will not return home. This is a great achievement after 22 or  23 months of misery.    This is not their victory, as they want to present it. They  have even convinced themselves, 500 or 600 years ago when they  lost their state [in 1389, the Serbs were defeated by the Turks  in the Kosovo battle] that that was their victory, and not a  defeat. This is their clear defeat.    For eight days they had been hesitating to withdraw their  weapons, they were making up some kinds of reasons, from  categorical refusing to different pretexts -- snow, adverse  weather conditions, and so on. In two days only they were  forced to take to a headlong flight, leaving behind weaponry in  their retreat. Do not let yourselves be convinced that this is  a victory for them as they are now trying to convince themselves  in those hills up there. They left behind -- handed in -- 262  pieces of heavy weaponry, including 36 tanks and armored  vehicles.    I think that this is our victory and a first step, first in  a  series of good things that are going to happen to this city.  Electricity and water supply will be better, food supplies will  be better, convoys carrying food and medicines will enter more  safely, a kind of spring is coming. Therefore, please celebrate  this victory and do not be afraid any longer. Of course, we are  not going to allow the city to be divided. We must not be  afraid of that either. This is a political solution. They are  no longer there with their tanks and their guns above our heads.</p>

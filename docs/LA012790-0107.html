			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOMINGO ILL; MUSIC CENTER SWITCHES OPERAS  </P> <P> Less than three months before the scheduled opening of the L.A. Music Center  Opera production of "Queen of Spades," the company has announced that the  Tchaikovsky opera will be replaced by Verdi's "Don Carlo," on the same dates in  April.  </P> <P> The late switch marks the first time that the 4-year-old company has changed  productions on such short notice. Generally, opera productions are planned  three years in advance.  </P> <P> In a statement prepared before he flew to the East Coast for a meeting, Peter  Hemmings, general director of the company, announced Friday that the change was  made due to the recent illness of Placido Domingo.  </P> <P> The Spanish tenor, who was scheduled to sing the role of Ghermann in "Queen of  Spades," has recently been suffering from influenza and was unable to prepare  for the role, Hemmings said.  </P> <P> Instead, Domingo has asked to sing the title role in "Don Carlo," one of his  better-known roles. Hemmings said that Domingo hopes to perform in the  Tchaikovsky opera at a later date.  </P> <P> The "Don Carlo" production, borrowed from the Lyric Opera of Chicago, will be  conducted by Yuri Simonov, who was scheduled to conduct "Queen of Spades."  Soprano Natalia Troitskaya, who also was scheduled to appear in "Queen of  Spades," will sing the role of Elisabetta in "Don Carlo," which will be given  in Verdi's four-act Italian version with English supertitles. Domingo took the  title role in Chicago.  </P> <P> The role of Eboli will be sung by Nina Terentieva, a member of the Bolshoi  Opera who made her Vienna Opera debut in 1987 as Azucena in "Il Trovatore," and  her North American debut as Eboli with Canadian Opera.  </P> <P> In his U.S. debut, Soviet basso Barseg Tumayan, will sing the role of King  Philip.  </P> <P> Repeating her Chicago assignment will be stage director Sonja Frisell. Sets are  by Gianni Quaranta and costumes by Dada Saligeri, the team responsible for the  new Metropolitan Opera production of "Aida.".  </P> <P> A spokesman said the company hopes to schedule "Queen of Spades," which was a  co-production with La Scala, Milan, in a subsequent season.  </P> <P> Patrons holding tickets for "Queen of Spades" who do not wish to attend "Don  Carlo" may mail their tickets to Ticket Services, L.A. Opera, 135 N. Grand  Ave., Los Angeles 90012, for refunds.  </P> <P> Performance dates and times remain the same: April 20, 22, 25 and 28, all at 8  p.m.  </P></p>

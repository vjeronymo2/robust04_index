			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Reporter Yu Huiyin (7411 6540 7299)] </F>   [Text] In 1933, the output of 10 types of nonferrous metals  commonly used in China totalled 3.26 million tons, an increase  of almost 10 percent over production for the previous year, and  met its original quota of 3 million tons set for 1995 two years  ahead of time. What is more outstanding is the fact that this  was accomplished in face of organizational restructuring and a  close to 10 percent reduction in the work force that was  diverted.    The annual output of nonferrous metals in China grew from  an annual output of 13,000 tons during the early years of the  Liberation to almost a million tons annual output within 30  years to reach its first step. During the next ten years, from  nearly a million tons annual output, the industry grew at an  annual rate of 7.5 percent to reach the second step marked by an  annual output of 2 million tons. From the second step to the  third step of 3 million tons annual output, the industry only  took five years, growing at an annual rate of 10 percent. Not  only did production show rapid growth, the supply of ore  resources also continued to be structurally adjusted in  accordance with market demand. When market demand was great, the  output of aluminum (an abundant resource in China) rose from its  already great proportional share of 31.2 percent of the  nonferrous metals produced on the second step level to 38  percent. Growth of its absolute output was so great that it had  reached 1.22 million tons per annum. As the international market  looked encouraging, the output of zinc, which is also assured in  China, also rose from its proportional share of total output,  from 20 percent to 23 percent.    China's nonferrous industry, as a "traditional" industry  has the disadvantage of being a single industry utilizing too  many workers. Last year the head office for the nonferrous  industry diverted the work force in a move to reform the inner  structure of enterprises by changing their mode of operation  throughout the whole system to increase productivity. They  obtained good results. According to statistics from last year's  annual report on worker wages, the number of workers in the  system under the head office in 1993 was fewer than the number  for 1992 by more than 70,000, but productivity was increased by  11.5 percent. Income per capita, after adjustment for inflation  on goods sold, rose 7.85 percent over the previous year's figure.    After some study and discussion, the Xinan [Southwest]  Aluminum Processing Plant separated 12 production subsidiaries  and service units from itself. Reorganized and given a social  orientation, these units were economic entities that served the  plant at the same time. This move separated 2,473 persons from  the parent plant. At another group of large enterprises  including the Tongling Co., the Yunxi Co., the Guizhou Aluminum  Plant, the Shenyang Ore Refining Plant, the Daqing Bureau of  Mines, the Jiangxi Copper Company, the Lanzhou Aluminum Plant  etc., work force diversion and new enterprise creation were  coordinated, whereby the separated workers developed new kinds  of start-up business entities. According to statistics from the  838 economic entities completely separated from their parent  companies, income from their operations last year grossed 2.7  billion yuan, of which 100.8 million yuan was realized interest  tax, and 90 million yuan was net profit.</p>

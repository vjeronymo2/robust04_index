			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 16 ITAR-TASS -- "The president is  resolutely supporting the Central Bank of Russia as the single  federal body the regulation of which is Moscow's exclusive  prerogative," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA writes today. "It is not only  that local authorities have been trying to command Central Bank  subsidiaries on their territories. The president's approach is  dealing the final blow to the smoldering plans for turning the  Bank of Russia into something resembling the U.S. Federal  Reserve system with characteristically high autonomy of the  regional banks within the system, plans resolutely opposed by  the present leadership of the Central Bank".    The same newspaper carries an interview with Colonel-General  Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the first deputy chief of the External  Intelligence Service, who stresses that "as concerns the  composition of the world's top league of intelligence services  and the place different services occupy in it, we have always  been in that league and, I would like to believe, we shall  always remain in it. I am sure that should the personnel of our  rival services be placed in the conditions in which the Russian  Intelligence Service now finds itself, many would not be able to  cope. While ours are serving and will continue to serve".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an open appeal of Russian and  foreign specialists to the president, government and Federal  Assembly of the Russian Federation, which reads, "Russia has  three key sources of its unique potential for effective  development and a sure place among the world's leading nations.  First of all, the country has immense reserves of  fuel-and-energy and mineral resources, fertile land and other  natural riches. Russia's per capita resource potential is twice  that of the United States, six times that of Germany and 18-20  times that of Japan. Secondly, Russia has a unique potential in  its army of highly-qualified specialists and scientists capable  of solving the most complex problems in the field of science,  technology and production. And at last thirdly, it has a mighty  production base which is second to none in a number of fields.  Nonetheless, a striking contrast exists between the country's  colossal potential for prosperity and the bleak reality.  Regrettably, Russia's economic potential has been used not to  ensure its prosperity but to pay the cost of abortive economic  experiments".    Commenting on the situation in Tajikistan the same newspaper  says "eighteen months have elapsed since the end of open civil  war in Tajikistan. But the triumph of "anti-Islamists" has  brought about no long-awaited stability to the republic. There  is no single Tajikistan any more. The republic is divided into  dwarfish semi- feudal states with their regional armies and  leaders. Incidentally it is not the traditional strongholds of  the opposition which are the greatest danger to Dushanbe but the  regions where the advent of the new power was greeted with  enthusiasm in the not so recent past".    NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA centers around the situation on  the Korean peninsula: "It is quite possible that the story about  the North Korean nuclear potential is another political bluff.  When the winner bluffs people tend to believe him. If the  bluff is eventually called, the loss will be relatively painless  for one side, but the nerves of the less fortunate partners,  already strained in the course of the game, might snap, and then  more and more faulty moves are likely to be made".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comment on the same situation: "In the  opinion of the majority of the countries no state can be granted  "a special status" under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as  sought after by North Korea. This is most important not only  for nuclear security on the Korean peninsula but also for non-  proliferation in the whole world, because precedent might be  created which will tempt other states which wish to join the  nuclear club".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA reports that "the presidential staff  and  the security council are thinking about a merger of the Federal  Counter- Intelligence Service and the Main Directorate of Guards  of the Russian Federation. If the merger takes place, the new  service will probably be headed by Mikhail Barsukov who is now  chief of the directorate. FCS Chief Sergey Stepashin is likely  to be appointed first deputy".    According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "the leadership of Georgia  believe that the beginning of Russia's peacekeeping operation  in Abkhazia will accelerate the settlement of the conflict in  the region. That Russia's politicians and military have taken  up the settlement of the conflict is, in their opinion, a sing  of Russia's peace-making potential for resolving conflicts on  the territory of the former Soviet Union".    SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA publishes an interview with Army General  Valentin Varennikov who refused to be amnestied for his role in  the August 1991 putsch and demanded a new trial. The general  said in the interview: "I understand that the authorities do not  need the trial, they would rather have me agree to the amnesty.  On the other hand since I put up a resistance, they undoubtedly  feel like teaching me a lesson and demonstrate that all other  members of the GKCHP (the State Committee for State Emergency  which planned the abortive coup) are guilty. I do not rule out  such a turn of events. But I still hope that we have people  capable of doing justice impartially, on the basis of law".    PRAVDA reports that "while in Irkutsk Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn  condemned Communism, the Soviet era and the changes now underway  in the country. He said "Gorbachev destroyed the system that  was, but it should not have been destroyed. It should have been  revivified very slowly from below - beginning with the  distribution of plots of land, with the organisation of small  workshops and retail outlets". The writer added that "reforms  are proceeding without a plan. The deregulation of the prices  is robbery, privatisation is playing into the hands of  criminals, and it should be dealt with by prosecutors and  investigators. We now have oligarchy and not democracy".  Solzhenitsyn was also skeptical about the Civic Concord  agreement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 22 (XINHUA) -- The China Great  Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC) will launch two high-powered  direct broadcast satellites for the United States' Echostar  Satellite Corporation.    A contract was signed between the two sides here today.    The two satellites are expected to be placed in orbit over  119 degrees west longitude. The launch of Echostar 1 is slated  for late summer of 1995 and of Echostar 2, for mid-1996. Both  satellites will be sent into space from the Xichang satellite  launch center on China's 2-stage Long March 2e carrier rocket.  CGWIC will also supply Echostar with a solid motor (epkm)  [expansion unknown] for each launch.    Charlie Ergen, chairman of Echostar, said that the satellite  manufacturer, Martin Marietta, anticipates receiving required  satellite export licenses in the near future.    Ergen said that a major reason for Echostar's choosing to  work with CGWIC is that the Long March 2e rocket can ensure a  minimum life of 17 years for the satellites, a term which can  not be provided by many Western space companies. In addition,  CGWIC's competitive price, sincere cooperative spirit and  experiences in successfully launching overseas satellites were  also important considerations in making the decision.    Echostar 1 and 2 are Martin Marietta Astro Space Series 7000  satellites, both with 16 transponders. Their successful launch  would enable Echostar to provide over one hundred channels of  video, audio and data communications services accessible to  virtually every single-family household in the continental  United States utilizing an 18-inch satellite dish.    Echostar's home receiver and antenna systems will  incorporate  digital compression technology with the potential to deliver  programming including sports, popular cable services,  pay-per-view movies, databases, educational services and hdtv  [high definition television].    At today's contract-signing ceremony, Vice President of  CGWIC  Liu Zhixiong said that in the next two years CGWIC will launch  six overseas satellites. Starting from 1996, CGWIC will launch  Echostar 2 and a series of iridium satellites for Motorola. At  present a number of foreign satellite companies are negotiating  satellite launch arrangements with CGWIC.</p>

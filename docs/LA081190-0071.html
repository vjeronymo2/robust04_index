			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CHARGERS NOW FIND OUT: SHOULD HE STAY, OR SHOULD HE GO?  </P> <P> The Chargers open their four-game exhibition season tonight against the Dallas  Cowboys with a simple mandate: Find out who can play and who can't.  </P> <P> If the philosophy sounds basic, it is. But it isn't easy.  </P> <P> Talent evaluation is a tricky part of NFL life, and with 80 players still in  camp, this is the time of year it can be most complicated.  </P> <P> And it could be particularly so for the Chargers, a team with more new faces  than most. In addition to the usual collection of free agents, many of whom  were originally brought in as little more than warm bodies to fill out training  camp practices, there are quite a few more expensive newcomers.  </P> <P> Primary among these are the team's nine veteran Plan B free agents, plus 16  draft choices out of a class of 17, largest in the NFL.  </P> <P> These are the players to which the Chargers will be paying careful attention in  the exhibition against the Cowboys beginning at 7 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium.  </P> <P> "We've determined that of the new players, there are some people we really feel  have a chance to make this team and be productive for us," Coach Dan Henning  said. "We're not going to evaluate the guys in this game on what they think  they can do, or what we think they can do. We're going to evaluate them on what  they do.  </P> <P> "You pick them for potential, but you play them by performance. That is the  only way you can tell."  </P> <P> The best way is in a game. And after three weeks of practice, including  controlled scrimmages against the Rams and Phoenix Cardinals, that is what the  Chargers will do tonight against a team that is coming off a 1-15 season, the  Cowboys' worst since they were 0-11-1 in their debut year of 1960.  </P> <P> That led to a talent turnover that rivaled any in the league. The Cowboys were  the most active NFL team in the Plan B market, signing 15 players. They also  tried to boost their offense in the draft, taking running back Emmitt Smith of  Florida in the first round and wide receiver Alexander Wright of Auburn in the  second. The only problem now is that both are unsigned and will not play.  </P> <P> The Cowboys do have quarterback Troy Aikman, back for his second high-paid  season and saying he is more comfortable than last year.  </P> <P> "Last year, everyone was more curious about what was going to happen," Aikman  said. "This year, I can just go out and be myself."  </P> <P> The Chargers are looking for much the same from Billy Joe Tolliver, their  second-year quarterback.  </P> <P> Tolliver had a rough time last week in the scrimmage against the Cardinals,  throwing two interceptions. This game will continue his NFL education. While  Henning is using the game to evaluate several new players, he also is laying  groundwork for the season opener against the Cowboys in Dallas Sept. 9. Maybe  nowhere is this more important than at quarterback, where the Chargers consider  themselves talented, but where they clearly are inexperienced.  </P> <P> Tolliver will be making only his seventh NFL start of any kind. But even that  little bit of game action almost qualifies him as seasoned veteran compared to  his backups.  </P> <P> Tolliver will be followed by Mark Vlasic, who played in only three games in his  first three seasons and missed last year because of knee surgery, and John  Friesz, a sixth-round draft choice from Idaho making his debut in live NFL  contact situation.  </P> <P> Henning said Tolliver will take about half the snaps, with Vlasic and Friesz  splitting the other half. That does not necessarily mean Tolliver will not play  in the second half, Henning said.  </P> <P> "What if we get only five snaps in the second quarter?" he asked.  </P> <P> Presumably, Tolliver then would also play after halftime. Henning has left that  option open. There are a number of other things he wants to see tonight as  well.  </P> <P> It's that time of year.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> The game will shown in San Diego on a taped basis on Ch. 10 at 3 p.m. Sunday.  The radio broadcast will be live on XTRA-AM (690). . . . Tight end Andy Parker  has two loose teeth and 12 stitches in his lip as the result of an altercation  in Thursday's practice with linebacker Cedric Figaro on a punt coverage drill  and will not play, Coach Dan Henning said. Henning said he expected also to  hold out tight end Arthur Cox (back) and that running back Ronnie Harmon  (dislocated finger), H-back Joe Caravello (coming back from knee surgery),  defensive end Burt Grossman (shoulder) and nose tackle Joe Phillips (knee)  likely will play sparingly. Sure to be missing are linebackers Leslie O'Neal  and Junior Seau, the team's two remaining contract holdouts. . . . Fuad Reveiz  and John Carney will alternate kicking duties, and John Kidd and Keith English  will trade off the punting, Henning said. . . . Henning on wide receiver Nate  Lewis, a seventh-round draft choice from Oregon Tech: "Nate practiced better  against Phoenix than he played in the scrimmage (last week). That has got to be  reversed. Not to the point where I want him to practice poorly, but the object  is to play well in the game." . . . The Cowboys will stay on in San Diego for  joint practices with Chargers Monday and Tuesday at UC San Diego.  </P></p>

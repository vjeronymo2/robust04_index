			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Burden falls mainly on the affluent A PROMINENT feature of President Clinton's economic plan was a set of 'burden' tables showing that affluent families will bear the lion's share of tax increases. Families with taxable incomes of Dollars 140,000 or more will face a new top income tax rate of 36 per cent, against 31 per cent under President Bush. A 10 per cent surcharge will be applied to taxable incomes in excess of Dollars 250,000, resulting in an effective top marginal rate of almost 40 per cent. These measures are expected to raise an extra Dollars 27.7bn in fiscal 1994 (which begins this September) and a total of Dollars 126.3bn by fiscal 1998. Officials said the new 36 per cent band would apply only to the top 1-2 per cent of taxpayers; 85 per cent of those affected by the surcharge would have assets in excess of Dollars 1m, making it effectively a levy on millionaires. Affluent families will be hit by a range of other 'fairness' measures. Employee and employer contributions towards Medicare, the federal scheme for the elderly, will be levied on all earnings, rather than only earnings up to a limit of Dollars 135,000 a year. This will raise Dollars 2.7bn next fiscal year and a total of Dollars 29.2bn by fiscal 1998. Executive pay in excess of Dollars 1m a year will no longer be tax deductible. And only 50 per cent, rather than 80 per cent of the cost of business meals and entertainment, will be tax deductible under the plan. These measures will raise nearly Dollars 17bn by fiscal 1998. The affluent elderly will also have to pay higher taxes on their social security (federal pension) benefits. If enacted such measures will have a significant impact on the distribution of the US tax burden. For families with annual incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more federal taxes as a percentage of pre-tax incomes will rise 2.9 percentage points to 23.8 per cent. For families with incomes of Dollars 100,000 a year or more, the ratio will rise 0.9 points to 21.8 per cent. For the poorest families, with incomes of Dollars 10,000 or less, federal taxes will decline 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of pre-tax incomes to 7.6 per cent. Increases for families with incomes of Dollars 30,000 or less will be negligible. If the impact of spending changes, which favour low- income groups, is taken into account the plan is skewed even more decisively in favour of poor families. If nothing else Mr Clinton could yesterday claim to have delivered on his campaign promise to reverse the fiscal policies of the 1980s which had favoured affluent Americans.</p>

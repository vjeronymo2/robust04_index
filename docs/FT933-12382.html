			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The worst result for the Tories: Defeat in yesterday's vote and in a subsequent election could have healed the Conservative party The best thing that could have happened to the Conservative party yesterday would have been a defeat for the government on its confidence motion. A general election would have followed, and the Tories would have enjoyed the glorious, healing relief of a period of opposition. We can be sure of that. Britain's present administration is exceedingly unpopular, not least among its own supporters. It is hard to find a Conservative who respects the abilities of ministers; too easy to find many who express a fair contempt for the prime minister. Most of the evidence is anecdotal, but it does appear that everyone is fed up with the Tories. There is no discernible difference according to age or gender. As to social grouping, there is an apparent bias towards extreme anger among houseowners, pensioners and members of the aspirant working classes who previously supported the Conservatives. Many such people feel that they were hoodwinked by the promises made during the election of April 1992. We saw the effect of their fury at the recent Newbury by-election, and may witness it again in Christchurch on Thursday. This is not to say that the country would be better governed by Labour or a Lab-Lib coalition. As matters stand, the judicious answer to such a suggestion is 'probably not'. But the readiness or otherwise of the Labour party for government and the quality of Mr John Smith's leadership are distant topics, to be properly discussed when a real election is called. Perhaps the Labour leader will have wrestled the trade unions to the ground by then, and we may all look upon his party in a different light. Possibly Mr Paddy Ashdown will come to resemble a viable Liberal Democratic prime minister-in waiting. There is always time for miracles. We must wait. The matter at issue this weekend is the state of the Conservative and Unionist party, the one that has governed Britain since 1979. Its condition is, frankly, appalling. Its leader's performance is erratic. He moves in fits and starts, at times skilfully, too often with the clumsiness of the apprentice. When Mr John Major took over in November 1990, his administration was amateurish. He could hardly be blamed for that: even his best friends would agree that he was promoted too soon, after too short a preparation for the highest office. The prime minister, his staff, and his close colleagues have learnt much since then, but it would be stretching kindness to say that Downing Street has become the home of a smoothly oiled machine, tended by professionals who always know what they are doing. This is a consequence of extended rule by a single party. The Conservative revolution initiated in 1979 by the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher was a natural, necessary response to the Labour and trade union excesses of the late 1970s, but it had completed most of its useful work by 1987. Victory in the election of that year turned the heads of the politicians of the time. Puffed-up and proud, they thought that they could do anything; blinded by success, some of them imagined that Britain was greater than the continent of which it is an offshore archipelago. It is customary at this stage of what is becoming a familiar rehearsal of recent events to say 'Europe destroyed so-and-so, and so-and-so'. This is true, but only on the surface. Factors other than quarrels over Europe played their part in curtailing the periods in office of the principal cabinet ministers of the 1980s. Divisions over what was being demanded of the United Kingdom by the European Community certainly existed. The late Nicholas Ridley was obliged to resign following his outburst of anti-German vituperation. Lord Lawson's chancellorship was blighted by his disagreement with the prime minister over the shadowing of the D-Mark. Lord Howe resigned over Lady Thatcher's anti-European rhetoric and, in an uncharacteristically lethal burst of rhetoric of his own, brought down the lady herself soon afterwards. Historians may take a broader view. Europe has usually been the proximate cause, but it is a constant. It has been a divisive force in British politics for 40 years. Its power to destroy waxes and wanes, influenced in part by what is happening on the continent, in part by the state of our island polity, and in part by the skill with which it is handled. Europe nearly destroyed the Labour party under Lord Wilson, and probably completed the job under Mr Michael Foot. Sir Edward Heath has still not been forgiven by the unrepentant xenophobes of his own party for heading the Conservative government that secured Britain's membership of the then European common market. Yet it was not Europe, but his own decision to resign that ended Lord Wilson's career, and it was the coalminers who toppled Sir Edward. It is at least arguable that Lady Thatcher brought her downfall on herself by persisting with the poll tax; without that issue, she might have survived Europe. If Mr Major falls, the divisions within his party over ratification of the Maastricht treaty will be only one element in the explanation. The harsher truth is that, since his election last April, he has come to be perceived - fairly or otherwise - as not up to his job. If he is sacked, then that, not Europe, or his small majority, or the late start of the recovery from recession, will be the explanation. The negative effect on public opinion of internecine strife should not, however, be underestimated. 'Damn your principles,' said Disraeli, 'stick to your party.' When Conservatives heed this celebrated advice they usually survive; when they ignore it, they lose. All Tories know this. Their famous history is burned in their memories. As any schoolchild should be able to remind us, they split over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. In consequence, they became the natural party of opposition to the Liberals, a fate from which they did not properly recover for the next 30 years. In 1904-05 they fell apart again, over tariff reform. Once again they paid the penalty. At the 1906 general election they lost what had been a majority of 135, to face a Liberal majority of 129. British voters expect their parties to be united. They cannot tolerate division. In 1886 the Liberals broke up over Irish home rule; their unionist faction joined the Conservatives, who held office for all but three of the following 20 years. We have all seen what happened to the Labour party following the departure of leading right-wingers and pro-Europeans to form the now defunct Social Democratic party. The bar-room perception of the Conservatives today is that they are led by a bunch of clowns, each attempting to throw custard pie in the faces of the others. Yesterday the lesser clowns turned and ran. It was not a question of damning their principles, or sticking to their party. They chose, most of them, to save their own skins, to stick to the seats in the Commons some of them might have lost had Mr Major been forced to call an election. The spectacle will not have enhanced the image of the Conservative party in the eyes of the electorate. You could make a case - the foreign secretary made it in the Commons yesterday - to the effect that by the end of the summer all of the above will seem like a distant memory. The pressure for European integration is at least temporarily in abeyance; if the Belgian president of the EC tries to push the federalist cause, a British prime minister can only benefit politically if he slaps the perpetrator of such an impertinence around. The exchange rate mechanism may collapse; fears voiced by Eurosceptics and others that Britain would eventually enter a monetary union would be stilled, at least for a few years. Meanwhile the government would promote 'British' strategies for the construction of the Europe of the next century  -subsidiarity, an inter-governmental structure, enlargement, a reduction in the bureaucratic aspirations of the Commission. At the same time the economy really seems to be in recovery, if the recent run of positive indicators is not again deceiving us. The government knows what is required. Let people start feeling the jingle of disposable cash in their pockets. Reduce the aching worry over who is next to be made redundant, or who is unemployed. Stop the fall in house prices or, better still, resume a period of increases. Address the pressing non-economic problems on people's minds, most notably the perception that the Home Office is not doing enough to combat crime. When all this is done, the argument runs, Conservative voters will start returning to the fold. I wonder. On paper the optimist's expectations outlined above could make sense, but a lot depends on the ability of the government in general and the prime minister in particular to find fresh sources of energy, new founts of inspiration. For once an electorate has it in its head that an administration is exhausted, devoid of new ideas, at the end of its natural life the view that it is time for a change begins to take deep root. That is why the Tories would benefit from a period of opposition, one in which they can refresh both their intellectual well-springs and their leadership. The other, lesser, option is to attempt renovation while still in office. That is the curse of their victory yesterday. The gang of four who run the cabinet will be of varying utility in any rejuvenatory endeavour. The most outstanding, Mr Douglas Hurd, is nearing the end of his span as foreign secretary. He is the only one of the four who could reasonably expect to reach so high an office in an A-grade ministry. He may be around at the next election, but few expect him to be in office after that. The newest, Mr Michael Howard, has yet to prove himself as home secretary. He is clever, but he does not inspire confidence, even among the right-wingers who like what they fancy are his opinions. We know now what the prime minister is made of; he showed yesterday that he has the courage to risk everything, at least when the alternative is to lose everything. Perhaps fate will assist him to develop that side of his character. The ablest politician of the four is the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. If political skill were all, the party could recover some support under his leadership. If Mr Major does not engender a political recovery, Mr Clarke's moment will come.</p>

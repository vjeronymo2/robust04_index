			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Prison conditions attacked THE CONTINUED failure to improve conditions in jails was condemned by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, in his annual report published yesterday. He highlighted overcrowding, lack of training for prison officers, lack of investment, the concentration of prisoners' meals and recreation within the short working day, the failure to end slopping out, and delays in dealing with complaints. Judge Tumim said: 'Many of the criticisms levelled in my report have been made before and it is disappointing to find so little real improvement in the quality of life for most prisoners.' He added: 'The prison service is committed to programmes to provide all prisoners with ready access to sanitation and to improve standards in prison kitchens. This money is well spent but it does not address the problem of the lack of facilities for out-of-cell activity in many establishments.' Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, accepted that prisoners should not have to live in 'overcrowded and squalid conditions' but made no commitment to deal with the specific issues raised by Judge Tumim. He pointed to the prison building programme, which will provide 11,000 new places by 1994 at a cost of Pounds 1.2bn.</p>

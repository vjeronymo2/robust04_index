			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi, April 26 (AFP) -- Workers at a private  clothing firm struck last week in the southern province of Song  Be, the area most affected by labor unrest in Vietnam, the trade  union newspaper Lao Dong said Tuesday.    Some 150 workers from the Song Be Garment Export Co. stopped  work for two hours Thursday in favor of overtime payments and  the lowering of production levels required by management.    Company director Le Thi Bich Ngoc, rejected the strikers'  demands, saying they could resign if they felt they were unable  to meet the production demands.    The strikers plan to stop work again by the end of the week  if their demands were not met.    The latest strike followed similar action earlier this month  by 2,500 workers at the state-run peanut firm Thanh Le against  working conditions and low salaries.    Labor unrest in southern Vietnam has increased in recent  months, particularly in companies controlled by foreign firms.    Vietnam plans to adopt a labor code in May in which the  right  to strike is to be defined for the first time.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: A tough task of blending the chemicals - Rationalisation lies ahead for Evode LAPORTE, the UK's second largest quoted chemical company, appears to be paying a stiff price for Evode, the chemicals and plastics concern. The company, led by its ebullient chief executive, Mr Ken Minton, will be stumping up Pounds 129.4m to acquire Evode's shares, debt instruments and debt. That is some Pounds 16.2m more than the sum proposed by Wassall, the mini-conglomerate that was contesting a hostile bid for Evode. When it comes to bidding for companies Mr Chris Miller, Wassall's chief executive, says he always sticks to the rule laid down by his former boss Lord Hanson, the eponymous chairman: write down the maximum price you are willing to pay for a company before bidding and then put it away. Mr Miller, while declining to reveal what his maximum price may have been for Evode, says: 'Laporte's recommended offer slipped past it quite easily.' Mr Minton promises the deal will not dilute Laporte's earnings during the first 12 months following the acquisition's completion. He claims the target, even without an economic recovery, should not prove demanding. Disposals will not be needed to achieve its aim, he adds. But analysts believe the purchase is likely to stretch Laporte's management skills. Its borrowings will rise significantly. It is inheriting Pounds 41.9m debt from Evode and Pounds 17m from Silo, the Italian acquisition it announced yesterday. The group will also have to spend Pounds 28m in paying off Evode's unlisted US redeemable preference shareholders. Gearing, however, will remain just under 40 per cent because of the issuing of 37.6m new shares (15.4m in the placing and open offer and 22.2m in the share swap). Evode made pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.2m last year on turnover of Pounds 271m - not a particularly distinguished set of results, admits Mr Minton. The aim will be to improve margins from the existing 3.8 per cent. Laporte's margins are about 14.2 per cent. The margin improvement will partly be driven by cost savings, according to Mr Minton. Mr Minton believes Evode's businesses can be managed more effectively. 'We can make money by being ruthlessly efficient and adding technology,' he explains. Laporte is no stranger to rationalisation, says Mr Minton. He points out that over the last two years the number of sites in the European absorbents business has been reduced from five to three, saving Pounds 6m. Meanwhile, the number of worldwide locations manufacturing construction chemicals has been cut from 26 to 14, saving Pounds 2.5m. Two of Evode's businesses - adhesives and sealants operations and the polymer compounding subsidiaries - are viewed as core by Mr Minton. These represent about 67 per cent of Evode's continuing turnover of about Pounds 240m and will be integrated into Laporte. Evode's adhesives and sealants operations with sales of Pounds 81m will be integrated with Laporte's construction division. The US specialty polymer compound businesses, involved in flame retardant wires, medical and beverage plastics and footwear, are high margin operations, says Mr Minton. The Italian subsidiary is efficient, but Evode Plastics in the UK needs to be rationalised and moved into higher margin areas. The whole division has a turnover of Pounds 85.1m. The bulk of rationalisation will fall on Evode's three other business areas  -plastics fabrication, powder coatings and a grouping of other businesses. Mr Minton says these contain some good subsidiaries and some that need dealing with. In plastics fabrication businesses - generating annual sales of Pounds 22.4m  -the US and Italian companies are fine, as is Chamberlain Plastics in the UK, according to Mr Minton. However, the weaker companies, Evode Clearex, making injection and reaction moulding chemicals, and Rushden Granulating, manufacturer of rubber granules, require refocusing and rationalisation. Mr Minton says he is open-minded about the powder coatings businesses which generate annual sales of Pounds 19.4m. Margins are not sufficient and the subsidiaries have to cope with large competitors such as Imperial Chemical Industries and Courtaulds. There are also problems with the German operations. The fifth and final grouping of Evode companies does not make sense, says Mr Minton. CP Coatings, a UK subsidiary making vinyl wallpaper base, and Sterling Coatings, another UK company manufacturer of resin insulators, are profitable but non-core. In spite of Mr Minton's plans, analysts remain to be convinced that Laporte's move makes sense either strategically or financially. Whether Laporte's chief executive is right will only be finally decided in March 1994, a year after the group takes control of Evode.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Praia, 18 Apr (AFP) -- Dissidents of Cape Verde's  ruling Movement for Democracy [MPD] today announced the  formation of a new political party that will be led by former  Justice and Labor Minister Eurico Monteiro and former Foreign  Minister Jorge Carlo Fonseca. The membership of the new party,  whose name was not disclosed, is drawn from the MPD, the ruling  party since January 1991 when the first free parliamentary  elections were held in Cape Verde to end 17 years of one-party  rule.    Dissension within the MPD led by Prime Minister Carlos Veiga  was first noted in late 1993 when the Cape Verdian ambassador to  Portugal was retained in office in spite of accusations of  diverting government funds to personal use. Monteiro, Fonseca,  and Health Minister Rui Figuiredo resigned over the issue thus  forcing a cabinet reshuffle on 4 March.    The prime minister was reelected MPD chairman on 21 February  which brought about the resignation of several senior officers  including Mr. Monteiro, the party's former second in command.  The MPD has 56 seats in the National Assembly as against 22 for  the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde the former  single ruling party.</p>

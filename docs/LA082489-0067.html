			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Palm Trees Galore  </P> <P> Yes, there are a lot of palm trees on Sherman Way in Van Nuys, Reseda and  Canoga Park. More than 1,000 of them grace the thoroughfare from Van Nuys  Boulevard to Valley Circle Boulevard, according to Duane Gute Sr.,  superintendent of Los Angeles' Street Tree Division. And most of them, he  believes, were planted about 1911.  </P> <P> It's quite possible that those palm trees -- California fan palms, Mexican fan  palms, date palms and queen palms -- will be around longer than we will since  they sometimes live to be more than 100 years old. There's documentation that  some trees have lived more than 188 years. "We have some in the city that are  about 150 years old," Gute said.  </P> <P> Except for replacements, the city is not too keen anymore on planting its  signature trees, some of which can grow to be more than 100 feet tall. "If you  have a uniform street of palm trees and one dies, we'll replace it with another  one -- a smaller one, of course," Gute said. "But generally there are a lot of  problems with palm trees. They grow into overhead wires and there's seed-pod  droppage. A citizen walks on it and slips and falls on the sidewalk. . . ."  </P> <P> You get the picture.  </P> <P> Quick: What's a Carhop?  </P> <P> Opening your own restaurant entails solving a lot of problems, but Tim Shpall  of Sun Valley encountered one that threatens the basic gimmick of his new  eatery.  </P> <P> "My place is called Cadillac Jack's and it's a '50s drive-in," the 40-year-old  entrepreneur said. "We have carhops but there's a diner inside too. What I find  very odd is that no one takes advantage of the carhops. It's like nobody under  the age of 35 even knows what a carhop is."  </P> <P> Shpall had to make a business decision. He cut back the carhop service to  weekends only. "I used to have two girls standing out there just looking at  each other twiddling their thumbs," he said. "As soon as it starts to catch on,  we'll do it again on a regular basis."  </P> <P> Located on San Fernando Road in Sun Valley, the hot-pink restaurant has a 1955  Cadillac parked out in front. Shpall put $10,000 worth of neon lighting on the  exterior. Inside he made light fixtures out of old hubcaps.  </P> <P> Perhaps there was a foreshadowing of his problem when Shpall had trouble even  finding the car trays. "I called every restaurant equipment wholesaler in Los  Angeles and after they quit laughing at me, they said no, they didn't have  them. I found out, though, that the original company that made them is still in  business in Dallas," he recalled.  </P> <P> When Shpall is in need of solace, he retreats to his office in the back of the  restaurant. Its walls are covered with posters of Elvis, Elvira and Alf. "Why  not surround yourself with the three greatest minds in American culture?" he  said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Trendy Business  </P> <P> If you're thinking about getting into the stretch limousine business, forget  it. Ditto for tanning salons, yogurt shops and fitness centers. "Those markets  are saturated," said Ted Walters, assistant vice president for the Money Store  Investment Corp. in Encino, a U. S. Small Business Administration lender.  </P> <P> Southern California trends frequently translate into entrepreneurial  opportunities, but like a summer tan, the trends fade after a while. Small  business lenders in the San Fernando Valley have yet to notice a Southern  California-type trend that might replace the ones mentioned above.  </P> <P> "We're going through a lull now," Walters said. "We went through a real  creative period in small business start-ups, but then the market leveled out  for a while."  </P> <P> So what other type of small businesses are growing these days? "The  communications industry is increasing, like stores that sell cellular phones or  fax machines," noted Arthur Sweet, president of Val-Ven California BIDCO  (Business Industrial Development Co.) in North Hollywood, another SBA lender.  </P> <P> Dorothy Walker, vice president of Industrial Bank in Van Nuys, added that the  video production industry is also doing quite well.  </P> <P> Pet Project  </P> <P> Pettpourri is still her hobby -- not her job -- but it's taking up more of  Andrea Pett's time these days. "I started putting out my newsletter last summer  after I graduated from UCLA because I had no more schoolwork to do and I wanted  to keep busy," recalled Pett, 23, of Tarzana. "And I've always loved animals."  </P> <P> Pett was working at an office in which she was the unofficial expert on animal  issues. "The ladies would ask me where to take their dog to get spayed, or what  to do about a certain problem, and finally I said, 'Why don't I write this all  down for you?' "  </P> <P> Using her home computer to create simple graphics, she wrote her first  newsletter, focusing on local animal organizations and clinics. She distributed  the newsletter free of charge to vets, groomers, pet supply stores, friends and  relatives. People loved it. She now has more than 1,000 names on her mailing  list.  </P> <P> The newsletter has expanded. A column called "Animal Kingdom Notes" alerts  readers to international animal rights issues. Other columns list free programs  and services for pet owners, and there's an events calendar.  </P> <P> The fourth issue comes out next month. It's still free, although Pett has  accepted a few advertisers to help defray mailing costs. (She sends any surplus  advertising money to animal organizations. Between them, Pett and her sister,  Cynthia Pett, belong to about 30.)  </P> <P> Pett owns two dogs and three cats. "With the last name Pett, it's kind of hard  not to like animals," Pett said.  </P> <P> To receive the newsletter, send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to  Pettpourri, 5907 Cahill Ave., Tarzana 91356.  </P> <P> Overheard at . . . .  </P> <P> "He talks a lot now but English is still his second language." -- Father  referring to his 2-year-old's gibberish at Jerry's Deli in Encino  </P></p>

Let us recall that the GKI's previous  attempts to establish a new state program ended with the program  being recalled for further work while the GKI ultimately issued  a statement on the extension of the operation of the old 1992  state program for a further three years.    The GKI has several reasons for wanting the program to be  adopted right now. The main one is the desire to avoid a  detailed examination in the new parliament which would end in an  as yet unknown way. The document is being put into operation by  a president's edict. It is characteristic that its draft lacked  the point, traditional for the president's October and November  decrees, according to which the document should be examined and  approved by the Duma. But in the end it was decided not to  bypass article three of the law on privatization, in accordance  with which the state program is put into operation by parliament.    One of the document's clauses is extremely curious, banning  the use of procedures for re-registering debts on which state  enterprises have defaulted as bills of exchange and circulating  these bills on the secondary market in securities. In practice  that means one thing: The opportunity for demanding the payment  of debts from state enterprises is closed. As a result sooner  or later the need will arise for another reciprocal setting off  of debts. By defending its own property from being dragged  apart in accordance with bill of exchange commitments, the GKI  is in fact creating a situation in which no one is responsible  for state enterprises' debts: neither the state nor the state  enterprise itself.    The government session particularly criticized the benefits  for investment funds (and that is tax legislation, not  privatization legislation), procedures for the participation of  foreign investors, and also the need to adopt a state program  "for just half a year," that is until the voucher's term runs  out. Although changing the privatization concept at a moment  when the population has already used 80 percent of the vouchers  is quite obviously already impossible.    Despite the fact that the state program provisions have been  worked through, individual "underwater rocks" could prove too  sharp. One of them is the privatization of uncompleted  construction projects. This point is internally contradictory  and provides unjustified benefits for the enterprise personnel  and does not coincide with this question's interpretation by the  recent Russian Federation Supreme Arbitration Court plenum.    The program also contains points which allow an expanded  interpretation and which go beyond the framework of  privatization legislation. But the program's main feature lies  elsewhere. Without declaring new slogans, the new document fully  confirms the thesis that within the framework of the current  privatization there has been an internal substitution of its  aims which has gone almost unnoticed. Instead of the "free"  issue of state property to citizens proclaimed at the start, a  different aim has emerged -- the speediest removal of vouchers  from circulation and the retention of the maximum proportion of  unprivatized property under GKI patronage. To judge by Ye.  Gaydar's speech at the government session, the subsequent  scenario looks like this: The actual concept of privatization  will change and the rights of labor collectives will be  substantially curtailed.    By the end of the vouchers' term no more than one third of  state property will have transferred to private hands. Although  110 million vouchers have already been put to use. In this  connection serious doubts are strengthening that each voucher  will be worth one 160 millionth of Russia's property.    In that sense the indexing of vouchers looks very  attractive.  But it looks as though it is possible only on paper as, indeed,  is the indexing of fixed production capital. But for some  reason the latter is being carried out for the second time in  the past 18 months. Yet the indexing of vouchers has become  something like a banned topic. In fact only enterprises'  working capital is being privatized for vouchers now, that is  the proportion of fixed capital at 1987 prices is becoming  insignificantly small in the structure of the property of any  enterprise. They can be spared this either by a decision of the  GKI on indexing the voucher or by an analogous GKI decision on  bringing working capital into line with 1987 prices through  reverse inflation indexing. Either measure would fill the  voucher with real values and not inflationary working capital.    To all appearances the SKI will not make up its mind to do  that. The reasons are understandable. By leaving the "sweet  course" for dessert it is reliably ensuring itself work for many  years to come.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Foreign banks accept US curbs European and Japanese banks appear to be ready to drop their opposition to controversial restrictions on foreign-owned banks in US legislation designed to remove barriers stopping banks in the US from opening branches outside their home states. Interstate branching legislation has passed both houses of Congress, but the Senate version of the bill would restrict foreign banks from opening new branches in the US unless they operate through a separately incorporated subsidiary. The US treasury, the European Commission and some House members have argued this would breach the principle of national treatment by imposing more restrictions on foreign banks than on their US counterparts, and could rebound against US banks seeking to operate abroad. In Europe, for example, US banks may open a branch directly in all EU countries without setting up a subsidiary. But most international banks appear to have concluded that the practical consequences of the restrictions would be small, and they have not been pressing their finance ministries to intervene actively in the dispute. Many banks have also decided they would rather undergo these limited restrictions than engage in an all-out fight that could strengthen calls in the Senate for foreign bank branches to be subjected to the requirements of deposit insurance and of the Community Reinvestment Act. This requires banks to lend a certain proportion of their resources to deprived areas. Foreign banks that wish to set up a branch network in the US have usually chosen to do so by buying a US subsidiary. Senate concern is driven by evidence that foreign banks have been able to increase their market share in the US because they do not bear the costs of deposit insurance and CRA compliance.</p>

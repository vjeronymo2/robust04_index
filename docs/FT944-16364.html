			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: MIM plans to sell its shares in Asarco MIM Holdings, the Australian metals producer, is continuing its divestment of non-core assets with the announcement that it plans to sell its 10.35m shares - a 24.8 per cent stake - in Asarco, the US mining company, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. MIM said Asarco was filing a universal shelf registration statement covering the issue of up to USDollars 300m in equity and debt securities with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. MIM had requested that its Asarco stock be included in this filing. Asarco shares have been trading recently at around USDollars 33 on the New York stock exchange, valuing MIM's stake at ADollars 342m (USDollars 252m). MIM said completion of Asarco's registration process would enable MIM to sell some or all of its stock.</p>

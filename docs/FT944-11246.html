			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (3): Grants are the remedy for region's needs - Regeneration needs public funding Seen from Brussels, the West Midlands is one of the poorer regions of the European Union. Viewed from Whitehall, its gross domestic product falls below the UK average, and its inner cities register some of the worst poverty in the country. These are uncomfortable facts that detract from the messages put out by the promoters that the region is the manufacturing heart of Britain, which has attracted substantial inward investment and whose principal city, Birmingham, sells itself as the meeting place of Europe. Both claims can be substantiated. Yet to assume that all of the region is rundown and its people poor would be erroneous. It is increasingly urban - or rather, suburban - with pockets of wealth in those parts of the shire counties that are within commuting distance of the conurbation. On the other hand, the extremities of these counties (except Warwickshire) have recently been designated by the European Commission as rural areas in need of development (Objective 5b). Coming back into the centre, the unemployment blight in Birmingham and Wolverhampton was acknowledged by the government, which gave them development-area status. What all this will add up to in terms of regeneration and the region's economy will depend largely on the response of the private sector. The Department of Trade and Industry is encouraged that grant approvals are running at a higher level than last year (136, against 91). Grant money adds up to Pounds 21.3m so far in 1994-5, compared with Pounds 14.1m for the same period of 1993-4. Recovery in the manufacturing sector explains some of the increase in demand. The new development-area status also seems particularly to have caught the eye of Birmingham business. Jaguar Cars easily tops the list for the size of grant approved in the region. The two plants - Castle Bromwich in Birmingham, and Browns Lane in Coventry - will share Pounds 9.4m towards upgrading facilities to produce the X100. The fact that the Birmingham plant could qualify for the higher rate of assistance helped to win the project for Britain against international competition, and to secure it in the West Midlands against Ford (Jaguar's owner) plants in other parts of the country, according to the DTI. The grant was approved because it would safeguard jobs rather than create new ones. Regeneration of the old industrial and inner-city areas is also closely linked to the response of the private sector - developers, manufacturers and service producers. Most of the government's programmes have been brought under the umbrella of the Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) since the start of the current financial year. The whole region, however, is eligible to apply. Bids submitted this autumn are now being assessed. If all of the bids were successful, some Pounds 40m would be paid out. Considering that the total SRB for England is Pounds 100m, there will have to be some scaling-down of expectations. As government spending gets tighter, Brussels is the real honey-pot for the region's needs. Much of the older, urban section of the region has been retained as eligible for European Regional Development Fund support (Objective 2). (Telford and Stoke-on-Trent were not deemed to be in need any longer). The three-year allocation, to December 1996, for these areas is Pounds 287m. Redundant coalfield areas scattered around the region have also qualified for European money, to assist development and training. The European Commission's aim is to help the poorer regions of the EU to come closer to the average regional profile. So it wanted a plan not just for bits and pieces of the West Midlands, but for the region overall. In the absence of any regional government institutions such as exist in Germany, France and Italy, the West Midlands Regional Forum of Local Authorities pulled together the plethora of ideas and programmes into a coherent overview of the region's needs until the end of the decade. The progress of the current Brussels round marks the end of the so-called integrated operations programmes, which tended to favour industrial cities and sub-regions. Birmingham, which did well from the structural funds to support its city-centre renewal programme, expects to find it tougher in the current session. Consequently the government's City Pride exercise, which Birmingham, Manchester and London are competing for, is all the more important. It is not clear, however, whether Whitehall intends to fund City Pride from the Single Regeneration Budget, in which case these cities could lose other funding. European money has to be matched by funds from other sources. With local government capital spending severely constrained, Brussels increasingly supports projects where the other part of the funds come from urban development corporations, such as City Challenge. The aim of these bodies is to maximise the Euro-content by putting together schemes which incorporate support from the European Social Fund - for training largely - and other European sources. Brussels' support for alternative economic development in the more marginal rural areas in the West Midlands totals Pounds 32m, which puts it among the most successful bids in the more developed members of the EU, and is substantially complemented by the government's rural development area programme. Money can also be applied for to help add value to agricultural products. The Brussels pot might yield a little extra for the inner cities, and the region is also pushing to be included on the list of areas whose rail networks might qualify for extra help.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Metropolitan authorities - Revenue Support Grant (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1990-91   1991-92   1992-93   1993-94   1994-95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham             394.4     424.8     555.5     544.9     538.8 Coventry                84.8      82.1     127.4     123.4     123.7 Dudley                  42.2      39.7      81.6      77.5      87.9 Sandwell                84.9      84.7     128.9     127.4     129.2 Solihull                31.3      27.4      55.8      45.4      48.0 Walsall                 64.6      59.0      94.9      96.5     110.9 Wolverhampton           82.9      87.8     122.9     121.7     114.4 West Midlands Police  Authority                 -         -         -      68.0      76.4 West Midlands Fire and  CD Authority              -         -         -      35.6      36.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                  785.1     805.4   1,166.9   1,240.6   1,265.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Government Office, West Midlands  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

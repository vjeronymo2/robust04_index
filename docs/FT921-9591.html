			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Government releases a salary surge: Recommendations of the public-sector pay review bodies - Pressures building up over wages SOME TIME this year average gross weekly earnings in the public sector - now Pounds 283 - are expected to overtake those in the private sector (Pounds 285). This will happen in one of the periodic surges in public-sector pay. Yesterday's decision by the government to grant the pay-review body recommendations in full, no doubt mindful of the imminence of polling day, will not act as a brake on that surge. The recommended increases, effective from April 1 - for the armed forces, nurses, doctors, professions allied to medicine and teachers - average nearly 6.5 per cent, with the teachers on 7.5 per cent pushing up that average. The four pay-review bodies cover about 1.5m workers or 30 per cent of public-sector employees. Nearly half the public sector's 5m workers are covered by review bodies or special comparability deals, which look at average earnings over the preceding 12 months and thus tend to boost public-sector pay when inflation is falling fast, as it has been recently. The result, according to Mr Chris Trinder of the Public Finance Foundation, the research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, is that the rise in public-sector pay was 2 1/2 percentage points above private-sector pay increases in 1991-92 and will be at least one percentage point above the private sector and three percentage points above inflation this year. Mr Trinder believes that the relatively generous awards of the pay-review bodies are helping to create a 'two-tier' public sector with a growing gap between the privileged pay-review groups and others, such as local-government workers, who still bargain in the normal way. However, this year's pay-review settlement may help to pull up other public-sector workers to increases of at least 5 per cent. The non-industrial civil servants still have a private-sector comparability system, which will probably give them about 5.5 per cent. As manufacturing industry tries to hold down pay in order to stay competitive within the European exchange rate mechanism, there are other pressures that are likely to keep public-sector pay high over the next couple of years The pay-review bodies will not start pushing on performance-related pay for doctors, nurses and teachers until next year. But the various attempts to introduce more flexibility into public-sector pay will, in the medium-term, increase earnings and not reduce them. The Top Salaries Review Body recommendations, postponed until after the election, are almost certain to propose enormous catch-up rises for top civil servants, judges and generals which will seep down to lower levels. Large private-sector employers, which are now agreeing rises of less than 5 per cent, will not thank the government for yesterday's decisions.</p>

All economic and trade commissions and departments,  foreign trade bureaus, and relevant units should abide by the  requirements of this ministry on halting the infringement of  trademark rights; act in light of local conditions in their own  localities and units; organize relevant export enterprises, and  especially the leaders of these enterprises, to study  conscientiously the circulars of the State Council and the  Supreme People's Court on dealing relentless blows to the  production and sale of fake commodities; and enhance their legal  awareness of trademarks.    2. All economic and trade commissions and departments,  foreign trade bureaus, chambers of commerce, and head offices  should take responsibility and organize export enterprises in  their own localities or under their industries and trades to  conduct overall inspections of the possible manufacture and sale  of commodities using already-registered trademarks (including  accepting trademarks designated by foreign clients). Immediate  action must be taken to redress errors as soon as they are  uncovered.    3. No foreign trade enterprise is allowed to make use  of sales promotion activities -- such as trade fairs,  advertisements, and propaganda activities of any kind -- to  provide conveniences to factories engaged in the production of  counterfeit goods, including purchasing, exhibiting,  publicizing, and acting as agents for export commodities bearing  trademarks registered by others.    4. All localities should regard the use of trademarks  as part of their appraisal of the accomplishments of foreign  trade enterprises and their leaders. Enterprises that have  seriously violated trademark rules and regulations in their  daily operations will be deprived of their right to participate  in the annual appraisal and selection of outstanding enterprises.    5. All economic and trade commissions and departments,  foreign trade bureaus, chambers of import and export trade, and  head offices should report to this ministry promptly any case in  which an export enterprise is punished by judicial or industrial  and commercial departments for manufacturing and selling  commodities using the registered trademarks of others, as well  as for other law-breaking activities concerning trademarks.    6. Once export enterprises holding export permits are  certified guilty of producing and selling quota-administered  commodities using trademarks registered by others, MOFERT will  notify the relevant permit-issuing departments to suspend the  issuance of export and quota permits to such enterprises.  According to the seriousness of each case, this ministry will  suspend or annul the enterprise's autonomy in the export of  relevant commodities, or even terminate its right to handle  imports and exports.    It is a long-term task to eliminate counterfeit commodities  and halt trademark infringement. All economic and trade  administrative departments, as well as all relevant units,  should adopt feasible measures, work in close coordination with  the departments in charge, reinforce efforts to supervise and  guide export enterprises, and halt counterfeiting and  law-breaking activities in foreign trade according to the law.  This ministry will investigate and affix the responsibility on  leaders of competent administrative departments for failure to  take effective measures, for serious dereliction of duty, for  repeated infringements of rights, and for other serious problems.    [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade    8 September 1992</p>

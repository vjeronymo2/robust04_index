			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (1): Sluggish economy raises concerns - It is ironic that democracy and diplomacy are blossoming in South Korea when the state of the economy is provoking a crisis of confidence about the nation's future South Koreans, who celebrate the 45th anniversary of their republic this year, have arrived at a unique moment in their nation's long history. After centuries of unbroken authoritarian government on the Korean peninsula, the southern half has suddenly developed into a vibrant democracy that is one of the most liberal in Asia. Mr Kim Young-sam, who was elected last December as the first civilian president in more than 30 years, appears determined to complete the country's transition to democracy that began with the downfall of the military dictatorship in 1987. During his first three months in office, Mr Kim has laid a stable foundation for political reform by making government more accessible and accountable to the public. He has curbed the power of the military and once-feared intelligence agency and imposed firm civilian control over them. More importantly, an anti-corruption campaign has been launched to remove the culture of 'money politics' that pervades government and society and enriched those at the top. Revelations about bribery among senior government officials, military officers, university administrators, bank presidents and corporate executives have become the daily fare of the country's unfettered media. What is happening now in South Korea has parallels to the current political upheaval in Italy and Japan, but with one key difference. While lowly Italian and Japanese prosecutors have been the chief agents in exposing political scandals, the anti-corruption campaign in South Korea is being led from the president's office with little apparent regard to who it affects, whether friend or foe. In contrast to the changes sweeping through the Korean establishment, the streets of Seoul have become quiet after years of anti-government student demonstrations. It is one sign that the new administration has gained widespread public confidence. In foreign policy, South Korea has also gained respect among the regional powers that tried to dominate the peninsula during the past century and often made the Koreans feel they were mere pawns in great power politics. As South Koreans prepare next month to mark the 40th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Korean War, they note with satisfaction that the last year has seen them being wooed by China and Russia, the two countries that supported North Korea's invasion of the South in 1950. Beijing established diplomatic relations with Seoul last August in what was a setback for Pyongyang, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin paid a visit to South Korea in November during which he declared that Moscow would no longer militarily support North Korea. South Korea's democratic progress and its new stature as a regional power reflects its economic success. The rise of an affluent educated middle-class, with per capita income having more than doubled from Dollars 3,110 to Dollars 6,800 in the past five years, has promoted political stability. The potential that South Korea offers as a source of foreign investment is a key reason why China and Russia have developed ties with Seoul. It is ironic then that democracy and diplomacy are blossoming when the state of the economy is provoking a crisis of confidence about the nation's future. Last year's GNP growth rate of 4.7 per cent, although enviable by present global standards, was the country's poorest economic performance since 1980 when Korea was reeling from the twin shocks of President Park Chung-hee's assassination and the rise in Opec oil prices. The sluggish economy has raised concerns about whether Korea can regain its position as one of most dynamic nations in Asia. Although outsiders may dismiss such fears as exaggerated, the economic performance is troubling for Koreans, who grew accustomed to double-digit growth during the mid-1980s. Moreover, the country is once again wrestling with its traditional problems of high inflation and current account deficits after appearing to solve them five years ago. These developments coincide with growing competition from the low-wage countries of south-east Asia and China, which have grabbed market share from Korean manufacturers as their labour costs have risen to the highest level on the Asian mainland in the past five years. It is one reason why Korea has slipped from 11th to 13th place in the global ranking of export nations since 1990, with Korean officials predicting that the country will drop to 14th place this year. The economic challenges confronting Mr Kim's administration are formidable. Not only must Korea return to balanced economic growth, but it also needs to introduce important structural changes to improve its international competitiveness. Korea needs, for example, to spend more on research and development if it is to become an advanced industrial nation. Total corporate R&amp;D spending in 1992 amounted to Won2,228bn (Pounds 1.78bn), less than what is spent on research by General Motors or IBM. Instead of pursuing research, most Korean companies prefer to invest their earnings in automating their production facilities as wages grow or to speculate in the property and stock markets in order to raise cash and service their huge debt burdens. Foreign companies are cautious about transferring technology because of Korea's weak protection of intellectual property. Foreign investment in Korea is another source of technology, but foreign investment is declining and disinvestments are growing. Financial liberalisation will help solve these problems. The country's antiquated and state-controlled financial system has led to the inefficient allocation of capital to industry, which is hindering economic development. A deregulated capital market would eventually lower financial costs and improve corporate balance sheets, allowing companies to pursue such long-term goals as research. But financial liberalisation will only be achieved through reform of the bureaucracy and politics. Officials have resisted giving up control of the financial system because it is one of the most important centralised powers the government still retains. State control of the economy has amounted to a giant patronage system, with companies making contributions to politicians and bureaucrats in return for economic favours. Mr Kim's anti-corruption campaign is meant to weaken bureaucratic resistance to change. But reform will not be easy because the bureaucracy has always played a strong autocratic role in Korea's Confucian society. The battle for democracy has now shifted from establishing a fair electoral system to diluting bureaucratic power. One 'wild card' factor that could derail Mr Kim's reform programme is North Korea. Few Koreans believe that Pyongyang's confrontation with the international community over nuclear inspections will lead to war. But if the issue is not resolved soon, the UN could impose economic sanctions on North Korea, which could eventually cause its struggling economy to collapse. Seoul fears that possibility almost as much as war because South Korea would have to divert massive resources to reconstructing North Korea and consequently delay its own vital restructuring of industry.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Indians key into the market for software - High-skill, low-cost engineers are getting better but there are still hurdles AN ENGINEER at Infosys, an Indian software group, presses a computer key in Bangalore, south India, and his machine connects directly with the computer centre of the Holiday Inn hotel chain 12,000 miles away in the US. Infosys is supplying Holiday Inn with hotel reservation software. Its other customers include General Electric of the US and Reebok, the British-owned sports shoe maker, which have bought sales management programs, and Digital Electric, the US computer company, which ordered software to control a fleet of 15,000 sales vehicles. Thanks to satellite technology, engineers in Bangalore can communicate almost instantaneously with counterparts in the US, Europe and Japan. Software exports are pouring out of India in ever-increasing volumes, as more multinationals take advantage of the high-skill low-cost engineers who are one of India's biggest competitive advantages. 'India is already a great influence on the world software market,' says Mr Michael Klein, head of the Indian operations of IBM, the US computer group. 'They are getting better all the time. If they continue to get better they will become unbeatable for the next 10 or 20 years.' India must overcome many hurdles, if it is to fulfil Mr Klein's prediction. Its phone and transport networks are inadequate and red tape still hinders business activities despite economic liberalisation in recent years. Violence after destruction of the Ayodhya mosque has also disturbed some foreign companies' plans. Moreover, there is tough competition from other low-cost software exporters, including east Asian and east European countries. But many foreign high-tech companies believe India's engineers are hard to beat because they speak English, the language of international high-tech trade, and are trained at some of the best universities in the developing world. According to a World Bank-funded report, average monthly wages for programmers in India are just Dollars 225 (Pounds 158) compared with Dollars 600 in Singapore and Dollars 2,500 in the US. India is starting from a low base, with less than 1 per cent of world software output. Indian software engineers estimate they have a sizeable 12 per cent share of developing countries' software exports. Exports are expected to reach Dollars 225m in the year to June 1993 and are growing at an annual rate of 30-40 per cent. Moreover, success in software is beginning to encourage improvements in the quality of domestically produced hardware, potentially also a significant export. Foreign companies have held back from investing in India, not least because of the painful experience of IBM, which quit the country in the mid-1970s in a row with the government over ownership of its Indian subsidiary. But the economic liberalisation that started in the mid-1980s and that gathered pace when Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched reforms in 1991, has persuaded multinational companies to reconsider India. Texas Instruments, the microchip maker, which opened a software centre in 1986, was one of the first to invest. Motorola, Digital Equipment and Intel have followed. IBM, because of its past experience, has been one of the later arrivals. It signed a joint venture with Tata, the industrial conglomerate, last year. This month it opened an office block in Bangalore and launched three ranges of computer on to the Indian market. Mr Richard Gall, managing director of the Indian subsidiary of Texas Instruments, says: 'India is now a critical part of our design capability.' Indian-controlled exporters are also winning increasingly complex orders. Tata Consultancy Services, a Tata group software house and the biggest exporter, is capable of 'studying' client businesses and 'helping' to design 'one-off' systems. So is Infosys, which is opening marketing offices this year in Boston, San Francisco and Paris and next year in Dallas and Chicago. Indian companies believe they are more likely to succeed in producing customised packages than in competing in the market for packaged software, which requires far more marketing muscle in developed countries than they can afford. Foreign buyers are far more cautious about purchasing Indian hardware. The partnerships struck so far between multinationals and Indian computer companies generally involve the export of software. In return, the foreign group supplies the Indian partner with brand-name computers and/or kits for sale in India but not for export to other countries. This helps foreign companies enter the Indian market and Indian groups to sell top-quality machines. However, the domestic industry is still protected by high import tariffs, which restrict sales growth by keeping prices high - above Dollars 2,000 for a basic personal computer. Only 110,000 computers were sold in India last year, split among over 20 manufacturers, giving little scope for large-scale cost-efficient production. Mr Dick Heimlich, corporate vice president of Motorola, the American electronics group, says: 'The problem isn't quality standards but costs, which can be three times higher than in the US.' Given enough support and a big export order, some Indian hardware suppliers may make the grade. Dell Computers of the US, the personal computer maker, has placed an order for the assembly of printed circuit boards with PCL, a leading Indian manufacturer, for no less than Dollars 50m. 'That's a breakthrough. It means they can reach critical mass,' says Mr Gall of Texas Instruments. But others have yet to follow Dell. Mr Klein at IBM believes it will take time for Indian companies to meet the company's quality standards. He plans to start by purchasing low-technology items such as cables and transformers. For the next few years at least, fortune is likely to favour software producers. This should work to India's advantage, since software sales are expected to grow faster than hardware revenues in the global computer industry. Moreover, some engineers believe that innovations in software will increasingly lead hardware development in the future. As Motorola's Mr Heimlich says: 'The industry is evolving in India's favour.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           INDIAN SOFTWARE EXPORTS IN Dollars m (years to June)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986-87    1987-88    1988-89    1989-90   1990-91   1991-92   1992-93*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   39          52         67        100       128      179        225*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *1992-93 figure projected.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source (Indian) National Association of Software and Service Companies.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

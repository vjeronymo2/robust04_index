			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Halifax launches first FFr offering Halifax Building Society yesterday launched its debut offering in the French franc market, following a series of investor presentations in Paris last week. Although the Halifax is now the best-rated financial institution in the UK, building societies have often fared poorly with overseas investors because they are perceived as rather parochial entities. However, the success of the Abbey National, which has become one of the most active borrowers in the international markets since its conversion to bank status, has inspired other societies to step up their marketing efforts with international investors in an attempt to reduce wholesale funding costs. A Halifax treasury official described the deal as 'part of a consistent process to establish a presence on the world's principal markets'. The seven-year offering of 8 per cent bonds was priced to yield 28 basis points over the comparable OAT, a level which dealers said was aggressive, relative to deals by better-known French borrowers. However, there is currently a dearth of paper in the French market, particularly at current coupon levels. The lack of new issues is partly due to poor swap opportunities. However, the Halifax deal was swapped into floating-rate sterling at a level slightly higher than the society normally pays for borrowings under its medium-term note programme, an official said. Joint lead manager SBC estimated that around half the deal was placed overseas and half in France. In the D-Mark sector, KFW, the German development agency, launched a DM1bn offering, which successfully reopened the 10-year sector after a five-month lull. Priced to yield 25 basis points over the 10-year bund, dealers said the spread was sufficiently attractive to appeal to both international and domestic investors, unlike a number of recent D-Mark offerings, which were too aggressive compared with paper available in the domestic market. Joint lead manager JP Morgan reported a 50/50 split. The spread held steady at 25 basis points, after the syndicate broke. In the dollar sector, two banks launched fixed-rate deals, while three banks launched floating-rate transactions. Among the floating-rate deals, the Bank of Melbourne brought an initial Dollars 250m offering of floating-rate notes, bearing interest of 25 basis points over three-month Libor.</p>

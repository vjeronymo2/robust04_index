			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "IMF: Fazio Calls For Budget, </F> Fiscal Severity"]    [Text] (ANSA) Washington, April 25 -- Rigorous budget  policy severity over the medium term along with action on the  monetary front will be required to "reassure the financial  markets" and to reach the goals of "lower long-term interest  rates and opening new expectations of non-inflationary growth,"  said Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio.    Addressing the annual spring meeting of the International  Monetary Fund here he also called for fiscal discipline among  the industrialized nations and declared, "The markets need  signals to confirm the fact that the increase in American rates  will not stop the decline in European rates."    "We are called on to act in a non-inflationary way, and not  only through monetary policy, to bring down the cost of capital  in real terms," the central banker continued. "Medium-term  fiscal recovery must, therefore, continue for the objective of  stimulating and strengthening savings and stabilizing  expectations."    Fazio said the industrialized nations must also pursue "wage  moderation, which prevents the risk of inflationary pressures."    Providing a run-down of developments in basic economic  policy  in Italy following the devaluation of the lira, the governor  touched on wage dynamics brought under control, discipline on  the monetary and budget fronts and public sector reform, all of  which have led to "important progress in reducing inflation and  improving the balance of payments." "This strategy can be  strengthened and carried further forward in the context of  recovery in the economic cycle which is now beginning to  materialize," he added.    Citing the figures, Fazio said the balance of current  accounts in Italy moved from 2.3 percent of GDP in 1992 to a  surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP the following year. The surplus,  he said, "should be significantly larger in 1994."    On another issue here, Bank of Italy Director General  Lamberto Dini said increases in rates and instability on  international bond markets "are not consistent with the  favorable scenario on the inflation front."    At a meeting of the Group of Ten, Dini reviewed recent  events  on the bond markets and the highly-speculative hedge funds which  came to influence the course of bonds and their yields.    Earlier, the director general told a press conference that,  "At the end of 1993, a certain euphoria dominated the market  because of the expectation of lower short-term interest rates in  Europe and long-term rates in the United States. Then a series  of events, beginning with the first small increase in February  in FED fund rates in the United States, caused a strong shift in  the expectations of dealers, a change which was perhaps  excessive compared to the fundamentals of the economies," he  noted. "In fact, we have witnessed the phenomenon of  overshooting which caused this rise in long-term rates."    A communique issued at the end of the Group of Ten meeting  said, "Ministers and governments have agreed on the fact that  despite the presence of sharp price movements in the prices of  securities, the financial markets have worked well and have  managed the increase in the volume of transactions without  systematic problems and tensions."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Ermakov, deputy of the Supreme Council </F> of the Crimean republic, by A. Baranov; place and date not  given: "It Is Still Gloomy in Crimea"]    [Text] A local constitution and parliament already exist on  the Crimean peninsula, and there is also a president. The  election of the president, however, is only half the issue.  While daisies bloom in Alupka a session of the "main"  parliament, lacking a speaker, is working out a new political  course.    Ivan Ermakov, a deputy of the Supreme Council of the Crimean  republic, is our interlocutor.    [Baranov] Ivan Fedosovich, elections indicated that the  great  majority of Crimeans are pro-Russian. Does it seem to you that  Mr. Meshkov won a very perilous victory and should the Crimean  parliament allow for the president with a speaker more familiar  to Kiev?    [Ermakov] The experience of numerous elections of recent  years indicated that we are still not so much living with  democracy as playing at it. Candidates, making fantastic  promises, are playing, and the voters are also playing, forcing  themselves to believe the obvious fantasies.    In a month or so neither the one elected nor, surprisingly  enough, the voters themselves recall those election campaign  promises. I feel confident that Crimeans voted not so much for  the person or his position as in opposition to the official  course. As far as the "president-speaker" line is concerned, it  is impossible to push through a convenient figure in our  parliament. If Kiev wants to affect the state of affairs in  Crimea, it is necessary to sharply change the position with  respect to the republic, fulfilling numerous promises and taking  decisive steps to expand economic rights of the region--right up  to the creation of a free economic zone on the peninsula    [Baranov] What do you believe would be the advantages and  disadvantages of Crimea having two currencies in circulation?    [Ermakov] Until a decision is made regarding a free economic  zone in the Crimean region it is difficult for me to imagine a  mechanism involving circulation of two currencies. If the SEZ  (Free Economic Zone] is created, however, then the advantages  are self-evident. That is indicated by international experience.    [Baranov] There is a lot of talk in Moscow about the desire  of the Russian community in Crimea to take part in the political  life of Russia. Is that really so?    [Ermakov] So far there have been too many problems within  Crimea because of which that is hardly possible today. But the  desire is an understandable one and I share it.    [Baranov] Will the citizens of Crimea be able to obtain dual  citizenship?    [Ermakov] This topic was included in practically all of the  election campaigns, including my own. An issue that important  should not be put off. But neither the president of Crimea nor  parliament have plans concerning secession from Ukraine,  particularly in the light of economic disintegration, collapse  of the financial system, and in the long-term, possibly the loss  of statehood. We shall see what new members of the Ukrainian  parliament will say--I am hoping for common sense.    [Baranov] Speaking of common sense. Is resumption of work on  the construction of the Crimean Atomic Electric Power Station  possible?    [Ermakov] The probability of that is low: first of all,  everything has long ago been pilfered, and, secondly, it is  necessary to return to the numerous expert reviews and determine  whether it was emotion or real miscalculations by designers that  did not permit the completion of this construction project. My  view is that atomic electric power stations should not be built  in Crimea. That would be a sin. Particularly since we have  completely unique natural conditions for creation of  ecologically pure sources of energy such as solar power stations.    [Baranov] What should Crimeans and Russian vacationers  expect  from the opening of a national bank and a currency exchange  market this year? Crimean coupons?    [Ermakov] Because of the absence of a printing facility  there  can be no talk of a local currency. One should likewise not  expect any radical improvement with the resolution of questions  of financial health, but the problem with cash, credit, and  foreign currency accounts will be eased. A true solution lies in  the extension of statehood or the creation of a SEZ    [Baranov] Who will the Crimean customs service be  protecting?  The vacationers?    [Ermakov] So far talk about a customs service is limited to  rumors.    [Baranov] What if a "Russian Crimea" movement should appear  tomorrow in Russia, or, in the manner of Aksenov, some "ideas  concerning a common fate," what would the attitude be toward  that in Crimea?    [Ermakov] Like every normal person, I would welcome any  movement in Russia, as well as in Belarus or Kazakhstan, which  could benefit the people of Crimea with its multi-national  population.</p>

Terminal Four and roads around the airport were  reopened during the night.    Some early morning flights were cancelled and others  diverted  before the terminal was opened. People inquiring about British  Airways arrivals were advised to ring 081 759 2525.    A statement from the airport said: "Due to the closure of  one  runway, delays are likely on other inbound and outbound flights."    "Passengers can be assured that this morning's incident is  being contained within Terminal Four and that their safety  remains a top priority."    It said the airport usually used only one runway during the  night. The southern runway was being used from 10.30pm last  night.    The last plane to take off was at 11.25pm -- 35 minutes  before the incident.    The last plane to land was a mail flight which touched down  on the northern runway at 00.34am.    The latest incident follows a warning by Sinn Fein president  Gerry Adams yesterday that there could be another attack like  Wednesday's IRA strike on the airport, when four mortar bombs  were fired from a vehicles in a car park at the Excelsior Hotel,  on the Heathrow's northern border.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / FT Review of Business Books (10): Enigma of the Reichmanns remains - Property / Vanessa Houlder finds no new insights in an account of the O&amp;Y saga Too Big to Fail by Walter Stewart McClelland &amp; Stewart, Pounds 15.95 335 pages In essence, the story of Olympia &amp; York's rise and fall is an all-too-familiar account of how an ambitious company can be brought to the brink of bankruptcy by the reckless pursuit of growth. But it gains an extra dimension from the enigmatic personality of the three Reichmann brothers who founded, managed and owned the company. The Reichmanns built up one of the world's largest property empires with a style that set them apart from brasher, pushier developers. They won a name for honesty, privacy, and discretion that matched their reputation for innovation, farsightedness and daring. But once O&amp;Y buckled under the burden of its Pounds 7bn debt in 1992, the Reichmanns' name and reputation were tarnished. Frustrated creditors felt they had been misled by the brothers once they discovered the true state of their empire. A disappointing aspect of Stewart's book is that he never assesses the extent to which the Reichmanns' reputation for ethical business dealings was deserved. Instead, he is sympathetic to the point of sycophancy. 'O&amp;Y are wonderful managers, superior builders, and all-around worthwhile people,' he says in the prologue. Stewart's sympathy for the Reichmanns did not open doors. He admits that he met 'an unbroken wall of brass' in attempts to talk to O&amp;Y and the Reichmann family. The result is that the book contains little new material and largely recounts publicly-available information. Nonetheless, his outline of their rise and fall makes a remarkable story. It begins with the brothers' early lives in Hungary, Austria and Morocco, where their mother, Renee, was the Tangier agent of a committee devoted to rescuing Jews trapped by the Nazis. In the 1950s, the family moved to Canada, where Paul and Ralph Reichmann set up the Olympia Floor and Wall Tile Company (Ontario) with capital of Dollars 50,000. After building a warehouse for the company, they successfully moved into property development. O&amp;Y's ambitions were not limited to property. In 1979, it bought Canada Northwest Land, an oil and gas company; in 1981, O&amp;Y took control of Abitibi-Price, then the world's biggest newspaper producer; four years later, it bought a 60 per cent stake in Gulf Oil's Canadian subsidiary, then the biggest corporate takeover in Canadian history; in 1986, it took control of Hiram Walker, the drinks and resources group. O&amp;Y's evolution into a major financial conglomerate was, Stewart suggests, a step too far for a company still run as a small family firm dominated by three men. But it was property, O&amp;Y's original area of expertise, that proved its undoing. In 1987 the Reichmanns poured Pounds 1.4bn into a pioneering development in a remote part of east London, encouraged by generous tax breaks and with the backing of Margaret Thatcher, then Britain's prime minister. This proved disastrous. The Reichmanns struggled to attract tenants, in the face of recession, to an area that was unfavourably perceived and poorly served by public transport, amid an explosion of construction elsewhere in London. While Canary Wharf struggled, O&amp;Y sunk into deep trouble on the other side of the Atlantic because of its exposure to the Campeau retail empire, which met difficulties after an over-ambitious takeover of two of the US's biggest department store groups. At the same time, other parts of the O&amp;Y empire, such as Abitibi-Price and Gulf Canada absorbed large amounts of cash. On May 14, O&amp;Y applied for bankruptcy protection. Following months of wrangling a restructuring was agreed in Toronto in January 1993, that would eventually dismantle much of the empire. This adequate account of the story does not live up to its subtitle: Olympia &amp; York: the story behind the headlines. Indeed, it often reads as a critique of other writers' assessments of O&amp;Y. Stewart's one-time career as a professor of journalism may explain his pre-occupation with flaws in accounts written by his rivals, but in a book so dependent on other people's research and marred by minor errors of its own, it only serves to irritate. Nonetheless, Stewart makes some cogent points when he blames the failure of the O&amp;Y empire largely on the financial and political system. 'What happened to O&amp;Y has less to do with the personalities of the Reichmanns . . . than it has to do with the laws governing incorporation, taxation, banking and bankruptcy.' O&amp;Y's acquisitiveness was encouraged by Canada's tax laws; its over-ambitious expansion was fuelled by credulous banks. When it came to the crunch, the bankruptcy laws protected a company that was deemed 'too big to fail'. The O&amp;Y debacle did severe damage to the company's creditors, but it did not ruin the Reichmanns. Two days after the restructuring of O&amp;Y was approved, Paul Reichmann was back in business with plans to invest in North American commercial property.</p>

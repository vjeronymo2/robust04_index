			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Getting in on the ACT A 30-point fall in the London equity market and a  1/2 -point rise in long gilts seems a proportionate response to the chancellor's advance corporation tax surprise. For tax-exempt institutions the reduction in ACT rate from 25 to 20 per cent marginally improves the attraction of gilts over equities. But that is unlikely to provoke much widespread switching. A fall in equities of around 2.5 per cent would restore gross yields to the level before the chancellor stood up. Yet given a number of offsetting factors, that would be excessive. Companies will receive a cash flow boost. Some may even increase dividends to compensate institutions for their lost income. Such institutional pressure for higher payments would be rather rum. They would be unlikely to respond sympathetically if their employees demanded higher pay to offset personal tax rises. The chancellor has transferred resources from institutions to companies, and he has effectively encouraged retained earnings over distributions to pension funds. Such a bias towards corporate investment may even have been deliberate. These changes will produce some mixed results among high-yielding shares. Those such as ICI with low - or no - dividend cover may suffer, since they clearly cannot increase payments to compensate for the sharp drop in gross yield. Others, such as Redland, which will benefit from improved cash flow, might do well if their dividends become more secure. And high yielding shares with good cover may be bought to replace lost yield - hence the demand for utility stocks yesterday. Proposals for foreign income dividends are further away and more opaque, although there is a clear conflict between companies wishing to cut their unrelieved ACT by issuing such dividends and institutions demanding UK payments with tax credits. Perhaps the chancellor will permit pension funds to take the UK dividend and taxpayers to take the overseas one. Such tax efficiency, though, was probably not what he had in mind.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Philippines switches to raising finance at home: After years of debt-driven growth, Manila is set to give up dependence on foreign funds THE Philippines, after years of foreign debt-driven economic growth that had anyway faltered last year, appears ready to shift dependence to its own financial resources. A package of revenue-enhancement measures passed by Congress last week, just before it closed its final session under the administration of President Corazon Aquino, puts the burden of funding the government's fiscal deficit this year on a range of domestic sources. While there was much criticism in the past of foreign borrowings, the level of debt has risen since Mrs Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986. She enjoyed high popularity among the country's principal economic partners, in particular immediately after the 1986 uprising that ousted the authoritarian regime of former president Ferdinand Marcos and swept her to power. That support has waned because her government has failed to turn foreign money into growth and fears of instability caused by several coup attempts. The need to reduce reliance on foreign assistance became more pronounced after the Senate's rejection last September of a new dollar-earning naval base agreement with the US. In addition, early this month, Washington proposed a much-reduced aid package for Manila for 1993. The revenue-enhancement bills passed last week enabled the country's debt negotiators to seek a resumption in the International Monetary Fund's support programme for the Philippines economy. IMF support is vital for Manila's relations with the international financial community. The government expects sufficient revenues to fill a 1992 budget gap of nearly 30bn pesos (Dollars 1.2bn) or 2.7 per cent of gross national product. The government also should be able at last to lift by June 30 the 5 per cent import levy which has pestered private business since January 1991. The import levy was imposed after the failure of Congress to pass new tax bills then proposed by the Aquino administration. Set at 9 per cent, the levy has been singled out as the biggest disincentive to investments over the past year. The Philippines has a tax collection efficiency rate of only about 14 per cent of GNP, Income earners are often loath to pay taxes because many suspect their payments may end up lining the pockets of corrupt officials. The government's collection agencies, the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs, are widely perceived as the most corrupt in the bureaucracy even if guilt has not been established in courts. The newly approved measures either raise rates on existing taxes or put some teeth into existing mechanisms. One law creates special tax courts that are designed to speed up tax cases. One reason taxpayers are emboldened to violate tax laws is the excruciatingly long period it usually takes the judicial system to settle such cases. The new courts will hear only tax cases. Another measure sets up a big-taxpayers unit that will 'closely monitor a few hundred corporations which account for a very large percentage of the BIR's revenue collections'. Big corporations are frequently accused of paying off certain BIR personnel to reduce tax assessments. Penalties on tax evasion are also to be raised under another law. Another creates new posts in the internal-revenue and customs bureaux which will be directly involved in enhancing collections. These staff will get salaries much higher than those in the normal payroll to reduce corruption. Not passed by the Senate, however, was a bill proposing refinements in the value-added tax system. The refinements involve an expansion in the VAT's scope to include the services sector and property leasing. It was the feeling of many lawmakers, most of whom are seeking re-election in the May elections, that the bill in effectcreates new taxes, and therefore was too hot to handle. Passed earlier by the two chambers of Congress and awaiting the president's signature are separate measures raising forestry charges, a simplified net income tax system that plugs the traditional loopholes 'through which tax revenues from high-income professionals and business establishments are drained away', and a withholding tax on purely compensation income. Mr Jesus Estanislao, the finance secretary, campaigned hard for these measures. He said the outcome was not bad given that this was an election year. The year's budget represents a nominal increase of some 20 per cent in current spending, or nearly 3 per cent in real terms. Mr Estanislao said the budget did not provide for huge, election-related allocations, which had characterised most budgets in past election years. In that respect alone, the 1992 budget is already a rarity.</p>

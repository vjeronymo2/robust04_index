			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Thierry Brehier: "Disappointed Majority"] </F>   [Text] Left-wing politicians criticize. As an opposition  force, this is their prerogative. But right-wing politicians  have been either acerbic -- those who belong to the RPR [Rally  for the Republic] -- or gently mocking -- those who belong to  the UDF [Union for French Democracy]. The right therefore has  been failing to do its job, which is to support the government.  In fact, reactions to the measures announced on Sunday 30  January by Edouard Balladur after a government "seminar" can all  be summed up with a single word: disappointment.  Disappointment with the feeble steps taken to bolster economic  growth. Disappointment with the few, unimaginative job creation  incentives. Disappointment with the postponement of the tough  but crucial decisions needed to save the French health insurance  system.    For a large part, of course, such lack of support from the  prime minister's own side can be traced to strictly political  motives; however, he also has his own behavior to blame. In an  attempt to cast into oblivion his retreat -- that is, his  failure -- on the revision of the Falloux Act, Mr. Balladur had  insisted that it would not steer him away from reform and that  he would prove his point on the occasion of the government  seminar, which was meant to act on the French people's main  concern (jobs) and the most delicate issue of all, which has  plagued governments for a long time (social security).    The goals were so ambitious that achieving them was never  going to be easy. The prime minister failed simply because the  way he trained his horse was not likely to let him overcome this  particular hurdle. Owing to his carefully constructed image of  a quiet administrator, Mr. Balladur could not afford to look  like he was putting out a "new plan" that contradicted the  policy he has been conducting since he came into office. Hence  the difficulty of introducing real consumption-boosting measures  since during the past 10 months he has steadily ruled out  demand-driven recovery measures, preferring instead  supply-driven ones. Having chosen tight control of public  expenditures as his first article of faith, he cannot introduce  excessively costly proposals.    Furthermore, the "Balladur method" was bound to complicate  matters. The bitter Falloux affair strengthened the prime  minister in his resolve to eschew anything likely to anger the  population. Like Michel Rocard when he was prime minister --  could this stem from the fact that, as for Mr. Rocard, his prime  ministership is meant to be a springboard for his presidential  ambitions? -- Mr. Balladur believes no reform is possible  without it being accepted by a majority of the French  population. Hence, although he denies it, the extreme attention  he has been paying to opinion polls -- again, just like Mr.  Rocard.  <H5>  Clash of Ambitions </H5>   This concern explains Balladur's insisting on Sunday that  "consultations" on all sensitive issues will be held; however,  it also let him postpone measures on social security which he  knew were bound to irritate the medical lobby, so influent  within his majority. This is also a letdown -- no matter what  he said in his Sunday press conference -- since in his general  policy statement of 8 April he had already announced a five-year  law meant to bring "sustainable balance" to the health insurance  system.    All this explains why a number of tangible measures  developed  in various ministries were rejected in the final round of  decisions. Above all, it explains the feeling of disappointment:  Expectations had been brought to fever pitch by the very  attitude of the head of government, his ministers, and their  staff.    This is a chance Edouard Balladur's rivals were not about to  miss. In the UDF, those who, like Charles Millon, have not been  "Balladurized" saw it as an opportunity to toot their own horn,  in order to let their views and existence be felt. Even Raymond  Barre said he favored another direction, although he reserved  judgment on the actual measures and approved many aspects of the  government's policy. At the RPR, those who remain loyal to  Jacques Chirac will not approve the initiatives of a man with  whom their "boss" has been feuding almost openly, and when one  -- like Jean-Louis Debre -- is asked for his views on the  matter, he hastens to point out the shortcomings of the  government's plan and to call for "another policy."    Such is the clash of ambitions between the Paris Mayor  [Jacques Chirac] and the prime minister that as long as he does  not have to, the former will give the latter no support which  would tie his hand for the future. These reactions to the  measures announced on Sunday are a confirmation, for the prime  minister, that 15 months before the presidential election, he  can now only count on himself and on those who have bound their  fate with his own. Of course, that is still a lot of people.</p>

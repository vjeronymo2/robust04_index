			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / ICI shares fall 63p after downgrade IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' shares fell 63p yesterday to 1145p following a profits downgrading by Hoare Govett, one of the company's brokers. The decline contributed to a 41 point fall in the FT-SE 100 index, which closed at 2,560. Hoare Govett downgraded the stock from a 'hold' to 'overvalued'. It is unusual for analysts to advise investors to sell shares in companies for which they are brokers. Mr Martin Evans, chemicals analyst at Hoare Govett, said ICI's third quarter had been poor and there was limited room for improvement next year. He had downgraded ICI's full-year profits for 1992 from Pounds 780m to Pounds 620m because of continuing poor demand. He had expected ICI to make Pounds 1bn in 1993, but now forecast Pounds 843m. These downgrades were in spite of apparently favourable currency movements, said Mr Evans. ICI was dollar neutral, because although earnings from US operations were improved from a higher dollar, its dollar expenses were considerable, particularly for the raw materials of naphtha and oil. A fall in British interest rates had little impact on ICI because much of its turnover was outside the UK. ICI had said demand was slow in July and very weak in August, said Mr Evans. Anecdotal evidence from September suggested little improvement. ICI had been affected by poor demand for its petrochemicals businesses, particularly polypropylene and PVC. Volume and prices had both fallen. ICI uses BASF's polypropylene technology, and the German group said recently it was looking at acquiring ICI's polypropylene businesses. In the group's life-sciences areas, the pharmaceuticals business was suffering competition to Tenormin, its best-selling heart drug whose US patents expired last year. Demand for agrochemicals tended to be weak in the second half of the year, but would be in loss for the third quarter, said Mr Evans. Speciality chemicals were also under pressure, he added. He forecast that third-quarter pre-tax profits would be only Pounds 100m, compared with Pounds 196m last year for the same period. The downgrading follows a similar note by Credit Suisse last week, according to ICI. However, this is the first recent downgrade by one of its own brokers. ICI's third - quarter results are due on October 29. Market report, Page 46</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  BACK TO BASICS: THE HOW-TO'S OF MEASURING RECIPE INGREDIENTS  </P> <P> When using dry measuring cups, it's important to select the size cup (or in the  case of 2/3 cup or 3/4 cup, two cups must often be used) with the exact  capacity called for in the recipe. Then fill the cup even with the top rim.  </P> <P> Dry ingredients such as flour, grains, crumbs and granulated sugar should be  stirred before measuring, then lightly spooned into the cup until it overflows.  Do not tap the cup and pack the ingredient down. Level the ingredient with the  rim using a metal spatula or straight-sided knife.  </P> <P> It was necessary in the past to sift flour to remove lumps, but today, unless  the recipe directs, flour no longer needs to be sifted before measuring. Most  sources, however, recommend sifting powdered sugar to achieve the most accurate  measure.  </P> <P> When it comes to brown sugar, it should be packed firmly into the cup with a  spoon so lumps are crushed and it retains the shape of the cup when removed.  Shortening, butter and other dense ingredients also need to be packed into the  cup to remove any air space. Use a rubber spatula to pack and level off these  ingredients.  </P> <P> Chopped, sliced and shredded foods are measured by lightly placing them in the  cup until even with rim. Do not pack these ingredients unless instructed to do  so in the recipe.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

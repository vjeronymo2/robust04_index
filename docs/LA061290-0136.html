			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FLAG DECISION SETS OFF SCRAMBLE IN CONGRESS;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION: SOME SEEK SWIFT PASSAGE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. BUT POLLS SHOW  THE ISSUE HAS LOST ITS STEAM. A ONE-THIRD MINORITY CAN BLOCK ACTION.  </P> <P> Spurred by a Supreme Court ruling, key members of Congress on Monday demanded  swift passage of a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, while  outnumbered opponents scrambled to line up votes to block it.  </P> <P> Proponents of an amendment are helped by several factors. Congress' top two  Republican leaders -- Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.)  -- are leading the charge, with President Bush's enthusiastic backing. They  also have strong support from two key Democrats -- the chairmen of the Senate  and House Judiciary committees: Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-R. I.) and Rep.  Jack Brooks (D-Tex.).  </P> <P> Moreover, key votes will take place in the patriotic atmosphere surrounding  Flag Day, which falls on Thursday, and the Fourth of July, less than three  weeks later. And in the charged politics of an election year, lawmakers will be  wary of casting votes on emotional issues that might inspire negative TV ads by  their opponents.  </P> <P> "People who vote (against the amendment) will have to go home and explain,"  said Dole, the Senate minority leader. "It will make a good 30-second spot."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, opponents of the flag-burning amendment appear to have several  things going for them, too. Opinion polls indicate that the issue has lost  steam in recent months and that it is insufficient to decide an election by  itself.  </P> <P> Opponents also have a statistical advantage: A constitutional amendment can be  blocked by a one-third minority in either house of Congress. And Congress' top  two Democrats -- House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Senate Majority  Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) -- have vowed to fight it vigorously, with  the expected help of several prominent Republicans.  </P> <P> "We are now within 10 or 15 votes of stopping it," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-San  Jose), chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional  rights. "But it's awful tough. There's a mindless stampede out there, and, if  it passes, the President will sign it and the states will step all over  themselves to ratify it."  </P> <P> Dole pressed for quick approval of the amendment on Flag Day, but he was  rebuffed by Mitchell.  </P> <P> "It would be a grievous error in the haste and heat of controversy to amend the  Bill of Rights," Mitchell said, adding later that there will be "ample  opportunity to discuss this issue in the Senate."  </P> <P> In the House, Brooks announced that his Judiciary Committee will act on a  proposed amendment next Tuesday and will bring it to the House floor before  July 4.  </P> <P> "The flag is too important a symbol of our nationhood and all that we have  struggled for over the past two centuries to leave it unprotected," he said.  </P> <P> By overwhelming margins, the Senate and the House voted last fall to pass the  Flag Protection Act, which was ruled unconstitutional by the high court Monday.  Shortly after passing the statute, the Senate voted, 51 to 48, in favor of a  constitutional amendment -- 15 votes short of the required two-thirds majority.  There has been no vote in the House on an amendment.  </P> <P> Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) reaffirmed that he strongly supports an amendment,  but Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), long an opponent, did not respond to a  request for comment Monday.  </P> <P> Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who last year introduced his own  constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration, said Monday that he was not  surprised by the Supreme Court's decision.  </P> <P> "I voted for the law last year (that the court struck down Monday) under  protest. I knew it was a big waste of time," Dornan said. "Why would the  Supreme Court change and look like politicians who flip-flop all the time?  </P> <P> "The reason I voted for it was because I didn't want to answer to a lot of  veterans groups: 'Why did I vote against protecting the flag?' "  </P> <P> Dornan predicted that both the Senate and the House will quickly pass a  constitutional amendment, and that it will be ratified by the required 38 state  legislatures within 18 months.  </P> <P> "(House Speaker Thomas) Foley promised the President and all of us that we get  a vote on this," Dornan said. "It will pass the House, and it will pass the  Senate. Most of the state legislatures have adjourned for the year.  </P> <P> "We've got to get 38 of them . . . but I believe it will go through as quickly  as any (constitutional) amendment ever did."  </P> <P> Political operatives were cautious about gauging the impact of the issue on  this year's elections. But strategists in both parties agreed that much of the  initial public indignation that followed last year's court decision on the  matter has subsided.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody is going to win or lose an election on this," said  political consultant Lyn Nofziger, a one-time aide to former President Ronald  Reagan.  </P></p>

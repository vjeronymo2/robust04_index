			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Surachai Chuphaka] </F>   [Text] Economic ministers from the six Asean states began a  week-long meeting last Saturday to formulate a new vision for  the regional bloc in the wake of the signing of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord in Marrakesh two weeks ago.    Officially known as the Asean Economic Ministers (AEM)  meeting, the forum represents an unprecedented attempt by Asean  to determine its role in the fast changing global trade  environment.    Participants at the meeting outlined three principal goals:  First, Asean members are to seek a framework on which to  develop Asean cooperation in the service sector. Deputy Prime  Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak, said Asean is working toward  greater cooperation among members in the finance, insurance and  telecommunications sectors, primarily as a safeguard; against  pressure from industrialized countries.    Second, Asean will have to play an important role in the  World Trade Organization (WTO), a body created at the Gatt  ratification, so that Asean members have a forum for preserving  their interests and resisting domination by economic powers like  the United States or Japan.    Asean ministers see the linking of labour laws with trading  privileges as a way of creating trade advantages in favour of  developed countries. Asean has called for labour issues to be  addressed by the International Labour Organization, and not  included on the WTO agenda.    Lastly, the ministers have decided on a long-term course,  envisaging trade competition among trade organizations like  Nafta and the European Community (EC), and taking into account  the economic adjustment of such major countries as Japan, India  and China.    In the wake of increasing trade liberalization with Nafta  extending into South America and the EC transforming its  organisation into a transcontinental body and still growing,  Asean cannot stay complacent. It must adapt itself to the new  global arena.    Afta, Asean feels, will have to accelerate its efforts to  lower tariffs among Asean members ahead of the 15 year time  frame, (while complying with the Gatt requirement that members  must lower tariffs within 10 years after 1996), to create a  stronger Afta capable of competing with other free trade  organizations.    Asean ministers also agreed to slate agricultural products  for Afta tariff reduction in order to increase the trading  volume within the group and to keep in line with the Gatt tariff  reduction conditions for agriculture products.    Asean, the ministers recommended, should look to expanding  its transactions with other trade organizations like Nafta to  augment the volume of trade, and to create a broader product mix  as most of Asean's members share the same commodities. This, the  minister reasoned, would strengthen and upgrade the Asean  economy.    The Asean ministers also acknowledged the necessity to erect  a police exchange mechanism (PEM) as part of its effort to  reduce unnecessary competition among Asean members to obtain  foreign investment.    The ministers will assign senior Asean officials to study  and  work out plans to be presented at a meeting in September in  Chiang Mai, before a normal ratification at the next Asean  Summit in Bangkok the following year.</p>

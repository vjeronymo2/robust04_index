			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT DOWNPLAYS THE IMPORTANCE OF HDTV TO INDUSTRY  </P> <P> High-definition television, touted as the next wave in electronics, might not  be a big enough breakthrough to restore competitiveness to the American  industry, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report released Tuesday.  </P> <P> The findings triggered immediate criticism from an industry trade group and  congressmen who support increased federal funding to develop the new  technology.  </P> <P> HDTV, which produces a picture as sharp as movies and has many potential  applications, has become an international issue, with the 12-nation European  Community asking the United States to help head off any Japanese effort to  control the field.  </P> <P> But the CBO study questioned HDTV's potential impact on consumer electronics  and said any federal support should have other justifications, such as job  creation, national prestige and scientific advancement.  </P> <P> CBO Director Robert Reichauer told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on  Tuesday that private estimates of HDTV sales were based largely on the premiums  consumers were willing to pay in the past for color television over  black-and-white.  </P> <P> But he questioned whether consumers would pay the price for a high-definition  television -- in excess of $2,000, some experts say -- when the picture quality  of standard televisions still is improving.  </P> <P> Reichauer also questioned whether HDTV would be the instant success some  predict, saying even such successful products as videocassette recorders and  microwave ovens caught on slowly.  </P> <P> He told the committee that even the optimistic predictions for HDTV sales were  small in relation to the overall electronics market.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Direct Route  </P> <P> "It is unlikely that HDTV will pay a pivotal role in the competitiveness and  technology development of the sector as a whole," Reichauer said. "Exactly how  the HDTV market would change the competitiveness of U.S. producers on the whole  is unclear."  </P> <P> Reichauer said it was laudable to try to cut the U.S. trade deficit by  fostering HDTV but that reducing the budget deficit and thereby raising  national savings was a more direct route toward ending the trade imbalance.  </P> <P> Reps. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) and Don Ritter (R-Pa.), co-chairmen of the  congressional HDTV caucus, called the CBO report "dangerous nonsense."  </P> <P> Levine said the United States already lagged behind its top competitors in HDTV  development, with foreign countries spending billions of dollars to develop  their industries.  </P> <P> "Does the CBO really know something that has escaped Japan, Europe and the vast  majority of American experts, all of whom say that HDTV is critical?" Levine  asked.  </P> <P> The American Electronics Assn., which represents 3,500 high-technology  companies, said the report contained erroneous assumptions and flawed  conclusions.  </P></p>

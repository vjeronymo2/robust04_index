			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Acatos rises to Pounds 5.14m despite static sales ACATOS &amp; Hutcheson, the manufacturer and supplier of edible vegetable oils, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.23m to Pounds 5.14m in the half year to March 28. The new FRS 3 accounting standard meant the improvement for the six months was flattened by an exceptional credit of Pounds 600,000 shown for the comparable period. Last time it was recorded as an extraordinary item. Turnover was static in the first half at Pounds 104.9m (Pounds 104.6m) and trading remained difficult in the current half, said Mr Ian Hutcheson, chairman. 'Prices in the retail sector remain under pressure while some easing in the bakery market will not benefit us significantly in the current year.' More than 50 per cent of turnover goes to catering and retail customers. He said performance gains at the company's Orchard Place factory, which contributed to the improved profits, would not be repeated on the same scale and there would be less scope for further interest savings. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 387,000 (Pounds 826,000) because of lower interest rates and the company said gearing was further reduced. Mr Ian Caunt, finance director, said gearing figures fluctuated with purchases of raw materials. Mr Hutcheson said his confidence in future prospects was increasing: 'Volumes were maintained in all our principle markets despite continued strong competition.' The company said the continuing decline in the total market for edible oils concealed a switch away from non-refined oils based on animal fats in favour of vegetable fats. Mr Caunt said: 'Animal fats are a minor part of our business and have been for a number of years. 'We have progressively shifted into vegetable oils and in addition produce some more sophisticated products like low-fat spreads.' The board has declared an interim dividend of 3p (2.5p) on earnings per share of 10.4p (9p).</p>

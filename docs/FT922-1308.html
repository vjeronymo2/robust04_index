			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour in talks on union role BEHIND-THE-SCENES talks are under way to find a face-saving formula aimed at averting a public clash between the trade unions and the Labour leadership over the unions' role in selecting or deselecting MPs. Last week, the national executive's organisation committee agreed rule changes to carry through Mr Neil Kinnock's objective of excluding union votes and confining the process to individual party members. But continuing opposition to the changes from the big general unions, the TGWU and the GMB, and Nupe, the public employees' union, threatens to overturn that decision at the annual conference in October. Now it has emerged that Labour officials are discussing a compromise whereby the proposed changes are formally adopted at the national executive meeting tomorrow, then immediately taken into a wider review of union links. If such a compromise is agreed, it will avoid a conference debate in October in which the leadership might be unable to muster the two-thirds majority required for a rule change to be adopted. A lobby group representing Labour's constituency activists has targeted Mr John Smith's shadow budget as the party's 'biggest vote loser' at the April general election and calls for a new convergence of the centre-left. The report by the soft-left Labour Co-ordinating Committee, published today, says that while the budget was a 'bold move', a failure to project a vision for the economy left tax issues at the centre of its policy by default.</p>

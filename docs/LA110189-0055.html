			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA COUNCIL REFUSES TO REGULATE MOBILE HOME RENTS  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council, turning down a request from residents of mobile  home parks, has declined to enact an ordinance that would have placed a limit  on rents at 22 parks in the city.  </P> <P> But council members warned the owners of mobile home parks that they might  consider such an ordinance in the future if rents begin to skyrocket. "They  start jacking up rents, I'll be willing to come down real hard," Councilman  Carl Boyer III said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> For now, the council will organize a meeting between residents and owners of  mobile home parks to discuss what residents say are exorbitant rent increases  at many parks. Council members said they would rather see the residents and  owners work out the problem themselves with some city assistance.  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita Mobile Home Owners Area Council had asked the council to  adopt an ordinance, patterned after a measure in Oceanside in San Diego County,  that would have outlawed annual rent increases above 8%. Under the proposal,  mobile home park owners could receive permission for larger increases under  special circumstances.  </P> <P> Don Wilder, president of the mobile home group, said the ordinance would allow  park owners a fair return on their investment while protecting park tenants.  </P> <P> Wilder said there are 22 mobile home parks with 2,200 spaces in Santa Clarita.  More than 7,500 people live in the parks, he said, paying rents ranging from  $300 to $473 a month.  </P> <P> Over the past five years, rents have risen dramatically, Wilder said. Some  mobile home park owners raise rents 15% a year, he said. Most park residents  are senior citizens on fixed incomes, and many fear they will be forced out of  their homes by rising rents, Wilder said.  </P> <P> "Their desire for affordable living has been jeopardized," he said.  </P> <P> The council said it needs detailed information on rents at mobile home parks  before it can act on an ordinance. But council members agreed that many park  residents are having trouble paying their monthly rent.  </P> <P> "The problem is not getting any better," Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy said. "It's  getting to an unbearable point."  </P> <P> Boyer said the council receives more mail complaining about rents at mobile  home parks than any other issue.  </P> <P> Councilman Dennis Koontz suggested that the city write to each park owner and  request that they hold off raising rents until city officials can investigate  the issue.  </P> <P> "They'll tell you to take a walk," Darcy replied.  </P></p>

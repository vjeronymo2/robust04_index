			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese property companies suffer EARNINGS of Japanese property-related companies are under strain. Mitsubishi Estate, the realtor, yesterday reported a 0.3 per cent increase to Y90.2bn (Dollars 692m) in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March, and Daiwa House Industry, the home builder, a modest 1.3 per cent rise to Y90.6bn. However, Mitsubishi Estate is forecasting a 20.2 per cent decrease in pre-tax profits for the current year, the first fall in 17 years, which it blamed on the slow recovery of the property market and a new method of assessing land tax. Daiwa House is forecasting that pre-tax profits will expand by only 1.5 per cent on sales up from Y881.9bn to Y950bn. The more optimistic sales figure follows signs that the Tokyo housing market is gaining strength after two years of falling demand and prices. Last year, Mitsubishi's sales rose by 2.1 per cent to Y345.5bn, while for the current period it is expecting sales of Y360bn. Daiwa's sales rose 9.9 per cent last year. The impact of the collapse of the Tokyo stock market was reflected in the erosion of both companies' share assets, with the unrealised gains on Mitsubishi's holdings falling to Y293.8bn from Y436.6bn. At Daiwa, the book value of short-term shareholdings fell to Y9bn from Y9.4bn but the market value fell to Y7bn from Y11bn and the book value of long-term holdings of stocks rose to Y85.2bn from Y80.3bn, while the market value fell to Y145.8bn from Y173.3bn. Mitsubishi said that while the Japanese property industry generally faces a 'difficult environment', its own situation will be made more difficult by additional land taxes of Y11.5bn for the current year. However, the company expects to spend Y344bn in construction and other investment, 14.5 per cent up on last year. Daiwa House said recent reductions in official interest rates could restore some of the consumer and industry confidence lost after the collapse of the country's financial 'bubble', and that house sales were likely to improve later in the year.</p>

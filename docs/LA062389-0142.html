			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BUFFETT'S MUSIC STUCK AT LOW TIDE AS FANS WALLOW IN 'MARGARITAVILLE'  </P> <P> Here's a tip: Next time Jimmy Buffett comes to town, buy stock in garish  tropical print shirts.  </P> <P> That was -- along with caps sporting shark fins -- definitely the fashion  statement Tuesday as Buffett (pop's foremost nautical nabob) and his Coral  Reefer Band played the first of two nights at the Universal Amphitheatre. (The  crew also docks at the Pacific Amphitheatre for shows tonight and Saturday.)  </P> <P> Would that Buffett's music was as colorful (if tacky) as his fans' choice in  attire. Instead, Monday's offerings had the general hue and consistency of a  pina colada, spiked only by the fluid harmonica of his longtime partner Fingers  Taylor and the mild Caribbean flavoring of a steel drum. In nautical terms,  Sailor Jimmy is in a dead calm.  </P> <P> Not only is he drifting aimlessly, but that seems to be the central theme of  his canon. What's more, he seems to think drifting is a good thing.  </P> <P> And drift he does, through a world in which the ideal love is a "Mermaid in the  Night" (a song from his new "Off to See the Lizard" album) and his biggest  concern is that he still can't find that dang shaker of salt in  "Margaritaville." Well, Jim, if you just got up and looked you might be able to  track the thing down!  </P> <P> "Changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes," he sang. "Nothing remains quite  the same." Except him, that is. Well, OK, he did shave off his mustache last  year. But otherwise, his mix of old and new material showed little difference  between Buffett past and Buffett present.  </P> <P> Yet the audience made the show seem like a rowdy frat party, singing along on  nearly every song (often voicing the words ahead of Buffett, as the star  pointed out with mock irritation). "Some of you people obviously don't give a  damn about working on Wednesday," the singer noted, to the delight of the  boisterous crowd.  </P> <P> What was all the shouting about? Apparently these people find Buffett's gift  for clever (though hardly insightful) turns of phrase and the notion of  floating in the Tropics something to get excited about. But then, this paradox  almost makes sense: It's just the kind of go-figure occurrence that Buffett  likes to write about.  </P> <P> Oh, yeah -- if you do invest in those shirts, make sure a good number of them  have room for beer bellies.  </P> <P> Whatever musical breeze did fill the sails on Tuesday could likely be credited  to opening act the Neville Brothers. Drawing largely from its fine recent  "Yellow Moon" album, the New Orleans institution's polyrhythmic Mardi Gras  mambo got the crowd quite fired up. Most impressive was how the Nevilles got  the predominantly white audience to sing and clap along on its tribute to  civil-rights movement spark Rosa Parks, perhaps even connecting with the idea  that "our freedom fight" was as important to Caucasians as to  African-Americans.  </P> <P>  Jimmy Buffett and the Neville Brothers perform today and Saturday at 8 p.m.  the Pacific Amphitheatre, 100 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $16.50 to  $22.50. Information: (714) 634-1300.  </P> <P> </P></p>

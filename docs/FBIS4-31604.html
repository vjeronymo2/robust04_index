			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Maric: "Biljana Plavsic -- He Who Attacks the </F> National Interests Will Inevitably Lose"]    [Text] Banja Luka -- In a statement for GLAS SRPSKI,  Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of Srpska, among  other things, touched upon the speech FRY President Zoran Lilic  made at the congress of the Yugoslav Trade Union Federation in  Novi Sad the day before yesterday.    "Statements made by some SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia]  officials or by some people belonging to the SPS, in which they  advocate the need to give in to blackmail in the peace process  are suddenly along the same line as the SPO [Serbian Renewal  Movement] (perhaps one should not say suddenly, because similar  things have been happening for a long time whenever the national  question is discussed and when Serbs in Krajina and the republic  of Srpska are concerned). In this respect, they do not differ  from Vuk Draskovic who had said: `Send them there, let them  live together with the Muslims.' And when Zoran Lilic says `we  no longer want to be hostages to the Serbian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina,' he is only putting it a little differently.    "Democracy suits the Serbian people, and I do not know how,  with such views, it could endure the 50-year torture of an  undemocratic regime. The Serbian people have a rich history and  that helps it to survive on this Balkan wasteland. Therefore,  all those people who attack the basic national interests will  inevitably lose. Such changes will happen in Serbia as well,  although everything is happening a little more slowly there.  Things were happening in this way here, because we were thrown  into events that occurred quickly and into dangerous situations.  However, I am convinced that this will happen in Serbia as  well," Biljana Plavsic concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITIM] </F>   [Text] Seventy Fatah Hawks terrorists were recruited to  the Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip yesterday.    Of the 70 -- who constitute the total number of Fatah's  terrorists and fugitives -- some 30 will be incorporated into  the Palestinian police force; approximately 20 will join the  security service under Muhammad Dahlan's command, while the rest  will join the military force, or will renounce this privilege  and become civilians.    A senior Israeli source said the Israeli security forces  were  unaware of this agreement.</p>

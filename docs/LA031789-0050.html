			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'FLETCH LIVES' TAKES BAD JOKES, BAD TASTE TO DEEP SOUTH  </P> <P> "Fletch Lives" (citywide) is the ultimate comedy of condescension, a movie with  a hero whose every other line of dialogue is a snide wisecrack directed at a  fool. In this meager sequel, as in its popular predecessor, Chevy Chase  demolishes every easy target in sight with a quip of the tongue. Some of the  lines are funny, but after a while you just want to smack him.  </P> <P> The original "Fletch" film nearly four years ago had Chase, as investigative  reporter Irwin Fletcher, sardonically reducing everyone and everything in Los  Angeles to its proper level. Having exhausted all possible prey for his comic  patronization in this town, what better place to go next and be painfully  superior about than the Deep South? Uh-oh.  </P> <P> Welcome to Louisiana, land of obese lawmen, sex-hungry belles, KKK goons,  crooked TV evangelists, redneck motorcycle gangs, 'possum hunters, plain folks  who like to dress up in Confederate regalia and enough suckers to keep P.T.  Barnum in business for five lifetimes. Everyone there has two first names --  Jim Bob, Joe Jack, Cindy Mae and almost every other possible combination except  John Paul.  </P> <P> These dusty cliches are set up like big plastic ducks in a shooting gallery by  screenwriter Leon Capetanos, to be knocked flat by cosmopolitan Chevy, who  isn't playing a character (least of all the character first created by novelist  Gregory McDonald) so much as reprising his nonplussed, punchline-spouting  "Weekend Update" anchor role.  </P> <P> This jester ends up in Louisiana after inheriting a mansion from his recently  deceased aunt. It's a given that our hero will offer more rejoinders than  remorse about the aunt. It's a little more shocking when, 20 minutes into the  movie, its most appealing character (a sexy Southern lawyer played by Patricia  Kalember) is killed off as she lies in bed next to Fletch, and all he can do  when the police show up is crack jokes.  </P> <P> But sleep with him another woman does, knockout real estate agent Becky Ann  Culpepper (Julianne Phillips, she of the angel face and wildly wavering  accent), whose land-grubbing TV-preacher father just happens to be a prime  suspect in the murder.  </P> <P> It's a brilliant stroke of casting to have R. Lee Ermey -- the formidable drill  sergeant of "Full Metal Jacket" -- take on the role of evangelist Jimmy Lee  Farnsworth. And when the picture finally gets to this fake faith-healer's  massive church, it looks all set to take off into satirical set-piece heaven.  The atrocious baby-blue color scheme of the set design and suits (from costume  designer Anna Hill Johnstone and five art directors) is hysterical and -- for  any students of the TBN or PTL cable networks -- dead on-target.  </P> <P> There's more reason to be hopeful still: Director Michael Ritchie is the man  who took on such American institutions as politics ("The Candidate"), juvenile  sports ("Bad News Bears"), beauty pageants ("Smile") and est seminars  ("Semi-Tough") in the '70s. Why not institutionalized religion now?  </P> <P> But this is the Michael Ritchie of the '80s, a coaster more apt to cook up  gilded turkeys like "The Golden Child" and last year's career low, "The Couch  Trip." This Ritchie lets sophomoric scatology predominate over satire at every  turn, and even in the two church scenes -- including an amusing bit with Fletch  impersonating a guest healer -- the gags are more crass than corrosive. The  whole dumb mess bottoms out (so to speak) when a parishioner pulls down his  pants to show the congregation his hemorrhoids.  </P> <P> Comedy this smug is bound to find its TV-weaned audience, but moviegoers might  think twice about signing on as the film makers' partners in put-down when  they're clearly also its targets. It's a also a bad sign of the faith Ritchie  and editor Richard A. Harris have in their audiences when every time Chase does  something funny with his hands, they cut to a closeup of the hands -- as if  they're afraid we might miss the gag.  </P> <P> Beware: "Fletch Lives" (MPAA-rated PG, in spite of its raunchy-mindedness) may  assume that all Southerners are dim bulbs, but it doesn't think you're so  bright yourself.  </P></p>

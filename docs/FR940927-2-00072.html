			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Health Care Portfolio MITTS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the NYSE'S existing equity floor trading rules will apply to the trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS. First, pursuant to NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading Health Care Portfolio MITTS. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  Second, consistent with NYSE Rule 405, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically approve a customer's account for trading Health Care Portfolio MITTS prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction. Third, Health Care Portfolio MITTS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange. Fourth, in accordance with the NYSE's Hybrid Approval Orders, the Exchange will, prior to trading Health Care Portfolio MITTS, distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in Health Care Portfolio MITTS and highlighting the special risks and characteristics of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NYSE Rule 405 requires that every member, member firm or member corporation use due diligence to learn the essential facts relative to every customer and to every order or account accepted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Hybrid Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Commission Findings and Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5). Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for health care securities. In particular, the Commission believes that Health Care Portfolio MITTS will permit investors to gain equity exposure in health care companies, while at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment. For the reasons discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission finds that the listing and trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS is consistent with the Act. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See MITTS Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with other MITTS products, Health Care Portfolio MITTS are not leveraged instruments, however, their price will still be derived and based upon the underlying linked security. Accordingly, the level of risk involved in the purchase or sale of a Health Care Portfolio MITTS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common stock. Nonetheless, because the final rate of return of a MITTS is derivatively priced, based on the performance of a portfolio of securities, the Commission has several specific concerns regarding the trading of this type of product. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to Health Care Portfolio MITTS. In particular, by imposing the hybrid listing standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission believes the Exchange has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of Health Care Portfolio MITTS. Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to the specific risks associated with Health Care Portfolio MITTS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission realizes that Health Care Portfolio MITTS are dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer, Merrill Lynch. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued listing standards which require issuers to maintain an aggregate market value of $5 million for its publicly-held shares. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Health Care Portfolio MITTS have at least $4 million in market value. In any event, financial information regarding Merrill Lynch, in addition to the information on the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio, will be publicly available. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 10. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The companies that comprise the Health Care Portfolio are reporting companies under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Merrill Lynch, or a subsidiary providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission believes this concern is minimal given the size of Health Care Portfolio MITTS issuance in relation to the net worth of Merrill Lynch. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See MITTS Approval Orders,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also believes that the listing and trading of Health Care Portfolio MITTS should not unduly impact the market for the underlying securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio. First, as discussed above, the underlying securities comprising the portfolio are well-capitalized, highly liquid stocks. Second, because all of the components of the Health Care Portfolio will initially be equally weighed, no single stock or group of stocks dominates the Health Care Portfolio. Finally, the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Health Care Portfolio, are subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and all of the portfolio securities are either listed or traded on, or traded through the facilities of U.S. securities markets. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  Additionally, the NYSE's surveillance procedures will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that 19 of the component securities are traded on the NYSE and the remainder are National Market securities traded through Nasdaq. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Commission notes that the value of the Health Care Portfolio will be disseminated at least once every minute throughout the trading day. The Commission believes that this result is appropriate because, unlike previously approved MITTS products which contain foreign components, the Health Care Portfolio is comprised solely of securities traded in the U.S. for which real-time price information is available. The Commission believes that providing access to the value of the Health Care Portfolio at least once every minute throughout the trading day is extremely important and will provide benefits to investors in the product. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, the Commission believes that it is useful and beneficial for all investors and market participants to have access to the value of the Health Care Portfolio as frequently as possible and encourages the NYSE and Merrill Lynch to further explore the possibilities in this area,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  calculating and disseminating the value of the portfolio at least once every 15 seconds as is done with other derivative products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As discussed above, the Commission believes that investors and market participants will benefit from having the value of the Health Care Portfolio calculated and disseminated as frequently as possible throughout the trading day. The Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 provides this benefit without unduly burdening either the Exchange or the issuer of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS. Additionally, the Commission notes that Amendment No. 1 provides for significantly greater access by investors and market participants to current values of the Health Care Portfolio than did the original proposal which was noticed for the full 21-day comment period without any comments being received by the Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;14 and should be submitted by October 18, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

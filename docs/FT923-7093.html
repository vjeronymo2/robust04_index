			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Thursday night belongs to BBC2 at present. Do you remember those comforting stories about the British being really responsible for the post war German economic miracle thanks to their revolutionising German unions and German politics? Well now it seems that Japan's modern success can be put down to American initiative. Business Matters (7.30) investigates the influence of W. Edwards Deming who, in 1950, went to Japan to teach the natives quality control. The opening episode of The Climbers (8.00) promised an engrossing series. Today Chris Bonington treks to the Diamir face of the Nanga Parbat. The game show Ps And Qs (8.30) should either take snobbishness seriously and use Jennifer from 'Jennifer's Diary' and Garter King Of Arms, or whatever, to head the teams answering questions on etiquette, or it should self destruct. The opening episode last week was disastrous. Alan Bennett's series of solo dramas, Talking Heads, was superb and the episode repeated today, 'A Cream Cracker Under The Settee' (9.40) with Thora Hird as the house-proud pensioner who has a fall, is one of the best: marvellous writing and a tremendous performance.</p>

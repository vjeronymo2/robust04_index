			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Mubarak backed for re-election Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak yesterday won the backing of 97 per cent of the People's Assembly to run as the sole candidate in the presidential elections, clearing the way for him to take up his third six-year term, Mark Nicholson writes from Cairo. The petition makes the house's backing for Mr Mubarak all but certain on July 21, when it must formally endorse his candidature by a two-thirds majority. His nomination will then be put to a referendum in October, at which a simple majority will return him. He won 97.1 per cent of the votes in October 1987.</p>

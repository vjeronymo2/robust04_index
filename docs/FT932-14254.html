			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Technology: Back to square one - or two / Technically Speaking THE life cycle of many management techniques follows a predictable pattern. First, the business school academics and management gurus come up with an innovation that they declare will confer competitive advantage, multiply profitability, improve flexibility and the like. Then it is taken up by the management consultancies which spread the word far and wide. After a time, the debunkers move in to expose the hyperbole and challenge the myths. After the savaging, what remains may prove to be of real value to managers and organisations. Business process re-engineering (BPR), currently a hot topic among management experts, is just entering the third phase. If its progress runs true to form, it should be possible within a few months to distinguish the elements of lasting value through a smokescreen of misinformation and mystery. BPR is a way of improving business efficiency. It involves taking a view of the company that focuses on key processes rather than traditional functions, divisions or products. Changing these processes through redesign and the use of technology can lead to order-of-magnitude improvements, the argument goes. Certainly, it has proved persuasive enough to become enormously fashionable in the US and Europe. Computer Sciences Corporation, a large US-based pioneer of BPR, says it attracted 1,500 executives to its annual conference in Boston this month, double the number that attended a year ago. OTR, an energetic, Brussels-based consultancy, has taken a critical look* at BPR, driven by a belief that many senior managers have reservations. As, they reason, their business was never engineered in the first place, how can it be re-engineered? OTR's chief conclusion is that BPR is based on real principles and there can be genuine value in applying them, but that hyperbole is confusing the picture. It concludes, for example, that claims for BPR applications are often exaggerated. It cites Hallmark Cards in the US. While BPR is supposed to imply fundamental rethinking of the whole business, the main change at Hallmark was the installation of barcode readers in 250 stores. 'Hallmark now knows what is being sold much quicker than before,' it says. While this has clearly been beneficial, the basic procedures have not been altered, notes OTR. 'Hallmark still monitors which cards are sold and adjusts its stock and design requirements accordingly.' In fact, OTR concludes, nobody has re-engineered their whole business: it is too risky. Even where funds are unlimited, no company dares risk removing the pillars that support its business, rearranging them and putting them back in place - the worry is that the business would collapse before reassembly was complete. How then can a company achieve the benefits of BPR? OTR prescribes measures which resemble those traditionally recommended for implementing information technology: leadership from the top, cultural as well as organisational change and a cautious approach - experimenting with prototype re-engineering in a small part of the organisation is better than attempting an enterprise-wide transformation. It recommends an interesting mix of people for the re-engineering team. It suggests broadly-based insiders, dispassionate outsiders - and 'rebels' who think the whole exercise will be a waste of time. Such people are better on the inside than the outside where their fears and suspicions can help to spread doom and despondency. Their ability to spot genuine flaws in the project can save money in the long term. The rebel as hero is an uncommon image in management lore, but it may become increasingly familiar as BPR spreads. *Business Process Re-engineering - Real or Hype, OTR Group 1993.

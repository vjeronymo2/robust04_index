			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / First Leisure feels tight grip on spending First Leisure yesterday provided further evidence of the tight grip consumers are keeping on their wallets when it announced pre-tax profits up 2.3 per cent to Pounds 31.8m on turnover up 12.3 per cent to Pounds 121.8m. Mr John Conlan, chief executive of the discotheques, bowling and tourist attractions group, said that while admissions were stable or had increased, spend per head had not. The only business to show a profits increase was discotheques. Operating profits were Pounds 14.5m, compared with Pounds 12.5m last year. Turnover was Pounds 44.5m, compared with Pounds 38.2m in 1992. Mr Conlan said discotheques were the first part of the group's business to be affected by the recession and were the first to recover. The south and south-east of England, the first regions to turn down when consumer spending fell, were also the first to recover. While discotheques admissions rose 14 per cent last year, the group had not raised admission prices. Profits from the group's resorts fell to Pounds 11.7m from Pounds 12.3m on turnover of Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 40.1m). The group said resorts outside Blackpool performed well. This was largely offset, however, by a disappointing summer season in Blackpool itself, following adverse publicity over bad weather and beach pollution. The group said it expected Blackpool visitor numbers to rise this year as a result of activities to mark the 100th anniversary of the Blackpool Tower, and the opening of the world's highest roller coaster on the Pleasure Beach, which is not owned by First Leisure. Profits at the sports division fell to Pounds 13.7m from Pounds 14.1m on turnover of Pounds 32.1m (Pounds 30.2m). The fall resulted from a drop in spending on bowling, compared with its peak at the end of 1992. Mr Conlan said that the number of bowling games played had remained stable, but spend per head had fallen. Profits from the bingo business, acquired last year, were Pounds 900,000. Earnings per share fell 6.8 per cent to 14.75p. Adjusted to exclude the effect of property transactions, they fell by 2.5 per cent, which the group said was wholly attributable to the increase in the tax charge. The final dividend is 4.53p, bringing the total payout to 6.53p, compared with 6.14p last time. Lex, Page 24; Picture, Page 27</p>

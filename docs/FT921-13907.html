			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Directors' transactions JUST AFTER Christmas we noted the very substantial volume of buying by directors during December which, when combined with the dismal state of the market, led us to suggest that the market was overdue for a recovery. That is precisely what has happened, but judging from this week's table it may prove short-lived. Two sales of 50,000 shares at 347p by Stephen Zimmerman, deputy chairman of Mercury Asset Management, follow a pattern of steady selling by directors since interim results were announced in mid-November. Mercury Asset Management, which is 75 per cent owned by S G Warburg, has benefited from last year's more buoyant stock market conditions. Christian Salvesen, the Scottish-based distribution group, has weathered the recession well: the shares have risen by 50 per cent over the last year. Andrew Salvesen, a non-executive director, and part of the founding family, has sold more than 1m shares at 242p, close to its all-time peak. Back in March last year five directors of Strong &amp; Fisher, the leather producer, bought shares at 25p. The shares have risen sharply since then, but Geoffrey Andrew, a non-executive director, has bought a further 100,000 at between 33p and 34p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                   Shares          Value              directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES BAA                         10,000            55                  1 BAT                         49,973           310                  1 BOC                          5,300            32                  1 Brown (N)                   58,750           130                  1* BTR                         50,000           202                  1* Hanson                       9,675            20                  1 Helical Bar                  9,000            12                  1 Jeyes                      175,000           732                  3 Mercury Asset Mngmt        100,000           347                  1 Oriel Group                 50,000            73                  1 Sainsbury (J)                4,400            15                  1 Salvesen (Ch)            1,039,419         2,515                  1 Steel Burrill Jones         17,000            52                  1 Transworld Coms            100,000            73                  1 Wellcome                     1,400            16                  1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Ass Brit Engin'ing         500,000            10                  1 Carclo Engineering          40,000            59                  1 Cookson Group               93,635            96                  1 Lopex                       40,000            18                  1 Nichols, JN (Vimto)          7,500            23                  1 Strong &amp; Fisher            100,000            34                  1 United Fr'ndly Ins A         6,000            32                  6 Usborne                     75,000            10                  1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in pounds000s.

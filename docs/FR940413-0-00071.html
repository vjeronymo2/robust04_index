If the total funds requested exceed the total amount of funds available, the funds will then be reallocated on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> basis only among these institutions to provide assistance to students whose financial need has increased as a result of the earthquake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. 34 CFR Part 682_Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. 34 CFR 682.604&blank;Processing the Borrower's Loan Proceeds and Counseling Borrowers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To assist affected individuals, the Secretary modifies the requirement in 34 CFR 682.604(c)(2) that loan proceeds be delivered to the borrower within 45 days of the institution's receipt of the check but will instead permit the institution to deliver loan proceeds to the borrower up to 120 days from the institution's receipt of the check. Documentation must be maintained according to the governing regulations. The Department still expects delivery of a borrower's loan proceeds as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, because some institutions may have to delay opening or have ceased operation for an undetermined period of time, the Secretary authorizes lenders not to disburse loan checks to institutions or to parent PLUS borrowers in the affected areas until the lenders receive revised disbursement schedules from the affected institutions. The Secretary instructs guaranty agencies and lenders to revise information on loan periods, graduation dates, and so forth, on the loan applications related to these disbursements as the information becomes available. This change means that a borrower need not reapply for the loan. This change also will allow a student to receive his or her loan proceeds according to a schedule that fits the institution's new academic schedule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. 34 CFR 682.605&blank;Determining the Date of a Student's Withdrawal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary modifies the requirement in 34 CFR 682.605(b) to permit an institution affected by the disaster to determine that the student has withdrawn within 90 days (instead of 45) after the expiration of the academic term for an institution that uses academic terms, except that 60 days (instead of 30) after the first day of the next scheduled term may be used in the case of a summer break, and 50 days (instead of 25) after the student's last date of attendance may be used for an institution that measures academic progress in clock hours or credit hours, but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: What a very odd year that was - Claret / Edmund Penning-Rowsell tastes the '84, and discovers qualities in an irregular vintage The claret vintages of the 1980s were unusually successful, but for more than one reason 1984 turned out the least attractive. The '80s were weak, the '87s inclined to be thin, but from both years there were agreeable, relatively inexpensive bottles for early drinking. '84 was not a bad vintage but it lacked balance and charm. That year the spring was poor, the vine flowering irregular, with much coulure (non-setting of the flowers) and millerandage (the grapes not swelling). A moderate summer and a wet late September led to many wines being made up to the middle of October. Conditions were particularly unfavourable in St Emilion and Pomerol. Overall the crop was the smallest since 1977. Nevertheless, it was by no means uninteresting to taste a decade later the '84 first growths, which in general make the most successful wines in any vintage, at the annual dinner to taste the 10-year old wines. Ausone, perhaps wisely, did not make an '84 grand vin bearing its label and the wines were tasted in the usual order: Haut-Brion, Margaux, Lafite, Mouton-Rothschild, Latour, Cheval-Blanc and Petrus. There were seven of us present, including a guest, a distinguished Californian winemaker. At the end, the customary vote on the order of preference was taken, and the unusual variety of views reflected the difficulty in assessing an irregular vintage. As often, Haut-Brion provided a problem, for even after 10 years the red Graves seldom have the outgoing qualities on nose and palate of the fuller Medocs. In the final voting one member of the party placed it second, while two others, including our American guest put it sixth. Here are my notes, made at the table: Haut-Brion: Slight tinge of brown, tannic nose, rather dry flavour, fairly light, lacks depth - looked much older than Margaux, biscuit smell, full palate, flatteringly ready, held up well, long; pretty nose, dry tannins, holds up well, but not as pleasant drinking; some brown, some class, too soft; slightly watery look, typical Graves nose, rather tough and tannic; more generous than Margaux slightly bitter nose, pleasant to return to; rather bitter. Margaux: More colour, soft nose for a hard wine that tasted younger than the others, edgy but long taste, holds up well in glass - deep colour, youthful, needs aeration, may turn out something exciting, but now taut. Dry, tannic at end; pretty nose, not a big wine, but balanced, smelling well; much better wine. Real class, more colour, dry, young; a very good colour, lovely nose, a very enjoyable glass; dryer on palate than Haut-Brion, a nice but small wine, thin; softer more pleasant wine. Lafite: Fair colour, some oak on closed nose, but developed in refreshed glass, yet dry at end, gentle, mineral nose, after a time the acid began to predominate, has its moments but did not last very long; again not a big wine, but balanced and smelling well; deep, very sweet nose, a full mouthful of fruit and tannin, slightly watery finish; very classy nose and flavour, but less later; more nose than Margaux, a bit mean, better in re-fill, a puzzle; rather thin compared with others. Mouton-Rothschild: First really fine nose, concentrated, seductive, mulberry taste, but fairly light body - deep crimson, pure cassis fruit on nose, chunky and ungrateful, astringent finish, concentrated but not well balanced, not as fine as Latour but food; rich, dry and good; definitely a chaptalised taste, tannin coming through; concentrated nose, taste softens in glass, but maintains character; rich, fruity, enjoyable. Latour: Big colour, rich nose, the biggest, most fruity of all, long finish  -deep colour, hot fruit, well-constructed, the most substantial of the lot without being alcoholic; lovely nose, slightly chalky taste but rich enough to carry it; great colour, deep and thick, not much subtlety on nose, very full in the mouth, and sweet too; very odd nose, richness over-riding tannin, very long; smell of paper and some acidity, a bit peppery, lively; little nose, but pleasant to the palate, lively. Cheval-Blanc: Little colour, light nose, lacks body and short - a bit sweet, dilute and short, very disappointing; soft character, not pleasant to taste; very poor nose and body; light colour, lacks fruit; cloth and paper on nose, thin, edgy; sweet but not much charac-ter. Petrus: Good colour, rich nose, fairly concentrated taste, light for Petrus but food balance and sweet, slightly sickly, metallic nose, alcoholic but a note of harshness at end; concentrated nose, but a certain made-up character. Sugar addition shows through, but pleasant drinking; clothy nose, but surprisingly pleasant drinking. Unattractive initially and not much better when refreshed. The table's order of preference, with the lowest figure top, was: 1. Latour (10), 2 Mouton-Rothschild (15), 3. Lafite (28), 4. Haut-Brion (30), 5. Margaux (33), 6. Petrus (34), 7. Cheval-Blanc (46). My own votes were headed by Latour and Mouton-Rothschild. Ten-year-old wine may vary from bottle to bottle, and only one bottle of each was opened.</p>

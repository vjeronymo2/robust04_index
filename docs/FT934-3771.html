			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (10): The picture is changing - The south, where smuggling is a way of life / Traditionally, the region has felt ignored by the government Hat Yai, a short drive from the border between southern Thailand and Malaysia, has long been famous for its brothels, its barber shops - which double as massage parlours - and its bird's nests, the local delicacy served in the town's restaurants. But Hat Yai's image is changing. The sleaze is still there but it's more discreet. Now families from Malaysia pack the town's well-kept streets looking for bargains in what local officials proudly describe as a shoppers' paradise. The hotels put on upmarket shows. Hat Yai bustles with new found prosperity. The southern region of Thailand, stretching for more than 900km from Bangkok down to the Malaysia border, encompasses 14 provinces with a population of 7.3m. Traditionally the region, particularly its most southern part, has felt ignored by central government. With a history of separatist struggles, the south was mistrusted. Political and military power in Thailand has been controlled by Bangkok, the north and north-east. The south has been under-represented in parliament and in the higher ranks of the armed forces. Infrastructure developments in the south lagged behind those elsewhere in the country. Few industries were set up in the area. Now the picture is different. A new administration under Mr Chuan Leekpai, the prime minister who is himself a southerner, has committed itself to decentralisation and stepping up developments in the south. A new highway, described as a land bridge linking the east and west coasts of the peninsula, has been given the go ahead. A 1,000-acre industrial estate, including an export processing zone, is being built near Hat Yai. Fish processing, cannery and furniture factories have opened up. But change in towns like Hat Yai has not come about through government policy. 'There are virtues in being so distant from Bangkok' says Mr Weerapant Musigasarn of the local Prince of Songkhla University. 'We've learnt to do things for ourselves and be self sufficient. This area has always been a trading centre. Now we are capitalising on the growing prosperity on both sides of the border.' Evidence of growing cross border connections is everywhere. Each day 12 luxury buses leave Hatyai for Singapore. Shrimps and tuna, two of the south's main exports, go to Singapore for local consumption or transshipment. Thailand has recently become the world's biggest natural rubber exporter. Ninety per cent of the rubber is produced in the south. The bulk of exports go out through Penang in Malaysia - only 200km on a four lane highway away - rather than through Bangkok. Last year more than 600,000 Malaysians visited the south. Each year about 40,000 Thai workers cross to northern Malaysia to harvest the rice crops - some with work permits, but many without. The authorities in labour-starved Malaysia do not interfere. More wealthy Thais go to Penang and elsewhere in north Malaysia to shop and visit friends and relatives: in the 1950s the Thai government banned the use of Chinese in schools. Many southern entrepreneurs sent their children to Penang to be educated. 'Our cross-border connections have helped the south develop an economy of its own,' says Mr Chan Leelaporn, president of the chamber of commerce in the southern province of Songkhla. 'We may not have much political power, but our economic power is growing rapidly.' Smuggling has been a way of life for years in the south: noodles go south, electronic goods go north. Attempts at curbing the trade have been made, but with little effect. Most officials seem to turn a blind eye to the trade, worth millions each year - 'if you live in the south and don't buy Malaysian goods, you must be mad,' says a Thai businessman. 'Here, cooking oil from Malaysia costs 18 baht per kilo. It's nearly double that in Bangkok.' Dismantling the various trade barriers between the countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) has been a painfully slow process. A more modest attempt at liberalising trade has been made through the formation of cross border growth 'triangles'. Earlier this year Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia agreed on the formation of a growth triangle linking the northern half of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia, including Penang.</p>

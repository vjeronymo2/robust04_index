			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Plantsbrook shares rise 48p Shares in Plantsbrook, the UK's largest quoted funeral group, surged by 48 per cent yesterday on news that Service Corporation International had acquired a 3 per cent stake, and was buying more shares, writes Simon Davies. Plantsbrook claimed it had no warning of the purchases, and had no communication as to the intentions of the US funerals group. Investors, however, reacted with enthusiasm, following the SCI bid for Plantsbrook's only listed rival, Great Southern Group, which resulted in an offer 63 per cent above the pre-bid share price. At yesterday's closing price of 148p, the market capitalisation of Plantsbrook (including convertible shares) is Pounds 163m, but at this stage, there is little expectation of a bid. SCI has indicated that it was concerned that its main competitor, Vancouver-based Loewen, might be planning a raid on Plantsbrook shares, and this move was implemented to pre-empt that.</p>

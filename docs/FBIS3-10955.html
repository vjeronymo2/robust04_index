Petrella said: "If we want to introduce the country into a  market such as the U.S. market, we cannot go on without a  patents law."    In this regard, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  reportedly told President Carlos Menem in Chile on 11 March that  if no progress on that law is made in Congress by 30 April,  Argentina would be eliminated from the list of candidates to  join NAFTA.    Regarding the request made by UN Secretary General  Butrus-Butrus Ghali that the Argentine Government send more Blue  Helmets to Bosnia, Petrella said this is "highly gratifying for  our foreign policy and the Armed Forces, which are the  participants in this peace process."    In comments made in the "Puzzle" program of the Rock and Pop  FM station, Petrella said our country "conveyed to the United  Nations that we will only participate if we get weapons similar  to the ones the other units have."</p>

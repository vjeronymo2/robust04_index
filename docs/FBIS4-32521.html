			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Moslems refused to  meet Bosnian Serb army representatives for U.N.-sponsored talks  at Sarajevo airport on Saturday [25 June]. U.N. spokesman Rob  Annink said the United Nations would try to organise another  meeting between the Bosnian belligerents on Sunday to negotiate  an extension to the four-month truce, REUTERS said. U.N.  observers blamed Moslem snipers for the death of a Serb woman  and a Serb soldier in Sarajevo on Friday. Annink told reporters  that Moslem snipers were responsible for a number of ceasefire  provocations and violations on Friday.    Moslem forces have been disregarding the one-month  ceasefire,  which was signed in Geneva on June 8 and took effect on June 10,  and have continued to attack Bosnian Serb territories. On  Thursday, Moslem forces commander Rasim Delic urged the new  allies -- Bosnian Croats -- to mount an all-out war against the  Serbs. Moslems and Croats, who had fought bitterly for  territories since early 1993, succumbed to strong U.S. pressure  in Washington on March 18 and agreed to form a federation in  Bosnia, which should eventually form a confederation with  neighbouring Croatia.</p>

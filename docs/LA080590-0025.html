			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINKING AID TO POPULATION GROWTH  </P> <P> Rep. Anthony Beilenson's (D-Los Angeles) article on foreign aid and population  growth (Commentary, July 23) was excellent. Mankind's slow response to the  ever-more-serious growth of our population is leading us to disaster.  </P> <P> The U.S. government must do more to assist anyone in the world who wants access  to family planning. The dehumanizing poverty and declining standard of living  for hundreds of millions of people in less-developed countries are reasons  enough to do so.  </P> <P> But help must be given for our own sake as well. The Dominican and Mexican  population explosions illustrate why. The United States has been flooded with  millions of poor, uneducated Dominicans and Mexicans, who have fled their  countries and who now contribute to the overcrowding of our cities,  particularly New York and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Third World population explosion is everybody's problem. We must insist  that our government take a more active role to solve it.  </P> <P> ROGER JOHNSTON  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

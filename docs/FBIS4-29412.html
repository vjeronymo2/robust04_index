			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government on Friday lodged a formal protest with the CNN (Cable  News Network) of the United States against its "misleading and  exaggerated" reports on the Korean situation in connection with  the North Korean nuclear issue.    In the protest filed with the CNN's Seoul Bureau, the  Information Ministry said the CNN was abetting the "theory of  war crisis in Korea" through "misleading and exaggerated"  reports on the reality of the Korean peninsula.    The ministry strongly asked the CNN to stop filing similarly  exaggerated and misleading reports.    The protest said that the CNN, for instance, covered the  routine civil defense drill of last June 15 in a way that made  it appear as if the South Koreans were preparing for a war in  earnest.    This was the first time the Seoul Government filed a formal  protest with major American press media.    An observer said that such inflated reporting by the CNN  apparently stemmed from their policy to make the Korean  situation another opportunity to expand their influence. The  CNN very profitably covered the Gulf war, he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hakki Erdem and Evren Deger: "Agri and Tendurek </F> Mountains Will Be Declared Restricted Areas"]    [Text] Ankara--In accordance with the measures that are  being taken against the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], Agri  and Tendurek Mountains will be declared "restricted military  areas" and people will be prohibited from settling there.  Minister of National Defense Mehmet Golhan has said the Council  of Ministers will approve the new measure in the next few days.  The villages on the two mountains will be moved, and anyone who  enters the two areas will be fired on. The measure will provide  for the establishment of a kind of buffer zone against the PKK  militants who may try to infiltrate into Turkey from Iran,  Armenia, and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.    The National Security Council [NSC] met a few days ago to  assess the intensified PKK activities on Agri and Tendurek  Mountains and the opportunities the PKK militants have to  infiltrate into Turkey from the neighboring countries and take  up positions on the heights in these two regions. Considering  the requests of the security forces, the NSC agreed that the  Agri and Tendurek Mountains will be declared "restricted  military areas." The NSC has conveyed its decision to the  Government. Mehmet Golhan said the Council of Ministers will  decide on the matter in the next few days. He also said the  decision to declare the two mountains restricted areas will be  put into effect this fall. Stressing that it will be aimed at  obstructing PKK activities among the citizens and the nomadic  tribes in the two areas, Golhan asserted: "The declaration of  restricted areas will apply only to Agri and Tendurek Mountains.  Several villages will be moved in accordance with the new  measure. No one will be allowed to enter the two areas. We  shall than be able to control the PKK's activities with no  difficulty."    Some 50 villages will be moved when Agri and Tendurek  Mountains are declared restricted areas. Some 10,000 people who  live in villages such as Binkaya, Yukarisek, Tepeli, Uzunyol,  Tuzla, Ortulu, and Sankaya will be transferred to areas close to  larger towns. Work is underway to establish the location of the  new settlements. Appropriate areas are being selected from among  the public-owned lands. Private property may also be  nationalized for that purpose if necessary. Meanwhile, nomadic  tribes will not be allowed to enter the two restricted areas  during summer. Although the Council of Ministers has not yet  adopted a decision on the matter, it has been reported that  measures have already been taken to prevent the nomadic tribes  from moving into the two areas. The measures have been put into  effect by the governors in the region in accordance with a  circular they received from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.    A buffer zone will be established on Turkey's border with  Iran, Armenia, and Nakhichevan to prevent the PKK militants from  infiltrating into our country. The security forces will be  instructed to fire on any unauthorized person who enters the  restricted areas. Thus, one of the important routes the PKK  militants use to infiltrate into Turkey will be sealed off.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Where pensioners can find the most for their money - The investment options for those over 65 More than 160,000 people have put Pounds 1.39bn into National Savings guaranteed income bonds for pensioners since the scheme's launch in January. Holders over 65 get a 7 per cent annual return, paid gross (but taxable) each month over five years, on deposits between Pounds 500 and Pounds 20,000. But those who cash in before the end of the five years must give 60 days' notice and they will lose 60 days' interest as a consequence. Is this the best that pensioners can do? Building societies The table shows how the bond compares with some of the top-rated, five-year building society bonds. Escalator bonds, with interest rates rising each year, usually impose a Pounds 2,000 minimum if interest is to be paid monthly but have a higher upper limit than the pensioners' bonds - Pounds 500,000 or, occasionally, Pounds 1m. Penalties for early redemption can be steep, however. The Halifax's escalator bond has interest rates stepped from 6.95 to 10.95 per cent, averaging 8.49 per cent over the five years. Withdrawals are allowed only after two years, when the penalty is six days' loss of interest for each full month left. But there is a maximum penalty of Pounds 326 on a Pounds 10,000 investment. After tax, the NS bond's 7 per cent is worth 5.25 per cent to a 25 per cent taxpayer or 4.2 per cent to those on higher-rate tax. This compares with the top-paying escalator bond - at present, from the Woolwich building society - at 6.42 and 5.14 per cent net. Guaranteed income bonds These bonds are issued by insurance companies and pay out income at an agreed rate - either annually or monthly, over terms ranging from one to five years - on a minimum investment of (usually) Pounds 5,000. Chase de Vere's Moneyline this week quoted five-year Gibs paying monthly income at rates ranging from 6.54 per cent on Pounds 5,000 to 7.14 per cent on Pounds 50,000. The rates are better than the National Savings pensioners' bond, but investors who cash in guaranteed income bonds before the full term can expect to lose up to around 4 per cent of the initial investment as a penalty. Rates are quoted net of 25 per cent tax, which cannot be reclaimed by non-taxpayers. Higher-rate taxpayers face an additional 15 per cent to bring their rate up to 40 per cent, but this is based only on the net amount and not on a grossed-up figure, as with building society interest paid net. Some tax on the bonds is, effectively, deferred: investors can withdraw the equivalent of 5 per cent of the initial investment each year 'tax free' but this is adjusted at the end of the term. Mark Bolland, of fee-based financial adviser Chamberlain de Broe, says that this makes the bonds thoroughly tax-efficient for those expecting to drop into a lower tax bracket by then. Gilts Gilts, or government fixed-interest securities, deliver a specific return if held to maturity and pay income twice a year. But if you want to pull out before they reach maturity, you could well make a capital loss. Some index-linked gilts will pay a better return than the National Savings pensioners' bond. Martin Riley, of stockbroker Henderson Crosthwaite, picks out two: 2 1/2 per cent 2001s at a market price of Pounds 164 3/4 , against the indexed value of Pounds 180.9, implying a real redemption yield over inflation at 3.2 per cent to a 25 per cent taxpayer and 2.8 per cent to a 40 per cent taxpayer. 2 per cent 2006s at Pounds 167 against an indexed value of Pounds 203.8, implying real redemption yields of 3.3 per cent and 3.0 per cent to 25 and 40 per cent taxpayers respectively - that is, 5.9 and 5.6 net at June's inflation rate of 2.6 per cent. A conventional (non index-linked) gilt, Treasury 6 3/4 1995-1998 priced at Pounds 96, is yielding 6.24 per cent or 5.21 per cent, depending on the tax rate, but there is no inflation-proofing.

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Bundesbank leads way The Bundesbank set off a round of minor interest rate cuts around Europe yesterday by setting its repurchase rate at 6 per cent for the next five weeks, writes Rachel Johnson. It cut the repo rate by 25 basis points after its regular fortnightly council meeting but left its two main rates, the Lombard and the discount, unchanged at 6.75 per cent and 5.75 per cent respectively. Central bank officials indicated this could be the first time that the Bundesbank has announced ahead of time it would offer fixed interest rate repos to the market for such a long period. The move was acclaimed by economists as cleverly defusing pressure from other countries - France in particular - to cut rates. For it sent enough of a trigger to the markets to allow the authorities to shave rates even though the Germans had left their main rates unchanged. As the bank tends to leave a differential of around 30 to 40 basis points between the discount and repo rates, yesterday's cut narrows this gap to only 25 basis points, making a reduction in the discount rate more likely than a further cut in the repo rate. Although France had not moved its own rates in response yesterday, this was largely because its next tender was not until Monday. Economists generally expected the high yielders such as Italy and Spain to be the last to move. Miss Alison Cottrell, currency analyst at Midland Global Markets, the securities house, greeted the bank's operations as 'psychologically beneficial for all sides'. 'This move will allow other 'core' Europeans to ease their own market - and in some cases - interest rates,' she said. The Dutch central bank cut its official interest rates by 25 basis points and its special advances rate by 20 basis points, citing falling interest rates and the strength of the guilder. The Belgian central bank said it had cut all of its leading interest rates in line with rate cuts in other European countries. It lowered the central rate to 8 per cent from 8.30 per cent, the discount rate to 5 1/4 per cent from 5 1/2 per cent and the emergency lending rate to 11 1/2 per cent from 12 per cent. Market reaction to the moves centred on speculation as to whether the Bundesbank would be more or less likely to cut rates on December 16, its next council meeting. Miss Cottrell believes that if the M3 number shows ample slowdown in the growth of broad money, this will encourage the bank to take the bull by the horns on December 16. After all, she pointed out, if the fundamentals had not supported a rate cut the authorities would not have acted today. The bank risked a 'speculative hell' on January 6 when normal meetings resumed unless it did something earlier, she said. The only risk to this plan, however, is on the large scale. If the world trade talks collapse or fail to conclude successfully by the December 15 deadline, then currencies would be dancing to a very different tune than they are now. The talks have reached a delicate stage. The major players are both stressing the need for one more heave and taking criticism from their counterparts for holding up progress and refusing to compromise. In Bonn, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said they were taking great pains to achieve a world trade deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by the deadline. Currencies had a quiet day in spite of the moves. There was a lull between the UK Budget on Tuesday and today's US non-farm payroll figures for December, on which the dollar's strength is expected to hinge. Mr Jim O'Neill, chief currency strategist at Swiss Bank Corporation, said it was a classic December week. 'Virtually all the data have been supportive of the dollar, but the currency has not done much more than creep higher over the last 48 hours,' he said. The big tussle on the currency markets was one of 'domination' between the Swiss franc - which has benefited from strong evidence of the Swiss emergence from deep recession - and the dollar. The Swiss franc ended a touch firmer against the D-Mark. In London the dollar rose to DM1.7215, after a previous close of DM1.7175, and ended a little higher against the Swiss franc at SFr1.4965, after a previous SFr1.4960. In New York the dollar finished at DM1.7225. For after a short burst of strength following the European rate cuts, the dollar fell back to wait for the employment data. The market is expecting a jump of about 177,000 in the non-farm payrolls in November to add to mounting evidence of a broad-based consumer-led recovery. A sharp increase in US consumer spending in October was consistent with a double-digit increase in consumer confidence last month, and there are rising hopes for a 4 per cent to 5 per cent GDP number for the fourth quarter. On the London money market, the Bank of England predicted a sizeable shortage of Pounds 2.65bn, which it relieved almost fully during the day's operations with total help of Pounds 2.52bn. The escudo is unlikely to react to yesterday's government reshuffle, in which Mr Eduardo Catroga replaced Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo as finance minister. Dealers are attributing the stronger escudo to slack end-of-year activity in the foreign exchange market.</p>

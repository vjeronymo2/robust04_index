			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME AWAY FROM HOME;  </P> <P> A MOUNTAIN ESCAPE  </P> <P> Vicky Panossian fled Beirut eight years ago to escape Lebanon's endless civil  war, leaving her father, mother and a sister behind. The claustrophobia of  staying inside to hide from the shelling and the fear of being shot by snipers  when she ventured outside, drove her to Canada. A few months later, she came to  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Despite her powerful reasons for leaving Lebanon, Panossian, an Armenian  Christian, says she misses her family and her homeland. And over the years the  gulf of separation from her family -- as well as the long-gone, easy-going ways  of pre-war Lebanon -- has come to seem especially wide during the holidays, she  says.  </P> <P> "The feeling of belonging is so important, and I didn't know that until I came  here," she explains, noting that her aging parents prefer the known dangers of  Beirut to the uncertainties of sprawling Los Angeles.  </P> <P> To fill the emotional gap, Panossian, who works for an oil company, has tried  to replace the friendliness and family closeness of her best Lebanese years  with the American vision of the Christmas landscape -- snow-covered ground,  brisk days, clear starry nights and the cozy warmth of a forest cabin in the  California mountains.  </P> <P> "I'm substituting that (family) warmth with the snow and the stars in the sky,"  she says. "I guess you try to create an inner atmosphere because you don't have  that togetherness . . . You can have some kind of peace with nature."  </P> <P> That's been her solution for two Christmases, and she plans a similar retreat  this year. It will also be a welcome break from the hyper-pace and emotional  grayness of city life.  </P> <P> "In Los Angeles you don't have time to complete your feelings," she says. "You  don't have time to even miss someone." GARRY ABRAMS  </P></p>

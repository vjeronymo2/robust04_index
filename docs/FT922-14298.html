			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Wax Acts Ruby Wax is rude, not suggestive-rude, but cantankerous-rude. She is encouraged to be - she is a foreigner, an American. This allows her to play the holy fool, asking the questions, drawing the conclusions, spilling the beans about the most intimate parts of the human, and national, psyche. Her one-woman show is an extended howl of outrage - just what her fans want to hear. She is moaning from the start, as she wanders on to a set dominated by a picture of her brightly provocative teeth, one of which is appositely gold-capped. The theatre management is treating her badly  - no car, no helpers, and a lavatory in her dressing room like the black hole of Calcutta. Helpfully, she shows us a Polaroid of it. The first half of the act stays devoted mainly to the bottom part of the body. Much of it hits at the softest of targets - can there still be laughs in bidets? - but sometimes she gets popular fads in her sights and scores a bull's-eye - 'show me a vegan and I'll show you a face full of zits', she promises. Her graphic descriptions of the agonies of childbirth threaten to doom the human race to extinction. At least she includes self-abuse in her repertoire  -'when I was young we used to pout in the mirror to look like Brigitte Bardot; I looked like Alfred Hitchcock'. After the interval, the ground gets softer, as she picks apart her native land, her childhood, her family. Here again the nuggets gleam: 'Americans look as if douched with Perrier'. The line is delivered with appropriate gestures. And that is one of Ruby Wax's strengths. She is a very physical performer and when she lets loose on a castigation, with arms flying, eyes bulging, body exploding, the effect is numbing. She ends by blowing the most vigorous raspberries seen on the West End stage. If her material is not a patch on the observations of the home- grown comedienne Victoria Wood, Ruby Wax would certainly enhance, no dominate, most stages as an actress. Her show is discreetly directed by Alan Rickman, who might try to sharpen up the first 20 minutes. Ruby Wax was at the Globe Theatre, Shaftesbury Avenue, before a national tour</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE;  </P> <P> VAQUEROS BRACE FOR MAJOR EARLY-SEASON TESTS  </P> <P> The Glendale College baseball team won't have to wait long to look at some of  the best community college teams in Southern California.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros open their 1990 season Friday by playing host to Riverside in the  first round of the Foothill Tournament. The eight-team, double-elimination  event, co-sponsored by Glendale and Citrus colleges, also includes defending  state champion Cerritos, El Camino, Ventura, College of the Canyons and Valley.  </P> <P> Glendale is coming off a 1989 season in which the Vaqueros finished 16-20  overall and 8-12 in Western State Conference play.  </P> <P> Glendale Coach Steve Coots, in his 12th season with the Vaqueros, has a veteran  team led by center fielder John Bojanac, first baseman Art Chute and third  baseman Paul Hugasian.  </P> <P> Bojanac and Chute were selected first-team All-WSC last season. Hugasian, a  shortstop last season, was named to the All-WSC second team.  </P> <P> Sophomores Aldo Angrisani and Darron McWhorter will start at catcher and second  base, respectively, and freshman Swain Wukelich replaces Hugasian at short.  </P> <P> Freshmen Vic Ramirez and Dustin Pike will flank Bojanac in the outfield.  </P> <P> "Defensively, we've shown signs of brilliance, but we've also been  inconsistent," Coots said. "We're not quite where I hoped we'd be on offense,  but I think we'll get there."  </P> <P> The Vaqueros' experience should pay off most in the performance of their  pitching staff.  </P> <P> "The sophomores have done a good job of setting the tone," Coots said. "The  pitchers are farther along then we've been at this time in the past."  </P> <P> Sophomore right-hander Mike Larsen, who was second-team All-WSC last season,  opens as the staff ace. Sophomore right-handers Mike Peterson and Jaime Aguayo  also threw well in the fall.  </P> <P> Matt Whisenant, a freshman left-hander from La Canada High who was drafted last  June by the Philadelphia Phillies, is the brightest newcomer.  </P> <P> Sophomore right-handers Steve Dempsey and Brad Blackmore will also see action.  </P></p>

Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said the Japanese  Government hails Pyongyang's decision on Tuesday as a move that  enables the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to confirm  North Korea is not using its nuclear sites for military purposes.    "We believe it is important that the IAEA's inspection will  be implemented in line with the latest accord" between Pyongyang  and the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, the top  government spokesman said at a news conference.    Takemura also expressed hope North Korea will take positive  steps in clearing itself of allegations that Pyongyang has been  secretly developing nuclear weapons at its facilities in  Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of the capital.    Tokyo wants Pyongyang to open a dialogue with Seoul and  resume talks with Washington on the matter, according to the  chief cabinet secretary.    North Korea agreed Tuesday to open seven of its nuclear  facilities to inspections by the IAEA in a move to avert  possible economic sanctions by the United Nations Security  Council.    The accord, however, does not allow the IAEA access to two  sites at Yongbyon where North Korea is suspected of developing  nuclear weapons.    Takemura spoke of the need for North Korea to open the two  facilities to international inspectors.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa expressed a qualified  appreciation for North Korea's decision, saying it was fine for  the moment. But Hosokawa said there remain two more nuclear  sites that must undergo checks.    A Foreign Ministry source said, however, it will not be  clear  whether North Korea will really accept IAEA inspections until  they are implemented.    Japan must cautiously watch the development of the issue as  Pyongyang may have agreed to open its nuclear facilities in an  effort to buy time before the possible imposition of economic  sanctions by the United Nations Security Council, the source  said.</p>

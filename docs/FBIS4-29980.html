			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Beddu Amang, the vice chairman of the National  Logistics Agency (Bulog), said in answer to questions from the  press recently that Indonesia has no intention at all to stop  its import of wheat from the United States. But, Indonesia had  not imported the commodity from that country under a commercial  basis for the last two years due to the relatively-higher price  reason. "That's normal in trade to postpone an import from  other countries because of its unreachness [as published]," he  said.    The Bulog vice chairman said that the postponement of  Indonesia's wheat was done only because of its relatively higher  price in a comparison to the wheat import from Argentina and  Australia. "From the commercial points of view, we saw that the  U.S. wheat import was not competitive in the market," he  reiterated.    Moreover, he added Indonesia has requested the U.S.  Government to consider the EEP (export enhancement program) to  Indonesia for its import of the U.S. wheat. "I hope that the  request can be understandably approved by the U.S. Government, "  he said, revealing that it is directed to improve the future of  the Indonesian people.    The Bulog vice chairman explained that due to the  uncompetitive price, Indonesia has asked the U.S. Government for  the EEP treatment also imposed to its wheat import similar to  other developing countries such as Bangladesh. [sentence as  published] However, he said, the request has not yet been  accepted yet.    So far, Indonesia has imported its wheat needs from the  United States both under the commercial and GSM (general sale  manager) 102 3-year-term credit schemes. Last year, Indonesia  imported wheat grains from the United States under the GSM 102  basis amounting to 40,000 tons. During the same period,  Indonesia's total import for the commodity reached 2.5 million  tons.    Dr. Beddu Amang said that due to the relatively-higher price  reason of the U.S. wheat in the market, the Indonesian  Government has taken into consideration a conversion of its  sources of the commercial wheat imports from the United States  to other countries, including Argentina and Australia.  Indonesia has also commercially imported the commodity from its  fellow developing countries.    The price of wheat imports from Argentina and Australia has  been about U.S. $170 per ton, whilst its US price is relatively  more expensive. "Really," he said, "although the price is  already calculated under the GSM 102 scheme, but its figure is  still higher," Dr. Beddu Amang said, revealing that the price  difference can reach up to around U.S. $20 per ton.    In the current 1994 fiscal year, Indonesia received an  assistance under the GSM 102 scheme from the United States  amounting to U.S. $165 million, out of which U.S. $20 million  had been allocated for wheat imports from that country, while,  the remaining amount was for other commodities, including  protein meals, soybeans, and raw cotton.</p>

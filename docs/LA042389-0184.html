			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER VIETNAMESE AND FORMER CIA CHIEF  </P> <P> Regarding "Ex-CIA Chief Defends Role of Vietnamese in Little Saigon" (April  17): I could not care less about how William Colby feels about the Vietnamese,  and if I hear one more time that "the Vietnamese community in Orange County is  known worldwide as the capital of the Vietnamese overseas," I will just scream!  </P> <P> Why Orange County? With 49 other states to choose from, why settle in Orange  County, in the Westminster, Garden Grove area? And then proceed to build  garish, urban blight-type buildings here? How would the Vietnamese like it if  an invader took over their country? How do they think we feel about them taking  over our neighborhoods?  </P> <P> For 15 years we have had to put up with more and more people moving into an  area already heavily impacted. Just what have the Vietnamese immigrants  contributed to this county and country other than more traffic, kids, crime and  traffic congestion? I couldn't care less about how hard they work. We work hard  or even harder than they do. And what do we get? An environment that is choking  us by the presence of more Vietnamese.  </P> <P> JENNIFER T. MOORE  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report MOST London Metal Exchange contracts reversed direction yesterday, with zinc, aluminium and tin regaining some of their recent losses and nickel surrendering some of its recent advance. Zinc had got off to a shaky start, after the announcement of another rise in LME warehouse stocks, but a subsequent rally was underpinned by trade buying. The cash position closed at Dollars 1,128 a tonne, up Dollars 11 on the day, after losing some of its rise in view of the continued erosion of supply tightness for February delivery. Nickel's setback, which took the cash position Dollars 45 lower to Dollars 7,290 a tonne, followed the announcement of a substantial stocks rise but dealers said the selling was a reaction against recent gains. They added that the likelihood of overhead resistance above Dollars 7,400 (for three months delivery metal) had inhibited an early advance, triggered by Canadian producer Falconbridge's recent statement that it was considering further output cuts. The copper market continued its recent downtrend, though more slowly, with cash metal ending Dollars 3.50 down at Dollars 1,130.50 a tonne. Dealers said the market was depressed by the three months position's failure to hold above Dollars 2,150 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

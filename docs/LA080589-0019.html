			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PILOT INJURED IN PLANE CRASH DURING LANDING NEAR LANCASTER  </P> <P> A private plane crashed while trying to make an emergency landing at General  William J. Fox Airfield north of Lancaster on Friday, injuring the pilot.  </P> <P> Donald E. Simanski, 49, who suffered a head cut and a back injury, was in  serious condition at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster,  where he was taken by helicopter about 20 minutes after his plane crashed just  west of Sierra Highway near Avenue D-8.  </P> <P> Simanski, a Lancaster resident flying a twin-engine Piper Apache, radioed the  control tower at the airfield shortly before 12:40 p.m. and reported that he  was losing power and would attempt an emergency landing, Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department officials said.  </P> <P> Simanski attempted one landing approach, then told tower personnel he would  have to try again, Sgt. Ron Shreves said.  </P> <P> "He made a low pass but did not land," Shreves said. "He said his left engine  was out."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plane Lost Power  </P> <P> Witnesses said the plane lost power and altitude as it headed east, apparently  preparing to turn into the wind and attempt another landing approach to the  airfield about five miles to the southwest.  </P> <P> "The wind just flipped him over," said Jim Deppe, who watched the incident from  a nearby house.  </P> <P> Another witness, Anthony Matranga, said he was the first to reach the wreckage  of the plane, which skidded across the field and through a barbed wire fence  before stopping on its shattered nose and left wing. Simanski's head was  bleeding, but he was conscious and able to talk, Matranga said.  </P> <P> Eight people who saw the crash or its aftermath helped pull Simanski from the  cockpit before a sheriff's helicopter arrived, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation  Safety Board and the airport said they had not yet determined the pilot's  origin point and destination.  </P></p>

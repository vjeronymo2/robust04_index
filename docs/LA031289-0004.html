			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The title of a movie recently shown on KCOP was "Warriors." It dealt with gang  control of areas, control of gang members by violent leaders, etc. As as  administrator of a middle school in an area troubled by similar problems, I  question the motives of the station's programmers. How can my students' parents  and I convey to our youth that gangs are not OK when this is the offering  available to them? TV viewing can be educational. Viewing selectively can be  positive. I think that station programmers have a moral responsibility to  support positive attributes of our society and oppose those of detrimental  value.  </P> <P> Linda Brady, Baldwin Park  </P></p>

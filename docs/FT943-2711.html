			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The long road back to planet Earth: Battered and bewildered, Albania is slowly emerging from 50 years of isolation and dictatorship Tirana airport is not the best introduction to the changes which have rocked post-communist Albania in the past two years. Armed guards lounge around the perimeter under makeshift sunshades, and pill-boxes lurk sinisterly in the tall grass. The runway is bumpy, the terminal tatty. As we drive out, I see a woman washing clothes in a ditch. The fields, parched by the sun, are enclosed by the mountains which Albania used to shut out the outside world for 50 years. Closer to Tirana, though, signs of change multiply. Battered, but recognisably western, vehicles begin to proliferate and a huge Coca-Cola plant looms on our left. As we enter the city, the side of the road becomes a teeming bazaar of people selling car parts and piles of imported household knick-knacks. Every few yards, little kiosks with plastic tables and chairs dispense coffee. The air is thick with dust and heat. At a roundabout, the traffic, now dense with buses and lorries, barges its way forward with much hooting and revving of smoky engines. The buses, I notice, have 'Region de Bruxelles' written on the side: Albania already has a reputation as Europe's 'last-hand' market for anything on wheels. The roads are lined with uniform rows of cheaply built apartment blocks. At ground floor level are shops, but many have been abandoned: they served a planned economy which no longer exists. Business has shifted to the footpath kiosks or the new shops which people seem to erect wherever they like. Our hotel, the Diplomat, is small but brand new, run up with Italian money. My room has all mod cons including a refrigerator, all of them working. I had been told that the water gets turned off several times a day in Tirana, but the hotel manages to maintain a steady supply. We meet in the hotel cafe for a drink. A tall young waiter takes our order. He speaks perfect English with barely a trace of accent. He learnt it all at school, he informs us; he has never set foot outside Albania. (In later meetings, I was to see further evidence of the astonishingly high educational attainments of the Albanians - one positive legacy, at least, of the despised communists.) We learn more about the previous regime on the way to our first official appointment at the industry ministry. The car ride takes us up the huge eight-lane boulevard which Enver Hoxha, the former dictator, built for a country with no private cars. It runs past the pyramid-shaped mausoleum which he erected for himself; this now contains government offices. The ministry occupies a large but faded Italianate building with the shutters hanging off. In a spacious, lemon-painted room with a long veneered table, Premier Consolidated Oilfields of the UK and Albpetrol, the Albanian state-owned oil company, sign a contract while crowds of Albanian reporters and television crews record the scene. Abdyl Xhaja, the industry minister, is handed a personal letter from Michael Heseltine, his British opposite number, and proclaims Albania's eagerness for foreign investment. That evening, the Albanians come for a reception at the Diplomat; over canapes and French champagne, I learn more about the recent past of this country of 3.2m people, about the same size as Birmingham, squashed on the edge of the Adriatic between Yugoslavia and Greece. It is only 2 1/2 years since students triggered the uprisings which finally finished off the communists. In 1992, the new Democratic party, headed by Dr Sali Berisha, was swept to power with a plan to transform Albania into a market economy. There are now more than two dozen political parties. Information, once a state monopoly, swirls around the country: satellite dishes are sprouting all over the place. I am shown a picture of a man taking one home on a mule. The legacy of communism cannot be eradicated that easily, however. The die-hards are still around. So are the people who ran the neighbourhood spy networks which infiltrated the lives of every Albanian. Many of them got rich on the old system and have managed to preserve their wealth. They are now accused of fomenting unrest including, it is alleged, a recent demonstration by political prisoners of the communists who want more compensation. One of the big questions is whether they are still powerful enough to derail the reform process. On the economic front, land, housing, small businesses and the entire bread-baking industry have been transferred to private hands; heavy industry will follow as soon as possible. There is unemployment and inflation, but not on the scale of Russia. During the overthrow of communism, the crowds destroyed much of the productive economy: factories, shops, greenhouses, even trees. These shattered relics now litter the towns and countryside - a cost that Albania's tiny economy could have been spared. They even smashed the breweries and ripped up the vineyards; Albania now has to import beer and wine. Before dawn the following morning, we set off by car to visit Albania's oilfields, 100 miles south of Tirana. The rising sun reveals a bleached landscape which might have belonged to the 19th century. Farmers travel to the fields with horses and carts; women tend the crops with hand tools; barefooted children scamper along the roads. Bulging haystacks stand in the farmyards. My companion tells me that, two years ago, the plain we are passing was one huge field owned by the state farm: today, it is dozens of tiny strips. Agricultural output in Albania is rising at an official 14 per cent a year but, unofficially, it is many times that. For the first time in the country's recorded history, the peasants really own the land, not the state or the big landlords. Everywhere there are pill-boxes, erected by the paranoid communists: little ones in clusters, big ones at strategic points, all built with the best concrete available. They drained the economy and are now abandoned - but indestructible. There are said to be more than 1m of them, one for every hectare in the nation. At one point, we pass along the coast: miles of sand and waving pines, utterly unspoilt except for even more pill-boxes. Progress on our journey is slow: horse-drawn carts congest the road, which is too narrow for easy overtaking. Many large lorries are broken down on the verge. Frustrated drivers overtake recklessly. We pass through several towns with dusty streets and raw concrete buildings. Many have brand new mosques and churches: religion is returning. Finally, we come over the brow of a hill: there before us, stretching as far as the eye can see, is a forest of oil derricks. Greasy pools and rusting equipment defile the landscape and sheep graze in between the wells. British Petroleum discovered this field in the 1920s, the largest onshore field in Europe which, literally, sticks out of the ground in oily, sandstone outcrops. The communists exploited it for all it was worth, but lack of know-how and spare parts brought production gradually down to a trickle. Of the 2,000 wells, only 800 are producing, some as little as a couple of barrels a day; indeed, no one is quite sure how much the field actually produces. But the good news is that the communists managed to extract only 4 per cent of the reserves. Premier Consolidated will now help Albpetrol suck out as much as possible of the rest. We hurry back to Tirana for a meeting with Berisha. His office is in a spacious building on Hoxha's eight-lane boulevard; the new deep-red flag with black eagle is fluttering outside. Armed guards salute as we swing into the drive, and a man in a bright green shiny suit ushers us into a waiting room. The furniture, the doors, almost everything is covered in shiny veneer. But Berisha's office is quite different: it is small and furnished comfortably. The president himself turns out to be a pleasant, middle-aged man with a fruity voice and a pale, lightweight suit. A cardiologist by profession, he came only lately into politics and still lives in his third-floor flat at the other end of town. He also speaks fluent English, which was self-taught. It made a considerable impact when he visited London recently and was received at Buckingham Palace. Berisha is a passionate man, and he speaks with a directness and conviction that moves audiences. Another of his skills, apparently, is an ability to make snap decisions - acquired as a doctor. 'The communists' greatest crime,' he tells us, 'was to isolate us from the world. This made Albania a third world country, the only one in Europe.' The remedy is the free market, foreign investment, privatisation and a stock exchange. All this is to be done as quickly as possible, says the president, who has dispatched teams to the UK to study its privatisation experience. 'When we tried to privatise the bread industry, people said: how can you do that? But, in the old days, we had bread only three or five days a week. We had to import wheat and transport it around the country to meet shortages. Today, our warehouses are full.' He relays with pride the results of a Europe-wide Gallup poll which showed that 72 per cent of Albanians approved of privatisation, the highest in any country. Berisha is particularly keen to dispel the image of Albania as a land hostile to outsiders (it was a crime under communism to speak to foreigners or accept foreign finance). 'The attitude of Albanians has completely changed,' he explains. 'They understand the importance of foreign investment.' There is huge scope for outside investment: apart from oil, Albania has copper, chromium and considerable tourism potential. The president is delighted that foreign capital has begun to trickle in, even though Albania lives under 'the shadow of war' in Bosnia and has difficult relations with all its immediate neighbours. The recent imprisonment of five members of the Greek minority on espionage charges has put a severe strain on ties with Athens, and reinforced the argument that less has changed in Albania than the government would have people believe. The Greeks have blocked a proposed aid programme from the European Community. Berisha shrugs: 'We are realistic. We will have to wait.' Back at the airport, there is evidence for his optimism. Two flights, Alitalia and Austrian Airlines, have landed and are disgorging dozens of people with suits and briefcases. There are now daily flights to several European cities, and most are full. On the flight back to London, I am sitting beside Pavli Qesku, the Albanian ambassador to the UK. A lightly-built man with lively, dark eyes and a shock of silver hair, he tells me about his own past. A lexicographer, he has just completed the first comprehensive Albanian-English dictionary. I ask him what characterises Albania and its people, with their unique Illyrian origins. 'The Albanian language survived 500 years of Roman occupation, and then 500 years under the Turks and the constant threat of Slav invasion,' he replies. 'But the first book was not published until 1555, and the first Albanian language school did not open until 1879. The survival gene is very strong.' I had to agree.</p>

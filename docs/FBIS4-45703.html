			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Chernobyl </F> Worries Should Not Detract From Problems Within EU."]    [Text] Brussels, 30 May 94 (Agence Europe) - At the debate  held by the Energy Council last Wednesday on nuclear safety in  countries of Central and Eastern Europe (see EUROPE of 27 May,  p.9), the Irish Minister for Transport, Energy and  Communications, Mr. Brian Cowen, invited his colleagues not to  allow concern on Chernobyl and on nuclear safety in Eastern  Europe as a whole to make one lose sight of the nuclear risk  within the European Union [EU] itself.    Mr. Cowen called for the EU to set up a nuclear inspectorate  to verify the safety of power plants within the EU. According  to the Irish Minister, the "lack of political will" to create  such an inspection system in Europe "weakens the moral authority  of the European Union." "Ireland attaches the greatest possible  importance to nuclear safety matters. We should look to  developments within the European Union as well as voicing  concern about stations in Eastern Europe and notably in former  Soviet Union. I have a deep concern about installations closer  to home and particularly at Sellafield. Concern about Chernobyl  should not blind us to the problem of Sellafield", said Mr.  Cowen.</p>

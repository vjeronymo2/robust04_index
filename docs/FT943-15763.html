			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries slip as FOMC leaves policy unchanged Longer-dated US Treasury prices slipped lower in light trading yesterday as traders and investors remained on the sidelines following the conclusion of the meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee. In late afternoon trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at to 84 3/16 , yielding 7.600 per cent. However, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.084 per cent. Prices at the long end declined from the start in the wake of a modest weakening in the dollar during early trading. The dollar fell because the perception on Wall Street overnight was that the FOMC would not vote at its meeting to raise interest rates to support the ailing US currency. Analysts said the Fed realised it would send the wrong signal to financial markets if it allowed the foreign exchange speculators, who have been selling the dollar, to dictate the direction of monetary policy. Once the meeting ended without an announcement, it was judged the FOMC had decided to leave policy unchanged, at least until more is known about the state of the economy. The next set of important data is due tomorrow when the June employment report is published. Traders said nervousness ahead of the jobs figures explained why longer-dated prices were stuck in negative territory and trading remained subdued. European government bonds traded nervously yesterday, with dealers eyeing the FOMC meeting and currency volatility. German government bonds ended a directionless session slightly higher on short-covering in the futures market. Investors remained sidelined as they awaited the outcome of the FOMC meeting, today's Bundesbank Council meeting, tomorrow's US employment data and the weekend Group of Seven summit in Naples. Bunds shrugged off the three-basis-point reduction in the Bundesbank's minimum securities repurchase rate to 4.93 per cent and the downward revision of May M3 money supply growth to an annualised 13.4 per cent, from a provisional 13.7 per cent. Although most market participants expect another cut in the Bundesbank's 4.5 per cent discount rate this year, few expect to see it today. 'Cutting again with M3 growth so much above target would damage their credibility,' said one trader. The Bundesbank's M3 growth target range is 4 per cent to 6 per cent. UK gilts ended a jittery session slightly lower in thin volume as investors eyed the FOMC meeting. Trading was dominated by activity in the futures pits and dealers reported sporadic and trendless activity in the cash market. D-Mark strength against sterling added to pressure on gilts, causing the UK market to underperform Germany. French bonds ended the day slightly weaker, depressed by the prospect of today's auction of FFr19bn-FFr21bn in medium- and long-dated bonds. Weakness in the French currency against the D-Mark reduced hopes that the Bank of France might follow the Bundesbank's latest rate cut with an easing move today. Swedish bond yields hit a new high for the year, pressured by currency weakness as the krone fell to a low for the year. After Tuesday's auction of government bonds had gone better than expected, many of Tuesday's buyers became sellers yesterday. 'The auction went well because the currency had weakened sharply and yields were high - you got some opportunistic investors into the auction stock who were looking to make money quickly and get out,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The yield on the nine-year benchmark bond closed at a new high at 10.73 per cent, a rise of 20 basis points from Tuesday. Spanish bond yields hit a high for the year, dogged by political uncertainty and fears that heavy funding at the short end will push short rates higher. The 10-year benchmark yield rose as high as 11.11 per cent. In Belgium, reports that domestic troubles were weakening prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's government, and recent nervousness over the budget outlook, caused short-dated yields to rise sharply.</p>

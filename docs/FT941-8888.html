			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / UK Company News: BAT unit estimates earthquake claims Farmers Group, the US insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, expects its exchanges to receive preliminary claims of about Pounds 400m from the California earthquake last month. However, BAT said yesterday that 'a substantial proportion' of this could be recovered from 'reinsurance arrangements. 'While the earthquake losses are significant, the exchanges have more than ample liquid resources to pay claims without disrupting their investment portfolio. Moreover, the claims will have no effect on BAT's reported profits, since the underwriting losses only affect the exchanges. Farmers' earns fee income for various insurance services sold to the exchanges. Farmers has received 27,000 separate reports of loss and expects to pay about 13,500 claims, with its personal (home and motor) and commercial business equally affected. BAT said fewer than one third of its customers buy earthquake insurance, which is perceived as expensive. All policies carry substantial deductibles.</p>

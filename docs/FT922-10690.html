			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Foreign Ministry heaves collective sigh of relief FOR ALL the chaos and confusion surrounding the choice of a successor to Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as German foreign minister, there was an air of relief yesterday at the Foreign Office in Bonn. Senior members of the foreign service feel that the candidate they would have most liked may well have emerged. 'Of course we were stunned like everybody else by the minister's resignation,' said one official diplomatically. 'That does not mean everyone admired him all the time. But the vast majority had a lot of respect for him, not simply as the boss, but because of his achievements. 'He was part of the system in which we worked, and it will take a while to adapt to a machinery in which he no longer plays a part.' When Mrs Irmgard Schwaetzer was instantly nominated for the succession by Mr Genscher's Free Democratic Party (FDP), some doubts were expressed. She had been a competent and hard-working deputy minister responsible for Europe. The feeling both among politicians and diplomats was that she did not really have the stature for the top job. The fact that the FDP parliamentarians rebelled against their leadership, and replaced her with Mr Klaus Kinkel, the justice minister, brings to the job a man who understands the service from the inside, knows all the top diplomats, and was as close as anybody to the ubiquitous Mr Genscher. He ran Mr Genscher's private office when he was interior minister; then he ran his private office in the Foreign Ministry; and then he became head of the ministry's vital planning staff, before moving in 1979 to run Germany's ailing intelligence service, the BND. 'He had the opportunity to look into everything. He was the alter ego of Genscher at the time. And he got to know all the people who now form the senior staff in the service, both at home and abroad,' says a diplomat. To that extent, they have no doubt that he will maintain his former master's priorities: commitment to the European Community and the Atlantic alliance, together with an energetic Ostpolitik to keep the doors open to eastern Europe. What he will lack is perhaps the very personal, almost physical commitment to Ostpolitik which Mr Genscher had, thanks to his hometown of Halle in what used to be East Germany. Mr Kinkel comes from wealthy Swabia, in the south-west, and his instincts are inevitably more westward-looking. He has an extremely high reputation from his career as a very political civil servant in Bonn: for competence, coolness, and the ability to master the most complicated brief. But he is not seen as simply a technocrat, ready to perform the role of glorified ambassador. Even in the Foreign Office, and then at the Justice Ministry as state secretary, he was a very political animal, although he only joined the FDP as a signed up member in January 1991, to become Justice Minister. He is not even a member of parliament, but he is 'a man with a strong personality', according to a deputy from the rival Christian Democrats.</p>

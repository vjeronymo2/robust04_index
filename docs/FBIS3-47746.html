			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 15 January, Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet received at the government office Senator Kerry, member  of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who came for a  courtesy call.    Also present were Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai and a  representative of the Government Office.    Senator Kerry briefed the prime minister on the purposes of  his visit to Vietnam, and greatly appreciated the results of his  meetings and the meetings of other U.S. delegations with senior  officials of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some  offices concerned. He viewed these meetings as discussions of  important significance aimed at contributing to strengthening  the mutual understanding and promoting the normalization of the  U.S.- Vietnamese relations.    The senator noted that on the MIA issue, the two countries  had engaged in a process of perfect cooperation, and that  cooperation is developing its effect. The government and people  of Vietnam, he also noted, have tried their best to cooperate  with the U.S. side in the search for American missing in action  [MIA] as well as in the supply of information on the American  MIAs in Vietnam. The issue now is not in the Vietnamese court  but rather on the American side.    His excellency the senator said: Enduring untold suffering  in  the past, the Vietnamese people are now cooperating with the  U.S. side. They have, however, not been compensated  appropriately for what they have done. The U.S. side will  continue to struggle within its own ranks to overcome the  obstacle -- the MIA issue -- in the normalization of  U.S.-Vietnamese relations, trying to achieve rapid progress in  the U.S.-Vietnamese relations.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet hailed Senator Kerry and other  Americans of goodwill for having expressed their views and  working actively to support the normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese  relations for the sake of peace, stability, and development in  Southeast Asia as well for their cooperation in the MIA issue,  thus helping press ahead with gradually-improving  U.S.-Vietnamese relations.    The prime minister affirmed: It is Vietnam's consistent  policy on the MIA issue to do its utmost for humanitarian  purposes. Satisfactory resolution of the MIA issue will create  mutual understanding and mutual trust with which to resolve  other issues related to the interests of the two nations.    The prime minister said: Although each country has its own  difficulties and advantages, while resolving their domestic  difficulties, the two countries should strive to avoid creating  impact on each other. Vietnam has been and is doing that, and  hopes that the U.S. side will do likewise in order to contribute  to creating favorable conditions for the process of normalizing  U.S.-Vietnamese relations    The prime minister asked his excellency the senator to  convey  to the U.S. President Vietnam's view that it was time for the  two countries to make a new decision on bilateral relations, and  the earlier that Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized, the more  favorable will be the conditions created for the development of  cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with the  interests of both countries.    The prime minister also asked his excellency the senator to  convey his New Year greetings to the U.S. people.    Also, on the afternoon of 14 January, Chairman of the  National Assembly Nong Duc Manh received Senator Kerry at his  office.    Senator Kerry expressed his pleasure over the meeting with  the National Assembly chairman and considered that event very  important, ushering in opportunities for cooperation between the  Vietnamese National Assembly and the U.S. Congress. He also  thanked Chairman Nong Duc Manh and the Vietnamese authorities  for their hospitality to him and his party, and said that his  Vietnam visits had left him with fine impressions of the land  and people of Vietnam.    Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his hope that the results  of the visit would contribute to strengthening the mutual  understanding between the two legislatures and the two peoples.  Prompted by the humanitarian spirit and profound sympathies  toward the families of Americans missing in action, the  Vietnamese National Assembly and people would continue their  cooperation with the U.S. side for the settlement of the MIA  issue.    The U.S. delegation also had working sessions with Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and representatives of the Vietnam MIA  Office.    On the afternoon of 15 January, the delegation left Hanoi  for Ho Chi Minh City and Danang prior to its departure for home.</p>

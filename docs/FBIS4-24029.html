			<p>BFN     [Text] The South African National Defense Force troops have  been deployed around Umtata to contain the mutiny by Transkeian  soldiers. A column of defense force armored vehicles has also  been spotted traveling toward the northern Transkei where the  Maluti Army Base is situated. More than 300 Transkeian soldiers  have been detained for mutinous activities following the  incident last week when troops based in Port St. Johns and  Umtata protested about salaries and took a senior officer  hostage. The officer was freed by troops from Eastern Province  Command.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Jets pound rival capitals of Yemen Yemen edged closer to civil war yesterday as northern and southern army units battled each other in the streets and air force jets pounded rival capitals. Residents in Sanaa, Yemen's federal capital, said southern air force jets struck the international airport and the presidential palace. Explosions rocked the northern capital again later in the day and warplanes flying over the city drew anti-aircraft fire, residents said. It was not immediately clear if the explosions were from a further air raid by rival southern fighter jets. The anti-aircraft fire continued for 15 minutes and came from the southern and eastern parts of the city. The northern-based, government-run Sanaa Radio declared a one-month state of emergency. It ordered all Yemeni citizens to keep off main roads. France said it would evacuate French and European Union citizens from Yemen's port of Aden because of fighting between rival northern and southern troops. 'Because of deteriorating conditions in Yemen, particularly in the region of Aden, France has decided to evacuate its nationals living in Aden as well as those from European Union member states who wish to leave the city,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The southern military command reported that northern warplanes had blasted the airport in Aden and other districts in the capital of the former South Yemen on Wednesday night. European diplomats in Sanaa also reported northern air attacks on Aden. The southern command's statement said two raiding jets were shot down during the attacks, but did not give their types. Yemen has been plagued by political rivalry since Marxist South Yemen and tribal, conservative North Yemen merged four years ago to form a single republic with a 14m population. Differences over power-sharing prevented integration of the armed forces has led to a power struggle with renewed confrontations erupting last week when the south said one of its brigades in the north had been defeated in a two-day tank battle near Sanaa. Clouds of smoke rose yesterday from the vicinity of the presidential palace on the outskirts of Sanaa. A diplomat said southern forces were shelling the compound with artillery. It was not clear if President Ali Abdullah Saleh was inside. There was shooting on the road to the Red Sea port of Hodeida, while sporadic fire clattered on the northern outskirts of the capital where the airport is located. Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East with a modest oil production of about 335,000 barrels per day, of which 140,000 barrels come from the south. Up to 30 foreign oil companies are operating in the main oilfields.</p>

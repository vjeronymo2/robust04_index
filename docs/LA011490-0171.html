			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA STEPS ON THE GAS, HOLDS OFF USD  </P> <P> What, Paul Westhead worry?  </P> <P> Nah.  </P> <P> The man has seen a lot of baskets in his five years at Loyola Marymount.  </P> <P> So there was little cause for concern when exuberant, upset-minded University  of San Diego began pressing his 23rd-ranked Lions Saturday night in front of a  standing-room-only crowd listed at 2,500 in the USD Sports Center.  </P> <P> As long as the pace was furious and the score high, Westhead was happy.  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount usually wins these games, and Saturday was no different. The  final: Loyola Marymount 119, USD 112.  </P> <P> It was the Lions' fourth consecutive victory, their second in the West Coast  Conference. The 11-3 start equals their best ever. In 1987-88, Loyola started  10-3 and also defeated USD in the 14th game. They did not lose again until the  second round of the NCAA Tournament and finished 28-4.  </P> <P> USD, which dropped its second in a row after a three-game winning streak, fell  to 6-9 and 1-2.  </P> <P> "I like that pace. I knew we were all right because the score was so high,"  said Westhead, who added that his team did not play up to potential.  </P> <P> "Sub-par," Lion forward Bo Kimble said. "I know we can play a lot better, but  we've got to hand it to San Diego. They played well. They had us scouted well.  They were prepared."  </P> <P> USD did play well but lost to the Lions for the fifth time in a row. In each,  Loyola has scored more than a 100 points. The Lions, second in the nation in  scoring with a 117.6 average going in, hit 100 for the 12th time in 14 games.  </P> <P> "They're so unique that they make it hard for you to adjust," USD Coach Hank  Egan said.  </P> <P> Hank Gathers led all scorers with 32 points, the first time he has led the  Lions in scoring since a fainting incident Dec. 9 against UC Santa Barbara. Bo  Kimble, the nation's scoring leader, was nine under his season average with 28  points. Jeff Fryer added 19.  </P> <P> Dondi Bell had a career-high 20 points for USD. Craig Cottrell had 18 and John  Jerome and Wayman Strickland 17 apiece.  </P> <P> USD raced to an early lead, scoring the first six points as LMU missed its  first four shots. The Toreros held the advantage until Per Stumer made a  three-pointer with 12:20 left, giving the Lions their first lead, 19-16.  </P> <P> LMU took a 34-27 lead with 8:45 left, but two Craig Cottrell layups, a Dondi  Bell five-footer and a Kelvin Woods layup, sandwiched around a Kimble basket,  pulled USD to within 36-35.  </P> <P> Minutes later, Wayman Strickland tied it, 41-41, with a pair of free throws.  But Kimble quickly answered with a three-pointer to put LMU back on top.  </P> <P> Late in the half, the Lions rallied for nine consecutive points and took their  biggest lead before halftime, 56-45, with 2:30 left. But two baskets each by  Cottrell and Dondi Bell pulled USD within eight.  </P> <P> After LMU's John O'Connell made one of two free throws, USD's Gylan Dottin got  his first two points, free throws with two seconds left, to end the first-half  scoring.  </P> <P> Despite repeated efforts by USD to slow the pace -- Egan called four timeouts  in the first half -- the point totals were easily the most scored and allowed  by USD this season.  </P> <P> USD got to within five a number of times in the second half, but Loyola  Marymount eventually built a double-digit lead with about five minutes left.  The Toreros scored the last nine points.  </P> <P> As is normal when the Lions play, there were a number of spectacular sequences.  Similar flying left-hand slams by Kimble were two of the better ones. The  first, at 14:27 of the second half, came off a long pass from Tom Peabody. The  second came seconds later after a USD turnover. Bell had a pair of decent  two-hand slams, but a one-handed Michael Jordan-like jam over an LMU player  brought the loudest cheer from USD's biggest crowd of the year.  </P></p>

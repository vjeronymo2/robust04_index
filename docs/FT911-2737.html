			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Guinness Mahon shows Pounds 36m loss - Pounds 49m rights issue will lift group asset base to Pounds 94m GUINNESS MAHON Holdings, the merchant banking group, yesterday confirmed plans for a Pounds 49.3m rights issue following disclosure of midway losses of Pounds 35.5m mainly due to provision against bad debts. The Bank of Yokohama, which owns 65 per cent of the company, will effectively underwrite the issue and tighten management control. The issue will be on the basis of seven for four at a price of 44p. The shares closed last night unchanged at 45p. Bank of Yokohama will take up its entitlement, and will also sub-underwrite the balance, which is being underwritten by Schroder Wagg and Lehman Brothers International. The Japanese bank will advance Guinness Mahon a Pounds 30m bridging loan so that its capital ratios remain in order until the rights issue proceeds are received. The issue will raise the group's net assets from Pounds 44.4m to Pounds 93.6m. Details of the capital-raising were accompanied by changes in the top management structure and group strategy. Mr Geoffrey Bell, the executive chairman, will move to a non-executive role. Mr David Potter, who runs the merchant bank, will become chief executive of the group and chairman of the merchant bank. Bank of Yokohama's representation on the 12-person board will rise from three to four with the appointment as a non-executive director of Mr Takaaki Shinozaki. He will also become deputy chairman of the merchant bank. More Yokohama executives will also join Guinness Mahon's management, and will play a larger part in credit and lending decisions. Several executives have left the group, and a number of new appointments were announced yesterday. Mr Bell said the group's strategy would be refocused away from corporate lending towards fee-earning services, particularly in the corporate finance area. Asset management and securities trading, both of which are benefiting from the recent upturn in the stock market, would also be developed. Leasing activities would be closed down. However Mr Bell warned that it might be necessary to make further loan loss provisions, and the bank was unlikely to return to profitability for some time because loans were not earning interest. 'The next stages in the development of GMH will be very challenging and the need to succeed is paramount,' said Mr Bell. The results for the six months ending March 31 showed a loss of Pounds 35.5m, mainly because of a bad debt provision of Pounds 30m. The leasing division, which concentrated on smaller computing service and printing companies, needed a provision of Pounds 7m. The property book required provisions of Pounds 3m, as did the Irish subsidiary, and the shipping book. There were also provisions of Pounds 10m against two large corporate names, one of which is believed to be Polly Peck. Non-merchant banking activities made a loss of Pounds 492,000. In the first six months of last year, there was a net profit of Pounds 2m. No interim dividend is to be paid (0.8p)- a total of 1.45p was paid last time. Mr Ken-ichi Ozawa, deputy chairman of GMH, said the Bank of Yokohama had confidence in the new management team and its ability to overcome 'this difficult situation'. He said he believed the group could 'regain its position and reputation as an important force in UK merchant banking capitalising on its Japanese connections.' See Lex</p>

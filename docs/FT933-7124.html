			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Struggling with new standards - BSI's environmental management system may cause difficulties for small firms Many small businesses struggling with BS5750, the British Standards Institution's quality systems standard, may soon have to grapple with BS7750, its successor for environmental management systems. The BSI decided to develop the standard because it wanted to respond to increasing concerns about environmental performance. BS7750 details a specification for an environmental management system that will enable an organisation to ensure compliance with its chosen environmental policies. It also contains advice on how to put the system in place. Having the management system will facilitate environmental auditing of the organisation and compliance with BS7750 will prepare it for participation in the EC's eco-management and audit scheme (Emas). The environmental management system laid down in BS7750 has a lot in common with that of BS5750. Indeed, the similarity in the numbering of the two standards is intentional to demonstrate the strong links between them. BS7750 can be seen as an add-on to BS5750. Both standards have something else in common: just as compliance with BS5750 is no guarantee of an organisation's output being of high quality, since low-quality targets can be set within the system, so compliance with BS7750 does not ensure good environmental performance. Toxic emission targets, for example, could be set to unacceptably high levels. A version of the standard has existed for over a year, but as yet the BSI does not think it has been developed enough to issue certificates of compliance. Although at least one consultancy, SGS Yarsley ICS, has been granting certificates, the BSI regards this as 'premature and misguided'. But a pilot programme earlier this year to test the standard in more than 100 organisations has now ended, and a draft of the revised standard is out for public consultation until the beginning of September. The final version should appear by the beginning of December and widespread certification should start after accreditation procedures have been set up to vouch for certifiers. In fact, the only significant revisions in the standard are those bringing it into line with Emas, under which businesses will undergo environmental audits and publish results. Emas is set to get fully underway in 1995. The concern of small businesses is that BS7750 will cause them problems similar to those of BS5750: disproportionately high implementation and certification costs, and the thinning down of tender lists by excluding those who do not have it. 'BS5750 is a nightmare for small businesses,' says Bernard Juby, trade spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses. 'BS7750 we see as the incestuous cousin - it's even worse.' Juby finds the standard more nebulous than BS5750, and is apprehensive of some councils and large companies making it mandatory in all but name for suppliers, in a similar way to that in which some have dealt with BS5750. 'It's supposed to be a voluntary standard,' he complains of the latter. Some of the businesses from the pilot scheme also think BS7750 is vaguer than BS5750. 'It's probably slightly woollier because the subject area is less easy to pin down and define,' says Sam Phillips, engineering manager at the Mann Organisation, a 50-employee company which recycles computers and electronic equipment. The business has had to abandon implementation of BS7750 for the time being, partly because it is still busy with BS5750. 'It would be very, very difficult I think for anyone to implement BS7750 if they haven't actually got BS5750,' says Phillips. 'If you're coming at it cold, particularly small businesses without BS5750, they won't know their arse from their elbow,' agrees Richard Hall, TQM systems manager of the Renlon Group, a Pounds 6m turnover, 60-employee property preservation and construction company. Chris Sheldon, the BSI's environmental spokesman, disagrees. He says experiences on the pilot scheme varied. For example the group of companies from the print and packaging sector, which included many small and medium-sized businesses, say they do not think BS5750 is a prerequisite for BS7750. The signs are not promising for small businesses worrying about the expense of compliance with another standard. Phillips and Hall have experienced interest in their environmental management systems from large companies and local councils. 'They haven't actually put pressure on us in the sense of having it documented, but we have been audited by a couple of them to make sure that what we're doing meets their standards,' says Phillips. He thinks that at some point there may be insistence on compliance with BS7750 before contracts are awarded. One large company the Mann Organisation does business with is IBM. 'The most likely position we would want to take with our suppliers for BS7750, once it does finally emerge, is, in a nutshell, encouragement,' says Eric Dewhurst, engineering services manager at IBM's manufacturing and development site in Greenock, Scotland. 'It would not be a requirement in the sense of being mandatory.' He thinks the company's policy will be similar to the one for BS5750, with which it normally expects big companies to comply, but not necessarily small ones. The Renlon Group is applying for membership of the London Borough of Merton's approved contractors' scheme. BS5750 certification is not mandatory to get onto tender lists for the council's contracts. 'We don't insist upon it, but obviously when contractors are vetted to come in on the scheme we ask for various safeguards in that respect,' says David Jones, a senior building surveyor in the council's property services department. However, Jones says the award of contracts can depend on whether a business has a certificate or not, and it may not always be possible to take small businesses' circumstances into account. Might they sometimes lose out as a result? 'Possibly.' Jones says that at present environmental management systems are sometimes taken into account when awarding contracts and that compliance with BS7750 may be taken into account in the future. 'If suppliers can show that they're moving towards that direction then I think we would take that on board in the selection stage of tendering.' The BSI is against mandatory application of BS5750 and is listening to small businesses' criticisms. It has set up an independent committee with small business representatives which is undertaking a survey of problems. This may provide little insurance against future problems given the legal and social context of BS7750. Large organisations are concerned about public perceptions of their environmental performance and have legal responsibilities under statutes such as the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Water Resources Act 1991 and the Control of Pollution Act 1974. 'There will be an increasing trend for companies to require their suppliers to have some form of qualification and the ready-made qualification off the shelf is BS7750,' says Michael Renger, a partner in the environmental department of lawyers Nabarro Nathanson.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Miyazawa in plea on US cars: Japanese industry urged to ease trade tensions THE Japanese car industry was yesterday urged by Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa to help Americans sell cars in Japan and to mend trade tensions during President George Bush's visit next week, AP reports from Tokyo. Speaking in a televised new year's news conference, Mr Miyazawa said: 'I am asking industry leaders to take more seriously and compassionately the US situation, symbolised by General Motors' shutdowns.' GM announced last month it would eliminate 74,000 jobs and close 21 plants in North America over the next four years. Mr Miyazawa, attempting to emphasise to the Japanese the need to help the US auto industry, said: 'GM is like the Stars and Stripes for the American people.' He said it came as a great psychological blow for many Americans to witness their car industry losing out to Japanese competition. President Bush, accompanied by the chairmen of the three leading US-owned car makers and 18 other business leaders, is due in Tokyo on January 7 to discuss ways of narrowing Japan's Dollars 41bn (Pounds 22.5bn) trade surplus with the US. Vehicles and car parts account for three-quarters of that gap. Senator Carl Levin, whose state, Michigan, is home to the big three car companies, said last week that the US Congress might enact legislation punishing Japan for its restrictions on importing US goods if the president's visit did not yield results. Last month, big Japanese car makers said they planned nearly to double purchases of US car parts by 1994 as part of a government-inspired effort to reduce the trade surplus. made parts. On another key issue between Tokyo and Washington, Mr Miyazawa hinted Japan eventually would ease its ban on rice imports.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HOUSING ORDINANCE DEFEATED  </P> <P> The Avalon City Council voted 3 to 2 against adopting an ordinance that would  have required developers of new commercial projects to provide housing for half  of their employees.  </P> <P> Council members Hal Host, Paul Puma and Irene Strobel voted against final  adoption of the ordinance. The vote reversed a 4-1 decision by the council to  adopt the ordinance at its introduction two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Instead, while a new ordinance is being drafted, the council voted unanimously  Tuesday to direct the Planning Commission to advise developers that they will  be required to build low- and moderate-income employee housing after the new  housing ordinance is approved, City Clerk Shirley Davy said.  </P> <P> The defeated ordinance would have required new commercial developments with 10  or more employees to provide housing for 50% of those employees during the peak  tourist season in August.  </P> <P> During a public hearing Tuesday, however, residents and council members  expressed concern about the wording of the ordinance and argued that the  ordinance did not set housing requirements for existing businesses that may  expand in the future.  </P> <P> The council, which will draw up the new ordinance, set a 60-day deadline to  come up with a new draft and requested that public comment be submitted in  writing, Davy said.  </P></p>

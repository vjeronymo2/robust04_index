			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> James Brown Shut Down: "Godfather of Soul" James Brown, recently freed from  prison, won't be giving a concert later this month as he had planned.  </P> <P> South Carolina corrections officials say a May 16 performance by Brown was not  and will not be approved. "This looks like a commercial endeavor on the part of  Mr. Brown and some of his associates . . . and does not fall within the scope  of his job," said prison spokesman Francis Archibald. Brown, 56, was freed from  prison and placed in a work release counseling job last month. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

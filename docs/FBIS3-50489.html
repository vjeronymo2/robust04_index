The nation's legislators  approved the tax reform bill sent by the Executive Branch but  with substantial modifications. Here we have a report by  Eugenia Salazar:    [Begin Salazar recording] Heinz Moeller, leader of the  Social  Christian parliamentary faction, maintained that the Ecuadoran  people succeeded in view of the Executive Branch's attempt to  increase IVA [value added tax] by 8 percent under the pretext of  a drop in the oil prices at the international market. Moeller  said that his party headed the struggle against the taxes and  rejected the government intentions to increase them. The public  backed this position and this prevented the government from  insisting on an IVA increase.    The Social Christian deputy praised the Executive Branch's  political decision to order its deputies to remain in the  sessions to permit the required quorum. This decision permitted  the approval of the tax reform bill without the 8-percent  increase that was initially proposed by the government. [end  recording]</p>

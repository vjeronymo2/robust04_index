In the Ibis the Dax strengthened slightly to 2,067.17. Turnover was DM6.5bn.

Philips was the most actively traded stock, going against the trend with a gain of 10 cents to Fl 54.80 in volume of some 1.5m shares. Unilever, off 70 cents at Fl 194.00, was affected by reports of lower domestic sales for its washing powders and the weaker dollar.

DENMARK was holding its general election yesterday. Unibank Securities said that it expected the outcome to be a Social Democratic government with or without the participation of the Social Liberals.

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Population growth outpacing food supply, report says THE WORLD'S oceans can no longer sustain the demands for fish made on them by a hungry and growing world population, according to a new report by an international think tank. Analysts at the Worldwatch Institute cite decreasing global supplies of fish as one element in an emerging scarcity of sources of protein. Harvests of two other important sources of protein - soyabeans and meat - increased slightly in 1992, but failed to keep up with world population growth. Global fish catches decreased from 100m tonnes in 1989 to 97m tonnes in 1990 and have remained close to that level. The amount of fish harvested per head of world population has declined 8 per cent since 1988. The 1992 soyabean harvest set a world record, yielding nearly 114m tonnes, but like fish, the output per person has declined. Almost all of the 1992 crop came from the US, Brazil, Argentina and China. Growth in world meat supplies has fallen below its traditional pace since 1990, which Worldwatch analysts interpret as an indication of the increasing difficulty of expanding production of grass-eating livestock. Declines in meat production, concentrated in eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and the European Community, were offset by modest production increases in China and the US. News of world grain supplies was relatively brighter as stocks on hand at the start of the 1993 harvest were up 19m tonnes from 1992 to a level sufficient to feed the world for 73 days. Analysts noted, however, that increases in global stocks masked regional decreases such as that in southern Africa, where drought caused sharply lower maize harvest. The report also found decreasing world use of fertiliser, largely because of the removal of subsidies for their purchase in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The study found capacity to generate power with wind continued to grow in 1992, while nuclear power capacity was at a virtual standstill. Cigarette smoking held steady from 1991 to 1992 breaking a trend of almost uninterrupted growth since the end of World War II, the study found.

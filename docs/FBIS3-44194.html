			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Commentary" column] </F>   [Text] The final preparation was carried out on 18 January  through the establishment of a transitional president and a  transitional parliament with council committees ensuring that  the Afrikaner/Boer nation can formally, and with the approval  and in the presence of the Afrikaner nation, attend Conservative  Party [CP] has never been inclined to negotiate with the actual  or potential enemy of the nation over the nation's unnegotiable  "own country" and "self-determination."    Despite this view, it had been important during the last  three years to point out to the nation's enemy during  "negotiations" what are in fact the CP's, and therefore the  Afrikaner/Boer peoples', "unnegotiables."    The capitulating NP government has all along been secretly  whispering to the leaders of the Afrikaner nation's enemy,  saying the Afrikaners/Boers are just big cowards like the NP's  leaders, and that there was no need to comply with the  Afrikaner/Boer demands regarding unnegotiable land and  self-determination.    For example, a prominent ANC [African National Congress]  leader admitted to PATRIOT that the government's people "lied to  them about the conservative Afrikaner's determination and  ability" to assert themselves should their sovereign existence  be threatened.    After the negotiations it became blatantly obvious that the  enemy had no intention whatsoever of favorably looking -- before  or after 27 April -- at any of the Afrikaner/Boer's  self-determination ideals.    That is why CP leader Dr. Hartzenberg personally told Mr.  Mandela what the Afrikaner people's unnegotiables were.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Business Traveller: Trouble spots - Travel Update Mexico: The situation around San Cristobal de la Casas in southern Mexico is still tense, following clashes between armed peasants and the army. An estimated 200 Mexican soldiers patrolled the streets and warned residents to stay inside for safety. The peasants, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army and say they are fighting for indigenous rights, took over what the government now says was six cities in the southern state of Chiapas in New Year's day raids. A rebel commander identifying himself as Comandante Marcos also told reporters that the uprising was tied to the North American Free Trade Agreement, the pact linking the US, Canada and Mexico in a free trade zone. 'The North American Free Trade Agreement is the death certificate for the indigenous people of Mexico. We rose up in arms to respond to (President) Salinas's death sentence against our people,' he said. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued the following advice to travellers to other regions: Philippines: Power blackouts of up to eight hours happen daily. Violence is a serious problem in parts of north Luzon and the Visayas. A curfew is in force in Azerbaijan and all border areas should be avoided. Non-essential visits to Baku should be postponed. All visits to Tajikistan should be postponed because of political and ethnically based clashes.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Vickers to cut final dividend after setback: Deficit reaches Pounds 12.4m after sales halve at Rolls-Royce - Shares rise 7p VICKERS, the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Challenger tanks group, yesterday cut its final dividend after incurring a loss of Pounds 12.4m before tax in 1991, down from a pre-tax profit of Pounds 96.5m. The loss stemmed from Rolls-Royce where sales halved in 1991. However, the dividend reduction was not as severe as some feared and the shares rose 7p to 169p. Sir David Plastow, chairman and chief executive, described the cut as 'prudent'. The group is one of the first to report in the current results season and its action will be noted by other companies who must decide whether to reduce the payment to shareholders. Vickers held its interim dividend at 3.7p, but warned last September that the final might be cut if there was no improvement at Rolls-Royce. The proposed final is 2.3p, down from 6.2p, to give a total of 6p, a fall of 39.4 per cent from 9.9p. Analysts feared that the final dividend might be cut to 1p. They now expect the new pay-out level to be sustainable. The 6p net dividend gives a gross yield on the shares of 4.7 per cent at yesterday's closing price. Group sales fell 16.2 per cent to Pounds 652.2m. The automotive division, which includes Rolls-Royce, incurred a trading loss of Pounds 17.3m compared with a profit of Pounds 41.2m, and also accounted for the bulk of a Pounds 34.4m exceptional charge relating to redundancy and rationalisation costs. Aside from Rolls-Royce, Vickers's other divisions maintained trading profits in aggregate. Defence and aerospace activities fell to Pounds 15.8m from Pounds 18.1m. Last year Vickers won an order from the UK government for Challenger 2 tanks which Sir David said would start to make profits in 1993, and could lead to export orders. The defence order book is now Pounds 800m against Pounds 200m a year ago. After tax and the Pounds 16.2m cost of the dividend the retained loss was Pounds 25.5m, against a profit of Pounds 38.4m. The balance sheet had net debt at the year-end of Pounds 54.7m (against net cash of Pounds 11.5m last time), 22.4 per cent of shareholders' funds. This gearing was lower than the market feared and was cited as a reason for the share price rise. Lex, Page 20 Editorial Comment, Page 18 Saab results, Page 25</p>

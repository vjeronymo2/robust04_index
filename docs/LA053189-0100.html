			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Louisiana House killed a bill that would have abolished state affirmative  action programs, handing state Rep. David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader,  his first legislative defeat since winning his seat in a special election in  February. Duke, a Republican from Metairie, branded the House action as  "cowardice." The measure, which also would have banned state contract set-aside  programs for minorities, had been approved by a House committee, but the full  House voted 44 to 41 in a procedural move to table the bill, effectively  killing it. The motion to table was made by Rep. Mitch Landrieu, a New Orleans  Democrat whose district contains a large percentage of blacks. Duke vowed to  fight to have his measure tacked onto another bill as an amendment.  </P></p>

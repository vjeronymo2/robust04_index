			<p><P> January 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO MORE PEOPLE SHOT AT HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> Two people were shot and critically wounded Sunday night at the Carmelitos  Housing Project in Long Beach, just 16 hours after a resident was killed and  two others were injured in another attack there, police said Monday.  </P> <P> The shootings appear to have been drug-related, though not connected, police  said.  </P> <P> In the latest shooting, the two victims, Robert Savage, 38, of Wilmington and  Howard Demery, 28, of Long Beach, were critically wounded during a robbery  attempt "that occurred during the selling of drugs," Long Beach Police  Detective George Fox said.  </P> <P> "A victim, who was apparently selling drugs, was robbed and shot," Fox said.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear which man was allegedly selling drugs or if any  money was taken.  </P> <P> The two men were taken to Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where they were  being treated for multiple gunshot wounds. No arrests were made, the detective  said.  </P> <P> In the earlier shooting, Ana Lechuga, 20, and her boyfriend, Mario Garcia, 20,  were shot at their Carmelitos apartment at 4:30 a.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> Police said the couple argued about "money owed for drugs" with a visitor, who  then shot them both in the head, Fox said. Garcia died shortly after being  taken to the hospital. Lechuga was in critical condition Monday with three  gunshot wounds in the head and neck. A third victim, Deborah Thomas, 27, was in  stable condition with arm and leg wounds. Montie Harvey, 29, who lives in the  housing complex, was arrested custody and booked on charges of murder and  attempted murder.  </P> <P> Officials at the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission, which  oversees the Carmelitos complex, said they have known for months about drug  activity at Carmelitos, which until a few years ago was considered a model  public housing project. Officials said security measures have been put in place  to try to stem the drug problem.  </P> <P> Although the commission said that drug activity has abated somewhat, residents  say that five shooting victims in 16 hours does not bode well for the crime  prevention efforts.  </P> <P> "I've been here for 25 years and I'm at the point where I'm scared to walk  around outside, anywhere, even the parking lot," said a 27-year-old mother of  one, who lives close to the apartment where Sunday's first shooting took place.  </P> <P> "When I grew up here, I felt safe. People used to say bad things about us  because we lived in the project. But Carmelitos wasn't half as bad as it was  talked about. Now, it's much worse than they talk about. People on the outside  don't know what to make of it. They are getting scared, too, so they just keep  quiet."  </P> <P> Carlos Jackson, assistant executive director of the commission, said, "I admit  that at Carmelitos, like other major (public housing) sites, we are having a  problem with drugs. But we have identified the main players and we are in the  process of arresting or serving eviction notices to the residents who are  creating the problem."  </P> <P> Jackson added that criminal activity at the project has decreased since October  when the commission contracted with the Long Beach Police Department to send in  a nightly two-car, four-officer patrol.  </P> <P> However, the police patrols at Carmelitos had to be dropped recently because of  the costs, said Milton Patterson, manager of several county housing projects  including Carmelitos. Because of the recent violence, the commission plans to  renew the contract, Patterson said.  </P></p>

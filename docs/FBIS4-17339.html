			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Irina Savvateyeva report: "The Nature of Social Policy Has </F> Been Agreed in the Government"]    [Text] The latest session of the Russian Federation  Government Presidium took place Thursday. It can be said that  the first question was "routine": Reports from officials  responsible for the implementation of the 9 March government  decree "On the Situation of the Russian Economy and the  Prospects for Its Development in 1994" were heard. In recent  times, weekly accounts of work done have become a tradition at  Presidium sessions.    But it was Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan who delivered  the  report concerning the main question: "On the Draft of the Basic  Guidelines for the Social Policy of the Russian Federation  Government for 1994."    Social problems the government intends to tackle in line  with  the "Basic Guidelines" are as follows: the fall in living  standards for the bulk of the population; the dramatic  intensification of social stratification; and the increase in  the extent of hidden unemployment, and the threat of its  escalation into overt unemployment....    The government intends to resolve these problems within the  framework of preserving (and ultimately improving) correlations  between the minimum working wage, pensions, grants, and  benefits, and the size of minimum subsistence requirement.    As the Ministry of Labor sees it, this can be achieved  primarily by "protecting the fixed incomes of the population  from inflation on the basis of various forms of indexation of  the pay rates and salary scales of workers in budget-financed  sectors." (It is typical that the intention is to "protect"  from inflation, and not to fight it.) Admittedly, there is one  condition -- that protective measures should be implemented  "with due account of the financial possibilities of the state."    But it is proposed that "urgent assistance to those  categories of the population whose per capita income is lower  than the minimum subsistence requirement" be given to the  regions. Along with this, the need to create economic and legal  conditions providing an incentive for high labor productivity by  the country's able-bodied sector is pointed out.    The Ministry of Labor also proposes to perfect the system of  taxation for consumption funds and the revenues of individuals,  which, according to the evaluations of certain experts, may  culminate in the drastic wage control.    For the purposes of averting "wholesale, mass unemployment"  it is proposed to implement a Federal Employment Promotion  Program for 1994. Incidentally, this program was also examined  at the Government Presidium session.    The Ministry of Labor also proposes setting in motion a  mechanism for the regional regulation of employment on the basis  of socially permissible levels of unemployment, which will be  defined by each Federation component. When this level is  reached, it is recommended that special measures, including  administrative measures, be taken to restrict unemployment.    What is interesting is that the Ministry of Labor believes  that the funds envisaged by the 1994 Budget for social needs  will be sufficient to implement the proposed program. Provided,  of course, that the financial resources of enterprises and  extrabudgetary funds are also harnessed.    After a discussion, the government approved the "Basic  Guidelines for Social Policy for 1994."</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: Foie gras and confit for perfect parties THE story began in 1985 when Michel and Elizabeth Rostaing were married. Everything about the wedding was very English. Everything, that is, except the champagne which Michel brought over from Oger in France. It went down a treat. His guests (now clients) thought it excellent and, six years on, he is still supplying friends and customers with this white grape nectar from Champagne, called Jean Milan, Grand Cru, Brut Special (Pounds 12). From there, it snowballed. The French consulate was enthusiastic and helped to make the project easy; so much so that Elizabeth hit on the idea of introducing her English friends to French duck foie gras. In the heart of foie gras country, the Landes, in southern France, she knew a man called Andignac who raised duck for the region's famous product. She bought his foie gras and began selling it in England. Now, she too, has a faithful following. I bought a loaf of her pure fresh foie gras (250g - Pounds 12) which came vacuum-packed and kept for several weeks in the fridge. It was the perfect answer when I was called on by my husband to entertain important clients. How to impress them? Easy. A bottle of Sauterne was put on ice. I served each guest with a slice of foie gras nestling in a bed of endive and mushrooms dressed lightly with a walnut oil vinaigrette. My husband is still basking in the afterglow of the success. Another of her specialities is confit de canard, the essential ingredient for an authentic French cassoulet, for which you need: 1 kg of haricot beans;  1/2 kg of brisket of lamb; 6 pork sausages (sliced); 150g of smoked bacon; 1 kg of confit and its fat; 4 onions; 4 tomatoes; 4 garlic cloves;  1/2 bottle of wine; bouquet garni; cloves; salt and pepper. Soak the haricot beans and cook them in a saucepan of water with a clove-studded onion, bacon, salt and peppper and wine for 90 minutes. While the beans are cooking, open the jar of confit, keep the duck aside and stir-fry the garlic, tomatoes, the rest of the onions, lamb and sausages in the duck fat. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Strain the beans, reserving the stock and add them to the meat, along with enough stock to cover the lot, and cook slowly for half an hour. Add the confit to the cassoulet and continue cooking for 30 minutes. Another delicious treat worth trying, too, is the foie gras entier (Pounds 14.80 for 180g) I found it very rich and smooth with a good, strong flavour. It was served best with chunks of coarse country bread (try Sainsbury's pain de campagne - 79p) and a salad of tomatoes and black olives. Prices for confit de canard start at Pounds 5.50 for 750g, and there is also a selection of terrines at Pounds 2.50 for 180g - the terrine de canard au poivre vert is possibly the tastiest. It is worth noting that Rostaing sells goose fat (Pounds 3.10 for 800g). Forget butter. Any French chef worth his onions cooks with goose fat. (The chef at Hilaire in London SW7 is famed for his salad Nicoise featuring fresh tuna cooked in goose fat). Rostaing's products were reasonably priced and she will deliver to Londoners and has an efficient postage and packing service for those outside the capital. For an order form ring 081-788-6908. Rostaing's foie gras and duck products are all cooked. If you want to really lash out then you can buy raw foie gras. Very few shops stock it but you can buy the whole liver, vacuum packed from Boucherie Lamartine, at 229 Ebury Street, London SW1. Tel: 071-730-4175. It will cost you about Pounds 41 for a 2lb liver. The best culinary treat to my mind is hot foie gras and for that you need 1lb of foie gras cru (raw) sliced into eight. Season it and marinate it in a wineglassful of Armagnac. Then fry each slice in your hot goose fat. Serve it on fried bread, decorate with a few snips of chives, and tip the juices from the pan over each portion. It is food for the gods.</p>

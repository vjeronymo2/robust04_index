			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Business and the Law: Individuals gain right to apply directly to court - Legal Briefs Individuals will be able to apply directly to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg from October 1. This follows ratification of Protocol Nine to the European Human Rights Convention by Romania, bringing the number of nations that have done so to 10 - the number required for it to come into effect. Under article 25 of the convention, any person claiming a human rights violation can bring an action against the state responsible by applying to the European Commission of Human Rights. If the commission cannot reach a friendly settlement of the issue, it makes a finding on the facts as to whether there has been a violation. At present, only the commission or the state concerned can refer a case to the court. Under the new system, the individual concerned will be able to apply to the court. A panel of three judges will then decide whether the case should be heard. From October 1, the protocol will come into force in the 10 states that have ratified it: Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Romania and Slovakia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Rodriguez and Samuel Prieto in Chiapas State </F> from the "Good Morning from Mexico" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] The place and date for the peace talks  have not been confirmed yet as some security and logistics  problems are still pending. It seems, however, the meeting will  not take place in Ocosingo or Las Margaritas, bastions of the  Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN.    On 6 February, well-informed sources mentioned two possible  sites: Palenque, located approximately 200 km from San Cristobal  de las Casas, which has good access roads, or Comitan, located  approximately 80 km from San Cristobal de las Casas, an area  with a great degree of EZLN influence.    In the early hours of 6 February, EZLN communiques were  received in San Cristobal de las Casas demanding the  establishment of security cordons by nongovernmental human  rights organizations to provide more guarantees. Here is the  reply given by Gerardo Pacheco, representative of the  nongovernmental human rights organizations.    [Pacheco] We are now in the initial process of reviewing the  possibilities of establishing security cordons. Right now we are  trying to adequately interpret the letter addressed to us, after  which we will decide how we will give the necessary support to  the proposed security cordons. We are also waiting for reactions  from nongovernmental human rights organizations in other parts  of the country, as the letter is addressed to all Mexican  nongovernmental human rights organizations. In that manner, we  can organize and coordinate efforts to make possible the  creation of security cordons providing specific guarantees  proposed by the EZLN.    [Prieto] International Red Cross representative Maria Lude  explained the Red Cross' role in establishing buffer zones in  areas where the communities are becoming desperate. The creation  of the so-called buffer zones in the Chiapas highlands has  created some confusion among the people regarding the  International Red Cross' role.    [Lude] I will take this opportunity to explain the  International Red Cross Committee's role. As I said, our main  concern -- and this is how we operate in all countries -- is  finding out what the main needs are. Our representatives are now  in the area, evaluating the people's needs, and if necessary  they will propose ways to provide assistance. At the same time,  there is a great solidarity movement in Mexico toward that zone.  In no way will we prevent Mexicans from helping Mexicans. Our  role will be limited, as I said, to reopening those areas, after  which we will let national institutions do the work. I really do  not think national institutions need our presence to carry out  their work once the situation returns to normal.    In the past, it was confirmed they are efficient  institutions, and if they really have the necessary assistance,  we are not the ones to decide if people should or should not  receive assistance by the Mexican people. What we will do is to  work based on the people's needs, which is our policy. Once the  zone is reopened, organizations willing to help can take over.    [Prieto] The entry of the International Red Cross Committee  in the buffer zones does not mean all nutritional and medical  problems will be resolved.    [Rodriguez] Sunday, 6 February was a normal day in San  Cristobal and nearby communities. Apparently, everything was  calm in the Chiapas highlands.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MIRA MESA WINS BY PLAYING AS OCEANSIDE COACH FEARED  </P> <P> Oceanside Coach Steve Kinder made three observations before the Pirates played  Mira Mesa for the Chula Vista Tournament boys' basketball title Friday night at  Chula Vista.  </P> <P> Two were correct and negated the other as No. 10 Mira Mesa defeated Oceanside,  95-82.  </P> <P> Kinder's first two comments had to do with defending Mira Mesa. He said his  team had to keep the ball away from Marc Ziegler and be wary of the Marauders'  surprising quickness. The other concerned his team: "A score in the 75-85 range  would be to our advantage."  </P> <P> Oceanside was unable to keep the ball out of Ziegler's big hands, and Mira Mesa  showed off its quickness by beating the Pirates at their own game. And that  meant his point requirements weren't enough.  </P> <P> Ziegler, a 6-foot-4 center, had 15 points and six rebounds in the first quarter  to help Mira Mesa take a 28-11 lead. He added 10 more points, two rebounds and  two blocks in the third quarter and finished with a game-high 31 points, plus  14 rebounds and the tournament's most valuable player award.  </P> <P> When Oceanside was successful stopping Ziegler, teammates J.J. Rowlett (18  points), Kal Chatham (13) and Shed Smith (11) picked up the slack.  </P> <P> Behind the play of Jerry Garrett (24 points, seven rebounds), Carl Mathis (16  points) and Kenya Hunt (16 points), Oceanside tried to come back, but the  Marauders would not relent.  </P> <P> "I'm always worried when we get out to a big lead like that in the first  quarter," Mira Mesa Coach Tim Cunningham said.  </P> <P> Oceanside pulled to within seven, but Mira Mesa turned it on to lead, 48-34, at  halftime. The Pirates got to within 83-74 with two minutes 24 seconds left, but  Mira Mesa (8-4) made nine of 10 free throws down the stretch to secure its  seventh victory in eight games. Oceanside, which had won four in a row, fell to  6-3.  </P> <P> "We wanted to run the fast break, and we knew that we could," Ziegler said. "We  kept our heads that whole game."  </P> <P> Said Kinder: "We came out flat, and they were ready to play. I know I'm going  to eat that quote now, but I still feel if we score in the 80s, we will usually  win the game." JIM LINDGREN In other Chula Vista Tournament games: Chula Vista  83, Crawford 57 -- Derek Chapman scored 19 points, and Carnell Penn had 14 to  lead Chula Vista (7-3) to third. The Spartans led by just 19-16 after the first  quarter but outscored Crawford, 62-40, the rest of the way. "Midway from the  first quarter on we really played heads up," Chula Vista Coach Mike Collins  said. "I was very pleased the way the bench came in and did the job." Senior  guards Tracy Halton had 23, and Tito Singleton added 18 for Crawford. Hilltop  68, Coronado 62 -- Carlos Gonzales scored 23 points, and Carlos Marques added  12 for Hilltop, which finished fifth. El Cajon Valley 49, Santana 46 -- El  Cajon survived a 16-9 fourth quarter and held on to claim seventh. Gil Velasco  had 15 for the winners.  </P></p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Big investors urged to be active One in five of the 250 largest UK-quoted companies meet all important criteria of best practice in corporate governance and 75 per cent meet most of them, says a report by the National Association of Pension Funds' Voting Issues Service after its first year of operation. That was described as 'encouraging' yesterday by Mr Angus Matheson, retiring chairman of the NAPF investment committee, at the association's investment conference in Eastbourne. Speakers called for active voting by institutional investors, for the revival of the role of the annual meeting, and proposed attacks on the management of poorly performing companies. The Voting Issues Service monitors the 250 companies for controversial proposals requiring shareholder approval. It supplies details to more than 60 fund-management firms running portfolios worth some Pounds 200bn in aggregate. It also tests against a check-list of eight corporate-governance criteria, including division of the roles of chairman and chief executive, presence of three or more non-executive directors, and the existence of remuneration and audit committees of the board. Mr Matheson told delegates that the service had been well-received but institutional owners of shares should go further and exercise voting rights. Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore, the newly listed fund management group, said there was further to go in improving corporate governance. Non-executive directors were important but selection was capricious, training virtually non-existent and the job definition vague in the extreme. The pool from which non-executive directors were drawn should be widened, he said. Mr Myners also recommended the resuscitation of the annual meeting. 'The opportunity exists for a far-sighted chairman to restore the annual meeting to its rightful place as the nexus of shareholder and management contact,' he said. Mr Dale Hanson, chief executive officer of the Dollars 82bn Californian public-sector pensions system, Calpers, and veteran of many US proxy battles, told delegates that institutional investors must be active in pursuing the boards of under-performing companies. 'We are going to remind the world that shareholders are the owners,' he said. 'We will be targeting 10 companies this year.'</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Bristol (10): A change of attitude - A look at the tourism industry A bronze statue of a craggy John Cabot on a Bristol quayside shows him gazing westwards, towards the American mainland which he discovered almost 500 years ago. If he could look over his shoulder, he would see a wharf where his ship the Matthew, in which he set sail from the city's harbour, is being reconstructed. The new Matthew, being built with oak and traditional materials at a cost of Pounds 1m, is at the heart of an overdue desire by Bristol to stimulate tourism. The ship, a square-rigged caravel of 21 metres, will be launched next September and in May 1996 will be the city's centrepiece of an international festival of the sea. Then she will sail to Newfoundland to take part in the province's 500th anniversary celebrations. The festival, organised by partners including the city council and Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Initiative, is intended to be the biggest held in the UK. It is hoped to attract 800 ships from around the world and as many as 1m visitors. For four days, the quays will be alive with exhibitions, concerts, other events and visits to the moored boats. With its cost already underwritten by a property company, the festival is the most striking example yet of a change of attitude in Bristol towards tourism. Overshadowed by Bath's status as a world heritage city, Bristol has until recently appeared to disregard the industry. This was despite evidence of tourism's importance. The West Country Tourist Board estimates the city has 750,000 staying UK visitors each year, contributing Pounds 55m to the local economy. In addition, it has a big number of day visitors and is a popular place for visiting friends and relations. For visitors from overseas, Bristol is the tenth most popular UK destination  -with Americans and the French leading the way. In 1992, there were 209,000 staying visitors from abroad. In total, tourism is estimated to contribute at least Pounds 100m a year to the local economy, creating directly or indirectly 10,000 or more jobs. A consequence of Bristol's lack of interest in tourism was that the city, despite being internationally known because of its trading history, failed to invest in the industry compared with rival UK cities. It has no sports stadium, concert hall or conference centre of national significance. The Matthew project and festival of the sea is evidence of a change of mind. Mr Neil Croucher, chairman of Bristol Tourism Forum, says: 'A few years ago the private sector was tearing its hair out and asking what the city council was doing to promote tourism. The answer is that they were doing nothing. It was not recognised as an industry, nor as an area of potential.' In the past three years, he says, there has 'been a total turnround and the city council is nothing short of excellent in putting money, time and commitment to tourism.' The forum itself, with representatives from the council, chamber of commerce and tourist industry, has been reactivated. A new strategy has been adopted to tackle the weaknesses - visitors, for example, consider Bristol inhospitable - and build upon the city's strengths of location and maritime heritage. In particular, it is seen to have more potential as a year-round destination for short-break holidays and business tourism. 'Now everyone is working towards one goal,' Mr Croucher states. 'We have the big plus of water right at the heart of the centre. We would like to see Bristol as a major European city, closely linked to waterside development. By the year 2000, we should be in the position to promote Bristol as one of the most beautiful cities in western Europe.' Mr Croucher is development director of the Exploratory 'hands-on' science centre which, with nearly 200,000 visitors a year, is the most popular city attraction after Bristol Zoo. The Exploratory, outgrowing its space at Brunel's Temple Meads station, may move to Harbourside, a waterfront scheme which is hoped to include an electronic wildlife 'zoo' and centre for the performing arts. A separate project is for a museum of commonwealth and empire at Temple Meads. Bristol already has the advantage of impressive landmarks, including Brunel's Clifton suspension bridge over Avon Gorge, the cathedral and St Mary Redcliffe church. Less well-known is that, despite wartime bombing damage and consequent ugly office blocks, there are 3,600 listed buildings. The Old Vic's Theatre Royal is the oldest working theatre in Britain, and John Wesley's chapel, built in 1739, was the world's first Methodist chapel. Outside the 18th century Exchange are the merchants' flat-topped 'nails', the origin of the phrase 'paying on the nail.' A more recent survivor is Brunel's ship, the SS Great Britain, launched in Bristol in 1843 and salvaged from the Falklands in 1970. Nearby, the Victorian buildings of Underfall Yard are being restored. Alongside the floating harbour, which retains permanent high-water in the city's docks, there is an industrial museum and Arnolfini art gallery. Events such as the annual balloon festival and regatta attract thousands of people. Visitors might well be deterred by the cost of car parking, at Pounds 1 an hour, and the variety of shopping can not compete with Bath. But one deficiency perceived by tourists - the restaurants - is less well-founded. The 1994 Good Food Guide lists 10, three more than Bath and five more than Birmingham. Outside the city, there are distinguished country house hotels such as Ston Easton, a Grade I listed Palladian mansion. The city is also close to some of Britain's finest countryside, including the Wye valley, Cotswolds and Mendips. In addition to Bath, it is within reach of Cheltenham, Wells and Glastonbury and the seaside towns of Weston-super-Mare, Burnham-on-Sea and Clevedon. With these advantages, Bristol should have captured more business tourism. Despite having 2,000 four-star hotel beds, it is not among the top 50 UK cities for the conference trade. This autumn, an initiative was launched to correct this. Twenty-seven hotels and venues have formed a marketing consortium called Conference Bristol to promote it as a destination and provide a central point for bookings. The aim is to bring the city into the top 10 conference destinations within three years. All the big hotels have also joined Bristol Hotels Association in what Mr Michael McGahey, chairman of the West Country Tourist Board, has described as 'a new spirit of co-operation.' One area where there should be more co-operation is with Bath. The two cities, only 12 miles apart, could promote a complementary appeal for tourism. But there has been mutual suspicion and little common interest, exacerbated by poor transport connections. Bath, in its cultural identity, has traditionally looked eastwards towards London. Bristol, like John Cabot, has looked westward.</p>

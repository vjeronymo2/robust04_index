			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Gerstner sees no place for a 'vision' at IBM - Chairman says priority is to get the company 'rightsized' as soon as possible MR Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'Rightsizing IBM as quickly as possible, to restore the company to profitability is my number one priority.' In his first substantive public comments since joining the troubled computer company on April 1, Mr Gerstner made clear that he had no 'grand master strategy' to turn IBM around. 'There has been a lot of speculation that I'm going to deliver a 'vision' of (the future of) IBM,' he said. 'The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision. What IBM needs right now is a series of very tough-minded, market-driven (and) highly effective strategies that deliver performance in the marketplace, and shareholder value.' IBM's primary problem is its cost structure, Mr Gerstner stressed at press conferences in New York after presenting his company's results. 'In the last three months we have all been focused on getting that problem behind us, of getting rightsized as quickly as possible,' he said. 'The management team feels that we need to get this (restructuring) behind us as fast as we can. 'IBM's problem is very simple. We sell about Dollars 65bn worth of products per year. At the end of the day we don't make any money. 'We don't have a problem with our products, our services or our technology - we have a problem with our cost structure. 'My second priority for the company is to win the battle in the customer's premises,' Mr Gerstner continued. 'Our prices have become more competitive and our technology is the best in the industry, but we do not have a monopoly.' IBM must intensify its competitiveness, he said. Identifying which products and technologies represent the best prospects for growth, comes third on Mr Gerstner's list, although he mentioned microelectronics and multimedia as two areas that have his attention. IBM would not hesitate to pull out of segments of the computer market in which it was not either a technology leader or making profits, Mr Gerstner said. 'Nowhere in any of our minds, certainly not mine, is there a view that IBM's strategy is to be all things to all people, and to participate in all elements of the information technology business,' he said. 'We are not in any way pursuing that as an objective.' Employee morale was a serious concern, Mr Gerstner said. Morale had suffered as a result of continuing lay-offs and losses, the chairman acknowledged. 'Morale is not good in parts of the company, we have got to get behind this Chinese water torture we are going through,' he said. However, in spite of the attention that has been given to whether Mr Gerstner will restructure IBM's management, he expressed little interest in the subject. 'I'm spending a lot of time on customer issues, on technologies, on employees and the economics of the business, and I don't really care what committees we have. 'Process is not what we're going to talk about. Performance is what we are going to talk about. 'We will never stop fixing IBM. Because of the nature of the business, we will be constantly renewing this organisation and our challenge is to get that renewal process continuous without bumps and starts. 'That is the requirement of any company in the '90s, but more so in the information technology industry where the pace of change is so rapid.'</p>

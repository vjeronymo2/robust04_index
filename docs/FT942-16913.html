			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rally continues A fairly small cut in the German repo rate yesterday helped the dollar and sterling maintain a firmer tone on foreign exchanges, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency was also helped by a story in the Washington Post newspaper saying that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to change short-term interest rates until financial markets had calmed. The Bundesbank cut the repo rate by three basis points to 5.73 per cent  - in line with market expectations following tighter money market conditions recently. The dollar closed in London at DM1.7151 against the D-Mark from DM1.7071 on Tuesday. Sterling rose slightly against the US currency to finish at Dollars 1.4678 from Dollars 1.4638. It was also higher against the D-Mark, ending nearly two pfennigs up at DM2.5173 from DM2.4987. The dollar finished New York trading at DM1.7150. Elsewhere in Europe the D-Mark was generally firmer after a range-bound trading session. The Belgian franc was barely changed after the central bank lowered rates by 10 basis points to 5.95 per cent. The Italian lira weakened following signs of dissension among the Freedom Alliance coalition which won last week's election. The Washington Post story quoted Fed officials as saying that rates would not be moved until markets had stabilised and the impact of the fall in share prices and rise in long-term interest rates had been assessed. Although higher US rates - nobody is suggesting they will fall - should be dollar positive, the market appears to have reasoned that interest rate stability will also favour the dollar as it will calm US equity and bond markets, encouraging capital inflows. Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, said the improved performance of the dollar and sterling - a reversal of last week's move - indicated a possible 'return to looking at fundamentals rather than looking at inflation'. Analysts, however, questioned the durability of these moves, saying they depended on a sustained recovery in the stock and bond markets which was by no means assured. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury analyst at Midland Global Markets, said he remained negative on sterling in particular, which had 'risen on the dollar's coat-tails more than anything else'. He added that it was 'difficult to find anything that might go right either on the political or the economic side for sterling'. However, Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, said there were other factors supporting sterling. These include a shrinking negative interest differential, versus the D-Mark, and a reasonable yield premium on sterling bonds over D-Mark bonds. Mr Norfield added that these premia should attract capital inflows. He said econometric estimates also suggested that the pound was fairly valued 'in the mid-DM2.50s'. Short sterling futures also continued their recovery, the June contract finishing three basis points firmer at 94.50. The December future was 12 basis points up at 94.03. The Bank of England, meanwhile, put Pounds 592m into the discount market, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 750m. German call money remained fairly tight after the Bundesbank surprised the market by withdrawing a net DM1.8bn from the banking system yesterday. Rates were in a fairly wide range from 5.85 per cent to 6.05 per cent, slightly up from Tuesday's 5.80/6.00 per cent. Opinion seems to favour rates moving higher. There was little movement in the futures market, the June Euromark contract ending three basis points off at 94.54. The recent woes of the Turkish lira continued yesterday, the currency falling by 25 per cent against the US currency to trade at TL40,000 per dollar, after Tuesday's close of TL32,000, before recovering slightly to TL39,500. The central bank set its official dollar rate at TL39,933, up from TL32,053 on Tuesday. The bank, which effectively devalued its official dollar rate by 28 per cent on Tuesday, calculates the rate as the average dollar offer of 10 banks on the interbank market at 1200 GMT. The lira was weakened by falls in overnight money rates, at 90 per cent against 120 per cent when trading opened. Analysts said that now that the bank had decided to devalue, it was predictable that speculators would try to drive the currency lower. In Portugal, the escudo stabilised as the central bank persisted with its policy of high interest rates. The currency finished at Es101.3 against the D-Mark, up from Es101.8. The bank again injected funds into the money market at 13 per cent and 14 per cent, compared to a previous rate of 10 per cent. Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, told TSF radio that he believed his strategy would allow key lending rates - such as banks' prime rates - to continue falling. The Belgian franc finished at BFr20.60 against the D-Mark from BFr20.61 before the trimming of rates. Analysts said Belgium had sufficient margin over Germany to cut rates.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Summary of "International Forum on Beijing's 1993 </F> Transnational Corporations and China": "On Further Improving  China's Foreign Investment Climate and Attracting Investment  by Transnational Corporations"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  III. A Reassessment of China's Investment Climate, and </H5> Policy Suggestions    The participating delegates held that in the broad setting  of  the evolving new world economic order and the appearance of an  international production-network system, in order to adapt to  the ever-changing climate and its new demands and opportunities,  and to get onto track with the open international economic  situation and become more internationally competitive, China  needs to reassess its climate and policy framework for direct  foreign investment in China. It was precisely in line with  that constructive spirit that this forum made a number of  suggestions for consideration by the Chinese government, aimed  at helping China to further improve its current  foreign-investment-policy laws and regulations, so that it can  attract more foreign investment to speed up its economic growth  and development, particularly direct investment by large  transnational corporations.    The delegates' general line of thinking was that on the  occasion of China's transition from a planned to a market  economy, China's economic reform should be focused on building a  market-oriented macroeconomic climate suited to both foreign and  Chinese investment, whose climate ought to be both stable and  predictable. This will mean establishing the appropriate  legal framework and system structure for the sound operation of  a market economy; a convertible currency; an effective finance  and banking system; a competitive market structure;  transportation and communications infrastructures to aid  commercial transactions; and constantly improving human capital  and technical skills. It will also require policy measures and  management plans that will put all domestic and international  economic activities on the same track. As to long-range  objectives, the pertinent policy laws and regulations on direct  foreign investment should be transparent, grant enterprises  decisionmaking power, guarantee national treatment without  ethnic discrimination, provide procedures for resolving  disputes, and permit the outward remittance of bonuses.    In order to gradually realize these objectives, the  delegates  made many suggestions, which were quite constructive and  definitely feasible, so that we should pay them adequate  attention, to pave the way for choosing the best ones to follow.  <H5>  1. On Adopting a Policy Slanted Toward Large Investment </H5> Projects    As to large investment projects in line with China's  industrial structural-adjustment orientation (such as high-tech,  power, and transportation), we need to provide full  encouragement and support, by making a transition of  preferential policy from a regional to an industrial slant.  <H5>  2. On Allowing the Establishment of Holding Companies </H5>   The forum welcomed the suggestion made by China's  foreign-investment management sector to allow the establishment  of holding companies. Based on established holding companies,  such as the U.S. Hewlett-Packard Co, IBM, Du Pont, and Motorola,  and the Netherlands Philips B. V., we could gradually expand the  experimental scope, to allow these types of companies to  practice effective and integrated management of their  subordinate joint-venture enterprises, and to enjoy a nationwide  corporate status, in order to bring their overall operating and  comprehensive advantages into full play.  <H5>  3. On Further Opening Up Markets </H5>   China's current market capacity and market openness are out  of proportion, leaving us with the problem of "a large market  with a low degree of openness." Except for industries, such as  food, industrial and agricultural machinery, metal goods, toys,  and sporting goods, where we have no restrictions on foreign  investment, we subject all other industries to varying degrees  of restrictions. It was suggested that except for projects  that involve national security, military affairs, harm to  physical health, or destruction of the ecology, all other  industrial sectors should be opened up to foreign investment.  As China's transnational enterprises have free access to  foreign markets, foreign transnational corporations ought also  to have relatively free access to the Chinese market.    We should let capital- or technology-intensive transnational  corporations sell part or all of their products on China's  domestic market, and not put any hard limitations on their  production scale. To attract high-tech and export-oriented joint  ventures, local-content provisions (made-in-country provisions)  and raw materials and parts import-restrictions should be eased.  <H5>  4. On Encouraging Access by Transnational Service Companies </H5>   As production activities and production services are closely  linked, introducing transnational service companies will help to  attract direct foreign investment in our manufacturing industry.    Meanwhile, transnational service company access will promote  competition in our local service-trade market, to stimulate  tertiary industry growth. China should encourage foreign  investment activity in banking, insurance, air carriers,  communications, advisory service, accounting, quality  authentication, and other commercial service sectors. When  conditions are ripe, we should consider allowing foreign firms  to set up trade subsidiaries, to be granted the authority to  engage directly in foreign trade.  <H5>  5. On Reforming Examination and Approval Formalities </H5>   The Chinese Government revises its project catalog yearly  and  openly encourages the use of foreign investment, to guide  foreign-investment orientation. We need examination and  approval jurisdiction based on varying industrial categories  instead of on varying overall investment provisions. While we  have taken certain steps to speed up the examination and  approval process (such as setting up a window investment-service  center), the process still needs further streamlining,  acceleration, and more transparency. The respective  obligations of the central and local governments need to be set  forth as clearly as possible in pertinent issued documents. Once  a project is approved, the legal documents (such as  joint-venture enterprise contracts) should be subject to only  legitimate acceptance inspection.  <H5>  6. On Making Policy-Related Laws and Regulations More </H5> Transparent    All domestic laws and regulations directly relating to  investment in China by foreign firms should be easy obtainable,  or openly published. As this process has been started, it needs  to be speeded up and continued. Such transparency will  contribute on a nationwide basis to the continuity of business  and trade policy, and to the consolidation and standardization  of laws and regulations, to keep policies from being made in too  many places.    The current FIE Law should be dovetailed and matched with  other laws. We now need to accelerate our formulation of laws  and regulations such as a corporation law, an anti-monopoly law,  an anti-dumping law, a fair competition law, and a joint-stock  company law. As the Uruguay Round has expanded the  GATT-standardization field to investment related to trade, we  now need to conscientiously study ways to ensure that China's  foreign-investment policy is more in line with pertinent GATT  regulations and international practice, in order to get it on  track with the international direct-investment market.  <H5>  7. On Ensuring National Treatment </H5>   Enterprises in China that are part of transnational  corporations expect to be able to take part in fair competition  on the Chinese market as Chinese enterprises. FIEs should  be treated equally without discrimination just as China's state  enterprises in areas, such as raw materials supply, prices, and  loan acquisition. The government ought to eliminate subsidies  and protection for state enterprises.  <H5>  8. On Protecting IPRs </H5>   While we have made great progess in protecting intellectual  property rights [IPRs], we still need supplemental agencies and  formalities that can effectively prevent trademark infringement  and fake products (grey commodities). In this area, the  Beijing IPR Court that was established in the summer of 1993 is  a typical example of such actions that need taken.  <H5>  9. On Foreign Exchange and Finance </H5>   In order to help FIEs (particularly transnational  corporations investing in large projects) balance their foreign  exchange, to raise their foreign exchange availability, we  should allow certain high-tech enterprises to collect foreign  exchange directly when making domestic market sales; formalities  for the acquisition of foreign exchange need to be made more  effective. In this area, the greatest hopes are that  foreign-exchange conversion markets throughout China will be  coordinated, and that a transregional  foreign-exchange-transaction computer network will be allowed to  be linked up.    A consolidated diversified exchange-rate system should be  completed as much as possible, with the conditions created to  make the yuan a convertible currency. As Vietnam was able to  consolidate its currency conversion rates in such a short period  of time, it is obvious that this problem is not mainly one of  development level, but rather of policy. We should permit  foreign banks to operate RMB services.    Thee Chinese banking system needs to raise its work  efficiency. As its current telegraphic accounts transfer that  actually takes 3 weeks is unimaginable, foreign banks could  provide technical assistance in this area.    As about 50 percent of current global overseas investment is  through stock markets, we ought to make securities investment a  key means of attracting investment in China by transnational  corporations. So it is suggested that we expand the offering  of B shares by China's large and midsize listed state companies,  to pave the way for access by transnational corporations  through purchases; we should expand the experimental scope and  offering volume of listed stock offerings by wholly  foreign-owned or joint-venture joint-stock companies, with their  listed offerings of B shares not subject to domestic  restrictions on annual stock-offering volume.  <H5>  10. On Upgrading Infrastructures </H5>   The most important task is to reinforce our existing  transport system, particularly the transport system that links  up China's key cities. Raw materials arriving at our ports now  require more than 1 month to get to consumers. Our  public-transport scheduling is also very difficult, with it  being very hard to know accurate delivery dates in railway  transport, many water-transport stoppages, and our long-distance  truck transport network being very incomplete, affecting timely  and steady provision of products to customers and consumers.  <H5>  11. On Increasing Labor Mobility </H5>   Foreign subsidiaries in China should not be subject to  obstructions in hiring qualified employees in any area, as well  as being without wage-barrier restrictions, and FIE employees  should have the right to take their dependents with them. In  addition, as FIE local or foreign employees need better housing  and related facilities, FIEs that want to improve their employee  housing should be allowed to do so through having foreign  construction companies do the building.    Chinese employees of joint-venture enterprises who need to  be  sent abroad for training or to engage in commercial activities  should be able to obtain very quickly the necessary travel  documents (passports and visas); qualified FIE employees sent  abroad should be trusted and, when necessary, be provided  guarantees.  <H5>  12. On Emphasizing Education and Training </H5>   Education and training to develop host-country local human  resources, to provide full categories of talent qualitatively  and quantitatively, is one of the most important regional terms  to attract transnational corporations (particularly high-tech  companies). China needs to invest more resources in education  and training at all levels, so that the efforts made by  transnational corporations in the areas of technical and  management training can be fully assimilated throughout China.  We now need to focus on post-graduate training, in an attempt  to ensure that China's younger generation has favorable  qualifications for being more competitive in international  business circles as the next century approaches. Transnational  corporations need graduate students from schools, such as the  China-Europe Management Center and the Nanjing U-John Hopkins  China-U.S. Cultural Studies Center, to train into tomorrow's  managers and leaders.  <H5>  13. On Adopting International Criteria </H5>   It is hoped that China will adopt international criteria to  support the development of enterprises set up in China by  transnational corporations. In particular, the Chinese  Government should adopt current international safety and  anti-pollution standards, applying them equally to state and  foreign-invested enterprises; all industrial enterprises should  adopt uniform international quality and engineering standards,  in order to produce high-quality and high-standard raw materials  and parts for supply to local purchases by FIEs.  <H5>  14. On Macroeconomic Stability </H5>   Transnational corporations are even more hopeful that  China's  economic development will be steady, and not just fast.  Macroeconomic regulation and control needs to consist more of  regular fine tuning, in order to keep the economy out of  cyclical fluctuations of volatile overheating and overcooling.  We need to note the currently existing severe inflation rate,  rapid growth of the money supply, plummeting value of the yuan,  enormous fiscal budget deficits, large amount of nonproductive  real estate speculation and fund misplacement, and huge  state-enterprise losses and subsidies. All of these problems  are in need of serious government attention.</p>

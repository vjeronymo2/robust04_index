N.

In this study the evaluation of special cases is made  using a numerical method. For this purpose a study was made of  the law of distribution of the geometry factor in the case of an  equiprobable distribution of observation points over the Earth's  surface and observation times and then with a fixed value of the  geometry factor an estimate was made of the accuracy in  determining coordinates with any set of measurement errors and  positions of the observed satellites. The geometry factor  distribution law for each situation and the determinations of  position in the course of the day (at 0.5-hour intervals) were  simulated at points uniformly distributed over the surface of  the northern hemisphere. The series of geometry factor values  obtained from modeling was about 100 000 determinations of  position for each case, represented by 10 levels. Modeling of  determinations of coordinates was carried out with allowance for  relief data taken from a 1:100 000 map. A table gives the rms  errors in determining coordinates, averaged vertically and  horizontally over the Earth's surface, as a function of the  accuracy in measuring pseudorange and the accuracy of satellite  position in orbit. The rms error in determining position in open  terrain when using the standard number of navigation satellites  (4.2) is about 13 m; the minimum error is about 6 m and the  maximum error is about 30 m. Position accuracy drops in the  event of failure of individual system satellites. In the event  of operation of 18 satellites the minimum, mean and maximum rms  errors are 10, 21 and 400 m respectively. If half the satellites  fail in 50% of the cases the problem has no solution.

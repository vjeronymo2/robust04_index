			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuching, Tuesday -- The Parti Bansa Dayak Sarawak  [Sarawak Dayak Race Party or PBDS] was officially readmitted  into the Sarawak National Front, which the party quit in 1987.    The Sarawak National Front and PBDS signed a memorandum of  understanding on the readmission into the front at Wisma Sumber  Alam here today.    According to a press statement of the State Information  Department here this evening, the memorandum of understanding  was signed by Chief Minister Tan Sri Abdul Taib Mahmud in his  capacity as chairman of the Sarawak National Front and PBDS  President Datuk Leo Moggie, who represented the Sarawak National  Front and PBDS respectively.    The document was drafted by the National Front-PBDS  negotiating committee, which previously held several series of  talks.    Witnessing the signing ceremony were Datuk Adenan Satem,  chairman of the negotiating committee from the National Front,  and PBDS Vice President Dr. James Masing.    PBDS, which was established in 1983, was a component of the  National Front both at the federal and state levels until the  party quit to join the opposition at the state level in 1987.  PBDS remains a component of the National Front at the federal  level.    PBDS sought to rejoin the Sarawak National Front for the  first time following its severe defeat in the 1991 state  election, but the Sarawak National Front gave no reply at that  time.</p>

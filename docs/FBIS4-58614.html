Under the new Majles guidelines, this year the Majles  is discussing revenues in the Joint Economic and Financial  Affairs and Plan and Budget Commission. In the last two weeks  the Plan and Budget Commission, as the main commission and the  other commissions as secondary commissions, have worked very  hard on the budget.    The Plan and Budget Commission has worked about 74 days in  three shifts. In the final nights before the budget was  presented to the Majles the discussions continued until dawn.  Often when the Majles appeared to be in recess the commissions  were active. Even during the 10 Days of Dawn celebration, when  the Majles was closed for a week, all the commissions continued  working, and the deputies submitted about 2,000 proposals to the  Plan and Budget Commission.    During the period of studying the budget notes, some of the  commissions worked very hard, presenting a special opinion about  every row and contacting and consulting with experts from the  Plan and Budget Organization and the relevant ministries. Here,  after the Plan and Budget Commission, one may also mention the  Agriculture Commission, for most of the recommendations and  requests for change came from this commission.    Along with these positive characteristics, there are some  points that cannot be easily passed over. One deputy told our  correspondent: During the budget discussions and debates, a  small number of the deputies do not pay enough attention to the  nation's interests and the ceiling on commitments. They give  priority to their own electoral districts. For example, with  regard to the creation of power plants and new electrical power  networks, they only consider their own regions as having  priority and make recommendations for it. Another example is  that the steel projects, which are being pursued in three  provinces, are not needed by the country, and there is no export  market for them either. It would be very appropriate if the  deputies would only consider the nation's interests when  submitting their proposals.  <H5>  Dr. Kamran's Comments on the Answer From the Ministry of </H5> Education and Training    Following the publication of the answer from the deputy  minister for education in the Ministry of Education and Training  to the comments by Dr. Kamran in the newspaper RESALAT on  12/11/1272 [1 March 1994], he said in a contact with our  correspondent:    What was said concerning the improper spending of credits  from Note 55 had nothing to do with the Ministry of Education  and Training. This organization has no specialist relationship  with the Majles Islamic Art and Guidance Commission. The protest  from the respected deputy minister of education in this ministry  was beside the point. Also, this year organizations have also  been approved by the commission under Note 55, which have a  direct relationship with the Majles specialist commission.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPRING BREAK WITHOUT EASTER IRKS L.A. PARENTS  </P> <P> A group of parents angry that spring vacation this year begins two weeks after  Easter Sunday staged protests Thursday against the Los Angeles Unified School  District at a Sun Valley elementary school.  </P> <P> "We as Christians are fighting the change," said John Barnwell, a parent who  organized the protest at Vinedale Elementary School. "Most people who believe  in God believe that this is the most important week in Christian history."  </P> <P> In previous years, the weeklong vacation preceded Easter.  </P> <P> Barnwell and a dozen other parents and children carried signs and passed out  literature urging parents to keep their children home during Easter week, which  this year begins Sunday. Vacation for the district's 592,000 students begins  April 10.  </P> <P> The school board, in an agreement reached with the Los Angeles teachers union  last year, scheduled spring vacation to begin halfway through the 20-week  semester. Easter falls on a Sunday within a 35-day period between March 22 and  April 25 each year.  </P> <P> "We believe that is most educationally sound," Don Schrack, a spokesman for the  United Teachers-Los Angeles, said of the schedule change. He added that  teachers also like the change because it comes midway through the semester.  </P> <P> But Barnwell said most parents still do not know about the change this year,  even though schools routinely send home vacation schedules in the fall. Having  the vacation separate from the traditional Easter week makes worship more  difficult and creates a problem for families planning vacations at that time,  he said.  </P> <P> "I would never tell anyone what to believe in," said Kris Tine, who has two  children in Los Angeles schools. "But they're trying to take the Lord away from  us."  </P> <P> Board President Roberta Weintraub said she supports returning spring vacation  to Easter week, even though she voted for the master calendar last year that  included the change.  </P> <P> Although the spring break next year will, by coincidence, fall during the  traditional Easter week, Weintraub said she will push to have the traditional  vacation period in future years.  </P> <P> Burbank and Glendale school districts will have their spring vacations during  Easter week, officials said.  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Council contractors reduce tendering prices COMPULSORY competitive tendering has brought fresh savings for councils  - with bidders cutting their prices when the contracts are renewed, according to figures published today in the Local Government Chronicle. The figures contradict the common view that the companies which won contracts on the first round had treated the exercise as a 'loss-leader'. Seven of the first eight authorities to renegotiate deals with outside contractors for refuse collection since the scheme started in 1988 have achieved real-term price cuts of 18.4 per cent or more. Councils using private contractors obtained savings varying from a 30 per cent real reduction for Runnymede district council to 18.4 per cent for Tonbridge. Medina district council, in the Isle of Wight, is the only authority so far to have suffered an increase. Three contractors - Biffa Waste, Tylers, and Cory Environmental - have so far won contracts. In Cherwell, in Oxfordshire, the council's own direct labour force emerged as the lowest bidder with a price Pounds 360,500 lower than 1988's Pounds 1.2m. Direct labour organisations, which in most cases beat private sector competitors when the contracts were first put out to tender, found the figures alarming. Mr Mark Bramah, principal adviser to the Association of Direct Labour Organisations, said previous studies had suggested contract prices would rise when retendered. He said: 'I find it surprising that they are coming in cheaper. There may be underlying reasons in each case, such as the impact of the recession on private sector bids. Local authorities' own resource problems could also be affecting their specifications.' Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CDC Research, which produced the figures, estimated that further contracts to be awarded in the next two months would confirm that private companies were prepared to offer low prices in order to gain substantial volume in the UK market. Dr Stefan Szymanski of the London Business School yesterday told a seminar on tendering organised by CDC Research, that competitive tendering had already delivered substantial reductions before the contracts came up for renewal. Figures produced independently by Dr Szymanski, which compare the expenditure on refuse collection declared by 217 local authorities in England and Wales in 1988 with the amount they paid for contracts, show the average cost saving is 27 per cent, with a variation in savings from 42 per cent to 5 per cent. Dr Szymanski said the cost savings could come from three sources - efficiency gains, poorer terms and conditions for the labour force, and reduced quality. However, recent research by the Audit Commission, the local government spending watchdog, suggested that quality had not been adversely affected. This led Dr Szymanski to suggest that the savings had come from the workforce - not generally in lower wages, but in longer working hours and reduced benefits - and from improved efficiency. Dr Szymanski's findings are questioned by the Institute of Local Government Studies at Birmingham University, which, on the basis of a smaller sample of authorities, believes accrued savings are about 8 per cent since 1988.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                      CONTRACT PRICES 1988 - 1993  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Authority        Contractor            1988     at 1993        1993                                                  prices  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Pounds      Pounds      Pounds  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Chiltern         Biffa Waste        980,000   1,294,000     950,000 Medina           Biffa Waste        500,000     660,000     725,000 Rochford         Biffa Waste        500,000     660,000     500,000 Bromley          Cory Envill      2,200,000   2,904,000   2,200,000 Forest of Dean   Biffa Waste        401,000     529,000     425,000 North Norfolk    Tylers             557,000     735,000     557,000 Runnymede        Tylers             700,000     924,000     646,325 Tonbridge        Cory Envil         650,000     858,000     700,000  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: The Contracts Handbook  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Collor told to present defence THE Brazilian Congress has instructed President Fernando Collor, who has been linked to a multi-million-dollar corruption scandal, to present a defence for an impeachment request against him on September 15, sooner than originally expected, Reuter reports from Braslia. The Sao Paulo stock market rose 7 per cent on the news. Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, president of Congress, who is responsible for setting the timetable for the impeachment process, said Mr Collor had been informed of charges against him. The president's spokesman later said an appeal against the decision would be made to the Supreme Court today. Mr Pinheiro said the vote on the impeachment request would require the approval of two-thirds of the lower house and would be open. His decision sparked protests from pro-government congressmen. The government had intended to delay the procedure and believes the president stands a better chance of blocking the request if the vote is kept secret. Observer, Page 19</p>

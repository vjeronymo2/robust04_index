			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (2): Providing a definition of standards - Architecture ARCHITECTURE HAS a number of meanings in computer jargon. It can mean the design blueprint for a microprocessor - the so-called 'chip' architecture. It can also be applied to complete hardware systems to define their methods of operation - multiple, parallel processing or fault-tolerant architectures, for example. But the most common meaning of the word is as a marketing term. Suppliers use architectures to define design and communications standards for hardware and software to provide a stable foundation for applications software. In the early days of computing, manufacturers went their own sweet way when they designed a computer system. They did not need to take account of what their competitors were doing because the design of computer systems was self-contained and under the sole custodianship of the manufacturer. But in the 1970s, when networks started to appear and computers had to communicate with each other, the situation changed and suppliers began to sell their products within a defined architecture. The trend was accelerated in the 1980s when mass-market personal computers became available and networking became less expensive. The architecture defined how different computers could communicate with each other. A new product which conformed to these specifications could be sold under the architectural 'umbrella,' with the assurance that it would work. IBM's System Network Architecture (SNA), originally announced in the mid-1970s, was perhaps the earliest example of an architecture of this type. SNA laid down the rules of networking and inter-communication within the IBM computer environment. It also enabled IBM to keep control of large areas of its customer's computing operations. Although SNA has evolved and now includes standards from other architectures, its emphasis remains very much on IBM's hardware and software products. Furthermore, it has given IBM a strong position of leadership in many areas of technology. IBM's rivals must offer SNA-compatible systems if they want to connect their equipment to IBM networks. In spite of the wide adoption of SNA by most of the world's leading computer users, IBM has not had the field to itself. By the late 1970s, the open systems movement began to gain momentum and it, too, defined a general networking architecture. The International Standards Organisation (ISO) called it the seven-layer model for open systems interconnection (OSI). It defined how connections are a made and communications carried out at seven different levels, from the physical transport system (the cabling) right up to the application level. Unfortunately, IBM's SNA and ISO's OSI were incompatible - although the two have slowly converged. Earlier this year, IBM announced its new Blueprint for Networking, which redefined SNA to include many open systems specifications. Meanwhile, many IBM SNA features have become de facto standards with the open systems stamp on them. The definition of systems architectures has expanded beyond networking to cover entire enterprises and their applications. Nowadays this can include several networks and many different computer systems. IBM, again, led the way with the announcement in 1987 of Systems Applications Architecture (SAA). IBM wanted to find a way to knit together three entirely different computer systems - its System/370 mainframe, its System/38-AS/400 minicomputers and its PS/2 personal computer. All three used SNA for their communications infrastructure. But all three used different operating systems, different command and control interfaces and different programming languages for their applications software. SAA embraces the important aspects of all three systems. It builds on SNA's communications by providing technical definitions for - among other things - user interfaces (graphical user interfaces - see page 8) and applications programming interfaces (APIs). Since 1987, it has been fashionable for large manufacturers and software suppliers either to define or to subscribe to one or more architectures - although the differences between them are often hard to spot. DEC, the minicomputer manufacturer, has defined its Networked Applications Support (NAS) to include its proprietary VAX systems and some aspects of open systems. Groupe Bull, the French hardware manufacturer has defined its Distributed Computing Model (DCM) - again combining its proprietary systems with open systems. And ICL, the Japanese-owned UK manufacturer, has defined its Open Framework - yet another variation on the same theme. The open systems features included in each of these architectures are derived from a number of sources. The infrastructural communications components come from the ISO/OSI model and from standards defined by the CCITT (X25, X400, X500). Higher-level components - such as user interfaces and applications programming interfaces - come from one or more of the informal open systems groupings. These include: The IBM-backed Open Software Foundation (OSF) which has defined the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) The AT&amp;T-backed Unix International (UI) which has defined the UI-Atlas architecture And the sponsors of the Advanced Computing Environment, (ACE). All of these open architectures use the Unix operating system as a starting point and share many common components. UI's Atlas includes some of the features of OSF's DCE and vice versa. IBM's SAA and the ISO/OSI standards remain the most important and most widely-supported architectural definitions - although it seems inevitable that they will all eventually come together and be refined into a universal architecture.</p>

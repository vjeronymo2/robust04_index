			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Light van sales lag behind recovery New commercial vehicle registrations increased year-on-year by 1.3 per cent in January, as demand for vans continued to lag behind the new car market's strong recovery. Commercial vehicle registrations in January rose to 17,642 from 17,418 in the same month a year ago, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Demand for light vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) fell again in January by 12 per cent year-on-year to 6,111 and continued to mask recovery in other sectors of the commercial vehicle market. Sales of medium and heavy vans (1.8-3.5 tonnes) rose by 12 per cent last month to 7,301, while registrations of trucks (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose by 10 per cent year-on-year to 2,568. In recent months demand has begun to pick up from the small business and local distribution sector with rising registrations of medium and heavy vans. The heavy truck segment of the market (above 15 tonnes) continues to lead the recovery with registrations up by 24 per cent year-on-year in January. Sales in the whole of 1993 rose by 27 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                Volume    Volume   Share (%)  Share (%)                               (Units)  Change (%)    Jan 94     Jan 93  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                  17,642     +1.3        100.0      100.0 Imports                         7,529    +10.9         42.7       39.0  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8t)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           6,111    -12.2        100.0      100.0 Imports                         2,340     -2.5         38.3       34.5 Ford                            2,794    -13.7         45.7       46.5 Vauxhall (General Motors)       1,680    -34.9         27.5       37.1 Renault ****                      448    +89.0          7.3        3.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen               444    +40.5          7.3        4.5 Rover (British Aerospace)***      251    -20.1          4.1        4.5  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Medium vans &amp; pick-ups (1.81-3.5t)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           7,301    +11.9        100.0      100.0 Imports                         2,988    +22.4         40.9       37.4 Ford                            3,383     +2.5         46.3       50.6 Leyland Daf Vans                  631     -9.1          8.6       10.6 Nissan                            556   +189.6          7.6        2.9 Volkswagen                        534    +16.6          7.3        7.0 Renault ****                      512    +40.7          7.0        5.6 Mercedes-Benz                     494   +115.7          6.8        3.5 Vauxhall (GM)                     386     -6.3          5.3        6.3 PSA Peugeot Citroen               313     -9.8          4.3        5.3  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Trucks (over 3.5t)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           2,568     +9.6        100.0      100.0 Imports                         1,551    +39.9         60.4       47.3 Iveco group** (Fiat)              510    +22.9         19.9       17.7 Mercedes-Benz                     479     -4.8         18.7       21.5 Leyland Daf (Daf Trucks)          401    -32.6         15.6       25.4 Volvo ****                        360    +38.5         14.0       11.1 MAN                               185    +81.4          7.2        4.4 Renault ****                      105    +40.0          4.1        3.2  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Of which Heavy Trucks (over 15 tonnes)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           1,533    +24.0        100.0      100.0 Volvo ****                        323    +36.3         21.1       19.2 Scania (Investor)                 275    +36.1         17.9       16.3 Mercedes-Benz                     200    +9.9          13.0       14.7 Iveco group** (Fiat)              169    +30.2         11.0        9.6 Leyland Daf (Daf Trucks)          167    -33.5         10.9       20.3 ERF                               159    +74.7         10.4        7.4  --------------------------------------------------------------------- (names in brackets indicate ownership) *** BMW is planning to buy an 80 per cent stake in Rover vehicle operations. * includes buses and light four wheel drive utility vehicles. ** includes Iveco Ford and Seddon Atkinson. **** Renault and Volvo are linked through minority cross-shareholdings.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and industry estimates  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Leyland Daf Vans is to boost output at its Birmingham plant from 200 vehicles a week to 250, Mr Alan Amey, chairman, said last night.

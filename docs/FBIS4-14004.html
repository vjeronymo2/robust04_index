			<p>BFN     [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that Israeli goods have begun to  flow publicly into the markets of certain Arabian Gulf states.  Informed political sources told AL-MAJD that an Israel ship  called "The Orient" [al-sharq] docked at 'Isa Port in Bahrain a  few days ago with an Israeli consignment for certain Gulf  markets. The ship's captain and crew were allowed to tour  Manama.    In another development, a Jewish businessman of Moroccan  origin, who is married to the daughter of a ranking Moroccan  politician, arrived in Morocco. He held intensive talks with  Moroccan officials on backing the Israeli efforts to lift the  Arab economic boycott of Israel and open public channels of  communication with the rest of the Arab Maghreb states. The  Moroccan side responded to this request by stressing the need to  lift the political boycott first. The Israeli delegation  objected to this and said no real political boycott exists.    AL-MAJD has learned that the contacts Rabin's government is  currently holding with various Arab countries will result in a  decision by the governments of Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman  to cancel the economic boycott of Israel before the end of this  year.</p>

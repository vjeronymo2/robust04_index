			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Waigel cuts backed by Bundesbank MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said yesterday that the Bundesbank had given a 'positive' response to his plans for spending cuts of up to DM20bn (Pounds 8.2bn) per year. After a trip to the central bank council meeting in Frankfurt to present his package, he said its members had given a cautious green light to his immediate plans for a DM10bn increase in borrowing, devoted entirely to the extra costs of the current recession. 'The German Bundesbank considers a higher net borrowing requirement, justified in this way, as defensible,' he said, 'provided that the overall concept of the federal consolidation programme is put into effect in its main provisions.' His words supported the widespread expectation that the Bundesbank will be prepared to relax its interest rates in the coming weeks, once it sees the full outlines of the government's planned 'solidarity pact' with employers, trade unions and the 16 state governments. At the same time, the ruling coalition spelt out more details of the programme it has drawn up, alongside the savings package, to boost economic development and investment in east Germany, the intended beneficiary of the solidarity pact. They include an agreement by the central government to take over the entire debts of the Treuhand privatisation agency, and the accumulated debts of the former East German government, instead of asking the five eastern states to share the cost of repaying half of them. From 1995 onwards, the eastern Lander and Berlin will also benefit from a transfer of DM60bn in state subsidy, to assume their full public spending responsibilities. The package of 18 specific measures, also including more money for investment subsidies for small enterprises, the extension of special depreciation allowances, a new deal for sharing the cost of environmental damages, and another DM10bn for modernising the housing stock, has been worked out by the government and the parliamentary parties in the coalition. Mr Waigel said that his savings plans in the west had met with broad approval from the Bundesbank, to which he had appealed directly to see in them greater room for manoeuvre to reduce its leading interest rates. He said the central bank welcomed in particular his moves to reduce the pressure of public borrowing on the capital markets, by introducing an increased oil tax, and road fund tax, from 1994 to pay off DM15bn in debts of the German railways, and also to find new ways of servicing the state's accumulated housing debts. That would remove a debt financing need for some DM30bn from the capital markets, he said. There was no immediate response from the central bank, and no move yesterday to adjust interest rates.</p>

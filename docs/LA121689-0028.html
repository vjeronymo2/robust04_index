			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CHILLING DESCENT INTO MADNESS IN 'WALLPAPER'  </P> <P> In "The Yellow Wallpaper," a stifling turn-of-the-century marriage and the  wife's descent into madness unfolds with a languid chill. The program airs  under the "Masterpiece Theatre" banner Sunday -- at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and  15, at 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24.  </P> <P> The story is adapted from an obscure but classic autobiographical novella by  long-forgotten, turn-of-the century American writer, reformer and crusader  Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Her tale, ahead of its time in its exploration of  sexual politics, mirrors the torpor of an imaginative young wife whose husband  treats her like a Dresden doll.  </P> <P> In fact, this story (from 1892, when most publishers wouldn't touch it) unfolds  like the worst-case scenario of Ibsen's "A Doll's House" -- or what might have  happened to Nora if she hadn't managed to flee her obtuse husband and similar  toy-like marriage.  </P> <P> The wife in the psychological horror story (a heightened version of Gilman's  own marriage at the time) is suffering oppressive fears induced by her  hyperactive imagination, boredom and virtual domestic incarceration.  </P> <P> The lazy mood of the production's painterly compositions and writer Maggie  Wadey's faithful adaptation hints without histrionics at the enveloping  madness.  </P> <P> Indeed, the wife's musings and her silences serve to better highlight her  infrequent outbursts. Beware that the tone is so languorous it may drive some  impatient viewers to examine their own wallpaper. But actress Julia Watson in  her high-neck gowns nicely suggests the tension adrift in the quiet mansion and  especially in her attic bedroom.  </P> <P> What the production succeeds at is visualizing the wife's fantasies as she lies  staring into the intricate patterns of her sickly yellow wallpaper. In a  blood-freezing conclusion, with the husband (Stephen Dillon) battering at the  door and the wife ripping at the wallpaper, she fades in and out of the wall  itself.  </P> <P> The sequence, with the now-crazed woman embracing her own becalmed persona, is  eerily and inventively staged by former TV commercial director John Clive,  making his TV drama debut.  </P> <P> (Gilman, suffering from cancer and judging herself no longer of any use to  society, took chloroform and took her own life at her home in Pasadena in 1935  at the age of 75. "The Yellow Wallpaper" is published by the Feminist Press of  the City University of New York.) RAY LOYND  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sa'd al-Silawi] </F>   [Text] Industry and Trade Minister Dr. Rima Khalaf has said  that Jordan's rapprochement and cooperation with all Arab  countries does not mean that it wants to confront or work  against any party, especially the Palestinian economy.    She said: We will cooperate with the Palestinian economy and  always work for its growth and development, based on Jordan's  historical commitment to the Palestine question. I do not think  that any Jordanian citizen or official is doing anything other  than this.    In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y commenting on reports  about a desire to establish economic integration between Jordan,  Syria, and Lebanon to confront the results of the economic  agreement between Israel and the PLO on the economies of the  three countries, Dr. Khalaf said: We are aware that there are  restrictions on the Palestinian economy, and we hope that these  restrictions will be removed so that this economy can become  close and attached to the economies of Arab countries, and  disengage its links with the Israeli economy.    Dr. Khalaf said Jordan's economic cooperation with all Arab  countries is based on Jordan's historical pan-Arab concept, and  this is not restricted to Syria and Lebanon but includes all  Arab countries in order to realize Arab economic integration.    Dr. Khalaf said Jordan is following a policy of entrenching  economic cooperation with all Arab countries, including the  Palestinian National Authority. She added that, according to  Jordan's concept, this cooperation will surely be beneficial and  will assist economic and social development in all Arab  countries.    Dr. Khalaf said Jordan wants to entrench economic  cooperation  with all Arab countries through joint committees, adding that  the Jordanian-Syrian Joint Committee held a meeting in Amman,  and will hold another meeting soon in Amman at the level of  prime ministers. Before that, the Jordanian-Egyptian Joint  Committee held meetings at the level of prime ministers.    She added that Jordan coordinates in all fields with Arab  brothers in a bid to build an Arab economy that is able to  survive and face the economic blocs set up in the world.</p>

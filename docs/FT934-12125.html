			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Japanese MPs query Thorp deal NINE members of the Japanese parliament have cast doubt on the economics of the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant by calling for a renegotiation of Japan's contracts to reprocess spent nuclear fuel at the controversial Cumbria plant. The call, which comes in an open letter to British MPs, runs counter to official Japanese support for Thorp. It is signed by members of four of the seven parties in the ruling coalition, including the Japan New Party of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister. The letter comes as the UK government is preparing to decide the fate of the Pounds 2.8bn British Nuclear Fuels reprocessing project. Japanese power companies are Thorp's biggest foreign customers, with contracts for reprocessing more than 2,500 tonnes of spent fuel over the next decade. That spent fuel will yield some 15 tonnes of plutonium  - which is used in nuclear weapons and certain types of nuclear reactor. The letter argues that Japan risks building up a big plutonium surplus if it sticks to these contracts. Mr Tadatoshi Akiba, socialist MP for Hiroshima and leader of the campaign, said Japan's plutonium demand was less than forecast due to delays in its nuclear programme. 'It is official Japanese policy not to have a surplus of plutonium,' he said. 'It is in both sides' interest to get together and talk about it.' The Japanese government is reassessing its plutonium policy and is sensitive to environmental pressure after the international outcry over a shipment of reprocessed fuel from France last January. BNF said last night that none of its contracts contained a clause allowing customers to delay reprocessing at Thorp to comply with their need for plutonium. Plutonium recovered at Thorp remained the property of the customer, BNF said, though plutonium would remain stored at Thorp until it was demonstrated by the customer that it was required for fuel fabrication.            *       *        *       *        * IN THEIR letter the Japanese MPs say: 'If current contracts are maintained with Thorp, Japan will be accumulating a very large surplus of plutonium. It has always been the policy of our country, however, that it will not accumulate surplus stockpiles of plutonium. 'The current world situation mandates that proliferation concerns receive the utmost attention. Under these circumstances, it is highly undesirable at this time for both Japan and the UK to extract more plutonium than is necessary. 'Therefore, we believe that it is of mutual interest that our two governments sit down to negotiate the various contingencies concerning Thorp without delay in order that we may mutually avoid the separating of surplus plutonium and the incurring of large economic costs.</p>

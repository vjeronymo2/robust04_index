			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, under the Basle Accord, ``loans fully secured by mortgage on residential property which is rented or is (or is intended to be) occupied by the borrower'' are permitted to be assigned a 50 percent risk weight. Nevertheless, the Accord admonishes bank supervisory authorities to apply this ``concessionary weight *&blank;*&blank;* restrictively and in accordance with strict prudential criteria. This may mean, for example, that in some member countries the 50 per cent. weight *&blank;*&blank;* will only be applied where strict, legally-based, valuation rules ensure a substantial margin of additional security over the amount of the loan.'' To date, the 50 percent risk weight has been accorded only to loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties that meet certain prudential criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 618(b)(1) of the RTCRRIA requires the federal banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital guidelines to assign multifamily housing loans that meet certain criteria and any security collateralized by such loans to the 50 percent risk weight category. In order for a multifamily housing loan to qualify for this preferential capital treatment, the loan must be secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property, the loan-to-value ratio for the property must not exceed 80 percent (75 percent if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the loan), the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before debt service) to annual debt service on the loan must not be less than 120 percent (115 percent if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the loan), the amortization period for principal and interest on the loan must not exceed 30 years, the loan must have a minimum maturity for principal repayment of not less than seven years, and the loan must have had timely payment of principal and interest in accordance with the loan terms for at least one year. Section 618(b)(1) further provides that a multifamily housing loan must meet ``any other underwriting characteristics that the appropriate Federal banking agency may establish, consistent with the purposes of the minimum acceptable capital requirements to maintain the safety and soundness of financial institutions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 305 of the FDICIA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2355 (12 U.S.C. 1828 note)) in part requires the federal banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital standards for insured depository institutions to ensure that those standards ``reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multifamily mortgages.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 618(b)(2) of the RTCRRIA requires the FDIC to amend its risk-based capital standards:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To provide that any loan fully secured by a first lien on a multifamily housing property that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *&blank;*&blank;* shall be treated as sold to the extent that loss is incurred by the purchaser of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section then defines the term ``pro rata loss sharing arrangement'' as ``an agreement providing that the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on a pro rata basis.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 618(b)(3) of the RTCRRIA then directs the FDIC to amend its risk-based capital framework ``to take into account other loss sharing arrangements in connection with the sale'' of multifamily housing loans ``for purposes of determining the extent to which such loans shall be treated as sold.'' An ``other loss sharing arrangement'' is then defined as ``an agreement providing that the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than a pro rata basis.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 1, 1992, the FDIC published a proposed rule designed to implement the provisions of section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA (57 FR 11010). The preamble to the proposed rule further noted that implementation of the proposal would also satisfy the provision of section 305 of the FDICIA concerning the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines to multifamily housing loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Criteria for Multifamily Housing Loans and Securities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to achieve the safety and soundness objective set forth in section 618(b)(1), the proposal observed that it is imperative that appropriate criteria be established to distinguish between multifamily housing loans that are accorded a 100 percent risk weight and those that are of sufficiently high quality to warrant a more favorable 50 percent risk weight. In this regard, the proposal noted that data reported in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income filed by all FDIC-insured commercial banks revealed that net charge-offs of multifamily housing loans by such banks for calendar year 1991 were 2.01 percent of multifamily housing loans outstanding. The percentage of multifamily housing loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1991, for all FDIC-insured commercial banks was 5.64 percent of multifamily housing loans outstanding. In contrast, for single family housing loans, which the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines assign to the 50 percent risk weight category if they meet certain criteria, the net charge-off rate for calendar year 1991 was only 0.20 percent of loans outstanding. Single family housing loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1991, for all FDIC-insured commercial banks were 1.65 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPSET BY 'TRIBUTE' TO HOMEOWNER GROUPS  </P> <P> "Developers Find Peace at a Price" which appeared on the front page of the  Sunday Times (Feb. 26) dismayed me. The recent practice of extracting tribute  from a developer as the price for settlement of a zoning matter has apparently  been initiated by Friends of Westwood. This surprises me since the other  co-founder is Laura Lake, a respected UCLA professor of urban planning and a  candidate for the City Council.  </P> <P> I have served on the board of directors of the Tract 7260 Homeowner Assn. for  33 years. We have been involved in sometimes bitter confrontations: 20th  Century Fox -- proliferation of helistops; Century City Inc. -- Century City  Specific Plan; Watt Industries -- Century City parking structure; Ring Brothers  -- condominium height; Days Inn -- design and routing of Orton Stairway; Days  Inn -- safety of retaining wall, Century City Shopping Center -- noise  abatement; and Homestead Associates -- neighborhood protection ordinance. We  have never sought one cent of tribute.  </P> <P> It has been assumed that those representing homeowner associations were unpaid  volunteers. In the David-Goliath struggles, we have appeared before boards and  commissions with clean hands to protect the sanctity of our homes. In the  Homestead matter, we were forced to hire an attorney. We are asking to be  reimbursed for legal expenses, not tribute.  </P> <P> Homeowner associations are normally nonprofit corporations. The IRS and the  state Franchise Tax Board might look askance on the large payoffs given to  Friends of Westwood.  </P> <P> I urge Laura Lake, Sandy Brown, Harald Hahn, and Diana Plotkin to examine their  priorities and to ensure that money and prestige have not diverted them from  their primary purpose.  </P> <P> JOHN H.

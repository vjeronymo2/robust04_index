			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Observer: Hold tight please Foreigners bemused at British willingness to form orderly queues for London buses are probably unaware that the long arm of the law is at work. London Transport has some byelaws aimed at keeping order at its bus stops and on its underground platforms. Of course, as they were drawn up in 1938 - imposing fines of up to forty shillings, or Pounds 2, for offences such as queue-jumping or queueing more than two abreast - ignorance may be excusable, especially as there is no record of recent prosecutions. Perversely, LT is now considering scrapping such regulations. So as well as a mad scramble for national health service hospital beds or a desk at the better state schools, we shall all be fighting tooth and nail to get on the buses. Such is progress.</p>

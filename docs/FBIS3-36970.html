			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The event we are talking about happened about three  weeks ago, yet we have to report it just to ask this one  question: Why did the first auction held in our navy, and  perhaps in the whole of the Russian army, take place in secret?  They were not selling the most up-to-date equipment, just  obsolete naval vessels. Three were purchased by St. Petersburg  firms to break up for scrap and the fourth -- a medium  amphibious warfare ship -- to be converted into a freighter.    On the whole the auction was deemed a success. However, the  command of the Baltic Fleet was in no hurry to appraise it;  indeed it had earlier been sharply criticized by the Ministry of  Defense for its commercial activity. That is why there was a  shroud of secrecy over the auction and why no journalists were  there, even though we have all known for a long time that with  the loss of the bases in the Baltic countries and with the fleet  being cut back auctions like this could well resolve one of the  most acute issues -- that of financing the housing program for  servicemen and their families.</p>

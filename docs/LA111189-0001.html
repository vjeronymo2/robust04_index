			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOT WINDS FAN FIRES, BEACH-GOERS  </P> <P> It's November in Southern California. Yet fall was nowhere in evidence Friday  as desert winds fanned four brush fires, including one that threatened a movie  star's home, and temperatures soared over 90 degrees, sending surfers and other  sun worshipers scurrying to the beaches to soak up the summer-like rays.  </P> <P> From the air, plumes of smoke could be seen rising from all directions as  blazes raged in Pacific Palisades, Chatsworth, Diamond Bar and the Antelope  Valley.  </P> <P> But the flames did little to discourage beach-goers who hit the sands in  unusually high numbers, thanks largely to the fact that many businesses were  closed for Veterans Day.  </P> <P> In San Diego, where beach crowds were also above average, the official high  temperature Friday was 82 recorded at Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> Forecasters don't see the warm weather continuing.  </P> <P> "We're looking for a weakening of the high pressure zone that in turn will give  us a little bit cooler temperatures over the weekend and a return of patchy low  clouds and fog, particularly on Saturday night," forecaster Frank Perdue said.  "Other than that, it's a very unexciting weather pattern."  </P> <P> Today's high at San Diego beaches should be from 69 to 74 degrees. Sunday is  expected to be even cooler, with a high temperature of 66 to 71. The ocean  temperature will be near 61.  </P> <P> Perdue said that the weakened high-pressure system will continue to keep stormy  weather to the north. That's lucky, he said, because there will be tides of  over seven feet in the next few days and when storms accompany such high tides  they often cause damage along the coast.  </P> <P> "If you got a storm surge it could be pretty hairy," Perdue said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, lifeguard Randy DeGregori said smoke from the Pacific  Palisades fire wafted over Santa Monica Beach like dark clouds but did not  attract much attention.  </P> <P> "There's a strong breeze, so a lot of the smoke is coming right down on us,"  DeGregori said. "But people are having a pretty good time."  </P> <P> The fast-moving brush fire that swept across 90 canyon acres in Pacific  Palisades was the worst result of the hot, dry and windy weather attributed to  a mild Santa Ana condition.  </P> <P> The fire, which was controlled after about two hours, started in the 900 block  of Palisades Drive and raced up a canyon wall toward residential areas.  Twenty-nine firefighting companies battled the blaze, aided by helicopters that  dropped thousands of gallons of water over the burning brush. Residents also  aided firefighters by hosing down their multimillion-dollar homes.  </P> <P> Among those whose property was threatened by the fire was actor Chevy Chase,  who lives in the Pacific Highlands. Smoke-belching flames edged within 100  yards of estate-sized houses.  </P> <P> Julie Brodia was walking out of a market when she first noticed the blaze. She  raced toward her home on Avenida de Cortez and quickly gathered up her husband  and 14-month-old daughter.  </P> <P> "I just drove out right through the fire," Brodia said. "The flames were all up  on one side of the road, and it was hot as hell and very scary. But at least my  baby is safe."  </P> <P> Tom Rockwell, who lives at the end of the Calle de Sevilla cul-de-sac, had left  his house for his usual morning jog minutes before the fire broke out.  </P> <P> "I looked out the door, and it was a bright clear day," said Rockwell, who was  standing in front of his house still clad in running shorts. "Halfway through  my run I saw the smoke and thought, 'Oh my God!' By the time I got back the  fire was pretty much under control."  </P> <P> George Bodner watched nervously from his home at the end of Cumbre Alta Court  as the flames roared to within a few feet of his back-yard swimming pool.  </P> <P> "We were extremely lucky," he said. "I happened to look out of the back of the  house and the fire was coming straight toward us, and then suddenly the wind  shifted and took it the other way."  </P> <P> Bodner and his neighbors kept watch for most of the afternoon as four  helicopters shuttled from nearby Santa Ynez Reservoir, dumping water into the  burning canyon beneath their homes.  </P> <P> Other residents anxiously gathered at a roadblock set up at Sunset Boulevard  and Palisades Drive, all too wary of the awesome destructive powers of  uncontainable brush fires.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo said the blaze, the cause of  which was unknown, could have been a lot worse if it were not for good brush  clearance, a quick response and a "lot of luck."  </P> <P> "Twenty years ago these homes would have burned down," said Los Angeles City  Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area. "But we have avoided a  disaster. We have just done a good job of prevention."  </P> <P> Much the same could be said of the other brush fires that cut paths across the  Southland as temperatures topped the 90-degree mark in some areas and winds  gusted as high as 30 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The Diamond Bar brush fire backed up traffic for several miles on both sides of  the Pomona Freeway and came as close as 50 feet to a housing tract Friday  afternoon.  </P> <P> The blaze broke out on a hill north of the Pomona Freeway, causing a SigAlert  at 12:30 p.m. as motorists slowed to view the fire. The flames were contained  by 3 p.m. but not before the fire spread farther north over the hill,  threatening homes in the Samarran Oaks housing tract.  </P> <P> Five county fire crews, made up in large part of inmates from Azusa and La  Verne correctional facilities, fought the flames, which leaped 60 feet in the  air.  </P> <P> "I came up the street and saw it right in my back yard," said Elaine Gonzalez,  a Samarran Oaks townhouse resident. "My heart ran to my throat."  </P> <P> Firefighters were also fearful of a fast-moving brush fire that broke out in a  remote northwest Antelope Valley area known as Kings Canyon. But structures  escaped the blaze, which charred 60 acres of brush, the Los Angeles County Fire  Department reported.  </P> <P> The fire broke out about 12:45 p.m. and was contained by 5 p.m. No evacuations  were ordered although two residents fled their houses as flames approached.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Amy Wallace, Mathis Chazanov, Gabe Fuentes, Kenneth J.  Garcia, Phillip Gollner, Siok-hian Tay Kelley, John Lee and Ron Russell  contributed to this story.  </P></p>

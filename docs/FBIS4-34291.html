			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Noris Aguirre, president of the Deposit Guarantee  and Banking Protection Fund [Fogade], has announced Fogade is  considering the possibility of increasing the guarantee ceiling  for depositors from 4 to 10 million bolivares.    [Begin recording] [Cayone] Noris Aguirre made this  announcement after being summoned for questioning by the Senate  Financial Commission. She added that a decision in this regard  will be made in coming days and that Fogade's board of directors  is already considering the request on the public credit law so  that the Finance Ministry may obtain an approval from the  Central Bank of Venezuela.    Congressional financial commissions will be able to voice  their opinions once an approval is granted, and the  corresponding bonds will be issued. Along this line and in light  of presumed resistance by certain sectors to accept the bonds,  Aguirre has said Fogade has the mechanisms to place them on the  market.    [Aguirre] What I have heard is a verbal reference to a  statement that anyone could have made, but that has not been the  Banking Council's position. This view has not resulted from  discussions, and whenever bonds are issued and placed on the  market, Fogade will be able to place them through either the  financial system, the Central Bank of Venezuela, or agents in  the open market. We will talk with all sectors involved to  implement this measure.    [Cayone] Meanwhile, Banks Superintendent Cesareo Cadenas,  whom the Senate Financial Commission has also summoned, has said  that as long as funds are not made available, depositors will  not be paid.    [Cadenas] That matter is not for the superintendency or the  Board of Interventors [word indistinct] to decide; it depends on  several organizations. First, it depends on the Finance  Ministry; second, the Central Bank of Venezuela; third,  Congress. Interventors will be able to dispose of the funds once  this is implemented. I hope that whenever they have the funds to  make the payments, the programs will be ready. We will be able  to announce them to the public but, rather, with the funds on  hand.    [Cayone] But when will you begin to pay the accounts of the  [word indistinct] banks?    [Cadenas] Once the public credit law is approved.    [Cayone] Even though Aguirre has said the possibility of  increasing the guarantees for depositors is being considered,  Gustavo Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms, has insisted  payments will not exceed 4 million bolivares. Roosen was also  summoned for questioning in Congress regarding the deposits made  by the Caracas Mayoralty into Latino Bank. [end recording]</p>

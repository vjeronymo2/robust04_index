The humanitarian situation in the area is a cause for  concern, Boban says in his letter to the UN high commissioner,  and adds that almost 100,000 people are facing death by  starvation. Boban informs Sadako Ogata that in the past 50 days  each inhabitant of the besieged Croat area in cental Bosnia has  received less than 4 kg of food. Mate Boban goes on to accuse  the UNHCR of not delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged  central Bosnia populated by the Croats, since the Muslim attacks  in the area have made the Vitez-Busovaca road impassable, and  the UNHCR has kept silent about this. Boban also says that the  UNHCR is resuming aid deliveries to Zenica, and that the largest  part of the aid is taken by the Muslim army. Despite the  promises given by the UNHCR regarding this, nothing has changed,  Boban says, and adds that the humanitarian aid is used by the  Muslim army to continue the war.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Management: One switch after another LISE Bockhart is swapping her computing job at British Telecom for the exotic occupation of aromatherapist, using fragrant oils and massage to treat stresses and ailments. Her choice of a new career may be unusual but the voluntary redundancy package she has picked up from her employer is fairly typical of the terms of Release 92. A lump sum of Pounds 21,000 includes the maximum 'early leaver' bonus and money in lieu of notice. She also gets Pounds 1,000 towards the cost of her retraining. Bockhart, aged 31 and with a son of five, had worked for BT for eight years and was earning Pounds 17,000 when she left at the end of May. She says she 'moved very quickly' when she heard about the package: out of her 30 immediate colleagues, six have left under the scheme but a further four have been refused. Her Hertfordshire-based job was on BT's internal computer 'help desk', taking about 200 enquiries a day and problem solving over the telephone. Before that, Bockhart was a senior data processing officer - a job which gave her greater opportunities for overtime and shift payments. If morale within the company had not been so low and future job prospects so insecure, Bockhart says she would not have gone for voluntary redundancy. 'I knew our site was threatened with closure. 'Other sites have been moved to the far reaches of Scotland where labour is cheaper. It would have been impossible to relocate,' she says. Bockhart expects to be qualified as an aromatherapist by the New Year and wants to work freelance from her home in St Albans. 'I've left a stressful working environment. Now my job will be to treat others who are still there,' she says.</p>

Pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095, the inpatient daily percentages are 55 percent hospital, 5 percent physician, 40 percent ancillary. The outpatient daily percentages are 57 percent hospital, 10 percent physicians and 33 percent ancillary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2DoD civilian employees located in overseas areas shall be rendered a bill when services are performed. Payment is due 60 days from the date of the bill. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3Charges for PRIMUS/NAVCARE and high cost medications/services requested by external providers (Physicians, Dentists, etc.) are only relevant to the Third Party Collection Program. Third party payers (such as insurance companies) shall be billed for high cost services in those instances in which non-active duty eligible beneficiaries have medical insurance and are seen by providers external to a Military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and obtain the prescribed service or medication from an MTF. Eligible beneficiaries are not personally liable for this cost and shall not be billed by the MTF. The standard cost of high cost medications includes the cost of the drugs and dispensing services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4All quantities shown are tablets unless otherwise stated. The third party charge is only for the strengths and the dosage cited. Charges will vary if the strengths and dosage are changed. The method of computing standards costs to be charged for high cost medications is actual cost to the pharmacy, plus a 30 percent dispensing fee. Only medications listed in this schedule may be billed. If a different dose is issued for a medication that is listed, only bill if the cost is $100 or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5The attending physician is to complete the common procedure terminology code to indicate the appropriate procedure followed during cosmetic surgery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6Cosmetic surgery rates will be charged for dependents of active duty members, retirees, and their dependents and survivors.

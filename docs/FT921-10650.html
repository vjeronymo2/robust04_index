			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Neste suffer sharp fall in operating profit NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals conglomerate, suffered a sharp fall in operating profit last year to FM2.7bn (Dollars 619.3m) from the FIM4.1bn in 1990, writes Robert Taylor in Stockholm. The company blamed the decline on the performance of its chemicals business, which had been hit by a drop in world prices in the plastics and petrochemical industries. Net sales, however, rose by 11 per cent to FM51.9bn, with the biggest increase coming in the group's oil trading activities and sales of crude oil produced by the group. The corporation's investments in capital assets last year was FM5.2bn, compared with FM4.6bn. Neste also announced a Dollars 670m upgrading of the power generation capacity at its main Porvoo refinery.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOMB THREAT FORCES CLOSURE OF CAMPUS AT UC BERKELEY  </P> <P> For the first time in its history, the UC Berkeley campus was shut down and  evacuated Wednesday afternoon because of a bomb threat.  </P> <P> A mid-morning telephone caller representing an unknown group called the United  Unification Front claimed that four bombs had been planted on campus.  </P> <P> After consulting with the FBI, campus police took the threat seriously enough  to evacuate thousands of students, faculty and staff. But after searching the  campus for several hours, police found only one "suspicious-looking" package  which turned out to be harmless.  </P> <P> Police said it was possible the package had been left by the callers as part of  a hoax.  </P> <P> The campus reopened at 7 p.m.  </P></p>

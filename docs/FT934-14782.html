			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Pressure on ERM as Belgian franc hits new low THE European exchange rate mechanism yesterday came under its heaviest pressure since the currency crisis at the beginning of August that led to the widening of the ERM fluctuation bands to 15 per cent. The Belgian franc hit a new low against the D-Mark in spite of support from the country's central bank. The French franc also fell sharply as dealers speculated that a cut in French interest rates was imminent. The Belgian central bank again denied that the bank was considering a change in its strategy of shadowing the D-Mark but a bank official said: 'The markets are so volatile that it's very difficult to plan a policy.' Belgium's central interest rate was left unchanged at 9.65 per cent, but in London the Belgian franc fell below the psychologically important barrier of BFr22 to the D-Mark for the first time. It recovered slightly to close at BFr21.97, down from BFr21.89 at Wednesday's close, and well below its old ERM floor of BFr21.095 under the 2.25 per cent bands. However in late New York trading it continued to hover around BFr22.03. Pressure on the Belgian currency was exacerbated by comments attributed to Mr Jacques Poos, Luxembourg's foreign minister, which increased speculation about the future of the 71-year-old currency association between the two countries. In an interview with L'Echo, Belgium's francophone business newspaper, Mr Poos said the Grand Duchy would continue to 'march alongside' Belgium as long as it stuck to its 'franc fort' policy. But he added: 'If it abandons that policy, we will have to rely on our own means.' The French franc fell by more than a centime against the D-Mark, hitting FFr3.5425 at one stage, well below its former ERM floor before currency bands were widened to 15 per cent in August. It recovered to close at FFr3.52, as the Bank of France kept its principal rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent but slipped in New York to FFr3.537. Spain's half point cut in its key money rate to 9.5 per cent boosted Spanish government bonds and helped the peseta, although a rate cut would normally tend to weaken a currency. Mr Nicholas Parsons, an economist with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'The Spanish cut showed the way but the French and Belgians have been fighting . . . to keep rates high. The subsequent strength of the peseta shows it is not lower rates but the absence of growth caused by high rates which is killing the currencies.'

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME cuts ring-dealing charge THE LONDON Metal Exchange is to cut contract levy charges to be paid by ring-dealers next year by nearly 60 per cent - from 12p to 5p per 'lot'. Its action is in response to complaints from some ring-dealing members that they are not getting a fair deal. The exchange is experiencing record business and it further demonstrated its financial strength yesterday by deciding to return Pounds 2m of the levies raised this year to all clearing members. It paid a Pounds 1.5m levy rebate for 1992. The LME board has been wrestling for some time with the problem of how to handle complaints from some of its 16 ring-dealing members that they were carrying a greater share of the burden of running the exchange and facing more risks than non-ring-dealing members but not getting commensurate returns. Now, as a first move, the board has decided that next year the ring-dealers will pay lower contract levies - those for other LME members remain at 12p a 'lot'. For four years the LME's business in tonnage terms has risen at an annual average of 30 per cent. By the end of October this year it was 45 per cent ahead of the same months in 1992. Turnover is expected to reach USDollars 1bn compared with Dollars 700m last year. The LME reported pre-tax profit just above Pounds 1m for 1992 compared with Pounds 1.4m a year earlier.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MEN WARNED ON NUDE SUNBATHING  </P> <P> Men who frequently sunbathe nude using ultraviolet lamps substantially increase  their risk of developing a rare and potentially fatal genital cancer, according  to a new study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The  study shows that the penis is particularly susceptible to the carcinogenic  effects of sunlight, and it advised men who are frequently exposed to  ultraviolet radiation in tanning salons, on the beach, or for therapeutic  purposes to protect themselves.  </P> <P> "Occasional sun exposure carries little risk. We are talking about people who  like to tan all over and do it year in and year out and are using a variety of  ultraviolet light devices," said Dr. Robert Stern, a dermatologist at Harvard  Medical School, who led the study.  </P> <P> Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation is estimated to cause some 90% of  the 500,000 cases of skin cancer in the United States each year.  </P> <P> The study reviewed a group of 892 men who, over a 12-year period, received high  doses of ultraviolet light and chemicals called psoralens for the treatment of  psoriasis, a commonly used therapy for severe cases of the skin disease. The  incidence of cancer of the penis and scrotum was nearly 300 times higher in  these men than in the general population.  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Catalonia sees war of words as dangerous fantasy: A look at the growing row over the Catalan language law which has been referred to Spain's highest court In Scoop, the British writer Evelyn Waugh's seminal satire on journalistic jaunts, a celebrated war correspondent sent to cover a revolution in a Balkans capital oversleeps in his train carriage, wakes up in the wrong city, blithely rattles off dispatches about flaming churches and dead children, and succeeds in creating financial panic, famine and a revolution on his hotel doorstep. Waugh's fable resurfaced two weeks ago in an editorial on the Catalan language question in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia. Mr Jordi Pujol, president of Catalonia's autonomous government, the Generalitat, since 1980, has since seized the story to explain in subsequent press conferences that the supposed row is a fantasy which could turn dangerous. At issue is a Catalan language law, unanimously passed by Catalonia's parliament 11 years ago in one of Mr Pujol's earliest legislative initiatives, that has been referred by the Supreme Court in Madrid to the Constitutional Court, an even higher Madrid-based judicial body whose 12 members are the watchdogs of civic rights and duties. The Constitutional Court has to decide whether the language law infringes the rights of Spanish speakers in Catalonia by forcing them to learn Catalan, a language that the post-Franco constitution asserts is co-official with Spanish in the area. It is expected to spend months pondering over its ruling. In Mr Pujol's view there is no issue and no row - only interested parties who seek to rock Catalonia's calm. The Scoop-like correspondent creating the storm is a well-known extreme right-winger in Barcelona and a lawyer, Mr Esteban Gomez Rovira, aided and abetted by the conservative Madrid newspaper ABC. Mr Gomez Rovira has been fighting legal battles to curb the growing use of Catalan in the area's schools ever since the language law was enacted. In 1985 and 1987 he survived bomb attacks from Catalan extremists. His latest assault, now before the Constitutional Court, follows what he terms 'a turn of the screw by the Generalitat'. The twist by Mr Pujol's government, which has so far gained the backing of the judiciary for its educational initiatives, has been its insistence on Catalan-only schooling for children up to the age of seven under a new policy called 'linguistic immersion'. Mr Gomez Rovira sees the development as one step further in the creation of a monolingual culture that will destroy 'the unity of Spain'. ABC has given the lawyer a platform for his views ('it has made all the difference', he says). The newspaper claims that Mr Pujol is seeking to stamp out Spanish just as Francoism sought to eradicate the language of Catalonia. Surveys conducted by the Generalitat, and a succession of views in Barcelona from a cross-section of native Catalans and of immigrants to the area, suggest a very different picture to the one painted by ABC. The vast majority are functionally bilingual; they do not question the Generalitat's weighting towards Catalan and they are not 'unlearning' their Spanish. Unlike other minority languages that have become nationalist emblems, Catalan is a romance language that is easy to learn and, more importantly, it is very much a living language that carries social prestige. Immigrants from southern Spain, who swelled Barcelona dormitory towns such as Santa Coloma from 12,000 in the 1950s to 140,000 today, wanted to learn the language of the foreman on the building site and in the workshop. Mr Pujol's education department claims that over the past five years the percentage of Catalonia's 6m inhabitants that does not understand Catalan has been reduced from 9.4 per cent to 6.2 per cent; nearly 94 per cent understand Catalan, 68 per cent can speak and read it and 40 per cent can write it. The department's officials say that far from discriminating against immigrants, the 'linguistic immersion' policy wants to ensure that children from Spanish-speaking homes will have an equal opportunity in a schooling system where more than half the subjects are taught in Catalan. To date, less than 500 parents have backed Mr Gomez Rovira's campaign to demand Spanish-language schooling with Catalan as an optional subject. Mr Pujol believes that the cornerstone of continued calm and consensus in Catalonia is the maintenance of the present impulse towards cementing a bilingual society. He fears that the Constitutional Court might, like Mr Gomez Rovira and the Scoop journalist, wake up at the wrong station, and create an artificial conflict by upholding a dual schooling system that would prove dangerously divisive.</p>

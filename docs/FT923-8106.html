			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading CONTINUED nervousness and uncertainty about the outlook once again dominated trading in the derivatives, sending stock index futures falling as dealers focused on unsubstantiated rumours, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE opened strongly with the first bargain struck at 2,326, 9 points above Tuesday's close. The contract moved gently forward and reached the session's high point of 2,340 by mid-morning, when a period of sideways trading ensued. Speculation about events in the Middle East and later about the UK chancellor's tenure caused the sharp retreat of September. A poor Wall Street combined with sell orders from two securities houses led to a continued slide and by 4pm it had fallen to 2,294, at which point it was trading at a discount to the cash market. Bargain hunting just before the close helped the contract end above the day's low point and September closed at 2,301, down 16 on it previous close and around 10 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 12. Turnover was 7,407. Total volume in the traded options was poor reaching 22,556 contracts, of which 13,631 was in the FT-SE 100.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jelena Radovanov on statements by Italian Foreign </F> Minister Antonio Martino and FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic in Belgrade on 28 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Martino, in English fading into Radovanov report in  Serbo-Croatian] The talks with President Milosevic were  extremely interesting and fruitful, Italian Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino said. These are the final talks with all the  sides that are involved in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war in order  to find ways for progress and peace, and to prepare for the  meeting of the G-7 and Russia in two weeks time in Naples,  Minister Martino said. The talks with President Milosevic were  cordial and very instructive. I am an optimist when it comes to  the future. I think that we should overcome the disorder of the  present and the historical roots of the conflict, and turn to  the future and its promises. I think, Minister Martino said,  that peace is essential for the prosperity of this region and  these countries, as well as for the entire Europe. I was happy  to hear what President Milosevic had to say and to draw  conclusions from his views, Minister Martino said.    This is how FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Foreign  Minister Jovanovic assessed the talks between Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic and Italian Foreign Minister Martino:    [Jovanovic] I will go along with what the minister said  about the talks being cordial and substantive, and that they  showed that both sides are very interested in reaching peace as  soon as possible, and in the removal of all the artificial  obstacles that thwart the efforts for reaching peace even before  the latest efforts. [sentence as heard] We are particularly  encouraged by the fact that the new Italian Government is going  to intensify its activities in the process, and do everything it  can to mark the departure from the policy of double standards so  that a principled approach is formed toward the Yugoslav crisis.  A principled approach is the only one that can lead to peace.  The talks about all the aspects of the Yugoslav crisis show the  common concern for peace, and the readiness of both sides to  contribute to a positive solution for Bosnia [words indistinct].    We believe that -- together with Italy as the most important  neighboring country -- we will find ways for developing a  constructive cooperation and continuing political contacts.</p>

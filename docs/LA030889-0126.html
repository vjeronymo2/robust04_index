			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VARIAN SAYS IT WON'T FIGHT FTC DECISION ON DEAL  </P> <P> Varian Associates said it will not fight the Federal Trade Commission's  decision to block the $65.8-million sale of its vacuum products division to the  BOC Group of Britain.  </P> <P> The company said it had been notified by the FTC that the agency would not  approve the planned sale and had authorized its staff to seek a preliminary  court injunction against the deal.  </P> <P> The FTC said the combination of the Varian division with BOC's Edwards High  Vacuum business would control too large a share of the market for a specific  leak-detection device.  </P> <P> Varian Associates produces systems and components for communications, defense,  scientific, medical and industrial markets.  </P></p>

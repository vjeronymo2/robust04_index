			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / People: Canary Wharf Canary Wharf, the company which owns the Docklands property development of the same name, has appointed Patrick Garner as an executive director. Garner (above right), who was born in New Zealand, joins Canary Wharf from the property subsidiary of Trafalgar House, where he was business development director. He was previously chairman and chief executive of Chase Property Holdings. Last Friday Canary Wharf emerged from administration under UK insolvency legislation. Garner's fellow directors are Sir Peter Levene, the former head of procurement at the MoD, who is chairman and chief executive, and Gerald Rothman (above left), who is the only director to survive from the period before Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf - as it was formerly known - went into administration last year. Canary Wharf is now in the process of trying to recruit non-executive directors. It is owned by Sylvester Investments, in turn owned by a group of banks which provided loans for the development.</p>

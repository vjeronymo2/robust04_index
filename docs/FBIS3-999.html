			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Former Bophuthatswana chief negotiator Rowan Cronje  has predicted that other anti-ANC [African National Congress]  homeland governments could collapse in the same was as  Bophuthatswana. He said that what had happened in  Bophuthatswana was happening in Ciskei today and could happen in  kwaZulu tomorrow. He said homelands not aligned to the ANC  could expect the same turmoil that had brought about the demise  of Bophuthatswana. Meanwhile, hundreds of nurses in Ciskei have  staged a protest in Bisho to demand that their pensions and  gratuity payments be paid to them before the end of this month.  Yesterday, Ciskeian public servants warned that they could turn  to Bophuthatswana-style civil disobedience if their pensions  were not paid out.</p>

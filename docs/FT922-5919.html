			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fresh doubts on payment to Davy holders Former shareholders of Davy Corporation seem little closer to receiving their second payment of Pounds 54m in spite of a deal concerning Emerald Producer, the floating oil production facility which cost Davy its independence. Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group which took over Davy, said yesterday it had reached an agreement with Midland and Scottish Resources, the oil company which ordered the rig from Davy. Trafalgar will lease the Emerald to MSR for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 37,000) a day. Trafalgar made the second payment to Davy shareholders, worth 45p a share, conditional on it receiving payment for the Emerald from MSR, which so far has been unable to draw on letters of credit, which expire on June 30. Trafalgar believes it remains unlikely that MSR will be able to get the necessary certification before June 30, or have the deadline extended.</p>

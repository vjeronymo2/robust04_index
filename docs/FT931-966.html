			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Swiss carrier halves dividends SWISSAIR, the Swiss national airline, said it would halve the dividends on its shares and dividend right certificates following unsatisfactory 1992 results. While group net profits rose more than one-third to SFr113m (Dollars 75.3m), the gain was mainly due to sales of aircraft and profits from ancillary activities. For the third consecutive year, flight operations were in loss. Group revenues rose 4.7 per cent to SFr6.4bn. Traffic volume increased 9.1 per cent to 2.7bn revenue tonne kilometres, but the parent airline company's revenues were up only 2.7 per cent to SFr5.5bn. The airline's net profit, including proceeds from aircraft sales, fell 54 per cent to SFr20.8m. The directors proposed SFr10 per share on the shares and SFr2 per certificate. Leu Holding, the private banking subsidiary within the financial group built around Credit Suisse, said its consolidated net profit rose 14 per cent last year to SFr104m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The Zimbabwe Association  of Democratic Lawyers on May 2 published a statement denouncing  the repression of the General Association of Korean Residents in  Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan by the Japanese  authorities.    The statement notes that the police of Japan which styles  itself a law-governed country breaks into lawful Chongnyon  organisations in broad daylight and commits outrages and  gangsters, running about in packs, openly commit murder and  violence against Koreans in Japan.    "This is an intolerable infringement upon the human rights  of  the Koreans in Japan, legitimate citizens overseas of the DPRK,  and outrageous acts violating the international law," it notes  and stresses:    "The Japanese authorities must promptly stop suppression of  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it".    It strongly demands that the Japanese authorities give up  immediately their hostile policy against the DPRK and stop  forthwith nuclear armament directed against it.</p>

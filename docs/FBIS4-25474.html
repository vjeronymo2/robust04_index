			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Qin Yucai (4440 3768 2088) of the Investment Department </F> of State Planning Commission: "Maintain Reasonable Increase in  Agricultural Investment"]    [Text] Agriculture is the foundation of the national  economy. Only by consolidating agriculture and stabilizing rural  areas can the whole country maintain stability, the reform  proceed smoothly, and the economy attain sustained, fast, and  healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660]  development. Therefore, energetically increasing the  comprehensive production capacity of agriculture, maintaining  rational increases in agricultural investment, and stabilizing  agricultural development is a major task concerning the  country's overall interests.    Problems in agriculture have many causes, one of which is  inadequate input. It is a rather complicated problem that has  cropped up in the process of deepening economic structural  reform.    1. Proportion of investments in agricultural capital  construction:    If calculated according to industry statistics, investment  in  agricultural capital construction from the First through the  Fifth Five-Year Plans was 77.543 billion yuan and the average  ratio of investment in agricultural capital construction to  total investment in capital construction nationwide was 10.5  percent; in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the figure was 17.284  billion yuan, 5.1 percent; in the Seventh Five-Year Plan, 30.393  billion yuan, 3.3 percent; in 1991, 8.5 billion yuan, 4.0  percent; in 1992, 11.27 billion yuan, 3.7 percent; and in 1993,  13.69 billion yuan, 4.4 percent.    The following three reasons mainly contributed to the  decrease in the proportion of investment in agricultural capital  construction:    First, the sources of capital construction investment  changed, investors were more varied, and the proportion of state  budgetary investment significantly dropped. From the First  through the Fifth Five-Year Plans, the sources of funds for  investment in capital construction by the state lacked variety  and the state budgetary investment accounted for 80-90 percent.  But since the Sixth Five-Year Plan, channels for pooling funds  for investment in capital construction have increased,  extra-budgetary investment (including bank loans, foreign  capital utilized, and self-raised funds) has gone up  considerably, and the proportion of budgetary investment by the  state has dropped tremendously. Consequently, the ratio of  investment in agricultural to total investment in capital  construction diminished.    Second, fields for investment expanded. Since the Sixth  Five-Year Plan, with the national economy moving ahead, the  expansion of new domains for industrial investment, such as  petrochemicals, chemicals, electronics, and new materials, have  caused a comparative reduction of the percentage of agricultural  investment, but investment in industries that aid agriculture  has increased.    Third, after the proportion of budgetary investment in  agriculture dropped, other financing channels have gradually  come into play. Apart from investment in capital construction,  over 15 billion yuan of fiscal and bank loans have been put into  agriculture each year. Therefore, though the absolute figure of  investment in agricultural capital construction has been rising  every year over the past few years, it has been very hard for  the proportion of investment in agricultural capital  construction to go up as a result of the increased variety of  investment channels.    2. Measures taken in 1994 for to increase the percentage of  investment in agricultural capital construction controlled by  the central authorities:    Increasing budgetary input and input of bank loans. In 1994,  central budgetary investment nationwide increased by 3 billion  yuan, of which 650 million yuan was allocated to agriculture,  taking up 21.7 percent of the total increase. Bank credit  increased by 19.8 billion yuan (with 13 billion yuan of new  loans), of which 2.1 billion yuan was allocated to agriculture,  taking up 10.6 percent of the total increase (or 16.2 percent of  the total value of new loans.    In 1994, budgetary investment in agricultural capital  construction and bank credit arranged by the central government  registered 10.485 billion yuan, up 35.6 percent over the 1993  figure of 7.735 billion yuan. The increase was 12.9 percentage  points, higher than comparable increase rates in all other  industries and trades arranged by the central government.    In 1994, the ratio of the budgetary investment in  agriculture  and bank credit arranged by the central government to nationwide  investment and bank loans budgeted by the central government was  8.5 percent, 0.8 percentage point higher than the 1993  percentage of 7.7.    3. Aside from direct investment in agriculture, forestry,  and water resources, favorable arrangements have also been made  for the investment in such agriculture-aiding industries as  chemical fertilizers, farm chemicals, plastic sheeting, farm  machines, and electric supply for agriculture.    4. Investment by local governments, collectives, and  individuals should also be increased gradually. Local  governments should assume the bulk of the responsibility for  investment in agricultural capital construction, while central  government investment should concentrate on core projects for  harnessing major rivers and lakes that cover a number of  provinces or regions, the construction of large agricultural  commodities and shelter-forests, and the development of  scientific research institutes serving the whole country and  institutions of higher learning. It is necessary to take  effective measures to guide peasants to increase productive  input in agriculture.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;  </P> <P> OPERA, SYMPHONY CHIEFS HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR '90S  </P> <P> In the 1990s, San Diego's classical music institutions hope to atone for the  sins of the last decade.  </P> <P> At Symphony Hall, incoming music director Yoav Talmi will undertake the musical  reconstruction of an orchestra that has been without a music director for three  years, while executive director Wesley Brustad and board members look for a  generous donor whose "naming gift" will absorb half of the lingering $4-million  debt.  </P> <P> Ian Campbell, having put San Diego Opera's house in fiscal order, is more  concerned with righting the sins of omission (mainly in programming) over the  last decade.  </P> <P> "Our immediate challenge is to include 20th-Century repertory in our seasons as  a matter of course," said Campbell, the opera's general director. "Not that the  company hasn't done this repertory in the past, but we've had no regular diet  to allow our audiences to grow into newer operas. As we enter the last decade  of the century, we need to do a gentle catch-up."  </P> <P> Not only is Campbell promising 20th-Century opera in every season -- and he  insisted that he means operas more adventuresome than late Puccini and Richard  Strauss -- he intends to restore American opera to the company's offerings at  least every other year.  </P> <P> "We will have two 20th-Century operas in 1991, including (American composer)  Carlisle Floyd's 'The Passion of Jonathan Wade,' with Floyd directing the  production." Less well-known than Floyd's other operas -- "Susannah" and "Of  Mice and Men" are his calling cards -- "The Passion of Jonathan Wade" is echt  Americana, set in South Carolina immediately after the Civil War. Commissioned  by New York City Opera, the opera was first performed in 1962.  </P> <P> As part of a cautious expansion of the company's season at Civic Theatre,  Campbell sees a five-opera season for the first half of the 1990s and a  six-opera season by the second half of the decade.  </P> <P> "I see the market place more complex in the 1990s, and we have to be practical  about expanding," Campbell explained. He noted, however, that the success of  "Cats," "Les Miserables," and "Phantom of the Opera" on the popular  contemporary music stage could be beneficial for traditional opera.  </P> <P> "These shows are actually opera in their form, because they are sung all the  way through with little or no dialogue. They could act as a bridge for people  who have previously avoided opera and encourage them to try something like  "Madama Butterfly."  </P> <P> Campbell, recently returned from a European scouting mission, had no news to  report about up-and-coming tenor superstars to add to the performances. He did,  however, manage to sign the promising young German baritone Hans Peter  Blochwitz to sing a recital here in October, 1990, which will mark his American  recital debut.  </P> <P> Other singers Campbell promises in San Diego Opera productions during the 1990s  include familiar names such as Carol Vaness, Hakan Hagegard, Ashley Putnam and  Diana Soviero. Among the younger singers, he has signed American tenors Richard  Leech and Gary Lakes, as well as baritone Thomas Hampson.  </P> <P> "In the coming decade, we will be hiring fewer foreign singers in major roles  because a new crop of American singers is just now coming into its own."  </P> <P> Campbell also indicated that his company might dabble in the Gilbert and  Sullivan repertory or include an occasional classic American musical in its  lineup, although not without first talking with local companies who specialize  in these areas to ensure that the opera company will undertake complementary  offerings. He is also keeping his eye on the vacant -- and currently unrestored  -- Balboa Theater as a potential venue for chamber opera, an alternative season  geared to appeal to a new audience.  </P> <P> When Campbell pulls out his wish list, the Australian native dreams of a  dramatic new opera complex on the San Diego harbor, much like the  architecturally stunning opera house in Sydney. Although with a probable price  tag of $150 million, Campbell's company is not about to undertake a building  fund.  </P> <P> For the decade's close, Campbell envisions the company commissioning an opera  to herald the year 2000.  </P> <P> "For a new century, we need to premiere a new opera. San Diego Opera hasn't  commissioned an opera since Menotti's 'La Loca' (1979). We need to do it as a  statement."  </P> <P> For the San Diego Symphony, Brustad has concrete plans for the next three to  five years.  </P> <P> "First of all, the orchestra will be recording for first time ever on a major  label. When we start seeing the records in stores, it won't be a big money  thing, but it will be a significant achievement for the musicians," Brustad  said.  </P> <P> "Secondly, Yoav (Talmi) and I are committed to the touring of the orchestra,  not because we think that we are the Philadelphia Orchestra, but for the  artistic development of the orchestra's ensemble by playing in other venues in  different cities. Touring also brings back good will here to the city. If  people here in town read in an out-of-town newspaper, 'These guys played like  angels,' then they're more than just the hometown boys."  </P> <P> Concerning changes in the orchestra's programming, the ball is now in Talmi's  court.  </P> <P> "He has a wide repertory," Brustad noted, "but I'm curious to see how it will  play in the first couple of years. It's different to talk about varied  programming and then get into the music director's chair, where you're the one  who's going to be shot at. You tend to tighten up a little bit. It will be  interesting for me to see how he maneuvers his way through. I know that he does  not want to isolate contemporary music into a single series by itself,  however."  </P> <P> Brustad's biggest hope for the decade is to move from Hospitality Point on  Mission Bay into a new home for the symphony's summer concerts.  </P> <P> "What we've got out there is cute and nice, but it's a little temporary. After  eight years, we need something more substantial, a larger, permanent venue on  the water that will allow us to move toward more of a Hollywood Bowl venue and  program."  </P> <P> According to Brustad, he is not simply empire building. This type of summer  facility with income-producing events augmenting the pops programs is essential  for the orchestra's future economic stability.  </P> <P> "I don't see this town supporting its orchestra like they do in Boston. It's  simple as the weather. It's just too nice to live here, which is why the summer  pops works so beautifully -- it's outdoors. You don't fight the weather; you're  part of it."  </P></p>

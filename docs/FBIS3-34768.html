			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Salah Salah, a member of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] Political Bureau, has said that  under the proposed peace agreement the Palestinians are being  denied the right to repatriation. He stressed the need for  dialogue between the Palestinians and Lebanon regarding both  side's refusal to accept permanent settlement of Palestinians in  Lebanon.    Criticizing the Lebanese Government, he said it wants to  dismantle, not rebuild, the Palestinian camps and wants to drive  the Palestinians to integrate into society so that the  population of the camps will lose their cohesiveness. He noted  that this policy furthers the permanent settlement of  Palestinians in Lebanon.    In an interview with the Voice of the Mountain, Salah called  for expanding the current camps or building new ones. He  praised the great understanding shown by Minister Junblatt on  Palestinian civil rights. He said the Palestinian issue will be  discussed with Prime Minister al-Hariri soon and urged the labor  minister to help resolve the problem of Palestinian employment  in Lebanon.</p>

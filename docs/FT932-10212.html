			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Radiotrust value starts picking up Reflecting the continuing difficult trading conditions, net asset value of Radiotrust at January 31 had fallen to 48.3p, compared with 49.9p six months' earlier and with 50.2p at end-January 1992. Since then, however, it had edged upwards as signs of the ending of the recession had begun to appear, the directors said. In the year ended January 31 1993 income totalled Pounds 113,000 (Pounds 127,000) but there was a net loss of Pounds 22,000 (Pounds 26,000), equal to 0.25p (0.3p) per share. The current year promised to be 'more stimulating' than the last two as the recession faded and advertising revenues began to climb, the directors claimed.</p>

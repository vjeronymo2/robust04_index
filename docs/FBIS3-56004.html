			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vladislav Chernukha; from the "News and </F> Views" program]    [Text] On Thursday [13 January] the Russian-American talks  at the highest level are to open in Moscow. The United States  President, Bill Clinton, arrives in Moscow on Wednesday evening.  What does Moscow expect from the talks between President Boris  Yeltsin and President Bill Clinton? Vladislav Chernukha,  accredited to the summit, got the following information at the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this is what he writes:    The first official visit of Bill Clinton to Russia, in the  first instance, should confirm the progress that has been  achieved in bilateral relations between the two countries in the  past year. Second, it is expected that concrete ways of tuning  the relationship between these countries, and also the  perfecting of the cooperation mechanism and joint actions on the  international arena will be worked out.    It is difficult to conclude that the bilateral relationship  between Russia and America are developing smoothly, without  hitches. Naturally, there are complications and problems. But  at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the view is that the  most important thing is that both Russia and America are  embarking on a new stage, a stage of mature relationship and  mature strategic partnership.    The difficulties on the road in these matters are connected,  first of all, with all those problems of the world that Russia  and America are called upon to solve. By the way, the problems  are not only global but (?uncommon), (?for the) developments in  the world have entered a new stage. Since we run into new  problems and are meeting new challenges, specific differences in  approaches do sometimes appear. It is necessary to add that  these problems and underestimation in certain issues [as heard],  had led to unnecessary waste of time in the establishment of  Russian-American partnership.    Besides, as two great powers, Russia and America have their  specific interests that do not always coincide, and this is  natural. The most important thing is that both countries should  aim at further development and perfection of their partnership.    According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, this will become  clear and will be elaborated at the impending summit. Taking  into consideration the fact that both Russia and America are  powers, potentially great in significance and influence in the  world, and taking into account how their bilateral relationship  develops to a great extent to such a level, (?that) development  in the world is accordingly affected. [sentence as heard]    Vladislav Chernukha sought the views of the Russian Foreign  Ministry about the reported meeting planned for Friday between  Russia, America, and Ukraine in Moscow, and the expected signing  of a three-sided document. The Russian Foreign Ministry said  that the most significant thing about the document was the  confirmation by Ukraine of its intention to become a nuclear  free country, and the elimination of all the strategic nuclear  weapons on its territory and its readiness to join the accord on  nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.    In the opinion of the Russian Foreign Ministry, this step  will strengthen security, not only in Europe, but, more  importantly, in the whole world.</p>

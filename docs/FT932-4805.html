			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / WHO wants Dollars 2.5bn a year to fight Aids THE WORLD Health Organisation yesterday appealed for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to be spent each year in developing countries for the prevention of the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes Aids. The organisation argued the programme could cut the number of new adult infections during the rest of the decade in half - from nearly 20m to 10m. 'It would be an investment on which the returns could be huge,' said Dr Michael Merson, director of WHO's global programme on Aids. 'WHO estimates it could save nearly Dollars 90m in direct and indirect costs by the turn of the century.' He said the biggest increase over the last 12 months has been in Latin America, south Asia, and south-east Asia. In each region there are at least 1.5m infections. The growth of infection in south Asia and south-east Asia has been explosive, said Dr Merson. In Thailand, for example, the number of infected people has increased from little more than 50,000 in 1990 to 450,000 by late last year. The programme would prevent more than 4m infections in Africa, the same number in Asia and about 1m in Latin America. 'The world can find this money if it wants to. It would hardly buy a single can of Coke for every person in the world,' said Dr Merson. He argued that funds could come not only from the first world but also developing nations. 'I appeal to world leaders to help mobilise resources from national budgets, non-governmental organisations and the private sector. We can afford Aids prevention. We cannot afford to neglect it,' he said. The programme of basic measures would include the promotion and distribution of condoms in the general population; the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases because of their role in the spread of HIV; Aids information and education; promotion of condoms among prostitutes and clients; maintenance of a safe blood supply for transfusions; and needle-exchange programmes. Meanwhile Dr Anthony Fauci of the US-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said new data demonstrated the need for early pharmaceutical intervention in HIV-positive patients who have not yet developed symptoms. There is now evidence the HIV virus remains highly active even during its so-called latent phase, when it appears to have low concentrations in the blood. During this phase the virus actually replicates extremely rapidly in the lymph system, he said. One possible route would provide medicines to support the immune system. Such drugs could be used in combination with other treatments such as AZT, Wellcome's treatment, he said.</p>

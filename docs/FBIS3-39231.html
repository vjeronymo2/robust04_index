Talks have already entered the final phase, the  politician stated in Bonn today. Without a conclusion of the  negotiations, the agreement between Lufthansa and United  Airlines cannot come into force. The U.S. side "needed more  time than we would have liked," the minister stressed.  According to Wissmann, in the agreements reached so far U.S.  and German interests balance each other.</p>

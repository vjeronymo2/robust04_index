			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ANHUI RIBAO correspondent (Li Changfang) and station </F> correspondent (Zhan Xu) from the conference hall of the Second  Session of the Eighth National People's Congress in Beijing;  from the "Provincial Hookup" program]    [Text] While listening to the Anhui delegation's  discussion of Premier Li Peng's government work report on 14  March, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee  [CPCCC] Political Bureau and member of the CPCCC Secretariat,  stressed that agriculture is of extremely great importance to  China and Anhui. Wen Jiabao said: In 1993, we focused attention  on fulfilling three tasks for peasants and achieved  comparatively marked success. First, we lightened peasants'  burden. Second, no more IOU's were issued for the purchase of  agricultural and sideline products. Third, to a certain extent,  we put an end to letting land in rural areas lay uncultivated  and to the exodus of rural areas' funds and personnel to other  localities through macroeconomic regulation and control. The  three tasks brought about a fundamental change in the situation  of our having once attached little importance to the  agricultural sector. Meanwhile, they showed that we can succeed  in doing something for the agricultural sector so long as we  have the determination.    Touching on the problems confronting the agricultural sector  this year, Wen Jiabao said: This year, as far as the nation is  concerned, the three most important tasks concerning the  agricultural sector and rural areas are as follows: First, we  must maintain a steady increase in the production of such main  agricultural and sideline products as grain, cotton, and cooking  oil; and we must do a good job of carrying out the vegetable  basket project so as to guarantee the supply of grain, cotton,  cooking oil, and other agricultural and sideline products and to  guarantee a stable market. Second, we must continue to increase  peasants' income. Third, we must maintain social stability in  rural areas. So far as Anhui is concerned, it must bear in mind  these three tasks and focus attention on fulfilling the  following tasks: First, it must maintain a steady increase in  the production of grain and cotton. Last year, Anhui increased  grain output by a comparatively big margin and its peasants  increased income comparatively quickly. This represented a  comparatively outstanding success among those scored by the  provinces and municipality in southern China and by all other  areas across the country; this also showed that the Anhui party  committee and government had attached great importance to the  role played by agriculture as the national economy's foundation.  Second, Anhui must increase peasants' incomes and continue to  make efforts to improve their living standards. Efforts must be  made to develop a highly efficient type of farming that provides  greater and better yields through restructuring, to exploit  various resources, to develop primary and secondary industries,  and to develop village and town enterprises. Anhui must take  comprehensive measures to increase peasants' incomes. Third,  Anhui must step up efforts to carry out infrastructure  construction for water conservancy works so as to enhance the  agricultural sector's comprehensive capabilities of production  and resistance against natural disasters. This task is of  extremely great importance to Anhui. This year, it is still  necessary for Anhui to continue to pay close attention to  carrying out the harnessing of the Huai He in accordance with  the central authorities' plan. Fourth, Anhui must strengthen  leadership over agricultural and rural work and further bring  into play the peasants' initiative. Anhui carried out rural  reform ahead of all other provinces in China. It may be said  that rural reform is a successful practice for the establishment  of a socialist market economic system and has important [words  indistinct] significance for us to reform the whole economic  structure. It is hoped that Anhui will continue to give full  play to its own strong points and will properly protect, guide,  and bring into full play the initiative of peasants through  deepening reform.    Finally, Wen Jiabao said: The central authorities recently  drew up a series of policies and measures to improve the  agricultural sector. What counts is our paying close attention  to their implementation.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley slips to Pounds 9m Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of highly illustrated reference books, expects a 'reasonable contribution' to group profits this year from its new generation of multimedia products. The group is this week launching five CD-ROM products - which combine words, pictures and text on personal computers - at recommended prices ranging from Pounds 49-Pounds 99 in the UK and Dollars 60-Dollars 130 (about Pounds 40-Pounds 80) in the US. Titles include The Ultimate Human Body and Incredible Cross-Sections. Mr Peter Gill, finance director, said profitability would depend partly on whether prices were held at this level - particularly in the US, where earlier multimedia products had been discounted. DK reported a 6.3 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 9.65m to Pounds 9.04m, in the year to June 30, in spite of increasing sales by 23 per cent to Pounds 107m (Pounds 87.4m). The group blamed the shortfall on investment in new businesses, distribution problems and a slower than expected take-off by DK Education, which supplies kits to schools. Mr Peter Kindersley, chairman and chief executive, said the UK bookshop market was flat and the situation was not being helped by uncertainty over the future of the Net Book Agreement, which allows publishing groups to set minimum prices. DK said it was disappointed by the proposed withdrawal of the publisher Hodder Headline from the NBA, as it believed the agreement's abandonment would result in the closure of smaller, independent bookshops and the availability of fewer titles. Mr Gill said: 'If there is a snowballing effect with other publishers joining Hodder, then there may be an impact.' DK Adult division increased sales by 23 per ent to Pounds 62m, representing 58 per cent of total turnover. Best-selling titles were on sex, gardening and pasta. DK Children's division increased sales by 19 per cent to Pounds 31.7m, comprising 30 per cent of total turnover. Earnings per share fell 15 per cent to 8.4p (9.9p). A proposed final dividend of 2.2p maintains the total at 3.3p. COMMENT The quality of DK's products continues to dazzle, but uncertainties cloud aspects of its markets. Although the UK now accounts for only 25 per cent of group sales, the break-up of the NBA would not be welcomed by a publisher which enjoys premium prices. Investment in multimedia is one reason why administrative expenses jumped from Pounds 19m to Pounds 25m, but it is much harder to estimate the profits potential of the new CD-ROM products - not least until the extent of retail discounting is established. Having sorted out last year's distribution problems should help forecast profits reach nearly Pounds 12m in the current year. That puts the shares, up 2p to 299p yesterday, on a prospective multiple of 28 - nearly double the market average. The rating reflects the premium which investors are prepared to pay for a stake in the new information revolution, but leaves no room for disappointment.</p>

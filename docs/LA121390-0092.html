			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> HARBOR COMMISSION OKS 20-YEAR LEASE  </P> <P> The Port of Hueneme took a major step closer to becoming the nation's first  regional cleanup center for catastrophic oil spills as Oxnard Harbor District  commissioners agreed to lease a section of the port to an oil industry  consortium for the next 20 years.  </P> <P> At their meeting Monday, harbor commissioners agreed to lease 6.3 acres of the  port to the oil industry's Marine Spill Response Corp. beginning at $1.03  million a year. The lease includes a 104,000-square-foot building, berths for  two vessels and an operations center at the deep-water port.  </P> <P> If the lease is approved by the corporation's governing board, the port will  gain national prestige as the training center for the oil industry's  preparations to handle spills the size of the one created by the Exxon Valdez  in Alaska last year.  </P> <P> The 20-year lease has a 10-year renewal option. The first year represents an  increase of $600,000 over rents being paid by 10 tenants, who will need to  relocate, said Anthony Taormina, port executive director.  </P> <P> By 1992, the corporation, financed by a consortium of large oil companies,  would have invested more than $60 million in equipment and improvements at the  port. The center is expected to bring 65 full-time jobs as well as temporary  and training positions.  </P> <P> The corporation also plans to build a 12,000-square-foot operations center in  Port Hueneme. The Oxnard Harbor District agreed to reimburse the corporation  for $275,000 of the building's costs. The district will also pay $35,000 to  improve its mooring system to handle a 240-foot spill recovery barge and a  200-foot cleanup vessel.  </P> <P> As part of the lease agreement, the harbor district also promised to spend  $5,000 to $8,000 to clean up a stretch of pavement contaminated with high  levels of oil-based waste. The suspected source of the contamination is a  former spray-painting booth on the property and the past practice of spraying  oil on the ground to control dust, Taormina said.  </P> <P> "With the marine spill center, our port is certainly in the big leagues now,"  Commissioner Bob Jennings said.  </P> <P> The commissioners passed a resolution Monday asking the county to exempt the  lease from environmental reviews under the California Environmental Quality  Act, arguing that the center would be housed in existing buildings that have  been used for similar purposes.  </P> <P> Under established financial agreements, the city of Port Hueneme will get about  $50,000 for the first five years from the deal.

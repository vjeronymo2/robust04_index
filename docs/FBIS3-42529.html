Oriented on Large-Scale  Prestigious Manned Flights, Russian Cosmonautics May Repeat the  Errors of the Soviets"]    [Text] The government of the Russian Federation, in  approving the federal space program for the period up to 2000,  allowed the RSA (Russian Space Agency) to make advance payment  for purchase of standard space complexes in an amount of  30% of  their cost (as is the practice in the defense industry). The  Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Finance in preparing  the 1994 budget were told to put all space expenditures in a  separate item. The RSA will receive 167 billion rubles of  appropriations for research, development, testing and  engineering work, 16 billion for the maintenance of surface  services, 10 billion for capital construction and 81.8 billion  for the purchase of standard- produced equipment. And in 1993  (in actuality antedated) the branch was allocated 164.8 billion  rubles. In essence this money represents the state debt for  research, development, testing and engineering work already done  and for purchased equipment, compensation for expenditures for  the maintenance of cosmodromes, etc. A resolution of the  Council of Ministers provides for preferred conversion credits  for only 16 branch enterprises. Budgeted funding can only  ameliorate, but not fundamentally improve the difficult  financial situation of the RSA. The RSA is accordingly laying  great hopes on cooperation with NASA and the ESA (European Space  Agency). The agreement signed in December by Viktor  Chernomyrdin and Albert Gore, jvice president of the United  States, provides for the launching of the Russian-American  orbital complex Alpha (in addition to work on the androgenous  docking units and the joint manned flights in 1994-1997, which  will cost 100 million dollars annually, etc.). In the words of  Vladimir Pivnyuk, a government space expert, the American  project for the launching of the Freedom orbital stations  experienced a failure -- the Bill Clinton administration has  sharply reduced the appropriations, although 10 billion dollars  had already been invested in the project. A similar situation  arose with our Mir 2 space station, all work on which was frozen  due to an insufficiency of funding. The total value of the  contracts under the Alpha project is 2 billion dollars, of which  it is proposed that 400 million be allocated to the Russian  side. The RSA has already received 1 million dollars from the  Americans for the matching of interfaces (this program is part  of stage I of work on the Alpha, also including joint flights in  the Shuttle, construction of the Spektr and Priroda biomedical  modules and putting them into orbit). In the second stage work  will begin on assembly of the station, and in stage III -- its  outfitting with special equipment. Yuriy Koptev, general  director of the RSA, feels that work on the Alpha project in  cooperation with NASA will be twice as cheap for our country  than finalizing the Mir on our own efforts. These computations  skirt a fundamental question -- is it necessary at all for  Russia to participate in this project? In the opinion of many  leading scientists (in particular, Academician Roald Sagdeyev  has written about this more than once, about 97% of the  research and practical information is from unmanned automatic  vehicles; the contribution of manned flights to science is small  and the contribution to the economy is virtually nil. Most  likely Russia, recovering from the sharp criticism of purely  prestigious space expeditions into orbit, will again return to  this direction. The motives are understandable -- Russia wants  to retain the personnel and technology of a powerful complex,  and finally, the status of a great space power. But tactical  advantages may be defeated by a strategic miscalculation which  the USSR allowed many years ago -- concentrating its efforts on  the race for the greatest duration of manned flights and the  chalking up of records of little significance for science and  the economy and disregarding the generous budgetary infusions  the branch ignored commercial cosmonautics.</p>

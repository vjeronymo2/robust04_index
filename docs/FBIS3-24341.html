Karasin, director of the RF MFA </F> [Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs] Information and  Press Department, conducted by DIPLOMATICHESKIY VESTNIK  correspondent: "A Subject of Particular Attention"]    [Text] [Correspondent] Grigoriy Borisovich, the topic of  cadre changes within the system of the MFA of Russia is once  again becoming the subject of particular attention of our mass  media. Practically every new appointment of a Russian ambassador  abroad is perceived as a sensation. Journalists often ask you  questions at briefings regarding such appointments. How can this  be explained?    [Karasin] The interest of the press, and also of Russian  society as a whole, in the MFA cadre policy is quite  understandable. We are speaking of those people who are  entrusted with the task of ensuring the foreign policy of our  state.    We must remember that the MFA system is a living, moving  organism which is in a state of permanent dynamics. Along with  specialization by states and regions, high level diplomats  develop a universality. This makes is possible to use them in  any section of the diplomatic service. At the same time, work in  the central apparatus in Moscow is alternated with long- and  short-term assignments abroad. The rotation of cadres along the  horizontal and the vertical refreshes the professional training  of the diplomat and facilitates the development of a new,  non-ordinary view of the problems and a creative approach to  their solution. Therefore, when we speak of the appointment of  deputy ministers or heads of certain departments as ambassadors,  this is certainly not a cause for sensation, but rather, on the  contrary--a confirmation of the established practice.    I would like to emphasize one other delicate moment  associated with the appointment of ambassadors. The fact is that  after approval of one or another candidacy in Moscow, the  leadership of the state where the envoy is being sent must give  an agreement--official consent as to his appointment. Therefore,  until the agreement is given we cannot say that the ambassador  has been appointed. Today no one makes any secret of the  appointment of new ambassadors, and as soon as this becomes a  fact the information is publicized.    [Correspondent] The mechanism of appointment of Russian  ambassadors evokes interest, and primarily the criteria for  selection of candidates to work in the highest diplomatic post  abroad. Are there any standard documents regulating the activity  and defining the rights and responsibilities of ambassadors?    [Karasin] There are two main criteria for the selection of  cadres for diplomatic work--devotion to the state interests of  Russia, and a proper understanding and professional ability to  defend these interests and to solve the problems posed by the  leadership of the country.    An Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the  Russian Federation is a notable figure in many respects. He  represents not the MFA, but the state, and it is the ambassador  who largely determines the image of Russia. Moreover, the  ambassador is the head of what is often a rather large  collective of Russian representatives, and of the Russian colony  in the country as a whole. For this reason, he must have special  business and personal qualities, a high professional level, and  an overall competency in area studies and international affairs.    We must note that in our country, as in others, not only are  career diplomats appointed as ambassadors, but quite often also  state leaders, leading scientists and journalists. In their  practical affairs such ambassadors rely on their life  experience, as well as on professional diplomatic workers.    Standard statutes regulating the activity of the diplomatic  service, including that of ambassadors, to my knowledge, have  been developed. However, as yet they have not been ratified,  since the former Supreme Soviet did not adopt the law on state  service. The question thus remains open for the present time.    [Correspondent] What are the results of the reform of the  MFA  which began approximately two years ago? Has it been possible to  create more effective and efficient structures of the Russian  diplomatic service? What difficulties have been encountered  along the way?    [Karasin] Reform was not painless for us, since it touched  upon human lives. However, it became necessary, since it was  caused by the cardinal domestic political changes taking place  in the country and by the need to give Russia a new image on the  international arena.    We are able to retain a core of experienced and promising  diplomats. And they, I am sure, will be able to withstand  various temptations to go over to the world of business. Today  we are experiencing practically the same material difficulties  which scientists, doctors, teachers and other workers in the  budget sphere experience. However, we like our work and do not  intend to leave it.    Nothing in the world stands still, everything evolves. That  is the case also in diplomacy. Therefore, the organizational  modifications will continue. Thus, at a meeting of the MFA  governing board held on 12 November, decisions were adopted  regarding continued activization of work with the CIS countries  and the introduction of appropriate changes into the structure  of individual subdivisions. This, I might add, does not foresee  any reductions.    [Correspondent] Will the appearance of numerous parties and  movements on the domestic political landscape of Russia  influence its foreign policy? What effect will the existence of  different viewpoints on current international problems have on  the activity of the Russian representations abroad?    [Karasin] The MFA and the Russian embassies abroad have been  and will continue to be all-state institutions. Under conditions  of political pluralism, we are interested in a constructive  interaction with all political powers and parties. One of the  most important tasks of the MFA under the new conditions is to  explain the essence of Russian positions on the entire spectrum  of international problems. Foreign policy must be understood and  accepted by millions of Russians.    And one more thing. As a result of the various domestic  political processes and the struggle of ambitions, a stream of  entirely unsubstantiated accusations has recently poured down  upon the Russian diplomatic service. Diplomats in the center and  in the embassies were in essence subjected to a constant  moral-psychological pressure which, frankly speaking, did not  facilitate a strengthening of the prestige of our Homeland and  its representatives. After all, to discuss foreign political  problems and to criticize individual actions does not mean to  thoughtlessly defame our own diplomats. We must evidently  realize that Russia has no alternative diplomatic service. The  only structure for implementing foreign policy is the MFA of  Russia. I believe that Russians do not doubt the ability of our  diplomats to defend our country's interests.</p>

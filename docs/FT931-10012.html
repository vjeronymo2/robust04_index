			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Effects as companies rally to a new standard MR DAVID TWEEDIE, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, recently said there was a need to develop standards that the person in the street could understand. FRS 3, the new financial reporting standard on the profit and loss account, does not fall into that category. But over the coming months, anyone examining companies' financial results will rapidly begin to see the effect of the standard and will have to learn to cope with its effects. FRS 3 becomes mandatory for companies with financial year-ends after June 22 this year. The Accounting Standards Board has urged companies to begin complying before this time. It is essentially a standard dealing with disclosure and presentation of financial information, rather than specifying new ways of treating the numbers. The most important changes are: Extraordinary items - costs or realisations which are fundamentally different to a company's normal activities - will be virtually abolished. Any that remain will be placed above the bottom line, so they will be included in the pre-tax profits figure. Pre-tax profits and earnings will become far more volatile from year-to-year as a result, forcing readers of accounts to examine the details rather than focusing on a single figure of financial performance. Exceptional items - other large material items outside the company's continuing business operations - will be largely absorbed into other headings on the profit and loss account. Three will remain separately disclosed: profits or losses on sale or termination of an operation; costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring; profits or losses on the sale of fixed assets. Turnover and profits must be broken down between three separate categories: continuing operations, acquisitions as a component of these operations, and discontinued operations. The proceeds on the disposal of revalued assets must be recorded with reference to the carrying value or revalued amount shown on the balance sheet, where previously it was left in reserves. A new statement of total recognised gains and losses will show the effect of any changes to reserves such as revaluations, and of exchange adjustments, which were all previously buried in the notes to the accounts. A note of historical cost profits and losses will reconcile the effects of any revaluations to the historical level at which they were shown in the balance sheet. A reconciliation of movements in shareholders' funds shows changes such as goodwill on acquisitions and new share capital issued. So far, only a handful of companies have complied. These include BOC, Blue Circle, Hanson and Trafalgar House. A larger number of companies are using the format of FRS 3 for their interim results. Others - such as Bass and MEPC - are beginning to make reference to it in their accounts. The recently-released accounts of Grand Metropolitan for the year to September 30 1992 provide a useful illustration of the effects of FRS 3, which it has fully adopted. The difference between the old and new profit and loss accounts is instantly shown by the different profits: under the old system, pre-tax profit was Pounds 902m; under FRS 3, the new pre-tax profit on ordinary activities is Pounds 925m. The principal difference is Pounds 12m in extraordinary items, which boosts earnings per share from 30.1p to 30.6p. The effect of FRS 3 was even more dramatic on the restated 1991 accounts. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 950m to Pounds 448m and eps declined from 32.4p to 11p. GrandMet discloses a contribution to turnover of Pounds 428m from ac-quisitions, separated from Pounds 6.6bn from existing, continuing oper-ations. This would have been impossible to calculate before. It splits out under the three categories of the remaining exceptional items: Pounds 13m in fixed asset disposals, Pounds 10m on sale or termination of businesses, and a Pounds 43m provision for loss on sale or termination of businesses. The three notes show substantial changes in goodwill, share capital, foreign currency exchange adjustments, and revaluations, reconciled to the figures on the face of the profit and loss account. In general, a danger of FRS 3 is that companies can use it to throw up a smokescreen. Some companies are reporting under the new standard, and blaming it for any drop in profits. Others are holding back from implementing FRS 3 because the old system gives them more flexibility to conceal damaging transactions. Analysts are also noting variations in the ways companies comply with the new standard - particularly over how material items must be separately disclosed, and how businesses are divided between continuing and discontinued items.</p>

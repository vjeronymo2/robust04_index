			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt The Bundesbank meets on Thursday but James Capel says the sharp rebound in manufacturing orders in September suggests that it is unlikely to be persuaded to ease its monetary stance, in spite of some disappointment over industrial output figures. The broker adds that the strength of other European economies points to a strong fourth quarter in Germany while the already high level of capacity utilisation heralds an inflationary threat, probably in 1996. On the corporate front, Munich Re's balance sheet press conference tomorrow is likely to reveal more about the 1993-94 figures, and Siemens will release preliminary figures for the year to September 30 on Wednesday. The company has already said operating profits are expected to decline by 10  -15 per cent over the year. In the first nine months, group net profit fell to DM1.25bn from last year's DM1.32bn for the same period, while last time's full-year group net profit was DM1.98bn. UBS is awaiting Veba's nine-month figures on Thursday. It expects another increase in pre-tax profits, of about 50 per cent to DM420m, which is at the upper end of expectations and should be viewed positively.</p>

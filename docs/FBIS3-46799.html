The new merchant  shipping lines, the Vietrans Chart Lines, will be a joint  venture between Vietnam Ship Leasing and Transport Company  (?Vietrans Chart) based in Ho Chi Minh City, and the U.S. firm  (?Trantavico). If Washington agreed, the line would be allowed  to use U.S. shipping ports, from which Vietnamese ships are  currently banned under the U.S. trade embargo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Istvan Kulcsar] </F>   [Text] Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross and Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, along with the Hungarian and  Russian ministers concerned, signed six documents early this  afternoon in the Cupola Hall of the parliament building here in  Budapest.    At their subsequent news conference, Peter Boross  highlighted  two agreements in particular: The first provides for the  transportation to Russia of the spent heating elements of the  Paks nuclear power station, and the second for the settling of  the Russian debt. The modalities of the latter are to be  services, deliveries of goods, and access for the Hungarian side  to property in Russia in Russian or mixed enterprises.    The latter was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin, who stated that the trade the two countries  conducted with each other last year could be doubled or even  tripled in the medium term.    In answer to questions, the Russian prime minister said that  his country welcomes Hungary's intention to join the European  Union. As for Hungary's possibly joining NATO, that is  something that will have to be decided by the Hungarian  leadership and the Hungarian people.    Peter Boross stated that the Hungarian-Russian discussions  have been even more successful than expected.</p>

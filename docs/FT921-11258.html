			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: My cheque is in the post . . . - . . . But is it safe? Ways to beat the fraudsters FINLANDIA DEVENUE is not a French actress nor an exotic Scandinavian. The name is just one of many aliases used by fraudsters who salt away cheques made out to the Inland Revenue. One of the commonest ways in which money is lost is when cheques are intercepted in the post and paid into a third party account. The Revenue estimates that cheques worth Pounds 8m have been intercepted on their way to the Revenue since 1989, although many were not cashed subsequently. Credit card fraud is also increasing. In 1990, the UK banks lost about Pounds 122m between them on plastic card fraud. This year it will probably be at least Pounds 180m. Fraud is so commonplace that consumers must despair of finding a safe way of transferring money. The Weekend FT examines the pros and cons of different methods of payment and discusses the measures you can take to protect yourself against fraud. Cheque in the post: Posting a cheque may be convenient but it is one of the riskiest ways of transferring money. Thieves can intercept the cheque, tamper with the payee's name, open an account in that name and pay the cheque into that account with a signature on the back. Finlandia Devenue would have found it possible to open an account simply by showing headed notepaper as proof of identity; now it should not be so easy. Banks and building societies have tightened their procedures for opening accounts since September 1990, after publication of Bank of England guidelines. However, the procedure for endorsing cheques is still a licence for fraudsters. There is little to stop someone from intercepting a cheque, endorsing it with their own version of the payee's signature on the back, and then paying it into their own account. They do not even have to be good forgers; if the payee is not a customer of that bank or society, no attempt will be made to check the signature. If you must send a cheque through the post, you can make it less easy for fraudsters to tamper with it. The Banking Ombudsman recommends writing 'only' after the payee's name' (write the name in capitals), crossing out the word 'or order', initialling the deletion and crossing the cheque with the words 'not transferable.' The Revenue also suggests writing your reference number immediately after 'Inland Revenue' on the payee line and drawing a line up to 'Or Order'. However, these measures are not foolproof. Many people suppose that by writing a/c payee only on a crossed cheque, they can stop it being paid anywhere except into the account it is intended to reach. Banking law is blurred on this point: such cheques can still be transferred to another bank account. All this may change if a private member's bill going through parliament, sponsored by Conal Gregory, MP for York, becomes law. It aims to pin responsibility firmly on the bank which accepts the payment. For the time being, however, remember that your bank is not responsible for the loss and you may find yourself obliged to pay up again. Do not give up without a fight. It is always worth talking to the bank and if they are unhelpful and you feel the bank was negligent, try taking your case to the Banking Ombudsman. If you do post a cheque you can ask the post office for a certificate of posting, which is a free receipt. However, the maximum compensation that the post office will pay is Pounds 24 unless you use registered post. The Post Office will compensate you for amounts up to Pounds 950 at a cost of Pounds 1.90 plus the cost of first class post through registered post. It will cost Pounds 2.10 for amounts up to Pounds 1,850 and Pounds 2.30 plus first class post for amounts up to Pounds 2,200. Bank giro: Payment from one bank account into another through the inter-bank giro system is the safest method of transferring money, according to the British Banker's Association. You fill in a credit slip which goes through the clearing system where it can be traced if it goes astray. You are given a stamped receipt as proof of the deposit. If you are sending money out of your account, you will need to know the bank account number of the payee and their branch sorting code. It will take up to four working days for the money to reach its destination. Girobank transfer: This has nothing to do with the bank giro system. Girobank is a bank which used to belong to the post office until it was acquired by the Alliance and Leicester building society in 1990. You can transfer money, at a cost of 70p, if either you or the person you are sending it to, is an accountholder. Postal orders: Bought over the Post Office counter, postal orders can be easily traced and the purchaser retains a counterfoil to prove they have been sent. These are excellent for sending small amounts of money but become expensive if large amounts are involved. The maximum postal order issue is worth Pounds 20 at a cost of 80p. So, sending Pounds 100 will cost Pounds 4 but sending Pounds 1,000 would cost Pounds 40. Credit cards: Using plastic payment cards is one of your areas of greatest vulnerability. All a fraudster has to do is to catch a cardholder off-guard and steal his or her wallet. But this is not the only method. When you make a transaction using a paper voucher rather than an electronic terminal, the information contained on each voucher can be used to make purchases by telephone: which is why in the US it is common for card holders to insist that the carbon slips are destroyed on the spot. You could also find that counterfeiters make a replica of your card and use it in foreign countries, while your card remains in your possession. This is now quite common in the Far East and the Mediterranean. Holders of gold cards are most at risk. If your card is stolen or if you notice money taken out of your account, you must notify your bank immediately. Under the Consumer Credit Act of 1974, credit card issuers are technically liable for unauthorised purchases on a credit card - so long as you let the bank or building society know your card is missing as soon as possible. Your liability will be limited to Pounds 50. Companies that are allowed to take your credit card details either over the telephone or by post are thoroughly vetted by a Merchant Acquirer - one of the big four banks which issue credit cards - and the banks will bear responsibility if your card details have been abused and if they have no reason to suspect you of trying to con them. ATMs and debit cards: Automated Teller Machines are more commonly known as hole-in-the-wall or even cosh points, because of the danger of being mugged immediately after using one. The most easily avoidable risk of using a cashpoint comes when someone else gets hold of your Personal Identification Number (PIN). A PIN can be used to unlock and remove all your cash. Thieves will look straight for a PIN when they steal a card: so it is most unwise to write down your number and positively foolish to carry it close to your cards. Many cheque guarantee cards can be used as a debit card through Switch and other systems. Money is debited from your account without your having to write out a cheque. This added facility also brings added risk. Your cheque guarantee card is usually sent to you through the post and if it is intercepted a thief can sign it and use it to buy goods which will be paid for from your account. Unless you can prove negligence on the bank's part, you are at their mercy regarding compensation if your card is stolen and used. If the bank is satisfied that you did not make the purchases, it will usually compensate you. This is set to change from March 16 , when the Consumer Credit Act will be extended to all plastic cards under the Code of Banking Practice and you will only be liable for the first Pounds 50 loss unless you have been 'grossly negligent.' CHAPS: Personal customers can also make same day payments through the Clearing House Automated Payments System (CHAPS), which is one of the electronic inter-bank payment systems normally used by businesses. Requests to use CHAPS may surprise staff in small branches. The cost will vary but may be as low as Pounds 15.</p>

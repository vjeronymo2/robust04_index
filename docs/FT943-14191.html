			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Olivetti to sell its Triumph Adler unit Olivetti, the Italian computers group, has agreed to sell the financial holding company of its Triumph-Adler office products subsidiary in Germany to a consortium of German banks and investors for an unspecified sum. However, the Italian group is retaining ownership of TA Vertriebs, which is responsible for research, development and marketing of Triumph-Adler's range of typewriters and office equipment in Germany and elsewhere. Olivetti stressed yesterday that it would retain control of the Triumph-Adler brand-name, and has increased the equity capital of TAV to DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) to stimulate its activities. Talks on the sale have been going on since the end of last year, and the deal should be formally confirmed at a Triumph-Adler shareholder meeting in August. IMM, the consortium buying Triumph-Adler, said it would continue to manufacture typewriters from the company's Frankfurt factory, and had agreed a long-term contract for production and distribution with TAV. But the consortium also plans to reorganise Triumph-Adler's activities into selected new areas, so as to develop the group into a 'diversified holding company for medium sized companies in stable markets'. Both Triumph-Adler and TAV, which have suffered losses in the past few years, are expected to record profits for 1994. Triumph-Adler's typewriters were market leaders in the 1970s, at which time it was owned by Litton Industries, the US group. In the mid-1980s the company was owned by German motor group Volkswagen. Olivetti took over the Nuremberg-based company in 1986 but attempts to launch a Triumph-Adler computer came to nothing. Triumph-Adler employs just 620 and lost DM70m in 1993 on sales of DM300m.</p>

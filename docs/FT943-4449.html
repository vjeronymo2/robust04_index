			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rerating seen at Ladbroke Hotels and leisure group Ladbroke put on the best individual performance in the FT-SE 100 list as the market responded to an overnight surge on Wall Street in the share price of Hilton Hotels, which jumped almost 10 per cent. Ladbroke owns the Hilton brand name outside the US. Dealers were quick to lift the Ladbroke share price, citing rumours of a possible break-up of the US Hilton group as possibly signalling a significant rerating of Ladbroke. Mr Alasdair McNee, an analyst at Yamaichi Europe, said the market was taking the view that Ladbroke's recent move back into casino gambling, after a 15-year absence, via its acquisition of three casinos last week, could also promote an upgrading. Casinos contribute more than 50 per cent of Hilton Hotels' profits in the US, the analyst said. Ladbroke acquired the three casinos, Maxim's, the Golden Horseshoe and Charlie Chester's, from Mr Trevor Hemmings, who became one of Ladbroke's biggest shareholders following the deal. Ladbroke shares closed 5 higher at 169p after good turnover of 5.4m.</p>

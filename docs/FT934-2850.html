			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Argument about cancer deaths too simplistic Sir, It is far too simplistic to claim that '200 people worldwide may die in the long term as a result of cancer caused by radioactive discharges from Sellafield ('Sellafield cancer deaths put at 200 worldwide', November 9). We have been saying this for weeks and, indeed, the radioactive waste management advisory committee, on whose letter to environment minister Tim Yeo the article was based, did as well. The committee said, in its letter, that the calculation of notional deaths from radioactivity exposure 'carries with it no certainty, and it is incorrect to state that 'people will die''. It also said that Greenpeace's use of these 'theoretical deaths' statistics was 'misleading'. I agree entirely because not a single actual death may occur. The theory of collective doses is based upon the assumption that there will be the same number of deaths from a large number of people receiving low doses of radiation as there would be from a small number of people receiving large doses. Using the same methodology, it is possible to claim that nearly 1m people worldwide will eventually die as a result of the use of medical radiation over the coming ten years. On a similar basis, it can be stated that natural background radiation will cause 650,000 deaths for every year that the population is exposed to it and the extra cosmic radiation received by flying in passenger aircraft will cause 510 extra deaths. Moreover, failure to open Thorp would merely transfer any theoretical deaths to another cause; for example, to mine fresh uranium which would otherwise be recycled at Thorp would lead to nearly ten times more theoretical deaths. Coal stations, oil stations and gas stations will also result in at least as many theoretical deaths for the same amount of electricity production.

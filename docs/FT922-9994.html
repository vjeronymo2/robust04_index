			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Balfour Beatty set to develop next stage of Glasgow airport Airport operator BAA is to award the contract for the next stage of development at Glasgow airport to BALFOUR BEATTY. The Pounds 37m contract is for the design, management and subsequent construction of new international facilities at the airport. This forms the next stage of an overall development that is expected to cost around Pounds 60m and will be built in phases to match passenger demand. The development will include a new international pier to accommodate up to eight wide-bodied aircraft, new taxiways and aircraft aprons and an extension to the west end of the existing terminal building to give better services for international passengers. Detailed design of the project will commence immediately and construction is expected to start in the spring of 1993 with completion two years later. The new development will be the second stage in extending and improving facilities at the airport, which has seen a big rise in its international traffic following the government's announcement of an 'open skies' policy for Scotland in March 1990. The new facility will improve the airport's capacity from the current 5.5m to 10m passengers a year. Last year over 4m passengers passed through the airport.</p>

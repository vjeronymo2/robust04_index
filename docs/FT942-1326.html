			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Hilclare broadens security interests Hilclare, the USM-traded maker of lighting and security products, yesterday announced that it was paying up to Pounds 9m for First Security (Guards) and was making a placing and open offer to fund the Pounds 4.95m cash element of the price. Hilclare's shares were suspended at 43p yesterday at the company's request, and will remain suspended until July 19 following an annual meeting on the preceding day to approve the deal. Mr Ian Quinlan, chairman, said that Hilclare aimed to concentrate future operations in sectors of the security industry which would be selected for their potential to generate significant profit growth and cash flow. FSG, which provides security guarding services almost exclusively within the area bounded by the M25, was 'the first stage of this strategy'. Of the initial Pounds 8m consideration, Pounds 4.95m is payable in cash, Pounds 2.35m in new ordinary shares and Pounds 700,000 in secured convertible loan stock. A further Pounds 1m is due if FSG achieves specified profit targets. Samuel Montagu has conditionally underwritten a placing of 21.52m ordinary shares at 23p, giving Hilclare a market value of Pounds 8.4m - 4.8m of the shares were subject to an open offer to qualifying shareholders, also at 23p. Hilclare also yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 482,000 (Pounds 54,000) for the year ended March 31, after making a Pounds 396,000 exceptional charge this time for its withdrawal from the production of control panels for security systems. Turnover fell to Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 2.9m) and operating profits on continuing operations slipped from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 43,000. The recommended single final dividend is an unchanged 0.5p. Mr Quinlan said trading in the current year had started well for the enlarged group. The chairman said Hilclare intended to change its name to Orbis and was planning a move to the main market.</p>

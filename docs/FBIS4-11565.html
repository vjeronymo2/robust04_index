			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Cardoso] </F>   [Text] The xenophobia unleashed in the United States  against migrant workers must not taint all bilateral relations  with Mexico because undocumented aliens are not responsible for  all of that country's ills, Teodoro Maus, general director for  Mexican communities abroad at the Foreign Secretariat [SRE], has  said.    The official noted the conditions of Mexicans living in the  United States are a matter of permanent concern for the SRE.  For that reason, the Mexican Government promotes, through its  embassy and consulates in the United States, rapprochement and  greater involvement with legal aliens, the Hispanic and Black  communities, and even nongovernment organisms "to counter the  xenophobia that has been unleashed in the United States against  undocumented aliens."    Mexican authorities are seeking a qualitative and serious  change in the attitude toward undocumented persons in  particular, and Mexican residents in general, without letting  that problem cool relations, he said.    Maus indicated that undocumented aliens are being blamed for  all the woes of the United States, although they contribute more  than they receive, since they fulfill their obligations, on  fiscal matters for instance, but do not receive the benefits  that that earns. Most of them, he said, pay their taxes with  the hope of establishing a record of residency. In addition,  they do not report abuses by their employers for fear of  deportation.    By way of example, he mentioned that in the State of  California, restrictions were increased on federal aid for  undocumented aliens who were hurt the most in the recent Los  Angeles earthquake. The argument for this was that they are  responsible for the rise in unemployment and crime, when the  fact is those things happen as a result of that country's  economic problems and the closure of military bases. He  recalled that at first, federal aid for housing reconstruction  was earmarked without discrimination, but later it was cut under  the pretext that the undocumented aliens were to blame for  unemployment, the deterioration of the economy, and crime.</p>

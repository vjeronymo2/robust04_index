Through a series of emergency intervention measures,  including the macroeconomic regulation and control, the  anticorruption struggle, the crackdown on criminals, and others,  which were adopted in 1993, the central government has  maintained social stability and economic growth. However, a  number of internal structural contradictions and problems have  not yet been resolved. As a result, many factors affecting  social stability, such as overly rapid price rises and so on,  were ready to create trouble at the end of 1993. What is more,  due to the central government's repeatedly emphasizing that 1994  will be a crucial year for the "rapid advance of groups [ji tuan  tu jin 7162 0957 4499 6651]" carrying out reform, the possible  trend of the social situation in 1994 has attracted greater  attention from people and has looked somewhat complicated and  confusing.    Although many factors affecting the trend of the social  situation in 1994 are full of contingencies and uncertainties,  the five major factors of reform, economic construction, the  political situation, the public will, and the central  government's authority are the most crucial ones, and are  forecastable as well as understandable.    1. The acceleration of the reform process in 1994 will  provide a further motive force for social and economic  development, but reform will also produce a complicated impact  on the trend of the social situation. The institution of a  modern enterprise system and the structural reforms in prices,  finance, taxation, investment, etc. will be the focal points of  the "rapid advance of groups" next [as published] year. Their  direct goal is to achieve the best allocation of natural  resources in society. At the beginning of their being put into  practice, however, they will bring about a series of social and  economic consequences, some of which will emerge on the negative  side. This raises the question -- discussed over the past 15  years but which has gained little attention in practice -- of  the coordination [pei tao xing 6792 1152 1840] of reform.    The reform of the modern enterprise system absolutely does  not just involve the relationship between government  administration and enterprises, the tax system, and the market,  but it also involves such systems as labor and personnel, social  insurance, trade unions, workers' representative conferences, as  well as more sensitive social political relationships, social  organizational relationships, and relevant value criteria. In  this regard, we must make adequate forecasts and take  corresponding technical countermeasures.    Reform in such areas as commodity prices and taxation will  exert strong pressure on people's tolerance when it touches the  level of their daily lives. A new characteristic of changes  revealed in people's tolerance has surfaced, that is, it is very  difficult for people to consider increased income a guaranteed  factor for the strengthening of tolerance. Many signs indicate  that the general mood of the people in 1994 and the changes in  their tolerance will be affected by social and economic factors,  which are far more complicated than price rises, and the degree  of their unpredictability is increasing.    There are other meanings in the reform factors affecting the  situation in society in 1994, among which the following two  points are most important: 1) Will the political structural  reform be suited to the economic structural reform? The  economic structural reform has involved a rather deep-going  level (such as the modern enterprise system, the market, and  enterprise ownership and management). If the political reform  remains only in the area of administrative structure in a  general sense, it will entail two consequences -- reform will  yield very few results (say, in solving the problem of  overstaffing in organs); and the economic structural reform once  again will be held back (as certain reform measures will lose  shape because their practice is not guaranteed by necessary  political mechanisms). 2) The political reform process with no  reversal is a significant factor that will affect the trend of  the social situation in 1994. Reform in the last 15 years has  brought tremendous changes in the social economic foundation and  structures, so a reversal would cause a loss of social economic  vitality and confusion in people's minds.    2. Economic construction will enter a crucial year in 1994.  Although the rapid growth that has continued for two years has  brought vigor and vitality to the entire society, it has still  been followed by a certain degree of confusion, disorder, and  shortage of supplies. Optimizing structure and enhancing  economic results should be the main theme of the economic  construction in 1994. This is a correct implication. The  practice of blindly pursuing high speed in disregard of a sound  foundation will certainly lead to great ups and downs in the  economy. The introduction of various economic structural reform  plans in 1994 is a direct effort toward a healthy economy.  Economic fluctuation will be a factor posing a direct threat to  social stability. The prevention of great ups and downs in  economic construction depends, to a considerable extent, on the  appropriateness of macroeconomic policy decisions and the  faithful performance of their duties by middle-level executive  departments.    Judging from the changes in the economic situation in the  first and second halves of 1993, it was not purely an act of  economic policy decisionmaking to put on the brakes (either for  a soft landing or a hard landing). It had noticeable political  implications, including the efforts made by the central  government to stabilize the overall situation and to politically  negate the orientation of expansion in localities. The problem  was that various social, economic, and political mechanisms that  led to the overheated economy were not removed, given the  initial results scored by the macroeconomic regulation and  control in 1993. This means that the social causes of the  economic fluctuations will not be completely eliminated in 1994.  This year, they probably will not manifest themselves in the  form of expanded investment in localities, but in the form of  "revising" a series of economic policies set by the central  government. The economic fluctuations brought about by this  will certainly lead to chaotic economic and even social order,  so that the public feeling of life being unstable will be  sharpened.    3. The authority of the central government will face  multiple trials in 1994. Apart from the above-mentioned ability  to exercise macroeconomic regulation and control, there are  still two extremely crucial issues, as follows:    First, whether or not the anticorruption struggle will  achieve actual results will have a bearing on maintaining the  public will and establishing the authority of the central  government. As a result of the mass mobilization through public  opinion and the initial actions taken in the second half of  1993, the anticorruption struggle has become an extremely  sensitive focal point in society. Although the struggle was  confronted with various difficult choices from the very outset,  it enjoyed popular confidence once it gathered momentum and  yielded actual results. This has covered two aspects -- whether  the anticorruption struggle can be waged at the upper levels,  and whether it can be conducted in localities. The progress of  the struggle in various localities has been uneven, which is a  fact universally acknowledged. It is anticipated that there  will be little possibility of social unrest in 1994, which is  directly affected by factors of the anticorruption struggle.  However, various kinds of friction and conflicts triggered by  the declining authority of the central government will be a  hidden peril affecting social stability.    Second, practicing a revenue-sharing system is a mission of  priority in 1994. As viewed from the angle of intensifying the  central government's ability and authority to absorb revenue,  the said system should be put into practice, even though  technical conditions have not entirely matured yet. As this  system directly involves the redistribution of economic  interests between the central government and localities, the  partial interests of those localities with powerful economic  strength will be lost temporarily, and whether they will accept  such losses remains a question. In order to implement the above  system smoothly, the central government should make adequate  forecasts of various possible consequences (including the  resurgence of local chauvinism, the intensification of local  interests, tax pressures imposed by upper levels, and so on).  On this issue, administrative, legal, and economic means should  be employed simultaneously. At the present stage, however, only  administrative means are the most perfect for contacts between  the central and local authorities. This determines that  stepping up administrative intervention sometimes cannot be  avoided, which will bring forth a series of frictions and  conflicts in the social, economic, and political areas. We  should also note that the authority of the central government  involves not only the issue of economic interest distribution  with localities, but also a large number of social and political  issues. For example, the central government will face the  question of maintaining and strengthening this authority in the  areas of investment policy, public security policy, the  establishment of a unified market system, and so on.    4. Public will and opinion will become another major factor  affecting the social situation in 1994. Since reform began 15  years ago, people from various quarters have come to understand,  given support to, and participated in reform with  unprecedentedly great enthusiasm. They have benefited a good  deal from the reform achievements, as their personal development  opportunities have been substantially increased, their fields of  mental activities have been considerably broadened, and their  means of entertainment and consumption have become diversified.  In the meantime, people's tolerance has withstood continuous  trials, heavier pressure has been added to their lives, and  their sense of security has tended to decline.    In recent years, people have acquired a much more distinct  concept of interests and have had clearer feelings toward  interest gains and losses. If reform and economic construction  exert excessively heavy pressure -- in commodity prices in  particular -- on people's daily lives in 1994, then the  awareness of interest losses caused to some strata will be  sharpened. In 1993, peasants' income grew slowly, the income of  staff and workers was unsecured owing to the poor performance of  enterprises, the living standard of retired people declined, and  the reversed position of mental and physical laborers was not  set right. All this has added weight to the pressures of living  of considerable numbers of people, which increases the  possibility of their unexpected response to particular specific  economic policies.    Another major characteristic of the changes in people's  wills  and opinions in 1994 is their concern for social affairs. For  example, their expectations of the anticorruption struggle will  directly affect their confidence in the justice of society and  in the central government. In rural areas, the relationship  between cadres and masses has been somewhat tense as a result of  the disputes over peasants' burdens and other economic affairs.  In urban enterprises, there have been contradictions centering  around such issues as income, democratic management, and so on  between managers and staff and workers. Along with the practice  of the modern enterprise system in 1994, there will be new forms  of expression for these contradictions. A host of facts have  indicated that the work style of grass-roots cadres is at the  core of the tension between cadres and staff and workers, and  that its adverse impact on the people's will and opinion is no  better than that of the spread of corrupt phenomena.    5. The stable political situation was the foundation for  stabilizing the overall social situation in 1993.    In 1994, the transfer of central power (i.e. from the second  generation of the leading collective to the third generation of  the leading collective) will enter a crucial period. Focused on  defining the policies of reform, economic construction, and  domestic and foreign affairs, this transfer has started to carry  substantive content. History proves that in the variable of the  political pattern in contemporary China, the issue of unity  during the period of transference of power is the most difficult  to tackle. Once an obstacle to unity arises, it will elicit  massive personnel changes or even policy reversals, thus leading  to turbulence in the social situation. During this year, a  number of vital social interest relations are urgently awaiting  a solution and, without a united and rational central  government, it is impossible to fulfill the above missions. In  particular, under the situation that the functional  transformation of the central government and its subordinates,  the manifestation of authority, and the ability to exercise  regulation and control are confronted with many difficulties,  inappropriateness in the course of transference of power will  lead to disastrous consequences. At the present stage, the  establishment of checking and balancing and compromise  mechanisms of power within the central government is the only  choice to maintain its unity and rationality.    Under the condition of China's social structure at the  present stage, the stability of the political situation is of  particularly vital importance. However, a protracted and  institutionalized stability must rely on a more flexible form of  control in society, which can effectively mediate various acute  social contradictions and remove factors for potential social  conflict in a timely manner. Of course, a relatively long  process is necessary for the establishment of this new form of  control, but, if the first step is made in the area of  transference of power during the crucial period, many costs can  be avoided and the extent of social turbulence can be reduced.  As far as 1994 is concerned, it is a historic opportunity to  make decisions.</p>

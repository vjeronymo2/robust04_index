			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports from Seoul, two U.S. Navy  transport ships loaded with U.S. Patriot missiles to be deployed  to South Korea arrived in Pusan port on 18 April.    Forty-eight launchers, 192 Patriot missiles, and 84 Stinger  missiles on the two ships are being unloaded. They will be put  in actual deployment by 29 April.    Following the first shipment of Patriot missiles which  arrived on 18 April, the second shipment is expected to arrive  soon and to be ready for deployment by 29 April.    The introduction of Patriot missiles to South Korea by the  United States and the South Korean puppet clique is a very  dangerous development of the situation which drives the military  situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. This  shows that the reckless attempt of the United States and the Kim  Yong-sam traitor clique to militarily win supremacy over  [kunsajoguro cheap] our Republic has already been put into  practice.</p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CANNED HEAT RETURNS WITH SMOKY BLUES;  </P> <P> L.A. HIPPIE BAND STRESSES ROOTS, NOT COUNTERCULTURAL EXCESS, IN LIVELY SET AT  FULLERTON'S GOODIES  </P> <P> In terms of potential hideousness, the imagined prospect of a 1989 Canned Heat  show would have to rank high. Even in its late '60s heyday, the L.A.-based band  offered a not-always-palatable mash of blues purism (both original front men  Bob (the Bear) Hite and Alan (Blind Owl) Wilson were regarded experts on blues  lore) and counterculture excess, with Hite's lyrics positing hippies as the new  oppressed race and the band's boogie rhythms fuzzed up through 200-watt amps  larger than some blues men's homes.  </P> <P> That combination appealed enough at the time -- the group was a hit at both the  Monterey Pop Festival and Woodstock -- but here in the age of rank oldies  cash-ins, and featuring only the original bass player and nearly original  drummer (Wilson died in 1970, Hite in 1981, and guitarist Henry (Sunflower)  Vestine is long gone from the band), Canned Heat's show at Goodies in Fullerton  Sunday night seemed more likely to live up to the band's first name than its  second.  </P> <P> But, while the new Canned Heat made its obligatory nods to the past -- even  whipping out a wood flute for "Going Up the Country" -- there wasn't a whiff of  patchouli in the smoky blues pouring from the quartet. The 10-song set seemed  more intent on keeping the blues alive today than in exhuming its past.  </P> <P> The group has a very capable, if not entirely captivating, front man in  singer/harmonica player/slide guitarist James Thornberry. In snaring Orange  County's Junior Watson (late of the Mighty Flyers) last year, the band may have  gained the best blues guitarist now working in the state.  </P> <P> Thornberry claimed even such Hite staples as "Let's Work Together" as his own  with a thick, grainy voice, and his harmonica playing achieved a furious  intensity on an extended boogie number. On occasion, though, his playing veered  toward accuracy rather than passion.  </P> <P> Watson's playing nearly always hit an emotional mark -- and hammered it  steadily on the showcase instrumental, "Hucklebuck" -- but it generally arrived  there by thoroughly devious means: Instead of going for obvious killer lines,  Watson consistently achieved a tension by taking unexpected byways, using a  delightfully skewed logic to sift through a musical vocabulary encompassing  delta blues, be-bop and the wild-hair country-jazz keenings of Jimmy Bryant.  </P> <P> With the exception of the long boogie number, the band's standards were solidly  delivered, with drummer Fito de la Parra taking over Wilson's reedy falsetto in  "On the Road Again" and "Goin' Up the Country." Requisite bass and drum solos  were delivered with dispatch, though both de la Parra and bassist Larry Taylor  (who has provided a foundation for everyone from the Monkees to Tom Waits)  seemed happier laying down a solid bottom through the set.  </P> <P> The five songs taken from its new album, "Reheated" (available only as a German  import), suggested that the band could easily forgo its catalogue numbers if it  chose. Both a stewing version of "Mercury Blues" and the T-Birdish encore of  New Orleans pianist Ronnie Barron's "Looking for the Party" were as fresh as  anything else on the current blues scene.  </P></p>

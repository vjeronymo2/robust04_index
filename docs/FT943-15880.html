			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Britvic censured over TV advert The Independent Television Commission, the commercial television watchdog, yesterday strongly criticised a publicity stunt by Britvic Soft Drinks which was judged to 'abuse the authority of the television medium and trespass on public confidence'. The television advertisement in May, for a drink called Still Tango, featured Tango's marketing director in a spoof warning to the public that the product was unauthorised. Viewers were urged to ring a freephone number to report stockists. When viewers called - and the company says 30,000 people responded on the first night - they were told that they had been tricked and were offered a voucher for the drink. Coincidentally, Britvic had to recall all bottles of the new drink a week later because of 'a small number of cases of fermentation' which were said not to pose a health hazard but had caused distorted packaging and a musty smell. To get the recall taken seriously, the company was forced in press advertisements to distance itself from the spoof TV warnings. The ITC said that 63 viewers had complained that 'it was not appropriate to use television advertising to play practical jokes on viewers'. Some also said 'they had been alarmed because they thought that a health hazard was being implied'. The ITC, which ruled that such advertisements should not be shown in future, concluded: 'If this was not quite setting off the fire alarm for a laugh it was certainly ringing door bells and running away.' Britvic said yesterday that the company was sorry if it had caused offence. 'The target market is young adults who are very much 'advertising aware' and enjoy our tongue-in-cheek approach,' it added. Separately, the ITC yesterday published its 1993 annual report which covers the first year of operation of the 16 new Channel 3 licensees.</p>

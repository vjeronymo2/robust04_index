			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (10): Route to paper-free trading - Paul Taylor reports on developments in 'electronic commerce' Since the mid-1980s a new concept - 'electronic commerce' - has crept into the lexicon of business. The widespread use of personal computers and their growing integration with telecommunications systems has begun to made paper-free trading a real possibility. Two business tools, electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail, are central to the operations of electronic commerce - both are value added network services which allow their users to improve business efficiency by substituting electronic forms for their paper-based counterparts. EDI enables two organisations, usually customer and supplier, to exchange business documents using standard electronic forms and their own computers linked through a service provider who acts like a central post office, routing the documents and messages to their destination and handling any 'data translation' needed between different computers or message standards. Generally, EDI is a faster, cheaper and more reliable means of exchanging information than the traditional paper-based business transaction chain and it provides other benefits including setting up an 'audit trail' which enables an organisation to check and validate electronic documentation. These benefits have spurred growth in the use of EDI in the US, where it originated, and more recently Europe, particularly in the UK. Ovum, the technology consultancy, estimated last year that the EDI market in Europe, including customer software and support, will triple in size from just under Ecu200m (Dollars 232m) in 1992 to about Ecu600m (Dollars 696m) in 1997. The UK and the Netherlands are the most mature EDI markets in Europe although France, Spain, Sweden and Germany are catching up fast. Among the service providers the market leaders in Europe are IBM and General Electric Information Services (Geis) which have pan-European networks and services. In the UK, the market is dominated by International Network Services (INS) with an estimated 55 per cent market share. INS was jointly owned by Geis and ICL until recently when Geis bought out its partner - a move which industry analysts suggest signals the growing consolidation and internationalisation of the EDI market. INS provides three main EDI 'communities,' INS-Tradanet, the main service for retailers and their suppliers, Brokernet for the insurance sector and Fleetnet for the fleet leasing-management sector. The biggest, INS-Tradanet, handles more than 6m documents a month . Between 8,500 and 10,000 companies and other organisations in Britain are estimated to be using electronic trading and the number has been growing by about 20 per cent a year. But there is still much room for growth. Other research, highlighted by Denise Fellows, EDI Business Manager at Sema, the leading systems integration group, shows that even among companies which have signed up for EDI only a small percentage are trading with more than 100 companies and a very large percentage are trading with less than 10. Ovum's latest Vans Markets, Europe report notes that 'the EDI market in Europe continues to grow steadily,' and that, 'most large organisations are now using, implementing or trialing EDI.' However the report also noted that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) continue to show much more resistance than was expected to the adoption of EDI. Part of the reason for this may be that the advantages of adopting EDI for the large organisation with a high volume of regular transactions are relatively tangible and easy to justify on the basis of cost savings. However, the advantages for the smaller company are less immediately obvious. As Sema's Denise Fellows, said at a recent conference: 'Over 70 per cent of EDI-users in the UK are 'doing' EDI not because it has been planned or even because they want to, but purely because they have been forced by a major customer into using EDI to replace the current method of transferring documents.' In future, she believes the growth of EDI will be driven by two separate types of enterprises - organisations which take on EDI as 'an enabling technology' because they are adopting new business practices such as centralised purchasing, and large organisations including nationalised industries 'where people are looking at EDI because they feel they can use EDI as a lever to introduce business change.' Other changes are also under way. In the past, most EDI traffic has been based on industry specific or proprietary application protocols. According to one estimate there are 26 different versions of standards in the world, including 15 in Japanese. However, most new user-communities are basing their services on Edifact (an international standard) - and many existing communities using proprietary application protocols are moving towards Edifact. By 1997, Ovum predicts that 90 per cent of EDI traffic in Europe will be based on the Edifact standard compared with less than 50 per cent last year. EDI users are also becoming increasingly sophisticated. Originally, EDI tended to be used only for basic transactions such as ordering and invoicing. However, as familiarity with electronic trading has grown, so has the range of information transmitted over EDI links and the number of different document types has grown to around 200. Unlike EDI, electronic mail is a non-interactive service based on sending computer originated messages across a computer or telecommunications network. Single terminals connected directly to public services account for almost 90 per cent of e-mail traffic in Europe, but by 1997 Ovum estimates this will have dropped to 20 per cent with the remainder accounted for by gateways to private e-mail systems. In the US, according to a survey by the Virginia-based Electronic Messaging Association, the number of e-mail users is rising by 17-19 per cent a year and, as in Europe, a growing number of companies are extending their internal e-mail systems to customers and suppliers using service providers. Meanwhile, the Clinton administration set out an aggressive timetable for the implementation of electronic commerce in government in a policy statement last autumn. All US government departments will be required to have systems in place to handle electronic documentation by 1997. The move will affect the more than 300,000 companies - including foreign-owned businesses - which trade regularly with the US government.</p>

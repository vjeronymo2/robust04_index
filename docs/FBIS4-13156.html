			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 18, IRNA -- Despite U.S. attempts to  sabotage a deal between Iran and its foreign creditors, Iranian  officials have signed seperate agreements with the creditors for  rescheduling the payment of about dlrs. 6 billion of the delayed  debts.    Germany, Japan, Italy, Austria and Spain are among the major  creditors to have agreed to reschedule the payment of Iran's  debts.    Of the total dlrs. 6 billion of the resheduled debts, Iran  owes dlrs. 2.6 billion to German banks, dlrs. 2 billion to  Japan, dlrs. 800 million to Italy, dlrs. 458 million to Austria  and about dlrs. 150 million to Spain.    Iran had already singed seperate agreements with Germany,  Japan and France for rescheduling about dlrs. 4.5 billion of its  debts to these countries.    The success of Iran in rescheduling the payment of its  foreign debts is, on the one hand, an indicator of the  importance that the European countries and Japan attach to Iran  and, on the other, shows that the foreign trade partners are  quite confident that Iran would have a prosperous economic  future.</p>

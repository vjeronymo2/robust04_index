The temporary customs tariff of the Kyrgyz Republic  was confirmed. Special duties have been introduced temporarily  as a precaution against participants of foreign economic  activity who violate the interests of the Kyrgyz Republic  concerning importing of goods in line with the direct exchange  of goods -- barter. Tariffs and duties are levied on all  exported and imported goods that are included in the appendix to  this resolution with the exception of cases envisaged by the  laws of the Kyrgyz Republic on customs tariffs and in line with  the stipulations of agreements of the Government of the Kyrgyz  Republic with foreign countries, companies, and international  organizations.    Export customs duties should not be levied when the produce  is delivered to those countries that have not adopted a decision  on such duties or have abolished previous laws on this topic.  The Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance charged with levying customs  duties in accordance with the procedures stated by the ministry.  Export and import customs duties should be paid before or at  the moment of showing the goods to the customs. The Kyrgyz  Ministry of Finance can grant the postponement of the payment of  export duties for a term of up to 60 days from the moment of  showing the goods under a bank's guarantee. Payment of duties  for imported goods can be put off for a term of 30 days under a  bank's guarantee or property collateral. If duties are not  paid, goods will be confiscated. Tariff rates can be changed by  the government under relevant circumstances. The government  sets, cancels, or lifts tariffs at the recommendation of the  duties and tariffs' council of the Kyrgyz Republic. Tariff  allowances or preferences are granted only by the Government of  the Kyrgyz Republic.</p>

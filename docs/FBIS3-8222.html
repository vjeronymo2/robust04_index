			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, March 6 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb  warplanes twice attacked the northern Moslem enclave of Maglaj  on Sunday [6 March], Radio Sarajevo reported, but NATO officials  in Italy said they had no reports of a UN flight ban over Bosnia  being breached. [passage omitted]    In Naples, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation denied the Bosnia "no-fly" order had been breached  Sunday [6 March]. U.S. Major John Jeffrey said the Western  military alliance had received no reports of an attack on  Maglaj. Any breach of the flight ban would have led to a NATO  riposte, he said. An Italian spokesman for NATO told AFP: "As  far as we are concerned nothing happened."    Maglaj, whose pre-war population of 19,000 was 45 percent  Moslem, has been besieged by the Serbs for eight months and its  residents are said to be living in appalling conditions. Sadic  said that 11 people were killed and 24 others recently when the  town's hospital was shelled.</p>

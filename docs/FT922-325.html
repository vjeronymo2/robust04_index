			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Social change Above all, the vogue for higher profits and better working conditions is in line with a basic shift in Japanese society, whereby the inhabitants of an economic superpower are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their living standards and working conditions. In corporate terms, this means Japanese industry moving gradually towards a more mature Western model. For its competitors in the West, this will be a profoundly welcome development. What it means for the investment community is another matter. It can be argued that the ultimate value of an equity always lies in its income potential: that when investors buy a share on a high p/e and tiny yield, they do so on the expectation that it will throw off cash when the business finally reaches maturity. If the share was correctly priced in the first place, there is no reason why the price should fall as the process unwinds. Applied to the Japanese equity market as a whole, this view calls for a degree of heroism. Even now, the market yield is a mere 1.1 per cent, compared to a world average of 2.9 per cent and around 5.5 per cent on Japanese government bonds. This is at least within shouting distance of conventional valuations, and, again taking the long view, might even represent fair value. In the shorter term, there are enough uncertainties - both transitory and fundamental - to make it hard to call the turn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Farm and fishery market  brokers ended their two-day strike Wednesday evening after the  government decided [to] shelve the planned enforcement of the  new law on farm produce distribution and price stabilization for  the next six months.    Yi Chong-su, secretary of the Association of Brokers Unions,  said his association members would return to normal farm and  fishery goods wholesaling and auctioning on Wednesday evening.    "I think the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry,  which had taken a mistaken policy, seems to have come to know  the sufferings of farm and fishery goods producers," Yi said.    Market brokers went on a strike on Tuesday in protest  against  the implementation of the new law which they argued would  heavily undermine their interests.</p>

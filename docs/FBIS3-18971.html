This resolution had been proposed  by 16 countries, including Switzerland.    The resolution specifically cited an "inadequate protection"  of Tibetan identity and the identity of other Chinese  minorities. The Commission declared itself to be very worried  by the continuous reports on violations of fundamental rights;  on torture; and on serious restrictions on freedom of expression  and religion as well as on the right to a fair trial. The  resolution finally asked the Beijing government to take "new  steps" to improve this situation.    Before the vote, the United Kingdom suggested rejecting the  "nondecision" motion proposed by China in order to "preserve the  credibility" of the Commission, which is often accused of  "harassing small countries." The United States took the same  attitude, and emphasized that China did not have to be treated  differently from other countries "just because of its economic  potential and its size."    On the other hand, Pakistan, which supported the Beijing  motion, stated that China had "accelerated its reform process"  in the past year. Sri Lanka declared that the best road toward  improving human rights was not through the resolution proposed  at the Commission, but through persuasion and a real dialogue.</p>

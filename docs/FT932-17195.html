			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (18): Cash call problem solved - Nigeria still on course to produce 2.5m barrels a day, says Chief Asiodu / Chief Philip Asiodu, secretary for petroleum resources, interviewed by Paul Adams and Michael Holman, expresses optimism about Nigeria's troubled LNG project How much is the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation's (NNPC) cash shortage holding back development of the oil and gas industry? A certain amount of our oil proceeds is dedicated to cover these cash calls. Last year, in order to finance some other operations, there was some money borrowed and that is being replaced. There is no problem with meeting our cash calls now that we have negotiated with the oil companies to scale down investment in our joint ventures by 10 per cent. Our partners assure me that it will not affect our ability to build up capacity over 1993. After last month's cut in its Opec production quota, does Nigeria still aim to increase output to 2.5m barrels a day? Yes, we very much hope to do that. The investments we have just been discussing are not only to maintain existing capacity but also to build up to a capacity of producing about 2.5m barrels a day. The latest OPEC quota is for the second quarter of 1993. In June we shall meet again and review the market. But in the medium and long term the world will rely more on OPEC to meet increasing consumption so it is wise to invest in the discovery of more oil if it is there. Will the amount of proven reserves of Nigeria affect its production quota? Not immediately because if we relate quota to proven reserves strictly, some of the Gulf states would have a bigger quota. But what we are now saying is that the quota should not look simply at production without considering a country's internal direct consumption of crude oil, quite apart from consumption for processing products for export. It is the oil that is for export which affects the world prices and we think that for countries with a large population there is a built-in penalty unless you take into account internal consumption, and we shall be arguing this more and more. Why is Nigeria offering foreign oil companies production sharing agreements instead of joint ventures for the new deep water blocks and what is delaying these agreements? Actually the first production sharing contract was signed in 1973 and that was to be the pattern of subsequent concession agreements but then we had a change of government and of policy. The advantage for us now is that it is a way of ensuring that necessary exploration goes ahead but that we do not have to put money up front. In a situation where we need every penny and our cash flow is not all that buoyant, there really is no point in committing large sums of money to very risky exploration when it is possible to have mutually satisfactory arrangements which does not tie up our funds. The big oil companies take the initial risk but if the oil is found there is an equitable formula for recovering their costs and we want to move more and more towards that. Indeed, I think we could have done more of this between 1973 and now and saved some privation in other sectors. There were delays in signing last year which were quite unnecessary. I have given a deadline to conclude several such agreements by the end of March. Can the LNG project be brought back on track? It is not off track completely. At the next board meeting of Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd (NLNG), including our technical advisers, the other shareholders, NNPC, I expect there to be a decision to go back to the air products process which Shell recommended in 1987. I have not found good arguments why it was abandoned and preference instead given to Telearc, the new French process. The alternative, air products process, accounts for 28 of 30 of the world's LNG plants and Nigeria is not in a position to experiment with very new technology. There would be penalties, if we did not deliver on schedule, which we could not absorb. I cannot recommend that. The indications are we will be offered a fair enough price from the purchasers of our LNG in April or May of this year. Due to the recent delay, instead of taking delivery in the third quarter of 1997, we are talking now of delivery in the first or second quarter of 1998. Now what is left is to discuss financing and ensure that we do not start to construct until 100 per cent of the equity is in place. I think Shell will find that they have to move faster. The important thing is that we want to take a decision, press the button and make the project irreversible. What are the appropriate prices of domestic petroleum products, when will you implement them and what will be the political impact? We are pitching new prices at a level which will recover our costs of producing, refining and delivering the products to the consumer, plus enough for full amortisation and replacement of plant. We are not adding much for taxation. On that basis we shall get appropriate prices. We recognise that we cannot get there in one fell swoop. On March 15 we stopped some subsidies. We will begin by stopping our deficits on the import of non-conventionals, that is base oils, lube oils ad lubricants and on aviation fuel. That will not affect the pump price paid by most people. Before putting up prices of domestic kerosene or petrol, we shall spend the next three months trying to explain to the public the basic facts: how much deficit we run every day in trying to satisfy the needs of the consumer. With two of NNPC's refineries out of action and petrol shortages in the north, how will you improve the efficiency of the downstream industry? The Kaduna refinery should be back on stream towards the end of March. It was not completely down. At the worst stage in early March, it was delivering less than a third of the normal quantity. Even at full capacity in Kaduna, we still have to do some bridging from the south. The long-term solution to that is now under construction - pipelines to Maiduguri and Yola. I think that the problem will become easier once we have appropriate pricing of our products. The distribution system and the refineries have been running on funding which is not enough even to sustain day-to-day operations, much less to provide for future upgrading or investment. The other source of the shortages is the amount of smuggling of Nigerian products over the borders and, again, sensible domestic pricing will help to stop that. Also, the other refinery which is out of action (the old Port Harcourt plant) is about to come back on stream. With that in place there should be less of a problem with the efficiency of the downstream industry. Do you intend to divest some of NNPC'S assets? I am not a strong supporter of selling the family silver. I do not think state ownership in the downstream sector is the problem, nor is divestment the solution. The sector will be thrown open, deregulated in a way that would allow private sector operators to make profits. We will have appropriate pricing and people will be free to come and set up refineries and sell their products for export, and to build private depots and pipelines if they want. Would you consider divesting some of your share of the joint ventures upstream? That is a different question. That is where we have something to sell. We would consider divestment upstream to release funds for other projects.</p>

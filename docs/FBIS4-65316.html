			<p>BFN     [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos has  proposed a "solution at all costs" on the Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue and has made it  clear that he prefers an agreement on all points except that of  the name, which will continue to be pending.    Moreover, he has implied that in the end it will be very  difficult to avoid the term "Macedonia" in the name of Skopje.    Speaking to Sky's [private radio and TV station] program  "Knock Out" the other day, Mr. Pangalos defended his phrase  "lost case" on the Skopje issue. He explained: "I say that our  attempt to win on the name issue is a lost case, but since we  cannot accept a compromise at this time the issue should stay as  it is."    Theodhoros Pangalos even insisted on his phrase that Skopje  "has claims" on the term Macedonia, explaining that:    --It was called this from 1950 until 1990, when it was a  Federal Republic. "We were recognizing it and Yugoslavia, which  included it, and was a most friendly country."    --They live in a part, the smallest part, of historic  Macedonia.    --The previous [Greek] government recognized a name that  included the term "Macedonia."    "Unfortunately, what Mr. Konstandinos Mitsotakis has done  continues to be Greek policy and whatever the current government  does is Greek policy... [ellipses as published] So, we have  recognized at the United Nations that they are called The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which, if I am not mistaken,  includes the word Macedonia, unless I no longer understand  anything. We should keep all this in mind if we are to live in  the world of logic..." [ellipsis as published]    According to diplomatic sources, the meeting between Foreign  Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis and Cyrus Vance  [UN mediator in Greek-FYROM dispute] will be held tomorrow, or  most probably on Monday [16 May].    The same sources noted that the negotiating process is now  idle and that there is not any specific convergence of views.    At any rate, the Greek side goes to this round of  negotiations with two principles:    --The Greek countermeasures remain as they are.    --All issues are open for discussion.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Far better a little less speed - at considerably less cost Sir, We who were fortunate enough to observe from a safe distance Sir Peter Masefield's remarkable business career must welcome his enthusiastic endorsement of the Super Concorde project (Letters, April 21) as a reliable confirmation of your own sober assessment. Res ipsa loquitur, indeed] There seems no limit to the extent to which such imaginative and far-sighted men are prepared to plunder the public purse. It is hard to see exactly how the human condition might be improved by, say, Mr Rupert Murdoch's being able to get here in half the time. Rather, such considerations make a better case for a new production run of that splendid classic, the Handley Page HP42 - a move with which Sir Peter, I warrant, would find himself equally happy, and all at so much less expense to the rest of us. M P Laker, 11 Woodmansterne Road, Coulsdon, Surrey CR5 2DG</p>

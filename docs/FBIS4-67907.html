			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: ``Agreement with IAEA on Tarapur </F> Plant'']    [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 23 -- Through an agreement with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], India has volunteered  to keep the Tarapur nuclear power plant under international  safeguards. India was not legally bound to do so, after the  expiry of the arrangement with the U.S. for the supply of  enriched uranium, but has taken this step as a goodwill gesture  -- in the belief that it would be helpful in the efforts to keep  the plant operational with the help of the reprocessed spent  fuel at a later stage.    The draft agreement, submitted by India in December last to  the IAEA, has been approved by its board of governors at a  meeting which began in Vienna on 21 February -- according to  information received by the Department of Atomic Energy and,  perhaps, also by the External Affairs Ministry.    The temporary bilateral arrangement between India and the  IAEA, that had been in force after the expiry of the 10-year  agreement with the U.S. on 24 October last, has now been put on  a permanent basis. Before that date, the safeguards were  applicable at a trilateral level, involving the U.S., the  original supplier of enriched uranium.  <H5>  Chequered History </H5>   The Tarapur arrangements have a chequered history. While the  agreement was still valid, the U.S. found it difficult to  continue the supply because of the imperatives of its domestic  legislation. As a result, France came in the picture -- and  enriched uranium was made available to India, though under the  framework of the Indo-U.S. agreement. France, as such, had no  independent standing and it stopped the supplies at the end of  the time-frame envisaged in the agreement with Washington.    The agreement with the IAEA has no major immediate  implications, as the plant has enough fuel in stock to keep it  going for two to three years. India was under no obligation to  approach Vienna with the voluntary offer, but it was done as a  confidence-building measure and to dispel misunderstandings  about the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This, New  Delhi calculates, would also facilitate its job in working for a  long-term arrangement as the plant has a life of another 15  years.    The U.S. -- as also France -- had expressed unwillingness to  extend the arrangement after 24 October 1993. Also, the U.S. did  not accept India's plea to secure enriched uranium from other  sources. The other course open to India was to reprocess the  spent fuel which, in any case, posed major storage problems.  This point figured in the discussions in Washington in September  last by then Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. The U.S. was  non-committal -- it neither said ``no,'' nor ``yes.'' Efforts in  that direction are to be continued.    The acceptance of continued international safeguards for the  Tarapur plant does not mean a departure from India's stand  against the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty or its variants,  suggested by the industrialised nations. The Vienna agreement  means extensions of the international safeguards for Tarapur,  that had been in force for the last 10 years -- now under a  bilateral arrangement.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Leading Article: A risk worth taking THE decision by the US, Britain and France to send troops to northern Iraq to ensure the safety of hundreds of thousands of Kurds has been taken to prevent a human disaster of horrifying proportions. These people, who have been stranded on the Iraqi border in appalling conditions, have preferred to risk starvation and death in the icy mountains rather than face the wrath of President Saddam Hussein's forces by returning home. The only way to save them is to persuade them to come down from the mountains and that they will only do if their security is guaranteed. Mr John Major, the prime minister, must be given the credit for mobilising not only his European partners, but ultimately a clearly reluctant US president, in support of at least the main elements of his safe havens plan. However, Mr George Bush's initial reservations about the original British proposals were entirely understandable. The suggestion that the fleeing Kurds should return to their home towns and villages under the military protection of allied forces or the UN over a very substantial area of Iraq, could be seen as the first step towards the creation of an autonomous Kurdish region. Worst of all, it risked directly involving the US and Britain in Iraq's internal affairs for years to come and thus provoking the hostility of most of the Arab world, including the coalition partners in the Gulf conflict. Military involvement Though the plan that was finally adopted is still full of hazards, the risk of permanent military and political involvement by the US, Britain and France in the domestic affairs of Iraq has been reduced. The forces which will be sent to safeguard some five to six refugee camps in northern Iraq will be relatively limited. The US is sending 5,000 to 10,000 troops and Britain some 2,000. Both Mr Bush and Mr Major have stressed the intended temporary nature of the operation - perhaps two to three months - and their desire to hand over responsibility for ensuring the safety of the Kurds to the UN as soon as possible. They have once again emphasised that it was not US or British policy to break up Iraq into separate states or to get involved in internal political quarrels, but only to deal with an urgent humanitarian need. It is right that these good intentions should be underlined publicly. But it is equally necessary squarely to face the dangers inherent in the joint military action. Though Washington and London sound confident that the Iraqis, while denouncing the allies for intervening in their internal affairs, will in practice do nothing to hamper it, that cannot be taken as a foregone conclusion. Even an isolated shooting incident, either between Iraqi and allied troops, or between Iraqi and Kurdish rebel forces, runs the risk of reigniting a conflict which most people thought had come to an end with Baghdad's acceptance of the coalition's tough ceasefire terms. Legal authority Neither is it possible to ignore the fact that the decision to send troops to northern Iraq has been taken by the three governments in question without the specific sanction of the UN, which provided the anti-Iraq coalition with its much-vaunted stamp of legitimacy throughout the Gulf conflict. The claim by the US and Britain that Resolution 688 gives them the necessary legal authority for their move is controversial, to say the least, and is unlikely to convince either China or the Soviet Union, both permanent members of the Security Council. The UN itself, which reported yesterday that it had reached agreement with Baghdad to set up 'humanitarian centres' in northern Iraq, said its initiative could be undermined by the trilateral action. No one should thus be under any illusion about the political risks of a humane move which cannot in any case provide more than a very short-term answer to the Kurds' plight. The problem of their long-term security and identity will remain as acute as always after they have been fed and cared for and the allied troops have returned home. Over this matter, the coalition partners can exercise only the most modest influence.</p>

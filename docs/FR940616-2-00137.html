Limited funding is also available to support leadership development and training for adults in NIS non-governmental organizations who work with youth, when such an activity is coupled with a youth exchange program. The Agency's main objectives are to foster interaction between American and foreign youth, to promote democratic values and the development of democratic institutions, and to build sustainable partnerships between organizations in the United States and organizations in the former Soviet Union. It is important that all projects make interaction between the American and NIS participants a central focus of their activities. Proposals should demonstrate how American and foreign participants will interact in a substantive way that encourages the exchange of ideas, culture, values, and information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four different program designs will be utilized in the NIS Secondary School Initiative: (A) An academic year program, (B) a semester exchange program (C) a school-to-school linkage program, and (D) a short-term exchange program. This RFP describes the short-term program. Other RFPs will be published separately soliciting proposals for the other three programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Germany to issue long bond Germany responded to demands from the international investment community yesterday when it announced plans for the issue of bonds with a maturity of more than 10 years for the first time in nearly eight years. The Bundesbank, the German government's issuing agent, said that next Wednesday the government would sell a new tranche of its 6 per cent bond issue due 2016. The bonds were launched in May 1986. A senior official at the finance ministry in Bonn said that if next week's auction was a success, the government would consider issuing more long-dated bonds, including a 30-year issue. Traders expect the auction to raise DM3bn to DM4bn. German banks have recently begun to push hard for a new 30-year bund to bring the German market into line with leading bond markets elsewhere. Most German government bond issuance is concentrated in the five and 10-year areas of the yield curve, while government bond markets in the US, the UK, the Netherlands and France have liquid, long-dated sectors, with maturities as long as 30 years. Italy has become the latest European sovereign borrower to issue 30-year bonds and Spain will make its first issue of 15-year bonds in the domestic market this month. Two weeks ago, a DM2bn offering of 30-year Eurobonds by the Austrian government was snapped up by international investors starved of long-dated bonds denominated in D-Marks. It prompted a flood of long-dated D-Mark bond issues by German federal states. The German finance ministry said the government was keen to raise long-term financing at the current low level of interest rates. Bankers said that it was in the German government's interest to satisfy the demands of international investors since their continued support was central to the government's success in funding its massive borrowing requirement. Next year, net public sector borrowing is expected to total around DM230bn, marginally below this year's DM235bn (Pounds 93bn).</p>

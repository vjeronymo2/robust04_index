			<p>BFN     [Text] With the goal of strengthening economic cooperation  with Vietnam, a Danish Government delegation led by Minister for  Development Cooperation Ms. Helle Aid Degn paid a working visit.  Accompanying the Danish delegation was a large group of Danish  businessmen.    During its stay in Vietnam, the Danish delegation was  received by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and held talks  with Tran Thong Giao, deputy chairman of the State Planning  Commission. Both sides noted that economic cooperation between  the two countries is developing satisfactorily.    Denmark has resumed cooperation relations with Vietnam since  1992 and has listed Vietnam as a preferential country in its  program of overseas aid. It has granted Vietnam a nonrefundable  aid of 83 million kroner or $14 million for the restoration and  development of Denmark-funded projects in Vietnam such as the  Hoang Thach cement factory, the La Nga sugar plant, and the  Dalat water work. Both sides noted that Vietnam has effectively  managed and exploited these projects.    Following the reopening of the Danish Embassy in Hanoi and  the Consul General in Ho Chi Minh City, Denmark has informed  Vietnam of a long-term strategic cooperation program under which  the two countries will accelerate cooperation in preserving and  processing of agricultural and sea products, developing cement  production and distribution; and improving water supply,  environmental protection, and care for women and children.</p>

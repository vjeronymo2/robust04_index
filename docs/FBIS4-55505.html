			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michal Kulesza, government plenipotentiary </F> for the reform of the administration, by Renata Wrobel; place  and date not given: "Kulesza: My Mission Has Been Exhausted"]    [Text] "If I feel that I am supposed to be the  government's plenipotentiary for blocking the reform of the  public administration, I will resign," said Michal Kulesza, the  government's plenipotentiary for the reform of the  administration, at one time. Yesterday, during a session of the  Second Congress of Territorial Self-Government, Kulesza publicly  informed about his resignation. He was appointed to this post  by the previous Council of Ministers, the one chaired by Hanna  Suchocka, in the fall of 1992. RZECZPOSPOLITA asked him to  explain the reasons for his decision.    [Wrobel] Many people expected you to submit your resignation  soon after last year's parliamentary elections.    [Kulesza] I often heard opinions at that time that the fate  of the reform was a foregone conclusion. I faced the following  dilemma: Should I look upon myself as a politician of the  previous government's people, who were cleaning their desks and  leaving, or the other way around--stay with the hope that the  issues I dealt with would be continued.    [Wrobel] What did you base these hopes on? The new  government avoided any declarations on the issue of this reform.  What is more, it began its activities by stopping the pilot  program in towns and cities.    [Kulesza] I believed at the time, and I still do, that the  reform is inevitable and that it takes not really bad will but  state abnegation to curb it. I did not think there is such a  great thirst for power within the Polish Peasant Party [PSL].  Of course, if someone has emerged from political nonbeing for  the first time in a couple of decades and has passed from a  level of village administration to a level of governing the  country, certain processes are unavoidable. However, I thought  that, after a certain period, things would begin to die down.  Reform is a great strategic maneuver that requires time. Those  who in December wanted the government to know whether it wants  the reform were wrong. The prime minister must not be pinned to  the wall: "Unless you reform the state within two weeks, you are  stupid."    [Wrobel] How is what you called "thirst for power"  detrimental to the reform of the administration?    [Kulesza] For example, in changing the cadres in the  nomenklatura-like style. In the corridors of the  Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], one can hear people  whispering that this or that guy is coming back to earn  additional money to add to his retirement pension. In  voivodships, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is taking part  in the division of loot rather modestly, whereas the PSL is  filling posts in an extremely brutal manner. I can understand  that a voivode may not satisfy the prime minister for some  reasons. However, there must be reasons other than pressure of  local party elites. The PSL is not changing people because they  are the wrong people in those places but, rather, because it has  to satisfy the demand for power within the party. First they  wanted to change only voivodes, then deputy voivodes, directors  of departments, and so on. If one manages to snare such a post,  he is followed by a large group of others. Along with people,  old ways of governing that we thought we had buried a long time  ago are coming back. We are witnessing the process of making  the administration political to a gigantic degree. Minister  Strak within just a few months recreated a  nomenklatura-like model of administration, similar to  the one we had in the Polish People's Republic. In doing so, he  undid the four-year efforts aimed at making the civil service  cadres independent of politics.    The thirst for power is also reflected in conceptual  thinking. The PSL achieved its greatest success in Poland after  1989. In some configuration, it will rule for the next 15 or 20  years, and, even if it finds itself in the opposition, it will  be a very strong opposition. In this situation, it is behaving  narrow-mindedly. It realizes that, when powiat [small  administrative unit] elections are held, it will take its share,  but it will require some efforts. Why get tired, then, its  activists seem to be saying, if we are doing very well anyway?    [Wrobel] You were not the PSL plenipotentiary; you were the  plenipotentiary of the government. The government coalition  also includes the SLD, which, as it is known, has a different  view of the reform of the administration.    [Kulesza] The PSL is employing effective, even though  utterly uncivilized, methods in its policy: It is omitting  substantive aspects of discussions; it is avoiding any kind of  political "scheming" such as: yes, a reform, but in a slightly  different manner. The SLD, which seems to be favorably disposed  toward the reform, is letting it go at that, just as it is doing  on many other issues. It cannot or does not want to get through  with its ideas.    [Wrobel] Do you not think that curbing the reform may be at  least partially caused by the hope that, after the forthcoming  elections to gmina [smallest administrative units] councils,  more of "our" people will come, and it will be possible to  adjust possible changes to them?    [Kulesza] I do not acknowledge such reasoning at all. If  the belief that "our people are better" were to be a fragment of  the state doctrine, it would mean that I have been here a  half-year too long.    [Wrobel] Why did you decide to resign now?    [Kulesza] Recently, the real intentions of the government  have become clear. A deputies' initiative was submitted in the  Sejm concerning the law on powiats. The Sejm speaker requested  the government to take a stand. This was at the beginning of  March. On 24 March, I forwarded a positive opinion to the URM  head, the prime minister, and the members of the Council of  Ministers. I did it of my own accord because, as usual, I was  omitted. Today is the middle of May and there is still no  answer; the government has not made any decision, nothing has  come to the Sejm. What does it mean?    [Wrobel] It means, perhaps, that the government has more  important issues to deal with now.    [Kulesza] One can say so, although one must have a lot of  goodwill. Another issue: Early in April, bills concerning the  government administration and the state civil service appeared.  I did not work on them, either. I prepared a negative opinion  because these bills are embarrassing: They are not in line with  what is happening in modern democracies; they make the  administration political and reduce the state civil service  almost to an empty name. No one was interested in this.    This is what I had been waiting for. The government's  attitude to the powiats, to the reform of the center, and to the  state civil service became clear. I dare say that the name of  Michal Strak will go down in the history of Poland's  administrative system as the person who caused the reforms to  collapse.    [Wrobel] Do you think Prime Minister Pawlak is "without  fault" here?    [Kulesza] To me it is understandable that the prime minister  is not dealing with everything himself because he has his  ministers. Michal Strak is his chief adviser in administrative  issues he is in charge of. I dare say that he is fulfilling  this function in a manner that is dramatically destructive.    [Wrobel] What was your position in the present government?    [Kulesza] It was absolutely marginal. For half a year I was  not invited by Minister Strak for substantive talks on the  functioning of the administration and the reforms. My office  was gradually denied the possibilities of acting. I saw an  utter lack of interest in the work that had been done thus far.  I was often passed up when bills concerning my duties were  being prepared. The bills that were drafted somewhere else  either reached me or did not. No one cared about my opinions.  As far as I know, Minister Strak has organized his own experts'  teams, which are not conducting a social discussion.    I performed a lot of work that I liked and considered  useful.  I felt that the minister wanted to take advantage of me as one  of his URM civil servants. However, I went there not to be a  civil servant but to prepare a basic reform. If the government  does not want that, my presence is entirely superfluous. At the  meeting before the elections of the self-government people, who  are the people of the reforms, I decided to tell them that my  mission had been exhausted. I cannot look passively at the  program of reforms, which Poland needs, being broken to pieces.</p>

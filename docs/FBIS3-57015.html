			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Armen Khanbabyann under the "Nagorno-Karabakh" </F> rubric: Karabakh: Fighting Intensifies as Azeris Shoot at Each  Other"]    [Text] Starting in the early morning of 19 January, Azeri  infantry and armored vehicles launched an attack on the  positions of Karabakh's self-defense army virtually along the  entire perimeter of the standoff -- from Omar pass in the north  to Goradiz in the southeast. The more sustained fighting was  going on in Mardakert Rayon in the direction of the settlement  of Magavuz. According to Nagorno-Karabakh's press department,  Karabakh subunits managed to hold back the enemy pressure by the  close of 19 January, inflicting on it appreciable losses in  personnel -- up to 100 killed -- and materiel. The Azeri Air  Force at the same time once again tried to bomb Stepanakert but  was chased away by antiaircraft artillery fire. On the morning  of 19 January, Karabakh fighters witnessed a more than two-hour  battle between two Azeri battalions outside the population  center of Karakhanbeyli. It is still not clear whether that was  a shoot-out between two rival commanders, or whether the Azeris  simply had mistaken each other for the enemy.    Military experts believe that despite the extremely  difficult  situation, the Karabakh Army is capable of holding the front  whereas possible Azeri successes may at this stage be of only  local nature and should not result in appreciable changes in the  sides' positions. The active participation of Russian and  Ukrainian mercenaries is not so far producing the expected  impact upon the overall situation, although, as commanders  certify, some battalions formed from the "Slavic" contingent are  fighting very vigorously, and it is hard to withstand their  pressure. In particular, the encirclement of Armenian units  near the settlement of Magavuz had been organized by two such  battalions.    The conviction taking shape in Armenia is that the offensive  efforts by the Azeri Army have been caused exclusively by  political expediency. Before the meeting in Moscow of the  leaders of the two Transcaucasus states and Russia, the men in  Baku would very likely want the talks to begin in a different  military-political situation. The men in Moscow would possibly  want the same: The gamble is that should the Azeri side manage  to inflict a major defeat on the Karabakhis, Yerevan's and  Stepanakert's stance at the talks according to the plan  suggested by Russia may be much softer. At any rate, Azerbaijan  is continuing its offensive regardless of losses. The latter,  meanwhile, have reached unprecedented proportions. In little  more than a month, the Azeri Army lost some 5,000 men. In Baku,  this circumstance sparked internal political tensions because  casualties sustained so far are not measuring up in any way to  success at the front.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 28 (CNS) -- More than 100,000  persons are poisoned by chemicals used in agriculture annually  in recent years in China, with the number poisoned in the course  of production equalling those not engaged in production  activities, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and the  Ministry of Public Health.    In 1992, a total of 70,618 persons in 25 provinces,  autonomous regions and municipalities suffered from poisoning  from agricultural chemicals resulting in 8,620 deaths, 12.2  percent of all those succumbing to such poisoning. In 1993,  some 51,283 persons in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities were found to have been poisoned with 6,156 of  them dying, making up 12 percent of all those poisoned.  According to experts, some 60 percent of all such poisoning  cases had gone unreported.    In the mid-eighties, there were many cases of such  poisoning.  The authorities in some provinces organized teams to prevent and  treat such poisoning and educated peasants about how to use  agricultural chemicals, reducing the occurrence of such  poisoning. After 1987, the shortage of funds and a drop in the  number of professional staff responsible for prevention and  guidance work saw an increase in the number of people affected  by such poisoning. The number of peasants using agricultural  chemicals increased to over 100 million households made up of  200 to 300 million individuals, leading to an increase in the  number of people suffering from such poisoning.</p>

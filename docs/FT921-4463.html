			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Management: Giving a boost to technology ventures Entrepreneurs with a technology-based proposal may be failing to raise venture capital funds because they do not present their ideas to a sufficiently broad spread of potential backers. This is the conclusion of a survey of technology oriented venture capital firms carried out by Korda, a firm specialising in venture capital technology. Most entrepreneurs contacted only five or six of the 30 funds prepared to consider technology proposals. Entrepreneurs tended to rely on personal contacts or professional advisers to put them in touch with a fund, instead of consulting any of the directories of venture capital funds, Korda said. Accountants and other professional advisers contacted up to 10 funds before losing interest but even they failed to exploit the full range of potential backers. By failing to approach a large number of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs not only risk not obtaining backing. They may well arrange a deal on less favourable terms than would otherwise be possible. Conventional advice to entrepreneurs is that they do not approach too many venture capitalists for fear of making their proposal look 'shop soiled'. But the specialist nature of technology proposals means that entrepreneurs should look as widely as possible, said Jason Loveridge of Korda. It estimated that venture capitalists looked seriously at about 460 proposals for early stage, technology-based ventures last year with individual funds looking at only 15 each. Seventy-five per cent of all proposals were rejected, 5 per cent won backing and 20 per cent were still undecided.

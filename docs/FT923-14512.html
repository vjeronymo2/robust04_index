			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Observer: Out to lunch Sir Bryan Carsberg, the new director-general of fair trading, wants a couple of months to read himself in before making grand pronouncements about general competition policy. But one tentative judgment can already be made. Sir Bryan, the former telephone regulator, seems to be taking a tougher line on the buffet lunch - a sensitive indicator for many journalists. Whereas the outgoing Sir Gordon Borrie laid on a good spread, Sir Bryan seems to be under the impression that journalists can be influenced with peanuts, crisps and wine. As a result, some of Fleet Street's finest were not overly impressed with their first briefing session with the new OFT boss yesterday. But what can you expect when you replace a barrister with an accountant?</p>

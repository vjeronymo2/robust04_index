			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (5): Teleworking buzzwords Teleworking is most simply defined as 'working at a distance'. Teleworkers do the work at a physical distance from the person or organisation employing him or her. Teleworking organisations (as opposed to teleworking individuals) process information for a remote client, usually as a third party. Homeworking, telecommuting, and remote working are all terms used to describe various ways of teleworking. In BT's definition, the work undertaken by teleworkers is generally electronic processing of information, with results communicated to the employer by a telecommunications link. Hot-desking is the use of one desk (and its technology) by a succession of different workers. The employer provides a desk in permanent premises: the territory belongs to no one individual worker, but is used by people who go into the premises occasionally. A nomadic desk is remote access (often via a laptop computer from wherever the worker happens to be). The telecottage or telecentre is a local centre, open to anyone who needs the service, providing PC, printer, fax, telephone and other equipment. Funding comes from various sources, local and national, and can even come from large corporations whose outworkers use the facilities. Telexecutive is a word (originated by Francis Kinsman) used to describe a highly qualified worker, probably part-time, whose flexible working pattern might involve hot desking, homeworking and telecentre working. Corporate telecommuting provides a formal framework for an organisation's professional employees to work at home as appropriate. Outsourcing describes the use of outside, possibly remote services to replace those of in-house employees. The organisational model is to have core workers responsible for key activities, who buy in outside resources as and when they need them from peripheral resources (such as consultants) or other outworkers. ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Networking) allows high-speed data transmission on lines that can accommodate voice, image, computer data, video and graphics. Once jokingly referred to as an Innovation Subscribers Don't Need, or It Still Does Nothing, there are now real applications which justify its use, such as video-conferencing. For the home or office user, a single pair of wires can serve phone, fax modem, all on the same line, with incoming call differentiation, calling line identity, and connection within milliseconds.</p>

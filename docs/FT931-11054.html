			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bad debts behind fall to Pounds 61.4m at Britannia A RISE in provisions for bad debts, caused by the slump in the housing market and recession, reduced pre-tax profits at Britannia Building Society by 4 per cent from Pounds 64m to Pounds 61.4m last year. Britannia, the ninth largest society, was weighed down by a bad debt cost of Pounds 71.9m (Pounds 50.3m) for the year to December 31, comprising Pounds 47.1m (Pounds 33.7m) in provisions and Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 16.6m) in irrecoverable interest on non-performing loans. The results were roughly in line with the pattern expected in the industry for 1992. A survey last month by the brokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew found that societies' pre-tax profits were likely to fall by 7 per cent on average. Operating profits before provisions rose by 16.5 per cent to Pounds 113.8m (Pounds 97.7m), but pre-tax profits were further reduced by a Pounds 5.3m exceptional charge for the cost of making 100 staff redundant and the closure of estate agency offices. Britannia Life, the society's life assurance and investment subsidiary, made a Pounds 14m contribution to profits, up some 30 per cent on 1991. A widening of margins as base rates fell by 4.5 percentage points in the last quarter of the year helped raise net interest received - the gap between interest paid on savings products and received on assets - to Pounds 165m (Pounds 144.3m). Mr Michael Shaw, managing director, said the results represented 'a very good trading performance during a year in which the housing market virtually ground to a halt'. He said the society had benefited from 'vigilance on costs'. The cost to income ratio, including the exceptional charge, rose slightly to 49.5 per cent (48.4 per cent). Capital increased from Pounds 470m to Pounds 623m as a result of profits and two issues of permanent interest-bearing shares totalling Pounds 110m.</p>

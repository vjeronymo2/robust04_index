			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Economic Notebook: Bickering over the Bundesbank THE BUNDESBANK is experiencing a behind-the-scenes battle over power-sharing which is growing in intensity - at a time when the German central bank is running into ever-greater complications along the road to European Monetary Union. Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, usually a sovereign figure on the international monetary circuit, faces a complex assortment of interlocking problems. The challenges over a prospective restructuring of the bank's 18-member policy-making council, necessitated by last year's absorption of East Germany, are compounding difficulties caused by post-unity financial turbulence. Turnaround Statistics last week showed that Germany ran a small current-account deficit in the first two months of 1991. This represents a sharp turnaround from current account surpluses of DM104bn (Pounds 34.8bn) in 1989 (in West Germany) and DM71bn last year (from July 1, counting both east and west Germany). The need to import capital to help cover the costs of unification means that the Bundesbank will be keeping interest rates high for the foreseeable future, whatever the desires of partner countries in the European Monetary System for credit easing. Concern over German interest rates is overshadowing preparations for the move to stage two of European Monetary Union at the beginning of 1994, where France and Germany are still divided over setting up a European central bank. Compared with the tussling between Bonn and Paris over EMU, the bickering within Germany over Mr Pohl's plans to cut down the number of the country's state (Land) central banks appears almost banal. But the political ramifications are wide-ranging. The problem arises because the arrangements under which the Bundesbank extended the D-Mark to east Germany last year were only provisional in nature, and need to be sealed by a change in the Bundesbank law by the autumn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has to decide in the next few weeks whether or not to support Mr Pohl's suggestion of reducing the number of Land central banks from 11 in west Germany to eight in united Germany. The proposal, involving the closure and merger of some regional central banks in the west, is politically sensitive because the president of each Land central bank sits on the Bundesbank's policy-making council. The Finance Ministry in Bonn is already giving support to Mr Pohl's ideas, which would slim down the top-heavy council and make decision-making less onerous. It would also redress the balance between the regional central bank chiefs and the Frankfurt-based Bundesbank directorate, which garners only seven votes out of 18 on the council. The Pohl plan has been backed by a majority of the 18 - but is opposed by a group of seven Land central banks, which believe the proposal would water down Germany's federal system and reduce the political influence of individual states. Bonn officials say that Mr Kohl, who met Mr Pohl in Bonn last month to discuss the subject, still has not made up his mind on the issue. This is partly because the chancellor does not want to annoy the Land governments, which say they would lose out over the deal. Mr Pohl's only allies on this question among the Land representatives on his council are the presidents of the Hamburg, Berlin, Hesse, and Lower Saxony central banks. If relations between the Bundesbank and the government were unperturbed, Mr Kohl's hesitation would not matter much. In fact, they are going through a stormy time. Mr Pohl upset the chancellor last month by saying in public that introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany last year had produced a 'disaster'. Although Mr Pohl sent a letter to Mr Kohl soon afterwards to play down the remarks, the episode still rankles in Bonn. Other members of the central bank council believe that a decision by the chancellor against the central bank president's plan would further undermine Mr Pohl's authority, which has come sporadically under strain during a series of disagreements last year over the terms of German monetary union. Resignation Mr Pohl was elected for his second eight-year term as the head of the Bundesbank at the end of 1987, and is due to stay on until the end of 1995. He briefly considered resignation in February last year, after Mr Kohl changed his mind overnight and decided, without telling the Bundesbank, to advocate speedy monetary union with East Germany. If Mr Pohl were really to resign - although there seem no grounds for this - the succession would either pass to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the present vice-president due to retire in September next year, or to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the former Bonn state secretary, who joined the Bundesbank last year. A side skirmish in this political tussling took place 10 days ago when the central bank council, in a highly-unusual move, rejected the new candidate put forward to join the council from the state government of the Saar. Mr Hans-Jurgen Koebnick, the mayor of Saarbrucken, was nominated to replace the incumbent, Mr Hans Gliem. But the Bundesbank council turned him down not only because they regarded Mr Koebnick as lacking in professional qualifications, but also because the Saar central bank is due to disappear under the Pohl plan. The proposals foresee the state of Hesse taking responsibility for the Rhineland Palatinate and the Saar, while Hamburg would absorb Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg and Lower Saxony would merge with Saxony-Anhalt and Bremen. A majority on the central bank council made clear that approving Mr Koebnick would be politically counter-productive and might also be financially exorbitant, considering the job carries a DM350,000-a-year salary. However, the Saar will be pressing Mr Koebnick's claims through the Bundesrat, the upper house of Parliament, which has the final say. Despite his ministry's basic support for slimming down the Bundesbank's decision-making apparatus, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, seems to be stopping short of giving Mr Pohl full backing. This may be because Bavaria has sided with the states of Baden-Wurttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia in opposing the Pohl plan - and Mr Waigel is chairman of the Bavarian conservative party, the Christian Social Union. The political infighting over the new shape of the Bundesbank may seem highly provincial. But, since it will have a crucial influence over the future of monetary decision-making, the bickering over the Bundesbank is a saga worth following for all of Europe.</p>

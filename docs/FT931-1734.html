			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Letter: The over 45s: possessed of wisdom but rejected in advertising (1) Sir, I would like to comment on your article, 'On the shelf at 45'. My company employs 19 personnel, average age 51, average service 13 years. Sick leave is negligible and staff turnover less than 10 per cent a year, including retirements. Any staff turnover we have suffered has tended to be among the young and this has not been due to any lack of affinity with their aged colleagues. We are proud of our team. It is ironic that you should quote a representative of the financial services industry where the turnover of personnel is among the highest. My fond hope is that the Office of Fair Trading recommendations for the life industry are fully implemented. The young may be bright, dynamic and so forth but they lack one thing - wisdom. M H Upson, 52 Overstone Road, Harpenden, Herts.</p>

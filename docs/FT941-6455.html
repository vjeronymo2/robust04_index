			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Hopes rise as UK and China resume HK airport talks Britain and China will hold their first formal talks tomorrow on financing Hong Kong's multi-billion-dollar airport since last August, raising hopes that Beijing may be moving closer to an agreement. The meeting, at China's request, will discuss the Hong Kong government's fourth financial plan for the airport and its connecting railway. It follows the collapse of Anglo-Chinese co-operation on Hong Kong's political development last week and has prompted speculation among British diplomats that China might be moving towards a separation of economic from political issues. China has consistently criticised the Hong Kong government's financial plans for the project. It has said the government wants to raise too much debt to finance the project: debt which the post-1997 government will have to shoulder. The government's first financial plan, which found favour with international bankers, provided for HKDollars 16.3bn (Pounds 1.4bn) of equity and HKDollars 66.6bn of debt. Earlier this year, the government offered, in its fourth revised plan, to increase its equity contribution to airport and railway to HKDollars 60bn, from HKDollars 45bn previously, and to cut the amount of debt needed to finance the project to HKDollars 23bn from HKDollars 38bn. It is unclear how China will react to this latest plan, in spite of its much-reduced borrowing requirement. Last weekend, after a meeting in Beijing of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), some PWC members complained the government had not gone far enough. It would be surprising if China were to agree to the Hong Kong government's latest plan without extracting further concessions. As today's budget will show, the government's revenues are buoyant and it could afford to pump more equity into the project. Hong Kong's property developers shrugged off interest-rate and political worries yesterday to bid record prices for three plots of residential land at a government auction, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. 'The prices were way above expectations. This is obviously a huge vote of confidence in the colony,' government land auctioneer Nigel Burley said after the auction. Mr Burley said the developed properties, units of which will be sold to the public before completion, will come on to the market around 1996 to 1997. Hong Kong reverts to China in July, 1997. Analysts said they were surprised at the high prices - the two more expensive plots at over HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 173.5m) each surpassed expectations by more than HKDollars 500m apiece. But Hong Kong's stock market reacted negatively to the auction.</p>

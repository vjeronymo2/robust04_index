			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard, in </F> Frejus, southern France, by Bruno Masure at the France-2 studio  in Paris; the interview is interspersed with video reports on  the situation in Rwanda--live]    [Text] [Masure] We will now speak to Defense Minister  Francois Leotard, who is in Frejus, in southern France. Good  evening, Mr. Leotard. Before mentioning the diplomatic or  political aspects of this case, let me ask you a couple of  questions on the purely military aspect. Is it conceivable that  French troops will enter the areas controlled by the Rwandan  Patriotic Front [RPF]?    [Leotard] The instructions we gave our forces are two-fold:  first, to develop the humanitarian action, that is to survey the  sites where people are threatened or facing difficult sanitation  or food problems; second, not to approach the front line. The  front line more or less cuts through Rwanda north to south -- in  the south, on the road from Kigali to Bujumbura, Burundi. We  avoid getting close to that line for the time being, because it  can be a line where Rwandan army, militias, and the RPF are  clashing.    [Masure] Tension was reported at a certain number of  roadblocks today and General Germanos, who is at the scene, says  the situation is fragile. Aren't you worried?    [Leotard] He is right, and I would like to say that the  video  report I just saw is extremely interesting and positive, but we  should avoid any untimely satisfaction. The situation is  extremely fragile, and Gen. Germanos was right to say so. It is  characterized by many uncertainties, and we do not know  everything about the situation. We now have fewer than 500  soldiers in Rwanda in a relatively large area and, as we saw in  the report, we do not know all the distressful situations we may  face. I believe we must be extremely prudent. I repeat that  our role is to wait for the arrival of UNAMIR [UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda] II, which is the UN force replacing us as  early as possible, I hope. We are scouting the area, observing  what is going on, listening, and going to places where dangerous  situations are reported. We do what we can physically do.    [Masure] I would like to ask you a personal question. What  do you feel when you see French soldiers in this difficult  environment?    [Leotard] As the man in charge of French defense, naturally  I  am extremely happy to see French soldiers welcome. I must  stress that we did not know what the reception would be like.  It could have been dangerous or difficult, and it can be  tomorrow, tomorrow morning, so we must be very careful. There  is a generous feeling driving many French to help a country in  distress, but the government also does not want to risk the  lives of our soldiers and does not want to give this military  presence, even if it has a peaceful and humanitarian aim, a  character of provoking one or the other party. As you see, the  men carrying out this mission do so very tactfully, but it is a  very difficult situation because there is no clash. We do not  want a clash, and for soldiers this requires a great deal of  self-control with relatively modest means. There is also an  important question: What do we do with refugees and how? We are  now in touch with the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees]  to make sure that food and medical aid follow, enabling these  refugees to be properly treated.    [Masure] Mr. Defense Minister, the purity, if you will  pardon the expression, of French intentions was strongly  criticized before the start of this intervention, including by  our very close allies, both European and American. Do you feel  now that you have reassured them, or do you feel that there is a  political evolution?    [Leotard] I believe this evolution is taking place. We are  in permanent contact with our partners at the Western European  Union, among others, and with the Americans. I myself had talks  with several of my counterparts--European defense ministers--and  it has gradually transpired that, first, they are going to help  us with the logistics and with health equipment. Second, they  support our concept politically: the idea that we are there  temporarily only until the UNAMIR II -- that is, the UN force  mission -- arrives. I believe this is France's position.    It may be necessary to explain it further, but we do not  intend to stay at all, nor do we not intend to carry out  military actions. I would like to point this out again if  necessary. We are there because there was a lot of concern in  France and throughout the world, and justifiably so, after these  massacres, and we believed that the international community  could not accept genocide in 1994, because this was the real  issue.    We regretted the fact that we were the only ones to do so  at the beginning. I believe some countries, including African  countries, because this is the key, are joining us; I hope there  will be many more. We have been given the assurance that some  Senegalese will be able to take part in the operation tomorrow;  I hope that the Ghanaians will be able to do the same in a few  days. We hope the Africans themselves will be able to manage  this type of conflict, this type of crisis, themselves in the  future. It is first and foremost their responsibility. We do  not intend to replace them at all.    [Masure] Francois Leotard, a last question: Can you confirm  to the families of these French soldiers in Rwanda that they  will all be back home in two months and that whatever happens  they will hand over to the UNAMIR II at the end of July?    [Leotard] This is our intention. The prime minister  mentioned the end of July before the National Assembly: We are  going to do our utmost to respect this goal. The French, on the  whole--it is often the case, including politically....[pauses]  when French soldiers are involved, that there should be a  maximum of support and unanimity around them. This is a fair  mission, a difficult one, perhaps a risky one over the next  couple of days, and it is necessary for French opinion--I know  that this is the case-- but for politicians, among others, to  avoid criticism and opposition. These are the soldiers of  France and, in an operation that is desired by many of those who  are threatened, is supported and desired by the government, even  if we are a bit lonely. We are sticking together and closing  ranks, and we try to support our soldiers. I believe this is the  least we can do.    [Masure] Thank you.</p>

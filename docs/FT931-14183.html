			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Gulf states uneasy over attacks: US deploys battery of Patriot missiles in Kuwait THE US deployed Patriot missiles in Kuwait yesterday as the Kuwaiti foreign minister sought to underline that his country's quarrel lay not with the Iraqi people but with President Saddam Hussein's non-compliance with United Nations resolutions. The remarks appeared to be designed to address creeping unease among Gulf states over the latest allied raids on Iraq. Sheikh Salem al-Sabah al-Salem said his government would 'not feel happy' if the allies deemed it necessary to launch further attacks on Iraq, adding: 'Who is hurt? Not Saddam Hussein. It is the people who are hurt.' Sheikh Salem's comments follow expressions of disquiet from other Arab leaders, put most vocally by King Hussein of Jordan, over the wisdom of persuading Iraq to comply with the UN essentially through military means. There have also been some murmurings within Kuwait, mostly among Islamic groups, that the country's unalloyed support for the allied raids may isolate Kuwait within the Arab world. Signs of unease over the latest raids have also begun to surface within the Gulf itself, where staunchly anti-Saddam sentiment has lately been tempered both by fears over the strategic consequences of a possible dismemberment of Iraq and by concern over the plight of the Iraqi people. Gulf newspapers have increasingly pointed up the apparent 'double standards' applied by the west in its application of UN resolutions in Iraq and, in particular, in Israel. A statement from Saudi Arabia, where more than 90 allied aircraft are based, called this week for 'the need to implement all security council resolutions in general, whether on the situation in the Gulf, the Palestinian cause and the issue of the deportees. Sheikh Salem said yesterday the missiles were expected to be fully operational today. Their arrival will, in the view of military analysts, do more for Kuwait's psychological well-being than its actual defence. Iraq may still possess serviceable Scud missiles but western officials believe it would only be capable of launching isolated attacks. Nevertheless, Kuwaiti officials yesterday repeated their desire to bolster their defences, already augmented by the arrival last week of a US brigade, with reinforcements from Britain, France and other allies. Kuwait's national assembly yesterday approved a law designed to increase the monitoring of the Gulf state's overseas investments and to toughen punishment for individuals accused of misusing public funds.</p>

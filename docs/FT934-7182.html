			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (12): Gifts for the county set - Jonathan Young's presents for the huntin', shootin', fishin' fraternity COUNTRY people are a tough lot. Ask them to drive a three-ton horse-box, round up a dozen loose bullocks or help with a difficult lambing and they will volunteer without blinking. Shopping, and city traffic, is another matter. Most blanch at the very thought. Fortunately, there is no need for soulless pavement-pounding. Country sportsmen have an excellent choice of kit, most of which is available through mail-order. This is just as well, because those who hunt, shoot or fish, need kit - acres of it. Enough to fill tack-rooms, gun-rooms and rod-rooms. Hand-made riding boots are the ultimate present for anyone horsy but bought from London's West End they cost the equivalent of a half-decent racehorse. Dennis Davies from Gwent will make a hand-made, fitted pair for just Pounds 420 (tel: 0495-313045). Alternatively, ring Calcutt's, which specialises in quality second-hand riding kit (0962-760210). The company has a wide range of butcher and top-boots, starting from Pounds 120 and Pounds 200, as well as red and black hunting coats, breeches and silk toppers for those who hanker to cut a dash at the Boxing Day meet. A rash of 'Cobber clobber' followed in the steps of the hit film Crocodile Dundee, and the Australian stockman's waxproof coat has become ubiquitous. Far more stylish are the traditional rubberised fawn riding mackintoshes, Pounds 145 from Exeter Saddlers, 0392-71141). However, for all aspiring Perditas and Ruperts, nothing can match polo's glamour. A string of polo ponies may be an over-ambitious Christmas gift - unless your beloved is in the Kerry Packer league - but you can start stick-and-balling at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club for just Pounds 52 for a lesson (0344-890060). Ask a fisherman why he spends hundreds on his annual Scottish salmon lottery (sorry, holiday) and he will smilingly reply that there is more to fishing than catching fish. What he will not admit is that all fishermen are tackle junkies. Farlow's of Pall Mall (071-839-2423) is their London Mecca, stocking everything from exquisite gold fly-reel cuff links (Pounds 450) to monstrous steel reels for 1,000lb marlin (Pounds 475). But beware. Rods and reels are highly personal and it is easy to gaff. Orvis UK (0264-781212) stocks an intriguing selection of fishing accessories, from soft leather salmon fly wallets (Pounds 18) to a leaded staghorn priest for administering the last rites (Pounds 12). Their clothing range is equally extensive, with a set of silk longjohns and vest at Pounds 56. More peculiar, but fun, are the 'Wet Gun Dog' after-shave (Pounds 12.50) and the magnificent Cracker Thrower 'which propels two Ritz crackers at amazing speeds, providing a fabulous challenge for even the best shot' (Pounds 18). It is hard to find many other cheaper items for keen shots. Shooting kit is restricted, but expensive. Those who are still smarting after Lloyd's insurance losses might jib at the Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 35,000 now asked for a Purdey or Holland &amp; Holland shotgun, though they are the best that money can buy. For those who were in a bad syndicate the hand-knitted shooting stockings with the knitted legend 'Damn Lloyd's' might bring some comfort at Pounds 27.50, from Almost Unwearoutable Socks, 04346-32283. A similar pair, emblazoned 'Bang] Bang]' on one leg and 'Bugger]' on the other, might persuade the recipient to seek a series of shooting lessons. Holland &amp; Holland and the Royal Berkshire run courses of six one-hour lessons for Pounds 275 and Pounds 250 respectively. It is generally bad form to look anything other than drab at a shoot, the only exception being the hat. The old school still swear by Lock's, though there is strong minority following for Herbert Johnson's and Bates, all of St James's, London. Whichever is favoured, always buy one two sizes too large - it will fit perfectly after the first downpour. Hats for women are more tricky. Unless you want to look like a stable lad ignore caps and buy a proper weather-proof hat which is warm and, most important, keeps your face covered. (A beaming visage has ruined more grouse drives than the average eagle.) Lock's has brought out a new ladies' range which the company will trim with feathers from your own pheasant (Pounds 100). These are gorgeous enough for Ascot but pretty bright for the field. Stylish and more subdued are the ladies' deer-stalkers from the Asprey Gun Room (Pounds 39, 071-493 6767). The once-ubiquitous waxproof coat is still popular, but being rapidly replaced in all country sports by the new generation of Ventile and Gore-Tex jackets. Warm, waterproof and breathing, this new generation of outdoor coats include the no-nonsense Barbour Ventile (Pounds 295) and Musto Highland (Pounds 270). Both will survive practically anything  - even massed labradors in the shoot trailer - and are machine-washable. The real hit in the shooting world, however, is the new generation of Gore-Tex-lined tweed shooting jackets. Walter Norton &amp; Sons of Savile Row produces a splendid affair for Pounds 495 off the peg or Pounds 680 bespoke (071-437 0829). If you cannot travel to London, Charles Gale will measure you at home or at the office; his bespoke waterproof tweed jacket, cuffs trimmed with leather, is Pounds 395 (0329-237698). All country people are obsessed with boots. Green wellies are an endangered species, except on Fulham Road. Real credibility is conveyed by black, steel-toed milking-parlour gum boots, preferably composed from different pairs. Far warmer, though, are the leather-lined Chameau gum boots, which are seen on all the best ploughs, even though they cost Pounds 107 a pair. The High Church old school eschews even these and sticks to iron-shod hill shoes from Hogg's of Fife (0337-860202) - just Pounds 80, but you could expect them to survive you. No matter how wrapped up, clothing alone will not warm the inner spirit. William Powell (021-643 0689) stocks a prodigious array of hipflasks. The 8oz stainless steel flask is excellent value at Pounds 15.95 but for the steadfast sloe-ginners the 15oz solid silver version is a must (Pounds 625). Powell also sells sets of four nesting stainless beakers, in a leather case, for Pounds 21.95. Sporting households tend to be manic, only gathering for Christmas Day, the one occasion in the year when no one hunts, shoots or fishes. On Boxing Day they will scatter, but hopefully carrying something lasting to remember you by - other than a hangover. Jonathan Young is editor of The Field.</p>

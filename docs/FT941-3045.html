			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Suffering the politics of drought: Corruption and Kenya's worsening famine The worst drought in a decade is extending its grip on Kenya. The government says 5m people - one-fifth of the population - are in need of emergency food handouts. Maasai herdsmen in the Great Rift Valley have lost 250,000 head of cattle, and in the densely populated Eastern Province the failure of the December rains has wiped out half the staple maize crop. If the rains that are due to start this month fail again, 'a rapid deterioration will result and famine relief may be required,' warns a cable from a western embassy in Nairobi. The drought comes at a delicate time for President Daniel arap Moi, who recently abolished the government's maize trading monopoly at the insistence of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Until October it was illegal for private traders to import maize into Kenya; until December it was illegal to move it around the country. Price controls were lifted only three months ago. The private sector, however, does not yet have the ability to import the vast quantities of maize needed this year. About 1.7m tonnes, or just over half the national maize consumption, will have to be met by a combination of commercial imports, government purchases and food donations. The government recently hauled in private grain traders to berate them for the paltry level of commercial imports. The traders retorted they did not have enough market information with which to act. How many tonnes were earmarked for free distribution? How many tonnes remained in the stocks of the National Cereals and Produce Board, the former state monopoly? Under what conditions would these stocks be released on to the market? Western donors complain that the NCPB treats its maize stocks as a state secret. This is not surprising, since the manipulation of stock levels feeds a complex web of corruption which marketing reforms cannot fully eliminate. A confidential study being circulated among embassies in Nairobi describes in detail the 40 most common scams in NCPB grain depots and concludes: 'An analysis of routine practices at a typical maize depot shows more than 60 per cent of the purchase value of all maize acquired by NCPB is lost due to corruption at the depot level alone.' Kenya's two biggest food donors - Usaid and the European Union - are urging the government to use NCPB's stocks to meet the current food emergency. But the government clearly expects the donors to cover the shortfall. 'There is a subtle kind of blackmail going on,' complains one ambassador in Nairobi. 'If donors do not pledge the food aid being demanded by the government of Kenya, this could be used as an excuse to reverse the grain marketing reforms.' He fears too much food aid would allow the NCPB to sell its maize to urban consumers, pocket the proceeds and maintain the undesirable business practices donors want stamped out. Underlying this mistrust is the way food aid was commandeered for political ends in the last grain emergency in the run-up to Kenya's first multi-party elections in 1992. The United Nation's World Food Programme discovered that donated maize was frequently diverted to areas where the ruling Kanu party needed to drum up support. In other areas, food which was meant for free distribution was sold by local officials. This time round, WFP is organising its own transport to ensure there are no diversions en route. It has also set up school feeding programmes and appointed monitors to supervise the distribution of food aid in the local communities. It expects to distribute about 150,000 tonnes of maize until the next harvest in September. If there is another bad harvest, however, Kenya's dependence on food handouts will continue until 1995. The government, for its part, has set up a drought relief task force which is importing 200,000 tonnes of maize for free distribution. Mr Philip Mullei, a senior civil servant heading the Relief and Rehabilitation Department, is confident no-one will starve. High up in the Kipangot Hills, overlooking the Great Rift Valley, farmers and their dependants are waiting for relief food to arrive. Their crops have failed, cows have died, and many families have already eaten the seed grain earmarked for the next ploughing season. The politics of Kenya's modern rain gods have not been kind to these communities.</p>

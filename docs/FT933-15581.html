			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Policy for training jobless is attacked ORGANISATIONS training unemployed people are forced to pick the trainees who can be trained most quickly, rather than people who are more disadvantaged, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations claimed yesterday. The council represents organisations traditionally working with women; the disabled; the long-term unemployed, and those from ethnic minorities. It said Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) were buying fewer places from voluntary training organisations, and providers were being forced to be more selective. Its conclusions are based on a survey of training providers contracting with 52 of the 82 Tecs, which receive more than Pounds 2bn a year to administer government training programmes. Tecs have been given tougher targets by the government, which is increasingly paying for 'outputs', such as National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). Tecs in turn put more pressure on providers to achieve qualifications. The survey also shows: A 16 per cent cut in funding voluntary adult training providers - which provide about 15 per cent of all training places for adults. An 11.5 per cent reduction in money spent on each young person in training. A 12 per cent rise in funding to providers of Youth Training to tackle waiting lists. The government guarantees a YT place to any 16 to 19-year-old who wants one. Mr Martin Ayton, NCVO policy and campaigns officer, said: 'The pressure is on to select those who can be trained quickly and cheaply, whilst having to turn away those who need the most.' Employers are moving away from recruiting 16 to 19-year-olds and taking on fewer, more qualified and older school-leavers, a report for the employment department says today.</p>

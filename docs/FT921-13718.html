			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Neste restructures Dollars 400m 10-year loan NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil company, has been forced to restructure its Dollars 400m 10-year syndicated loan and offer more attractive fees to lenders, after its original deal was cold-shouldered by the syndicated loans market. The deal - a project finance facility for Neste Petroleum, Neste's wholly owned Norwegian subsidiary - has attracted only Dollars 150m from banks since its launch at the end of November. Chase Investment Bank and Citicorp Investment Bank are relaunching the deal with the following changes: An agreement from Neste, the parent company, to provide a completion undertaking, ensuring the company has sufficient funds to cover any calls for cash on the two oil projects concerned. The money is intended to finance the development of the Brage and Heidrun oil fields. The definition of completion now includes both oil fields and not just Brage. The banks will be provided with an independent report on the oil reserves within 12 months, an amendment intended to dispel doubts about the figures originally provided. Front-end fees have been increased while the margin over the London interbank offered rate (Libor) and the commitment fees are unchanged. Front-end fees have been raised from 20 basis points to 32.5 basis points on Dollars 35m, from 15 basis points to 22.5 basis points on Dollars 25m and from 10 basis points to 15 basis points on Dollars 15m. The margin is between 60 basis points and 102.5 basis points over Libor, depending on coverage ratios, while the commitment fees range from 22.5 basis points to 27.5 basis points. The oil and energy sector was the source of several deals recently in the syndicated loans market. The latest deal is a Pounds 375m loan for Keadby Power. The mandate for the 17 3/4 -year loan has been won by UBS and NatWest. The margin is 120 basis points over Libor during the construction period and between 110-115 basis points over Libor thereafter. Elsewhere, Chase has completed a seven-year, FFr227.5m financing for an Italian borrower - Societa Italiana Per Il Traforo Del Monte Bianco, the Italian company with a concession for developing the motorway linking Val D'Aosta with the Mont Blanc tunnel. Autostrade, the Italian motorway operator, owns 51 per cent of the company and is guaranteeing the entire loan. Italian state-controlled borrowers have been largely out of favour since the Federconsorzi scandal last summer. Many international bankers had regarded Federconsorzi, the financially troubled farm services co-operative, as carrying a state guarantee and were furious when the Italian authorities and public-sector banks refused to compensate foreign lenders. But, Chase claims the Mont Blanc deal was 'comfortably oversubscribed' and the proceeds were swapped into lire to provide more advantageous terms for the borrower. The deal carries a margin of 52.5 basis points over Libor and fees of up to 20 basis points for participations of FFr40m, and of 15 basis points on participations of FFr20m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     EUROMARKET TURNOVER (Dollars m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Primary Market         Secondary Market                       US Dollars   Non-Dollars   US Dollars Non-Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fixed income bonds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euros straight           1,256.2     2,217.4      22,973.0    62,990.9 Other straight               0.0     1,196.2       1,316.1   120,424.3 Convertible                  0.0         0.0       1,156.9     1,343.8 Money market instr FRN                        315.0       342.3       6,503.0     3,957.6 CD's                       315.5        91.9       1,312.7       575.2 Short Dollars MT Notes  14,216.9     6,067.1       7,987.8    12,943.7 Warrants                     0.0         0.0         872.0       299.9 Equities                     7.2         0.0         220.7     1,147.5 Total                   16,110.8     9,914.9      42,342.2   203,682.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Cedel      Euroclear      Total  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US Dollars                21,654.4       36,798.6   58,453.0 Other                     69,358.6      144,239.2  213,597.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week to January 16 1992 The Warrants and Equities figures are from Euroclear only  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source ISMA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

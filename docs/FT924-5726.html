			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Dawson Intl dips to Pounds 15.5m: Clothing group sounds cautious note on trading outlook DAWSON International, one of Britain's biggest clothing manufacturers, yesterday sounded a cautious note over the trading outlook as it reported a 4 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 16.2m to Pounds 15.5m. Mr Ronald Miller, chairman, said: 'I see no easing of recessionary pressures, which have adversely impacted the half year. Although in time there should be benefits from lower interest rates and more favourable foreign exchange rates in the UK, these have to be set against an international background with more countries experiencing the effects of recession.' Turnover in the six months to September 30 fell from Pounds 217m to Pounds 211m. The profits figure was depressed by a write-down of Pounds 1m on the Pringle factory in Dumfries, which has been closed with the loss of 205 jobs. The premier brands division raised operating profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 9.8m. The group said that against a background of lower cashmere prices, its Joseph Dawson subsidiary was particularly strong. Todd &amp; Duncan was also positioned to benefit from the better cashmere market and Laidlaw &amp; Fairgrieve had increased volumes in both lambswool and shetland yarns. Sales of international apparel responded well, despite the difficult trading environment. Ballantyne Cashmere experienced better trading and Pringle of Scotland increased turnover. The consumer products division experienced a difficult time, particularly in the US, with operating profit down Pounds 4m to Pounds 8.5m. Sales of West Knitting fleecewear fell as retailers cut stocks. In the US, the JE Morgan heavyweight underwear business continued to perform well, in spite of slower ordering by retailers. Sales of lightweight underwear were lower, but margins improved because of better operating efficiencies. Earnings per share were 6.5p (6.4p). The interim dividend is held at 2.9p. COMMENT Currency movements have crucial significance for a group which makes about 50 per cent of its sales in the US, exports 25 per cent to Europe and Japan and reckons that about a third of the remaining UK business is tourist-related. These results would have been Pounds 400,000 higher if the dollar had remained at last year's levels. However, the pound's devaluation should spell good news for the group in the longer term. Full-year profits are forecast to reach Pounds 33m, which would put the shares, down 3p to 224p, on a prospective multiple of about 18. That already anticipates a profits recovery, which may be delayed by the gloomy international outlook.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALLERY OPENING BENEFITS L.A. ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS  </P> <P> Studio Leonardogavinci, an art gallery in the mid-Wilshire area, is owned by  artists Leonardo Chalupowicz and Gavin Dillard, who also go under the name  Leonardogavinci. And, in their spare time, these Leonardogavincis are also  animal-rights activists. Last Thursday evening they turned over their gallery  to 11 artists who, in various media, celebrated their relationships with other  species.  </P> <P> Among the "other species" present were Rio, a 10-foot Burmese python, who was  the life of the "Animal Rites" benefit opening. Rio knows about partying. Rio,  it seems, has appeared in the pornographic movie "Stryker Force." Dillard, the  python's owner, said that Rio would be continuing his career. Rio also appeared  in the October, 1988, issue of Playgirl magazine.  </P> <P> Rio, like many big stars, just hung around, seemingly indifferent to the  relentless attentions of the crowd at the Studio Leonardogavinci. When it came  time, however, for a photograph to be taken, Rio, like many stars, came to  attention and was suddenly animated and friendly. He flirted with artist Rachel  Rosenthal, who, later in the evening, performed a piece entitled "Zatoichi,"  the story of her elderly poodle who refused to die -- but eventually did.  Rosenthal was not joined by her pet rat, Tatti Wattles, who often accompanied  her during performances. Yes, T.W. has passed on also.  </P> <P> Animal-rights consciousness expressed itself in many forms during the unusual  event. Furniture designers Jeff Goodman and Stephen Charlton were sorry they  hadn't brought their white toy poodle, who, they felt, has a right to get out  more often. "She would've loved that snake," said Charlton, "and she always  likes tragic stories about other poodles."  </P> <P> Art collector Karen Barone expressed her concern for animal rights by wearing a  Mylar snakeskin bathing suit. "I prefer the Mylar and gold foil variety of  snake," said Barone. Rio, nearby, seemed nonplused.  </P> <P> The proceeds from the exhibit were donated to a host of animal-rights  organizations, including the Humane Society, Greenpeace and People for the  Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), whose executive director, Kim Stallwood,  had flown in from Washington, D.C. for the event. Stallwood announced at  approximately 9:30 p.m. that "fur was dead." As a fashion statement, that is.  </P> <P> Animal activist Chantal Cloutier, whose agency represents top stylists, make-up  artists and hairdressers, remarked that "it is no longer fashionable to wear  fur. Fun fur won't even be fashionable soon." Cloutier will not even accept  bookings that include fur. "One of my artists has to take his fur bookings at  home. I won't get involved in it," Cloutier insisted. Cloutier works closely  with PETA and Stallwood and was involved in the recently successful campaign  against the cosmetic companies to stop using animals in product research.  </P> <P> Brandon Labelle, the brother of animal-rights activist artist Charles Labelle,  brought three tiny kittens to the opening, hoping they would be adopted. They  were picked up for inspection immediately. Several potential adoptive parents  were not quite sure they were ready for yet another cat. Rio, hanging around  nearby, expressed his concern for the kittens' fortunes by flicking his forked  tongue hungrily.  </P></p>

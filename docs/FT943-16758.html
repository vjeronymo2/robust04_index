			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector bid move fails The death throes of the Enterprise bid for Lasmo saw the market get wind of the failure of the often acrimonious bid battle and stimulated the Stock Exchange into declaring prices for the two stocks as 'indicative only' - meaning that those on the screen are not firm for trading. At the close of a tense trading session Lasmo shares slipped back from a day's high point of 138p to close a net 1 1/2 higher at 136p, while Enterprise advanced rapidly late in the session, as the bid hopes faded, to close 9 1/2 higher at 398 1/2 p. Analysts said Enterprise's failure would be viewed by the market as a vote of no confidence in the Enterprise management. 'The shares may go up in the short term but that will represent relief that there will not be the much feared 'cascade' of Enterprise paper if the bid had gone through. The shares will also be buoyed by the latest upsurge in oil prices,' said one leading oil analyst. He also felt that Lasmo shares would improve on the oil price factor. 'The 10 per cent stock overhang, a legacy of Enterprise's failure, will obviously be a significant restraining factor,' he said. The failure of the Enterprise bid spilled over into the merchant banks sector where SG Warburg, which represented Enterprise in the battle, fell back in late trading to close 5 off at 684p.</p>

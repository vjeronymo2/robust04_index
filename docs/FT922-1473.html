			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (11): Rivalry a thorn in side of progress - Joint Ventures THE WORLD recession has meant hard times for the computer industry. But it has also precipitated rationalisation and consolidation that was long overdue. Rival companies merged, jobs were cut and an unprecedented round of co-operation swept through the industry. Research and development is another area which has seen some surprising alliances. The best-known joint venture of this type was announced by IBM and Apple in the summer of 1991 when the two companies agreed to pool research and development to create a new generation of workstation computers. Under the name Taligent, the joint venture company has brought together staff and expertise from IBM and Apple to develop both the hardware and software for the new computer. IBM contributes its long experience of reduced-instruction set computer (Risc) technology and Apple brings its advanced operating system software, based on 'object-oriented' principles. The combination of high-performance hardware and the new wave of object-oriented software, which is easier to use and less costly to develop and maintain, promises to give IBM and Apple a formidable product. The IBM/Apple joint venture is the tip of a huge iceberg. Both companies have numerous agreements with and investments in other suppliers. Earlier this year, IBM took a Dollars 100m in French hardware manufacturer Groupe Bull. Part of the agreement allows Bull to use the same Risc hardware technology to be used by Taligent. IBM also has a portfolio of joint venture agreements with software developers under the umbrella of its Application Development (AD)/Cycle, IBM's strategy for computer-aided systems engineering (Case) development. Apple, too, has joint ventures with many software companies and, increasingly, with hardware companies. In addition to its agreement with IBM, Apple has a distribution agreement with DEC. IBM and Apple are not the only ones with joint venture fever. The trend towards open systems, where different manufacturers computers are expected to work together, has spawned numerous industry groupings which aim to promote specific versions of standards. Although these organisations are not joint ventures, they are examples of industry co-operation on a scale which would have been impossible a few years ago. They are jointly financed by their members and the technology standards they produce are widely adopted. The Open Software Foundation (OSF), sponsored by IBM, DEC and Hewlett Packard among others, has produced a specification called the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). This lays down rules for the way software works in distributed computer networks based on the Unix operating system. It means that a customer who buys Unix systems from a company that conforms to the OSF/DCE standard, can be assured that the systems from other supporters of the standard will also work in the same network. Unix International (UI), a rival open systems group sponsored by AT&amp;T, Sun Microsystems and others, has produced another specification for distributed open systems called Atlas. Although Atlas is distinct from Unix , it is based on Unix and incorporates some of the OSF/DCE specifications which has led to some confusion. Not all joint venture groups of this type are successful and it is an indication of the persistent rivalry in the computer industry that one of the most publicised of these came to grief recently. The Advanced Computing Environment (ACE) group, launched in April 1991 with a deluge of publicity, aimed to create a specification for a new wave of co-operative computing based on an evolution from current industry standards. At the hardware level, ACE embraced the Intel microprocessor chip  -which is at the heart of most personal computers  - and a Risc microprocessor from US chip builder MIPS Computer. ACE also specified two operating systems which would be the foundation for applications software for the computers using the Intel and MIPS chips. One is a version of Unix from the US software company Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). The other is a development of the popular Windows software from Microsoft - Windows New Technology (NT). The supporters of ACE agreed to base their future product lines on a combination of these four elements, aiming to evolve a new range of computers from different manufacturers which could use the same applications software. In spite of broad support across the industry, the ACE initiative faltered earlier this year when the financially-troubled MIPS Computer was taken over by the US graphics workstation builder Silicon Graphics - a move which put a question mark over MIPS Computer's role as an independent supplier. Shortly afterwards Compaq, one of the key sponsors of ACE, withdrew and SCO announced that it was shelving development of its version of Unix for ACE. Although the venture is not dead, it is unlikely to have any great influence in the future and many of ACE's original sponsors have re-directed their efforts. Microsoft recently signed an agreement to develop Windows NT for DEC's computers and Bull, which was using the MIPS Risc chip, has defected to IBM and will use IBM Risc technology in its new computers. Joint ventures in the computer industry have become a pre-requisite for survival in the age of networks. But they are compromises at best and the inherent rivalry between computer companies - in hardware and software - is never far from the surface.</p>

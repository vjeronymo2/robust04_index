			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 24, BNS -- Finance Minister and  Liberal Democratic Party [ELDP] member Heiki Kranich declared in  a statement released yesterday that he cannot continue as a  member of Prime Minister Mart Laar's Cabinet, today's issue of  the RAHVA HAAL newspaper writes.    Kranich affirmed that he is prepared to fulfill his  obligations until the Pro Patria congress. "If Mart Laar should  after that continue as prime minister, I find it impossible to  continue as Cabinet member," he stated.    Kranich blamed the premier for having repeatedly gone  against  the rules in signing state guarantees for loans. "The justice  chancellor has qualified his actions as violation of the  Constitution. As a result, monetary obligations binding on the  Republic of Estonia have been assumed," Kranich stated.    The finance minister noted that Laar, denying his  violations,  has taken steps to remove from the government the ministers who  pointed out his mistakes.    Culture and Education Minister Paul-Eerik Rummo, who is  also the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, told the  RAHVA HAAL yesterday he doesn't plan to leave the government in  the next few days.    The ELDP council and the Liberals faction in parliament  yesterday announced their decision to authorize Rummo and  Kranich to continue in the government pending the outcome of the  Pro Patria congress.    The ELDP also proposed that all ruling coalition parties  should get together to make up their minds about a candidate for  new prime minister as well as other possible Cabinet reshuffles.    The other ruling coalition members -- the Estonian Rural  Centrist Party, the Estonian National Independence Party and the  Estonian Social Democratic Party -- said last week that their  ministers will not leave the government. Pro Patria member,  Foreign Minister Juri Luik also told reporters yesterday he will  not be stepping down until the Pro Patria congress.    A meeting of the Pro Patria council yesterday decided that  election of new party chairman doesn't necessarily imply  nomination of new premier.    The Pro Patria congress is scheduled for June 11. On the top  of the agenda are election of new chairman for the party and the  situation in the government and the ruling coalition.    Laar said on Friday [20 May] he regards decisions of the  congress as binding for himself. "If Pro Patria elects a new  chairman, I'll resign," the premier promised.</p>

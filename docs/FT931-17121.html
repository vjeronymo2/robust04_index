			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Ministers were embarrassed by ICI battle: Cabinet papers for 1962 reveal takeover bid row IMPERIAL Chemical Industries' attempt to take over Courtaulds was the biggest and most fiercely fought takeover battle of its day and the Macmillan cabinet did not know how to handle it, according to cabinet papers which have been released under the 30-year rule. The aim was to rationalise the UK's synthetic fibres industry but Mr Frank Kearton, then deputy chairman of Courtaulds, strongly resisted the plan and a long series of secret negotiations broke down. The battle between Mr Kearton and Mr Paul Chambers of ICI fascinated the City, particularly when Courtaulds, having cut its interim dividend before the battle, proposed a dividend increase and distribution to shareholders of Pounds 40m in loan stock. The government was an embarrassed spectator of the bitter in-fighting, and the Labour opposition rejoiced in the daily revelations of jungle warfare in the City. Cabinet papers show the scale of the disagreement among ministers on whether to intervene. Some ministers urged intervention to prevent an ICI monopoly but a majority argued in favour of allowing the bid to run its course and for the Monopolies Commission to step in at a later stage if necessary. Mr Rab Butler, the home secretary, absented himself from the discussions as he had married into the Courtaulds family. Mr Frederick Erroll, president of the board of trade, publicly washed his hands of the affair. He told the Commons he had decided not to decide whether the merger would be in the national interest. Fortunately for Mr Erroll the battle ended on the expiry of ICI's time limit for Courtaulds shareholders, when only 37.4 per cent of Courtaulds ordinary stock had been acquired. Cabinet minutes show recognition that the dispute had crystallised growing public anxiety about the effect of big mergers on the national interest, and that ministers would be pressed to assume further powers to control these operations.</p>

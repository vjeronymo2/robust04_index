			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Elizabeth June 22 SAPA -- The new Eastern  Province [EP] Command -- incorporating the old SA [South  African] Defence Force and the armies of two liberation  movements and two former homelands -- will be based in Port  Elizabeth. EP command will comprise the African National  Congress' Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], Pan  Africanist Congress' Azanian Peoples Liberation Army and the  former Ciskei and Transkei Defence Forces.    The structure of the integrated force was outlined by Lt-Col  J M Swanepoel at a media briefing on Tuesday [21 June] night.  He said it had been decided early in the planning of  integration that the new EP Command would cover the former  Eastern Province and Border/Kei areas.     -  EP Command would be divided into five army districts:    -  Hantam Army District with its headquarters in Grahamstown;    -  Algoa Army District with headquarters in Port Elizabeth;    -  Border/Kei Army District with headquarters in East London;    -  East-Border Army District with headquarters in Queenstown;  and    -  Transkei Army District with its headquarters in Umtata.        EP Command commanding officer Brig Toon Slabbert said the  SANDF aimed to establish a strong core army, whose primary role  would be defence.    Secondary roles would be to preserve life and the health of  the population; to assist the police in maintaining order; to  provide essential services, especially in disaster areas; and to  support the nation's socio-economic upliftment.    The SANDF [South African National Defense Force] would use  the former SADF as the core around which to develop a strong  apolitical force with high standards and full-time and part-time  components.    Brig Slabbert said with the integration of the SADF, former  TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei] armies and  non-statutory forces, the SANDF could comprise about 130,000  soldiers.</p>

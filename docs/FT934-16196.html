			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Volvo defends merger VOLVO yesterday insisted that its merger agreement with Renault was the best deal available for its shareholders, Hugh Carnegy writes. Rejecting a call from Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders' association, for the deal to be blocked at a shareholders' meeting on November 9, Volvo said that the merger agreed last month had won widespread support. 'The board of Volvo, the board of Renault, the French government, the government of Sweden, all the trade unions in Sweden and all the leading politicians have said that this is a good deal and that it is important that it takes place,' a spokesman said. Aktiespararna, which represents about 10 per cent of Volvo's shareholders, faces an uphill battle to block the merger. With Renault holding more than 8 per cent of the Volvo parent and at least a further 15 per cent held by investment companies and institutions seen as being close to the company, it admits that many of the larger shareholders see no alternative to the merger. However, the association has taken heart from its successful campaign in 1977 to win support for its objections to a proposal to sell a 40 per cent share in Volvo to Norway in exchange for oil concessions. Volvo said the commitment of the French government to privatise Renault after the merger was not in doubt. The company admitted, however, that a detailed prospectus for shareholders, which Volvo will publish later this month, would not set a value 'on each and every part of the company'. However, a spokesman said the 35 per cent of the merged company to be held by Volvo would yield 'much better' returns than the truck and car operations would on their current basis. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, last night played down the risk of opposition from small shareholders to the proposed merger, Kevin Done adds. 'I have not seen much shareholder opposition so far,' he said. 'I have had very little negative comment. I trust that the majority of shareholders will see the case as the board does.' The deal was also the best protection against the erosion of Sweden's industrial base, Mr Gyllenhammar said.</p>

			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Delors names Dutch PM as 'right' successor MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday took the unusual step of naming the prime minister of the Netherlands, Mr Ruud Lubbers, as his preferred successor, two years before he is due to leave office. Speaking in a Dutch radio interview on Tuesday, Mr Lubbers' tenth anniversary in power, Mr Delors said that the Dutch prime minister would be 'the right person in the right place' to take over as Commission president. Only last summer, at the Lisbon summit, EC leaders agreed to re-appoint Mr Delors to a further two-year term which would expire at the end of 1994. Mr Lubbers has made clear that he does not want to make himself eligible for the Commission presidency until then. But Mr Delors' remarks aroused interest in Brussels because they come amid widespread reports that he is frustrated by his decline in influence since the Danes rejected the Maastricht treaty on closer European union. He is also said to be frustrated by the corresponding assault by several member states, including Britain, on the powers of the Commission. An EC official familiar with Mr Delors' thinking described the Commission president as 'feeling sore'. Another EC official said Mr Delors was upset that he had not been formally invited to give a presentation on the need for an EC-wide growth package at the up-coming Edinburgh summit. Mr Lubbers is a leading contender for Mr Delors' job. A few days ago, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would make a good Commission president. As a proven national leader, he would also be a credible defender of subsidiarity - devolving power from Brussels to the lowest appropriate level in the Community. Mr Delors said of Mr Lubbers yesterday: 'He is a true European, has fresh ideas, and is capable of innovation. He is willing to discuss matters and he can compromise between the Twelve, an essential quality for the success of the Community.' Mr Delors, who has headed the Commission since 1985, is best known for his successful campaign to introduce a single European market by the end of 1992.</p>

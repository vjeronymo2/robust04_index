			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Unaccustomed as I am to software . . . - Computing IF YOU have ever had to make a speech, write a report, or write an article you will know that it is not as easy as it first appears. The first three sentences of what you say are vital: in less than 20 seconds, your audience will either tune in to you or put their mind to some other thing. The other problem is to get those jewels of wisdom down on paper - and in the right order. A new software import from the US, a program called Thoughtline, can help to resolve both these dilemmas. I know that when I sit down to write I need all the help that new technology can give. Some computer programs can help in overcoming the problem of writers' block. In the past I have used many of them. In general, they take the form of outliners. With outliners you type in thoughts and ideas in any sequence and later reorder them to make the various connections. None is interactive like Thoughtline, nor does any of them go as far as organising your thoughts for you. Using the thoughts you type in, it asks questions to focus your ideas and then asks for elaboration of ideas it does not understand. Thoughtline's data base is built around a set of key words. When it encounters those words in your typing it generates a particular type of question. Thoughtline focuses your thinking. It probes at your idea. The program keeps asking questions; it prompts you to address the subject at hand. Thoughtline challenges the user to think more deeply about the topic. Thoughtline is a piece of software that helps develop your ideas. It helps you focus on the key points of the issue. It is different from other programs of its genre. The program organises ideas and generates new ways of addressing the idea - but it cannot solve other problems. Presented with the problem: 'What is the best way of marketing this product?' it appears to go round in circles. It cannot get to the point of asking you the correct questions for you to focus your ideas. Thoughtline is irritatingly friendly. But, then it is an American program. Opening with 'Buenos dias Robin. What's on your mind?' does not generate a great deal of confidence. Sometimes Thoughtline comes up with ludicrous questions. You can pass over these questions without answering them. At other times it is merely the syntax of the question that is wrong. But, I am interested more in its ability to solve problems rather its syntactical deficiencies. In a broad sense it is using the fledgling principles of artificial intelligence. An article has a different fundamental structure than a report or speech, but the program organises what you have typed into a draft for each situation and generates a printed copy that is reasonably well laid out. In its own particular way, it does overcome problems of writing articles, speeches and reports. The program's manual proclaims 'Thoughtline - For Great First Drafts' and that is what it gives you. Although it could not be easier to use, it takes time before you are able to get the best out of it. A little perseverance goes a long way. Thoughtline is available from CABC, PO Box 162, Newbury, Berks. Tel: 0635-255300, Fax: 0635255148. The price is Pounds 83 + VAT.</p>

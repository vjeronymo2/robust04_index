			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bioplan calls for Pounds 23m to complete three hospitals BIOPLAN Holdings, the USM-quoted healthcare company, has launched a Pounds 22.8m rights issue to reduce debt and complete three hospitals. The 2-for-1 issue of 296.2m shares at 8p each, 2p less than yesterday's close, comes just over a year after Bioplan joined the USM, via a reverse takeover of Cooks Industries accompanied by a Pounds 14.3m rights issue. Mr Peter Townsend, chairman and newly-appointed chief executive, said the three new hospitals would bring the total spent in three year to Pounds 42m. All 11 hospitals operate in partnership with the National Health Service. Debt at the March year-end was Pounds 17m, giving gearing of more than 80 per cent. After the issue, fully underwritten by Smith New Court, debt would be wiped out. Pre-tax profit for the 15 months to March 31 increased to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 370,000 in 12 months) on turnover of Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 4.9m). Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.77p (losses 0.73p). The healthcare side made a Pounds 2.5m operating profit, while office furniture - a Cooks remnant that is about to be sold to management - lost Pounds 200,000. Interest costs were Pounds 720,000 (Pounds 40,000). The write-down of an investment and provisions against Cooks businesses incurred extraordinary charges of Pounds 750,000. After resumed dividend payments - the final is 0.1p - the retained loss was Pounds 550,000 (loss of Pounds 2.4m).</p>

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / EU 'should help draw in central European states' The European Union should set up new structures to help integrate central Europe and to circumvent vested interests which could prevent these nations joining the Union for at least two decades. This is the conclusion of a report for the European Commission published today by Richard Baldwin of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the independent think-tank. Mr Baldwin says present arrangements consist of bilateral Association Agreements, which link the central Europeans separately to the EU. These allow limited access to the EU market, but do nothing to promote intra-central European trade and inhibit investment in the region. Beyond the Association Agreements lies the far horizon of EU membership, promised for an unspecified future at last year's Copenhagen summit of Union heads of government. But in between, Mr Baldwin said 'there is nothing to get us from here to there.' He argues that two concentric circles should be built around the EU core gradually to integrate central Europe. The outer circle would include all central Europe and provide a duty-free zone for industrial products. Any liberalisation in one member would have to extend to all others, promoting trade on a pan-European basis. Mr Baldwin says this move would make trade policy more predictable and entice investors. A second circle, an Organisation for European Integration, closer to the EU for front-runners like Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics and possibly Slovenia, would spread the single market to the region. Free movement of labour would be excluded but any central European country could move into this circle as soon as it was ready. Although Germany, due to take over the EU presidency in July, is expected to push for Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics to join by 2000, Mr Baldwin believes this will be resisted. He estimates the cost of their entry in 2000 in farm and regional subsidies would be a net Ecu58bn (Dollars 65bn) and that these four countries would need to grow at 6 per cent a year for two decades to reach 75 per cent of average EU income. Mr Baldwin notes that EU farmers and poor regions would fight entry, richer member states will baulk at the implied 60 per cent increase in their conributions to the Union budget, and small EU members will resist dilution of their powers in the inevitable reform of EU voting rules which would follow. The need to broaden the current structure has already established itself in the Commission's current review of central Europe policy. But Mr Baldwin's analysis underplays the extent to which security concerns could propel faster integration of central Europe. Equally, his consideration of integration costs ignores the fact that the bulk of current regional aid to poor EU member states flows back to the richer countries as construction contracts and equipment supplies.

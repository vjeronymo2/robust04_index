			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Leading Article: View from the Bundesbank On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve decided to increase its short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. In a revealing response, the Bundesbank decided yesterday to do nothing. The performance of the German economy is likely to persuade the Bundesbank to continue to do nothing for some time ahead. This does not mean that a justification for lower German interest rates could not be found. It means rather that the Bundesbank would have to look quite hard for one, something it is not inclined to do. One reason for doing little now is that so much has already been done. On Wednesday, interest rates on three-month, Euro-currency, D-Mark securities, at 4.875 per cent, were identical to those on comparable US dollar securities. Less than two years ago, however, that gap was as much as 6.6 percentage points in favour of the D-Mark. The Bundesbank may well feel chary about acting to bring German short-term interest rates much below US levels, even though the German recovery is far weaker and at a much earlier stage than that of the US. One reason is that it tends to be more concerned about currency weakness than its US counterparts, a concern enhanced by the role of foreign investors in financing the public sector. Still more important is domestic economic performance. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, recently said that economic growth could reach 2.5 per cent this year. This would be well above the 1.5 per cent he forecast for the German economy at the beginning of this year. Since that forecast was widely derided at the time, Mr Rexrodt must feel entitled to gloat, particularly since many German economists agree that growth could exceed 2 per cent this year. Though not as outspokenly enthusiastic as Mr Rexrodt, the Bundesbank has noted in its latest monthly report that west German industrial production rose 3 per cent in the second quarter, while manufacturing capacity utilisation was at levels last seen in the autumn of 1992. What need is there for a further boost, the Bundesbank will ask itself, particularly when the effects of the past two years of monetary easing cannot yet have worked their way through the economy? Furthermore, while annual consumer price inflation has fallen below 3 per cent, for the first time for more than three years, this is hardly good enough for the Bundesbank, particularly when many of its European partners are doing better still. All that can be said of the monetary data is that they are beginning to look less of a constraint. The gamble that lower short-term interest rates would shift bank deposits out of the more liquid ones, included in the Bundesbank's target M3, is paying off. Not only is the estimate for the annualised rate of M3 growth between the last quarter of last year and July 1994 9.9 per cent (down from 11.4 per cent in June), but its level has stagnated since April. Yet private sector borrowing is also growing apace. Nothing in these data demands early monetary easing. The Bundesbank's natural conclusion is that this is a time for masterly inactivity. That is probably the right conclusion, too.</p>

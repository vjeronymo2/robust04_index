			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Senator tells Bush to act on anxieties over Nafta SENATOR Max Baucus, Senate trade sub-committee chairman, yesterday warned the Bush administration, previewing the Congress debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement, to answer labour and environmentalists' concerns with action, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. With negotiators still working on Nafta in Washington yesterday, he said the administration's record on the environment was such that Congress would insist the pact contain: protection for US environmental laws, with pledges they would not be weakened; a funding mechanism for environmental enforcement on the US side of the border, estimated to cost Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m); enforcement of Mexico's own environmental laws. 'In recent weeks, the administration has raised the spectre of protectionists in environmental clothing. Though I understand that concern, I am far more concerned with the possibility of polluters in free trade clothing.' He was challenged by Mr William Riley, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency. The Nafta, he said, would be 'the greenest international trade treaty yet seen,' setting a model for future trade pacts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elisa Wasch on statements by UN and EU mediators </F> Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord David Owen in Vienna on 5 January;  statements are in English with superimposed German translation  -- recorded]    [Text] [Wasch] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Silajdzic  and Croatian Foreign Minister Granic assessed yesterday's talks  in Vienna positively. They agreed to the return of the Muslims  driven away from Mostar by the Croats. But the tough problems  -- the controversial territorial issues -- will be discussed  today. UN mediator Stoltenberg and European Union [EU] mediator  Lord Owen commented on the negotiations this morning after a  meeting with Austria's Foreign Minister Mock.    Before today's talks, hopes for a peaceful solution for  Bosnia were very slim. In fact, both the Croatian and the  Bosnian representatives described yesterday's talks as  constructive, but a solution has been in sight too often in the  past before the talks eventually failed. But UN mediator  Thorvald Stoltenberg assessed today's talks positively.    [Stoltenberg] Well, I am always optimistic. If I were not  optimistic, I could not survive in this job.    [Wasch] His partner in the marathon talks, EU negotiator  Lord Owen, is commenting on the negotiations of the warring  parties with increasingly sharp words.    [Owen] I am afraid we have to tell you that there is a big  difference between the decisions adopted during negotiations and  the actual situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The fighting is  continuing there. The Muslims are continuing to send troops to  central Bosnia, and the Croats are continuing to send troops to  Herceg-Bosna. Unfortunately, we see no signs of an end to the  war. Quite the contrary; the Muslims are trying to capture more  villages in central Bosnia -- Busovaca and Vitez, for example.    [Wasch] Yesterday the delegations from Zagreb and Sarajevo  agreed to organize the return of refugees who left Mostar. The  Muslims driven away from there should be allowed to return.  Yet, according to Lord Owen, this is only wishful thinking  because there is war in Mostar, the Croatian [as heard] capital  of Herzegovina.    [Owen] I cannot see how on earth you can possibly hope to  get people back to Mostar if the war continues there, even  though there may be sporadic cease-fires.    [Wasch] Only if Mostar is placed under EU control, as  planned, would the repatriation program stand a chance, Owen  stated. Territorial issues will be discussed at today's talks in  Vienna. Access to the Adriatic Sea for the Muslims and a  cease-fire for embattled central Bosnia will be the major  topics. It would be a miracle if agreement were achieved on  these issues, and if it were implemented. Negotiations are  scheduled to end at noon.</p>

Telephone: (202) 205&hyph;5539. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Department has recovered $627,778 from the New Jersey Department of Labor, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation Services, in response to a claim arising from an audit conducted by the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG). The audit covered Federal fiscal years (FYs) 1989, 1990, and 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The claim involved the State agency's administration of The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program under Title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The final audit determination of the Regional Commissioner, which was issued on August 19, 1992, found that during FYs 1989, 1990, and 1991 the State agency had violated the regulatory requirements in 34 CFR 361.44, including its assurance in section 8.9 of the approved State Plan, concerning the procedures for authorizing client services. The OIG found instances in which the agency charged to one Federal fiscal year the costs of client services that had been initiated or completed in the prior Federal fiscal year by deferring the issuance of the agency's authorization form. As a result of these violations, the State agency had charged expenditures to the wrong Federal fiscal years, thereby failing to preserve the integrity of Federal accountability requirements. The final determination sought the recovery of $2,176,802 from the State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State agency appealed the Regional Commissioner's determination to the Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) (Application of the State of New Jersey Department of Labor: Docket No. 92&hyph;103&hyph;R) on September 21, 1992. In a Joint Notice of Reduction of Claim and Motion to Dismiss, filed with the OALJ on February 11, 1993, both parties agreed that, based upon an analysis of all the evidence in the case, the amount of the disallowance should be reduced to $627,778. The notice also certified that the State agency had returned the $627,778 to the Department on January 22, 1993. On February 18, 1993, the OALJ dismissed the case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New Jersey DOL/DVRS has submitted a request for a grantback of $470,833 (75 percent) of the $627,778 recovered by the Department of Education. In its request, DOL/DVRS provided documentation of the actions taken to correct the practices of the State agency that resulted in the final audit determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following the audit, the State agency issued a new policy directive to field staff on the procedures for authorizing and approving client services. The purpose of the new directive was to prevent charging case service expenditures to the wrong Federal fiscal years. A subsequent site review of the State agency by the Department resulted in the agency strengthening further its policies governing the procedures for case service authorizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> B. Authority for Awarding a Grantback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 459(a) of GEPA, 20 U.S.C. 1234h(a), provides that, whenever the Secretary has recovered funds following a final audit determination with respect to an applicable program, the Secretary may consider those funds to be additional funds available for that program and may arrange to repay to the State agency affected by that determination an amount not to exceed 75 percent of the recovered funds. The Secretary may enter into this so-called ``grantback'' arrangement if the Secretary determines that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The practices and procedures of the State agency that resulted in the final audit determination have been corrected and the State agency is, in all other respects, in compliance with requirements of the applicable program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The State agency has submitted to the Secretary a plan for the use of the funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement that meets the requirements of the program and, to the extent possible, benefits the population that was affected by the failure to comply or by the misexpenditures that resulted in the audit exception; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The use of funds to be awarded under the grantback arrangement in accordance with the State agency's plan would serve to achieve the purposes of the program under which funds were originally granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> C. Plan for Use of Funds Awarded Under a Grantback Arrangement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In its December 13, 1993, request for a grantback, the State agency submitted a plan, in accordance with section 459(a)(2) of GEPA, for the proposed use of the requested funds. In its plan, the State proposes to use the grantback of $470,833 plus the required State matching funds in the amount of $127,430 to supplement current program services to eligible individuals with disabilities under The State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program. The grantback and State matching funds would be used to provide time-limited employment site job coaching and support services through traditional community rehabilitation programs to increase the number of competitive placements in integrated settings made by these traditional programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are currently 32 traditional programs that are CARF (Council on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities) accredited and approved to provide work adjustment training and extended employment to DOL/DVRS. These traditional programs, also known as sheltered workshops, most frequently serve individuals with the most severe disabilities. In the majority of the cases, these individuals are rehabilitated as extended employees of the programs. According to the agency, 402 individuals were placed in competitive work in integrated settings during or at the conclusion of work adjustment training in FY 1993. By initiating time-limited employment site job coaching and support services through these programs, DOL/DVRS expects placements in competitive work in integrated settings to increase by at least 10 percent in both FY 1995 and FY 1996 compared to the number placed in FY 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initiatives facilitating placements of individuals with disabilities in competitive work in integrated work settings were identified as needs during public hearings concerning the reauthorization of the Rehabilitation Act and DOL/DVRS' State and Strategic Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> D. The Secretary's Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Secretary has reviewed the State agency's request for the repayment of funds, the State agency's plan (as outlined in section C of this notice), and other information submitted by the State agency. Based upon that review, the Secretary has determined that the conditions contained in section 459 of GEPA have been met. This determination is based upon the best information available to the Secretary at the present time. If this information is, at a later date, discovered to have been inaccurate or incomplete, the Secretary will not be precluded from taking appropriate administrative action at that time. On finding that the conditions of section 459 of GEPA have been met, the Secretary makes no determination concerning any pending audit recommendation or final audit determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

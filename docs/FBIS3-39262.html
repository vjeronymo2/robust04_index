Schoenhuber was the one who wanted the meeting, Streibl  said.  Since his decade-long personal contact with Schoenhuber had  never been interrupted, he told himself: "Why not?" After all,  after his resignation as minister president, he has had a number  of talks with politicians from other parties.    The contents of this personal talk with Schoenhuber was  "neither secret nor political." They primarily discussed joint  memories of the time when both of them worked closely with Franz  Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber. Streibl denied any intention  to leave the CSU and even to join the Republikaner. Streibl:  "Schoenhuber did not try to persuade me at all."    Bavarian Culture Minister Hans Zehetmair was "completely  surprised" about Streibl's contacts with the Repulikaner. On  the private SAT-1 television station, Zehetmair said that the  Republikaner are the declared opponents of the CSU.</p>

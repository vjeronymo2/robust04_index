"South Korea has done a lot in acquiring advanced Western  technologies and we want to learn from their experience and see  what Koreans could do for our high-tech efforts," said Monji  Safra in an interview with THE KOREA HERALD yesterday.    The Tunisian secretary of state to the prime minister in  charge of scientific research and technology is here on a  three-day visit to prepare a general agreement on science and  technological cooperation with South Korea.    He met with Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung and  other South Korean officials and heads of research institutes to  discuss such an agreement yesterday.    Safra named biotechnology, nuclear research and computers as  potential sectors for bilateral technological cooperation.    "We want to see what our biotechnology centers could do in  joint efforts with their South Korean counterparts to improve  seeds and increase agricultural productivity," he said.    Tunisia also has an ambition of becoming the chief provider  of computer software for Arab and African countries, especially  software adopted for the needs of small businesses.    The country is investing heavily in telecommunications. For  example, it is interested in developing software needed to  monitor satellites because one of the Arabsats is monitored from  Tunis, Safra said.    The Tunisian official also said his country is planning its  first nuclear research center to promote the peaceful use of  nuclear technology for medical, agricultural and industrial  purposes.    "And we hope South Korea will help us by sending experts to  give us advice on building nuclear laboratories, which are  urgently needed," he said.    Although some private South Korean companies are already  operating in Tunisia, Safra's visit marks the first big  commitment to establish bilateral technological ties at an  official level.    During his stay here, Safra visited Taedok Science Town and  six research institutes, including the Korea Institute of  Science and Technology, to discuss an exchange of researchers.    Korea International Cooperation Agency has agreed to offer  three scholarships for Tunisian researchers to attend seminars  and study in research institutes here.    "This cooperation on the official level will certainly help  lay the foundation for more cooperation in the private sector,"  Safra said.    Samsung is already in Tunisia assembling microcomputers and  Goldstar is producing household electric appliances there.    For foreign investors, there could be little doubt about the  importance of Tunisia's geographical location, Safra said. The  North African region has 60 million people and Europe is  directly across the Mediterranean Sea.    "By being in Tunisia, foreign companies will be in a  position  not only to expand into the North African market but also to use  it as a gateway to the European market," Safra said.    Tunisia plans to open two free trade zones this year where  foreign investors can work without any taxes and use cheap local  labor on a contract basis so that they will not have to pay  social taxes or comply with local labor regulations.    As long as the local value added is more than 40 percent of  the value of a product, the product is considered Tunisian, and  almost all Tunisian products get free access to the European  market except for a few agricultural products.    Safra leaves the country today. His visit here included a  meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong, where he said  he made clear his country's position that every country in the  world, including North Korea, must allow nuclear inspections by  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tunisia is a  member of the board of IAEA.</p>

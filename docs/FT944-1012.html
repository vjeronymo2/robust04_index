			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Dunton cuts loss Dunton Group, the restructured property company, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 34,000 for the six months to October 31, against a deficit of Pounds 636,000 for the comparable period which covered the half year to November 30. The outcome reflected the near-elimination of interest charges - Pounds 1,000 against Pounds 484,000 - and directors stressed that it was struck before 'we have embarked upon any significant acquisition or development.' Turnover was Pounds 240,000, against Pounds 1.49m which took in Pounds 1.36m from discontinued operations. Losses per share narrowed to 0.05p (1.38p).</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): Big bucks and dirty laundry THE MONEY LAUNDERERS by Robert E Powis Probus Europe Pounds 15.95, 328 pages THERE has got to be a great movie in this book. It has everything to fascinate and to titillate - from mobsters to sex, crooked bank employees and indifferent bank managers, drug peddlers and money launderers, smoke-filled rooms and bent politicians, fast cars, yachts and aircraft. At the core: how the drug barons and their hordes of henchmen and small-time crooks launder the estimated Dollars 120bn (Pounds 68.1bn) which Americans spend on drugs every year. This tale is very much what Americans call a big buck ticket; the numbers are big, and so are the names, from the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) to former Panamanian dictator General Manuel Noriega. Big name banks, who either colluded in the re-cycling of drug money or were duped by the crooks include, according to this account, Bank of America, Manufacturers Hanover, Crocker National, Citibank, Chemical, Bank of New England- indeed, the great and the good of the banking world who did not know, or did not want to know, the difference between real money and sleaze money. First a definition: money laundering amounts to the use of money derived from illegal activities by concealing the identity of the individuals who obtained the cash, and converts it to assets that appear to have come from a legitimate source. This author's definition is more straight-forward: the washing of dirty money to make it appear clean. And he should know. Robert Powis is a former US Secret Service agent who served in Washington as a top Treasury official coordinating enforcement against money laundering and was also involved in the administration of the Bank Secrecy Act. Powis writes it as he says it was over the past 20 years, and still is to a large extent, despite more and more legislation and more enforcement. He calculates that some 80 per cent of money from illegal US drug sales finds its way into the American banking system, often with the knowledge of greedy bankers anxious for ever more deposits; the rest takes wing, mainly via banks in Switzerland and Italy, and some in seemingly legitimate gold and jewellery businesses in London. A little - everything is relative when the annual sum touches on Dollars 120bn - even finds it way in covert operations run by the Central Intelligence Agency, such as the Contra affair which former President Ronald Reagan said he knew nothing about. Powis throws no new light on this. Facts are there aplenty. Witness a small motel room in the American Mid-West: a group of 'smurfs', so called by Treasury special agents after the blue cherubs made famous in television cartoons, whose task it was to launder drug money by using the local Yellow Pages to check out bank addresses and be assigned to branches where they would open accounts, or obtain bearer cheques, for something short of Dollars 10,000. This is the maximum over which banks must (or should) conform with the 1970 Bank Secrecy Act requiring that they report to the Internal Revenue Service currency transactions over Dollars 10,000 on behalf of the same person on the same day. The 'smurfs' stopped a dollar short, and most banks willingly bought the re-cycled drugs money. 'A smurf could dispose of between Dollars 50,000 and Dollars 100,000 in cash each day, and typically be paid between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent, depending upon his experience and ability. A smurf who disposed of Dollars 100,000 would be paid somewhere between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,000 for a day's work. The individual in charge of a road trip would get about 1.5 per cent of all the money laundered; in addition, he would get 0.5 per cent of all currency that he personally laundered at banks.' The whole business become labour-intensive, and new and bigger ways were arranged, often involving flying the money out of the US to Mexico or Switzerland; indeed, at one point some dishonest airline stewards with deep pockets were recruited to do the work, at a price. Some existing Italian resort apartment complexes are monuments to this re-cycling process, says Powis. But his is not just a cracking yarn. He has much that is useful to say about the need for stricter compliance procedures in banks around the world, particularly his reference to the 'Know your client' philosophy. He admires the so-called Basle Agreement, under which the Group of 10 industrial nations have agreed principles to try and limit the re-cycling of illicit cash through the banking system, but suggests that much more needs to be done within the US banking system itself. He thinks that politicians are hard on the regulators and soft on the drugs barons, not out of misplaced sympathy but because of concern about how the policemen police the crooks, including their occasional short cuts which erode individual rights. All in all, quite a read - and watch out for the movie.</p>

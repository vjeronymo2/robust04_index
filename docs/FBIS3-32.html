			<p>S                            U M M A R Y        Although the vote by the State Duma to amnesty prisoners  implicated in the August 1991 coup and the October 1993 Supreme  Soviet uprising marks the Duma's most confrontational move  against President Boris Yeltsin to date, it was passed as part of  a compromise package that somewhat mitigated its anti-  presidential thrust.  Centrists and moderate reformers supported  the amnesty after hardliners gave up a legislative commission  that was to have investigated last autumn's constitutional crisis  and agreed to accept an additional document defining the amnesty  as part of a movement toward national reconciliation.  The  amnesty vote appears to have weakened Yeltsin politically and has  deepened the divisions among reformers, further undermining their  ability to fight the anti-Yeltsin opposition in the legislature.                             END SUMMARY     Hardliners in the Duma scored a political victory over Yeltsin  when, with the help of centrists and moderate reformers, the Duma  adopted on 23 February a package of decrees amnestying prisoners  charged in the 1991 coup attempt and the 1993 uprising, including  Yeltsin's archenemies Ruslan Khasbulatov and Aleksandr Rutskoy.  The Duma had debated but failed to approve a political amnesty  several times previously, but proponents scored a breakthrough on  22 February when the Duma's Council put together a "large"  compromise package that included decrees on a criminal and  political amnesty, a memorandum calling for national accord, and  a decree that apparently abolishes a Duma commission established  on 9 February to investigate the events of 21 September to 4  October (see box 1) (Radio Rossii, 9 February; Segodnya, 23  February).  Legislative hardliners had intended to use the  commission to attack Yeltsin by publicly questioning the  constitutionality of his edict dissolving the Supreme Soviet.  During the Council's session, hardliners reportedly agreed to  "act as if the vote on setting up the commission never took  place," a choice that reportedly caused considerable anguish  among more extreme Yeltsin opponents, who did not want to give up  the commission (Segodnya, 23 February; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26  February).     How the Factions Voted     The compromise amnesty package passed 252 to 67 (with 28  abstentions)--just 29 votes above the required majority--with the  bulk of support coming from hard-line deputies.  According to an  account by a Communist Party (CPRF) deputy published in  Sovetskaya Rossiya (26 February), the CPRF, Agrarian Party,  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and the hard-line  nationalist "Russian Way" group led by Sergey Baburin provided  147 votes for the compromise amnesty package.  Some hardliners,  however, including nine CPRF deputies and one each from the  Agrarian Party and Russian Way, were so intent on retaining the  Duma's investigative commission into the September-October crisis  that they voted against the final compromise.     After a decree abolishing the investigative commission was added  to the "large" package, enough centrists and moderate reformers  joined in supporting the amnesty compromise to put it over the  top.  Apparently at the urging of Party of Russian Unity and  Accord (PRES) leader Sergey Shakhray, PRES and the Women of  Russia faction, joined by at least some members of the centrist  New Regional Policy group, made their support for the amnesty  package contingent on the inclusion of a "Memorandum of Accord,"  essentially a political declaration calling for round table talks  on economic and political issues and recommending amnesty as a  step toward "national reconciliation" (Interfax, 23 February).  Even with the inclusion of the Memorandum of Accord, however,  this "small" amnesty package did not have enough support to pass.  Only two PRES deputies voted for the "small" package.  When the  decree abolishing the commission was added to the "large"  compromise package, it gained the votes of 16 more PRES deputies  (of 24 present to vote).  Similarly, 35 deputies from the New  Regional Policy group voted for the "small" package, but an  additional 12 members voted for the final compromise that  abolished the commission.  Other centrist deputies voting for the  final compromise included all 22 members from Women of Russia and  all 14 deputies from the Nikolay Travkin's Democratic Party of  Russia faction who were present to vote (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 26  February).     The compromise package appears to have deepened divisions among  reformers, pitting the pro-Yeltsin Russia's Choice faction  against PRES and splitting the moderate reformist Yabloko bloc  led by reform economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy.  Russia's Choice  held together in its opposition to the political amnesty, with  only one of its members--Ivan Starikov of Novosibirsk--willing to  vote for the final compromise (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2 March).  However, only 57 of its 75 members were present to vote.  Most of  the Yavlinskiy bloc--16 of the 22 who were present at the vote-  -either abstained or voted against both amnesty packages, but the  other six took a strong anti-Yeltsin stand, voting only for the  "small" package and against the final compromise (Sovetskaya  Rossiya, 26 February).  Their position appears related to the  stance voiced by some members of the bloc following the October  rebellion. (See Note 1)     (Note 1)  During the election campaign, Vladimir Lukin, a  coleader of the Yabloko bloc, advocated a full investigation into  the events of 21 September-4 October, though lie acknowledged that  extremists in the Supreme Soviet had "started this carnage" and  had "brought about dozens of human casualties" (Literaturnaya  Gazeta, No. 47, 24 November 1993).  Shortly after the election  another bloc member, Valeriy Borshchev (of the Christian  Democratic Union), expressed the bloc's intention to promote the  establishment of a parliamentary commission to conduct the  investigation (Segodnya, 23 December 1993).  Lukin's support for  the commission evidently caused him, as well as other Yabloko  deputies Viktor Sheynis and Nikolay Petrakov, to abstain from the  vote for the final compromise package (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 2  March).     Background to the Amnesty Issue     Since convening, the Duma has debated two kinds of amnesty  proposals, one a criminal amnesty aimed at minor offenders and  the other a political amnesty for the 1991 coup plotters and  participants in the 1993 Supreme Soviet uprising.  During the  first week of the Duma's session, hard-line deputies made their  first move toward securing a political amnesty for their  political allies, but their failure to coordinate with the LDPR,  which was pressing its own political amnesty proposal, caused the  move to fail (ITAR-TASS, 17 January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25  January).  Yeltsin revived the amnesty issue when he submitted a  proposal for a criminal amnesty "in connection with the adoption  of" the constitution (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), continuing  a Soviet-era tradition of declaring amnesties to mark major  holidays and significant political milestones.  In retrospect,  this move was doubly unfortunate for Yeltsin.  His proposal  failed to attract support from reformers and gave hardliners  another opportunity to raise the issue of a political amnesty.     -- On 17 January, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, a close associate of  Rutskoy, proposed putting the political amnesty issue on the  Duma's agenda, but the motion fell 18 votes short of a majority,  reportedly because the LDPR did not back him (ITAR-TASS, 17  January; Sovetskaya Rossiya, 25 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 27  January).  At the time, the LDPR was advocating an amnesty that  would have freed anyone sentenced on "political or economic  charges" after April 1985 and also would have released from jail  Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other participants in the October  uprising but placed them under house arrest (Interfax, 31  December 1993; ITAR-TASS, 4 January).     -- Yeltsin's proposal, submitted shortly after he signed it on 21  January, quickly ran into trouble.  The CPRF and Agrarian Party  were unwilling to consider it because it did not amnesty their  political allies, and the LDPR stood by its version.  Even  Russia's Choice--the faction most likely to support the  president--was unwilling to back the bill, apparently in an  effort to erase public perceptions that it is soft on crime.  Faction leader Yegor Gaydar stated that Russia's Choice could not  support Yeltsin's initiative because "we are very doubtful about  the provisions . . . which reduce punishments for serious  criminal offenses" and pointedly drew attention to the "existing  criminal situation in the country" (ITAR-TASS, 21 January, 7  February).  In a further indication of trouble for Yeltsin, his  proposal was assigned to the Committee for Legislation, Judicial,  and Legal Reform, headed by Vladimir Isakov--a staunch Yeltsin  foe from the Agrarian Party (ITAR-TASS, 24 January).     -- The amnesty issue was scheduled to come up for debate in the  Duma's 4 February plenary session, but the Duma's Council  postponed the debate, probably in recognition that none of the  competing proposals would win a majority (Interfax, Segodnya, 3  February).  According to the Duma's First Deputy Chairman Mikhail  Mityukov (Russia's Choice), the Council postponed debate because  "certain factions" wanted to "play the amnesty card for political  purposes" (Izvestiya, 5  February).  By that time, Isakov's  committee had drafted its own decree to amnesty the participants  in the 1991 coup attempt and the October uprising (Segodnya, 4  February).     -- By mid-February, elements of the final compromise began to  emerge as the Duma agreed to examine both Yeltsin's criminal  amnesty proposal and an apparently revised LDPR political amnesty  proposal.  The Duma took no direct action on Yeltsin's criminal  amnesty proposal during its 16 February debate, possibly because  the debate made it clear that it lacked majority support  (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily, 17 February).  The Duma  then decided to consider separately two draft decrees--Yeltsin's  on a criminal amnesty and an LDPR proposal on an economic and  political amnesty (Interfax, ITAR-TASS, 16 February).  More  ominously for Yeltsin, the PRES and Women of Russia factions  offered conditional backing for the political amnesty, reportedly  insisting on "circulating" a "clarification document" --evidently  a reference to the Memorandum of Accord that the Duma later  adopted in the final compromise package--making it clear that the  factions supported the amnesty as a step toward "national  reconciliation" and not simply for the sake of freeing Rutskoy  and Khasbulatov (Segodnya, 16 February).  On 17 February the  LDPR's political amnesty proposal fell 23 votes short of adoption  and was sent back to committee for "improvement," this time going  to the security committee, headed by Yeltsin foe Viktor Ilyukhin  (CPRF), as well as to Isakov's legislation committee (Interfax,  ITAR-TASS, 17 February).     Disarray in the Yeltsin Camp     The varied responses from Yeltsin's advisers to the Duma's  passage of the amnesty suggest that the event caught them  unprepared, even though the approval of the compromise package by  the Duma's Council on 22 February should have given them some  warning of its improved prospects. (See Note 2)  National  Security Adviser Yuriy Baturin opted for a confrontational  stance, arguing that the amnesty was unconstitutional because it  was in fact a pardon, which is a presidential prerogative (ITAR-  TASS, 24 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 February).  By  contrast, Aleksandr M. Yakovlev, Yeltsin's official  representative to the legislature, responded in sanguine fashion,  contending that the amnesty was "completely in keeping with the  constitution from a judicial point of view" (Russian TV, 24  February).  Georgiy Satarov, a Yeltsin adviser on legislative  relations, did not weigh in until two days after the vote, when  he indicated that Yeltsin was preparing a "calm and businesslike  letter" asking the Duma to reconsider its stance (Interfax,  Moscow radio, Ostankino TV, 25 February).     (Note 2)  Much of the disarray in the Yeltsin camp may be  attributed to the absence of presidential Administration Leader  Sergey Filatov, who was apparently in Switzerland at the time  (ITAR-TASS, 27 February).  Yakovlev, Satarov, and Baturin are all  relatively new to the Yeltsin team, and their inexperience may  have contributed to their uncoordinated response (For more on  Yeltsin's advisers, see the Trends of 9 March 1994, pages 4-12).     Yeltsin himself responded too late to postpone or block  implementation of the political amnesty.  On 26 February he sent  a letter to Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, drawing upon Baturin's  line of argument and reportedly asserting that the deputies had  confused the constitutional principles of amnesty and pardon.  The letter urged the Duma to "improve" the decree to bring it in  line with the constitution.  Yeltsin also proposed that the Duma  adopt a "system of criteria" defining the responsibility of state  institutions and politicians "for decisions [that] hamper our  joint policy towards national reconciliation, civil peace, and  accord"--evidently an attempt to impress upon the Duma its  accountability for the actions of individuals released under the  amnesty (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  Satarov reportedly delivered  Yeltsin's letter to Rybkin on the afternoon of 26 February, when  Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and other prisoners arrested after the  October uprising were already walking out of Lefortovo prison  (see box 2) (ITAR-TASS, 26 February; Rossiyskaya Gazeta,  Izvestiya, 1 March).     After the futile letter to Rybkin, Yeltsin appeared to waver  between taking a confrontational approach and trying to defuse  political tensions.  At first he was confrontational, with  S,,atarov announcing on 28 February that Yeltsin was preparing  certain actions aimed at defending the democratic state and  society" (Russian TV, 28 February).  Satarov's comments and  others by Baturin and presidential press secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov fueled speculation that Yeltsin would address the  country that night in a special televised appeal (ITAR-TASS, 28  February).  Nezavisimaya Gazeta's Ivan Rodin reported (2 March)  that Yeltsin was to have announced on television an edict that,  while not containing "any specific tough measures," nonetheless  brandished a "menacing" tone.  Rodin also suggested, however,  that threatening a tough presidential response may have been a  deliberate tactic to bring pressure on Rybkin before a meeting  held the same day between Yeltsin's advisers--including the newly  returned Head of Administration Sergey Filatov--and Rybkin.  Rybkin and Filatov reportedly discussed ways to improve  "interaction" between the two branches, paving the way for  Yeltsin to meet with Rybkin the following day (ITAR-TASS, 28  February).     After his meeting with Rybkin, Yeltsin appears to have adopted a  position of accepting the amnesty and placing the burden of  responsibility for it--and for the actions of the released  prisoners--squarely on the Duma.  At their 1 March meeting,  Rybkin reportedly promised Yeltsin that the Duma would "ensure a  more balanced approach" when adopting decrees likely to have  "serious political and moral consequences" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March).  Yeltsin apparently also extracted a pledge from Rybkin that he  would urge the Duma "probably in the near future" to adopt a  memorandum on the "responsibility of state institutions and  politicians for preserving civic calm in Russia" (Moscow radio, 1  March).  In return, Yeltsin assured Rybkin that he had opted  against "immediate tough measures," but he warned that he would  not tolerate misbehavior by his amnestied foes, saying: "Should  the slightest attempt be made at destabilizing the situation in  the country, [the amnestied prisoners] will be arrested straight  after" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March).     As a result of the initial confused reaction by his advisers and  the conflicting signals about his course of action, Yeltsin  appears to have lost political stature in the aftermath of the  amnesty vote.  His acceptance of the amnesty conflicts with his  repeated assertions--most recently stated at the 4 March  Government meeting--that the Duma's amnesty is unconstitutional  (Moscow radio, 4 March).  In an effort to counter press accounts  of executive disarray (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Izvestiya, 1 March) as  well as criticism of his handling of the amnesty by Russia's  Choice members (Izvestiya, 3 March), Yeltsin apparently saw the  need to verbally assert his presidential authority after meeting  with Rybkin: "I . . . am in full control of the social and  political situation" (ITAR-TASS, 1 March).     Implications     The Duma's successful passage of a political amnesty suggests  that Yeltsin and his team of advisers have learned little since  the confrontation with the old Supreme Soviet about how to manage  relations with the legislative branch, much less to effectively  advance a presidential agenda.  By contrast, the Duma has again  demonstrated its ability to compromise effectively on issues it  considers important, with the Duma Council apparently playing a  key role.  By postponing debate when it recognized that the Duma  lacked consensus on the issue and brokering the final key  compromise, the Duma's leadership demonstrated a knack for  managing the legislative process.  Rybkin personally appears to  have emerged from the amnesty vote with enhanced political  stature.  His meetings with Filatov and Yeltsin and pledges to  improve legislative-executive coordination suggest the makings of  an effective political player, at least for as long as his  Communist-Agrarian colleagues are willing to back such  conciliatory politics and allow Rybkin to deliver on his pledges.     Box 1                   The "Large" Compromise Package     Resorting to the kind of package compromise that has worked for  the Duma in the past,* deputies voted on a total of five  documents, all of which came into effect after their publication  in Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 26 February.  The decree overturning the  Duma's investigative commission into the October crisis was not  included in an earlier "small" package that failed to pass:     -- "On Declaring an Amnesty in Connection With the Adoption of  the Russian Federation Constitution."  This decree, based largely  on the draft amnesty bill that Yeltsin submitted to parliament  (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 25 January), amnesties criminals convicted  of minor offenses as well as certain groups of offenders, such as  women and invalids.  According to Minister of Internal Affairs  Viktor Yerin, the criminal amnesty affects "less than 10 percent"  of convicted criminals, and another MVD general put the number at  about 20,000 (Argumenty i Fakty No. 6, February; Pravda, 26  February).     -- Decree outlining the procedures for implementing the above  decree.     -- "On Declaring a Political and Economic Amnesty."  This  document--the one opposed most bitterly by Yeltsin supporters-  -specifically terminates legal proceedings against the 1991 coup  plotters and hardliners arrested after the violent 1 May  demonstrations in Moscow and the October 1993 Supreme Soviet  uprising and stipulates that their release from prison take place  "immediately."  In an apparent effort to gain the support of some  reformers and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), it  also amnesties criminals sentenced for various Soviet-era  economic crimes.     -- "On the Adoption of the Memorandum of Accord."  This decree  formally approves the "Memorandum of Accord" put forward by PRES,  the Women of Russia, and the New Regional Policy factions calling  upon the legislative and executive branches to consider "jointly"  problems presented by "political, economic, and social reforms in  society" and urging authorities to wage their "political struggle  within a legal framework."  The memorandum also suggested that a  political amnesty could serve as an "integral part" of the  process toward "national accord."  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin has  repeatedly called this memorandum the most important document of  the package (Pravda, 1 March; Komsomolskaya Pravda, 2 March).        "On Overturning a Decree of the State Duma."  This decree  reportedly over turns the 9 February decision of the Duma to set  up a commission to investigate the events of 21 September-4  October, although its wording is somewhat ambiguous.  It annuls a  16 February decree on the "composition" of the commission,  leaving open the possibility that the commission has not formally  been disbanded.     *See the Trends of 9 February 1994, pages 15-25.     End Box 1     Box 2              Prosecutor Protests Yeltsin Pressure on Amnesty     Judging by comments made after the prisoners' release, both the  Yeltsin team and Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin were counting on  Prosecutor General Aleksey Kazannik to block or delay  implementation of the amnesty.  Kazannik's office reportedly made  an "inquiry" to the Duma about certain provisions in the amnesty,  and Rybkin indicated in his meeting with Satarov on 26 February  that the Duma's legislation and security committees were  responding to the inquiry and that no prisoners would be released  until the questions were cleared up (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  At  a meeting of parliamentary officials on 28 February, Rybkin  charged that the prosecutor's office acted on the amnesty with  undue haste" and without waiting for a response to its questions  (Interfax, Radio Rossii, 28 February).  He later appeared to  change his story somewhat--possibly in an attempt to deflect  blame from the security and legislation committees--when he  contended that the committees had "clarified every point" of  Kazannik's inquiry by 26 February (Pravda, 1 March).     Yeltsin reportedly tried to pressure Kazannik to delay  implementing the amnesty, but Kazannik, while declaring his  distaste for the amnesty, said that he had no legal authority to  block it and resigned rather than submit to Yeltsin's pressure.  Kazannik had implicitly warned Yeltsin that he would not bow to  political pressures over the amnesty issue when he stated that  his office does not give "political assessments" to various laws  but only ensures their "lawfulness and strict fulfillment" (ITAR-  TASS, 24 February).  In his resignation statement, Kazannik  charged that Yeltsin had appealed to him to "suspend" the amnesty  process, and though he indicated that he personally agreed with  the "civic attitude" of Yeltsin's appeal, he made clear his  professional and political independence: "The prosecutor in  Russia does not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act  [or] to appeal to the State Duma for a resolution to be  reconsidered" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).  Despite his refusal to  delay implementing the amnesty, Kazannik appears to harbor no  sympathy for the amnestied prisoners, asserting in his  resignation statement that he considered the Duma's vote for  political amnesty a "black page in the history of Russian  parliamentarianism" (ITAR-TASS, 26 February).     * Kazannik has now changed his mind about resigning and has  indicated that he will ask the Federation Council, which has the  constitutional authority to confirm the appointment and dismissal  of the prosecutor general, not to accept his 26 February  resignation (Russian TV, Izvestiya, 12 March).  Yeltsin, however,  appears intent on securing Kazannik's resignation.  On 14 March  he issued a decree affirming his acceptance of Kazannik's  resignation and arguing that because Kazannik was appointed by  presidential decree before the new constitution was adopted, his  release from office does not require the Federation Council's  approval (ITAR-TASS, 14 March).

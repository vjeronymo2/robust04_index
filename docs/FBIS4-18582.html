			<p>BFN     [Text] Stilianos Papathemelis, the public order minister,  announced plans yesterday to introduce sweeping changes in the  Greek police force, including the setting up of a special  homicide unit and the right to form trade unions.    Draft legislation is to be tabled in parliament in the  coming  days, said Papathemelis, and will propose the establishment of  powerful elite divisions in every department of the  force--public order, security, traffic and consumer protection.  The new system will be introduced as a pilot scheme next month  in Athens, Thessaloniki and one regional town. Papathemelis  said a national exam would be set for applicants seeking  entrance to ordinary and officer police training schools.    Under the new proposals, police staff-management relations  will be brought in line with the rest of the civil service.  Transfers will only be allowed to take place once every year.  If the bill is passed without significant amendments,  Papathemelis said negotiations would begin with union leaders to  allow police officers union representation.</p>

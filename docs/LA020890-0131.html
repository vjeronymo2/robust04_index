			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER RATE REPORT HANDLED ISSUE 'COURAGEOUSLY'  </P> <P> As an educator of public utility economics, I was following the water rate  issue. I read the "Water Rate Committee Report" (Times, Jan. 25).  </P> <P> The report has all the ingredients of a public utility rate. Simply put, the  utility rate is based on "Cost of Service Basis." The report, through its 10  recommendations, dealt with the rate issue courageously.  </P> <P> We (the people) should thank the members of the Rate Committee for a job well  done as the committee, not the City Council, recommended for the Covina rate  decrease when the city of Los Angeles approved a 5.9% water rate hike.  </P> <P> I do not understand why the council disliked the committee recommendation of  investigating the market for liability insurance. The council accepted all of  the committee recommendations except this one. Can the council member who  proposed this resolution provide a reason for ignoring liability insurance  issue?  </P> <P> RAM C. MUKHERJI  </P> <P> Covina  </P></p>

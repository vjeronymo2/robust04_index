			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> IOWA CENSUS TATTLER SUSPENDED  </P> <P> A census worker has been suspended for violating the U.S. Census Bureau's  tradition of confidentiality because he informed the police that a resident he  questioned appeared to be using marijuana.  </P> <P> The bureau's Cedar Rapids office said Stephen Larson should have informed his  superiors and let them decide whether to inform the police. Larson said he was  told Monday that he was being suspended pending an investigation.  </P> <P> Tom Moss, the district office's director, said census enumerators make  assurances that "nothing will come out of this to anybody other than the Census  Bureau."  </P> <P> Police, who took no action on Larson's complaint, said today that the census  taker's only mistake was telling a reporter about his report.  </P></p>

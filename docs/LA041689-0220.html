			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASSESSING THE RISKS TO THOSE NEAR THE AIRPORT  </P> <P> The airplane crash in Eastbluff that wiped out a young Canadian family was  statistically inevitable. Equally inevitable is a crash of a large commercial  jet in our city. It will happen out of John Wayne Airport, the fifth-busiest  airport in the nation. Doubling the number of commercial flights out of John  Wayne next year also doubles the chances of a major jet crash in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The crash site of a commercial jet airliner will not be confined to an area  only the size of two tennis courts. Residents of Newport Beach were very  fortunate there were not lives on the ground lost this time.  </P> <P> The decision to expand a tiny general aviation airport to a commercial facility  in a highly populated area was irresponsible to begin with. There were open,  unpopulated areas of Orange County at the time, but it would have been more  expensive to build a remote airport, access roads needed to be built, etc. To  double commercial flights next year out of John Wayne is additionally  irresponsible. To continue to route aircraft over the most densely populated  areas of Newport Beach is patently inexcusable.  </P> <P> I have a large file consisting of letters written by residents of Eastbluff,  Sea Island, Irvine Terrace, Balboa Island and Balboa Peninsula to the city of  Newport Beach, Orange County, the Federation Aviation Administration and our  state senator. We have a petition signed by almost 3,000 residents demanding  that the dangerous route and takeoff procedures be reexamined.  </P> <P> The deep power cutback one nautical mile after takeoff is outdated with the new  Stage 3 aircraft now departing John Wayne and, according to a recent study  funded by the city of Newport Beach, actually causes more noise by keeping  commercial aircraft low over Newport Beach. More importantly, it severely  decreases the pilots' emergency power in case of engine failure, thus  increasing the risk of a crash.  </P> <P> The outdated takeoff procedures also call for a turn to the left over the upper  bay, routing aircraft toward Eastbluff. This routes commercial jets in front of  small aircraft departing the shorter runway to their left. The current  procedure then routes the commercial jets over the most populated areas of  Newport Beach! All dangerous, unnecessary, outdated procedures.  </P> <P> I perceive Newport citizens as intelligent and politically sophisticated, and  it amazes me that we have allowed and continue to allow the county to dump the  entire burden of Orange County's air traffic on our city. The noise, pollution  and congestion caused by John Wayne is intolerable enough. This burden should  not be allowed to extend to endangering our lives unnecessarily by specifically  routing aircraft over our homes, schools and families.  </P> <P> John Wayne is growing faster than the national average for airport growth. The  prospect of a second airport in Orange County is looking less likely. Even if a  second airport site is found, John Wayne will remain in full operation.  </P> <P> Will Newport Beach have to wait for a disaster the magnitude of Cerritos to  happen before the city, county and FAA enact safer takeoff procedures and  routes?  </P> <P> MARY G.

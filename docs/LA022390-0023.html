			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Grammy Ratings Improve: Ratings for the Grammy Awards telecast on Wednesday  night were up significantly over last year's and nearly equaled those of the  recent American Music Awards. The 3 1/2-hour CBS broadcast averaged an 18.9  rating, compared to a 16 last year -- meaning it was seen in about 17.4 million  homes, or 3 million more than the 1989 show. For the hours between 8 and 11  p.m., Wednesday's ceremonies averaged a 19.7 rating, just shy of the 20 figure  that ABC wracked up during the same three hours for the American Music Awards  on Jan. 22.

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): ITT closing in from its Sheraton base - Ciga / Other Companies Today's board meeting at Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group, is likely to provide confirmation that ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, has gained effective control of the company. Up to three of the existing seven-strong board are expected to step down, allowing Sheraton-nominated directors to join. ITT confirmed at last week's shareholder meeting that it now owns 17.4 per cent of Ciga through its Sheraton International subsidiary.</p>

Gen. Gennady Evstafiev,  director-general of massive destruction weapon control bureau of  the external intelligence office, says in an interview with the  weekly in Friday's edition.    Pyongyang froze its nuclear development program for two  reasons, however, because of the international pressure and the  recognition that it could no longer afford the enormous  financial burden, Evstafiev says.    As a result, he says, the communist regime may give up its  nuclear program altogether and go entirely public on its nuclear  sites.    The intelligence officer points out that extra care is  needed  so as not to upset the sensitive political situation of North  Korea, which is in the middle of a power transfer.    Moscow agrees with international experts on the gravity of  the North Korean nuclear problem, he says, adding that  Pyongyang's leaders have long sought to manufacture nuclear,  biological and chemical weapons and have already succeeded in  developing a delivery systems by modifying Scud missiles into  the Nodong-1.    Evstafiev names North Korea the most dangerous country in  the  world, with the potential to make nuclear weapons. Next on his  list are Israel, India and Pakistan.    He says Pyongyang is playing a big game with Washington in  their ``nuclear dialogue'' and Moscow has therefore to put its  national interests first to guarantee safety in the Far East.</p>

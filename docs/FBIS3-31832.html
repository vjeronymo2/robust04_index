			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Within the next two days UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] will put forward a proposal for a document on the use of  blue routes to and from Sarajevo in accordance with the UN  resolutions adopted so far. This was one of the most important  conclusions reached at today's negotiations between our and the  Serb aggressor delegation at Sarajevo airport. The document,  which will most probably be adopted, provides for the opening of  a road corridor from Sarajevo via Vogosca [Serb-held district  north of Sarajevo center] to Visoko and Zenica [Muslim-held  towns in central Bosnia] for humanitarian convoys and all other  users with valid documents issued by the relevant authorities.

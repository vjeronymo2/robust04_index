Bouvard stressed that Albania's associate membership in the  North Atlantic Assembly was an important step in its integration  with NATO. Zhulali described Bouvard's speech to the Albanian  parliament as "the warmest ever" by a foreign political figure.    Zhulali asked for greater support to counteract the effects  of the embargo on former Yugoslavia, and expressed the view that  there will be no "definitive end" to the Balkan crisis without a  solution to the Kosovo, the largely ethnic-Albanian enclave  within Serbia.</p>

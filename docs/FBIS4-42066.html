			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ub/mes"-signed report: "Belgium's Head of Government </F> Dehaene To Become New EU Commission President"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- One month before Germany takes over the  European Union [EU] presidency, leadership problems in the EU  seem to have been largely solved: Belgium's Prime Minister  Jean-Luc Dehaene is to become the new president of the Brussels  Commission, and the European affairs expert in the German  Foreign Ministry, Juergen Trumpf, will be his secretary general.  This line that has leaked from the Brussels Commission will be  agreed upon at Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl's meeting with  French President Francois Mitterrand on Monday [30 May]. In  Friday's Bundestag session, Kohl announced that his government  wants to use the [German EU] presidency starting on 1 July for  making 1994 a year of success in European unification. Rudolf  Scharping, Social Democratic Party of Germany chairman, accused  Kohl of failures in his European policy.    In their consultations in Alsace, Kohl and Mitterrand will  set the course for the European Council meeting in Greece on 24  June. Greece has held the EU presidency since the beginning of  this year. SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG has been informed that the  chancellor and the president agree that Belgium's Prime Minister  Dehaene will succeed Jacques Delors as Commission president.  Meanwhile, 10 of the 12 EU governments are said to share this  view. The other candidates for Commission president are Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and British Foreign Trade  Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan. The British candidate is not  considered to stand much chance; the Dutch one might be slightly  more successful. It has been said that the time has come to  bring it home to Lubbers that he should "withdraw gracefully."  Should Bonn and Paris succeed in making Belgium's Dehaene EU  president, Belgium would support a German secretary general.  State Secretary Trumpf would be available for that position.  Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel have already agreed on  this option. Trumpf, a longtime ambassador to the European  Community, is a Social Democrat. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Body Shop When overseas investors suddenly rush to buy into a UK company whose shares are on a historic multiple of 48 and a yield of 0.4 per cent, it would seem foolish for UK shareholders to resist. It would be all the odder if the company was not a Wellcome or a Glaxo, but a mere retailer. Yesterday's 12 per cent jump in the Body Shop share price was apparently sparked by a recommendation from an influential US stock picker. The only question is whether, if overseas investors really are discovering the Body Shop formula in large numbers, they can push the price to even more improbable levels. If so, UK investors would plainly be advised to hang on for the ride. But Body Shop has shown once already that it is vulnerable to the cycle. In 1990, its shares lost nearly half their value as the recession took hold. And other UK companies - Dixons, Sock Shop and Isosceles, to name but three  -have learned to their cost that expansion in the US is an extremely chancy business. The best course for Body Shop's UK investors might be to hand the shares over and buy them back when they are less fashionable.</p>

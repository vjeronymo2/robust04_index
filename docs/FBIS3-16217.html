In an interview with Interfax, the Executive Secretary of  the  Commonwealth Ivan Korotchenya said that "the meeting which was  later joined by the Belarusian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich  was of a familiarizing character." According to Korotchenya,  the new head of the parliament decided to familiarize with  representatives of the CIS states in person and to hear their  opinion on the activities of the executive secretariat.    Kortochenya said that during the meeting Hryb expressed  readiness to propose at the next CIS summit the construction of  a new building for the Commonwealth headquarters in Minsk. The  blue prints have already been designed, and the city authorities  have found a suitable construction site. Kebich decided that  the building of the former regional committee of the Belarusian  Communist Party will be leased by the CIS Executive Secretariat,  which currently occupies the building.    In the opinion of Korotchenya, the meeting focused on  approaches to the preparations and the signing of an agreement  between the Belarusian government and the CIS Executive  Secretariat which, in his words, regulates "a whole set of  problems regarding the location of the CIS headquarters in Minsk  and the recognition by Belarus of the executive secretariat as  an international organization." "Hryb also expressed the  readiness of the Belarusian side to carry out the construction  of the administrative building and apartment houses under the  condition that there was a coordinated approach by the CIS  states to their financing," Korotchenya said.    Asked about the funding of the CIS Executive Secretariat,  Korotchenya said that "some states delay the remittance of money  for maintaining the coordinating structures of the  Commonwealth," declining to name them.    According to Korotchenya, "the date for the next CIS summit,  to be held approximately around April 18-19 in Moscow is being  discussed."    Interfax learned that Hryb and Korotchenya intend to take  part in a conference of the European Interparliamentary Union  scheduled for March 21-26 in Paris.    According to sources in the Belarusian Supreme Council, a  delegation of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly to the Paris  conference will be led by head of the Russian Federation Council  Vladimir Shumeyko.    The agenda of the conference will include a discussion of  the  role and means of the UN in the prevention of international  conflicts, environmental protection, as well as general debates  on the political, economic and social situation in the world.</p>

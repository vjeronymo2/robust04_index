Mr Cook said: 'You need a government that's prepared to intervene to give those companies protection against takeovers, so they can then do what is right, which is to invest in the company. 'In the long run if these companies invest, the shares will be worth more. The return to the owners will be better. That's why despite the lower dividends in Japan and Germany the shareholders do better.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roberto Orozco B. and Roger Suarez M.] </F>   [Text] The 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80] is demanding the  presence of poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra [LA PRENSA director] and  Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, or one of his representatives,  in the demobilization talks to be held with the government,  "Chacalin" [Salvador Talavera], who leads the armed men, told LA  PRENSA today.    A meeting has been scheduled for today between FN 3-80  members and CIAV [International Support and Verification  Commission]-OAS representatives. The meeting site and time will  be agreed upon this morning.    Certain media versions are indicating the peace talks could  be held in El Naranjo, Nueva Segovia Department.    The rebel leader know as "Martin Negro" [not further  identified] has said they will present a nine-point document to  be broached during the upcoming talks with the government.    He disclosed discreetly that among the petitions are the  withdrawal of Army forces, the presence of Pablo Antonio Cuadra  and Cardinal Obando y Bravo in the talks, and the delimitation  of areas that could serve as enclaves.    Sergio Caramagna, CIAV-OAS chief in Managua, has said the  presence of Army troops near the facility in which the  negotiations are to be held could hinder the talks.    There is a tense calm particularly in the northern part of  the country due to the deployment of Army troops since last  weekend after an armed group led by "El Gato" [Francisco Rivera]  ambushed a Land Cruiser belonging to Marcial Sevilla Garcia, a  coffee producer. Police Officers Raul Palacio Navarrete, Rene  Antonio Garcia, Holman Zelaya, and Denis Gutierrez were also  riding in the vehicle.    One of the police officers died on 11 February, and Marcial  Sevilla died the night of 13 February at Manolo Morales Aviles  Hospital.    An FN 3-80 version says the police officers opened fire  first  against "El Gato's" men, who were in a house in the hamlet of  Buena Vista, Somoto Municipality.    Despite what occurred, the FN 3-80 leaders appeared willing  to negotiate their disarmament, citing their personal security  as the main condition.</p>

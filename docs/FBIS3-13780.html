			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary from the "Spotlight on News" </F> program]    [Text] The U.S. Administration has once again pressed the  UN Security Council to renew the blockade imposed on Iraq's  people since August 1990. The statement the Security Council  issued to announce that the blockade on Iraq will continue has  caused outrage inside and outside Iraq. Political observers  believe the consultations the Security Council held over the  last three days resulted in a clear division among the Security  Council's permanent member states. They were divided into two  groups. The first is France, Russia, and the PRC, which all  insist on recognizing positive developments in relations between  Iraq and the United Nations, as well as Iraq's compliance with  all the commitments imposed on it in accordance with Resolution  No. 687. The second group is the United States and Britain,  which want to keep matters as they are and continue the blockade  on Iraq's people -- a blockade without justification that has  become a subject of protest and denunciation by world public  opinion.    The Iraqi position, which leader President Saddam Husayn  declared during his recent meeting with ministers, as well as  his call on the Security Council to meet its obligations toward  Iraq in accordance with its resolutions, drew sharp reactions,  most of which were in favor of Iraq's rights. This is  especially true since the unjust blockade began its fourth year  without any legal, constitutional, or humanitarian justification  that the Security Council and the head of the Special  Commission, Ekeus, can use to delay presenting their  recommendations to the Security Council to begin its weapons  monitoring program and implement clause C of Resolution No. 687.    The rift the Iraqi position created among the Security  Council's permanent member states proves the legitimacy of  Iraq's proposals, as well as any other step Iraq deems correct  to open the door of hope for its people to get rid of this  unjust blockade still imposed because of the insistence of  well-known and influential sides in the UN Security Council to  serve purely conspiratorial and political goals that have  nothing to do with the contents of the obviously unjust UN  resolutions.    Following the cease-fire that began in February 1990, as  stated in Bush's announcement, Iraq tried to confront the UN  Security Council with its true responsibilities to honor its  resolutions and implement its obligations in order to save  Iraq's people from further injustice and persecution in terms of  the most important human aspects pertaining to food and  medicine. But well-known sides in the Security Council, led by  the United States, have been distorting the Iraqi position,  reversing realities, and belittling Iraq's full cooperation with  the United Nations in order to continue the blockade and the  crimes committed against Iraq's people, its independence, its  national sovereignty, and its free national decision making.    The general climate prevailing in UN corridors, and even  inside the United States itself, is full of questions about the  usefulness of and the reasons for the continued blockade of  Iraq. This fact frightens the delegates of the United States,  Britain, the Zionist entity, and some other regimes that are  trying, through their humiliated positions and their  subservience to Washington and Tel Aviv, to support these  aggressive positions with money and oil.    World and official public opinions stress Iraq's right to  prod the Security Council to serve its legitimate right and its  people's right to lift the blockade and to reject the use of the  blockade for political and diplomatic purposes governed by  international sides known for their flagrant hostility to the  Iraqi people.    It is obvious that the issue of lifting or maintaining the  blockade has become a matter of life and death for the Iraqi  people. Therefore, the Iraqi people have the right to use every  way their enlightened political leadership believes to be right  to confront the mysteries of the political conspiracy against  them in order to lift the blockade, to reassess all the  positions that have led to the continued blockade, and to create  the right opportunity and take the right position and step to  save Iraq's people from the injustice it is facing as a result  of the damned blockade.</p>

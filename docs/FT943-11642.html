			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Moves to restart signalling talks Efforts continued yesterday through the conciliation service Acas to find common ground for a resumption of negotiations to resolve the railway signalling dispute with no sign of any breakthrough. Both the RMT transport union and Railtrack, the company that owns and runs the railway system, remain willing to talk but Acas officials have not yet found an agreed form of words that can bring them back to the negotiating table.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINE TO ASSUME SENATOR'S SEAT BEGINS TO FORM  </P> <P> While Sen. Joseph B. Montoya sits in a courtroom, charged with political  corruption, at least two fellow Democrats are eyeing his seat in the Senate.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) will run against Montoya "whether  he's acquitted or not" in federal court, sources close to Calderon said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Calderon, 39, would not comment on reports he will challenge Montoya. However,  the lawmaker acknowledged that, if Montoya steps aside, he will campaign for  the 26th Senate District seat. Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park), 60,  said she, too, is interested in the Montoya Senate seat and will probably jump  into the contest if Montoya drops out.  </P> <P> Montoya -- standing trial on 12 counts of extortion, bribery, racketeering and  money laundering -- said Wednesday that he has not "heard or seen anything"  about Calderon's plans. Motioning toward the federal courtroom packed with  spectators, Montoya added: "I've got this."  </P> <P> Repeat History  </P> <P> If Montoya is challenged by an Assembly member in the Democratic primary, it  would repeat political history. In 1978, then-Assemblyman Montoya successfully  challenged Sen. Alfred H. Song (D-Monterey Park), who was a target of an FBI  investigation into political corruption. Charges were never filed against Song.  </P> <P> Montoya, 50, has asked for a trial as quickly as possible, saying he wanted to  clear his name so that he can campaign for a fourth Senate term. When he ran  for reelection three years ago, Montoya drew no opponents.  </P> <P> A Democrat would be heavily favored to win because registered Democrats  outnumber Republicans 2 to 1 in the district, which straddles the San Gabriel  Valley and parts of Southeast Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> One legislative source close to Calderon said the assemblyman decided to enter  the race after reading a memorandum written by federal prosecutors which said  that Montoya repeatedly demanded "fees for service" -- campaign contributions  and honorariums -- in exchange for his support for legislation.  </P> <P> Two other Democratic sources said Calderon has been lining up support, talking  to contributors and forming a campaign organization in preparation for a  contest against Montoya. "If the seat opens up, I will run for the Senate," he  said.  </P> <P> Calderon, elected to the Assembly in 1982, gained a high profile last year as  one of the dissident "Gang of Five" Democrats who attempted to topple Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). A year ago, Calderon lost a bid to  replace Brown as Assembly leader.  </P> <P> Tanner said she would not consider challenging Montoya: "I think Joe right now  is going through an awful lot, and I hope everything works out for him." But if  Montoya drops out of the race, she said, she would most likely enter.  </P> <P> However, Tanner said the large amount of money required to run for Senate  "turns me off," adding, "I am not really the greatest fund-raiser in the  world."  </P> <P> With Tanner and Calderon looking toward higher office, several candidates are  already being mentioned as their possible successors. For instance, Carmen O.  Perez, an aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, said she would be  interested in Tanner's seat but would not challenge the assemblywoman.  </P> <P> In Calderon's 59th District, Diane Martinez, president of the board of the  Garvey school district and daughter of U.S. Rep. Matthew Martinez  (D-Montebello), said she is campaigning for the seat because she assumes  Calderon is running for the Senate. Also, Montebello City Councilman Arnold  Alvarez-Glasman said he is considering entering the contest if Calderon leaves  the Assembly.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (AFP)--The secretary of Wei  Jingsheng, China's leading dissident, is undergoing police  investigation, a Ministry of Public Security spokesman said  Thursday. Tong Yi, who disappeared on Monday, "is currently  being investigated," the spokesman said, using a term indicating  that she was also in police detention.    Tong has acted as chief spokesperson for Wei since he was  released from prison in September, acting as go-between for the  dissident and foreign journalists. Tong was travelling in a car  with Wei when he was picked up Friday as he attempted to return  to Beijing.    The spokesman refused to specify what crimes Tong was being  investigated for.</p>

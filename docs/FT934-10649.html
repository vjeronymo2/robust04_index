			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Reluctant to walk the gangplank: Hugh Carnegy says the debate over the Volvo-Renault merger symbolises Sweden's vexed attitude to the EC Volvo has always been close to the hearts of Swedes, remarked a hard-pressed company spokesman this week. It was, he said, 'normal, natural and fair' that an emotional national debate had sprung up over the plan to subsume Volvo's quintessentially Swedish cars into a junior partnership with mighty state-owned Renault of France. By the same token, the vexed question of whether Volvo's shareholders should approve the merger with Renault has come to symbolise a broader argument over Swedish attitudes towards the country's role in the wider world - and in particular its application to join the European Community. Like the recession-battered country as a whole, Volvo is just recovering from a traumatic three years dominated by losses. Just as the nation's political leaders have decided membership of the EC is essential to the future economic and political well-being of Sweden, so the Volvo board has decided the long-term survival of its core car and truck-making operations depends upon a strategic link with a big European partner. But to what degree does opposition to the Volvo-Renault deal really mirror an apparently solidifying resistance in the country to the notion of EC membership? And, in a wider sense, do both concerns signal a tendency in Sweden to turn inwards in response to what is the worst economic slump in 50 years? Professor Assar Lindbeck of Stockholm University, Sweden's leading economist, believes that the nationalistic element in the fight against the Volvo-Renault merger only emerged seriously after substantive objections were raised by shareholders, not vice-versa. He says the core issues in the opposition revolve around the industrial strategy behind the deal and the role of the French government as the owner of the merged company - not foreign ownership. 'I don't think feelings about foreign control are any greater in Sweden than anywhere else - possibly less. What matters in this case is the involvement of a foreign government with protectionist instincts. French governments have been more interventionist than Swedish governments have been. 'If the French government had not been involved I don't think the merger would have become an issue in the country.' It is true that the mainstream political parties and, crucially, the majority of trade unions, have supported the Volvo-Renault deal. The LO, the confederation of blue-collar unions, has not flinched in the face of a media campaign to prevent Volvo being 'sold out', saying more foreign investment is needed to secure jobs in Sweden, not less. Nevertheless, nationalistic overtones have become prominent in the Volvo debate. Svenska Dagbladet, the respected conservative newspaper which is normally vigorously against state intervention, has called for Prime Minister Carl Bildt's right-centre government to step in to stop the deal in its present form. 'Just as Renault is important to France, so Volvo is for Sweden,' is the mantra of the paper's chief economic commentator, Mr Peter Malmqvist. Mr Olav Ehrenkrona, Mr Bildt's senior domestic policy adviser, says Svenska Dagbladet's stance on Volvo is indicative of the strains Swedish society has been under in recent years as recession and reforms have eroded the old comfortable certainties of the country's strong industrial base and elaborate welfare system. 'It is very difficult for people to stick to principles when those principles lead to painful results you did not expect,' he says. The pain he refers to extends far beyond the unedifying sight of a treasured national symbol such as Volvo sliding under foreign control. Three years of slump, in which the economy has shrunk by more than 5 per cent, have heavily battered the 'Swedish model'. Unemployment, once below 5 per cent, has leapt up to more than 13 per cent of the workforce. Real wages and disposable income have fallen. A combination of rapidly deteriorating public finances and politically motivated reforms has led to lower unemployment benefits, higher healthcare and education charges and much tighter sick leave rules. At the same time, Sweden's traditionally liberal refugee policies have led to a surge in foreign newcomers recently, with at least 70,000 citizens of the former Yugoslavia alone set to settle in the country over the next couple of years. Their arrival in the middle of a severe downturn has sparked unprecedented levels of anti-immigrant feeling. It is mild by the standards of Germany or France, but weekend riots by right-wing racist groups in industrial centres such as Gothenburg and Trollhatten are no longer unusual. 'Sweden has been a very homogeneous place,' says Mr Olle Wastberg, until recently senior aide to Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, and now editor in chief of Expressen, a top-selling tabloid newspaper. 'Now people in the streets and in small towns are seeing people who are very foreign to them. It is taking time to get used to it, especially in a recession.' Such trends have tended to reinforce the argument against Swedish membership of the EC. Membership is seen as representing a further dilution of Swedish identity, opening the way to more foreign influence and a flight of more jobs abroad. Recent opinion polls have shown opposition to membership hardening at about 45 per cent, with support dwindling to less than 30 per cent. 'People tend to confuse the issues,' says Olle Wastberg. 'When they see (state-funded) day-care centres being closed early, they may blame the EC because they hear the government saying that one reason for changes in taxes that lead to cuts in public spending is to harmonise our tax system with that of the Community.' Mr Wastberg says he will keep the populist Expressen pro-EC as the country moves towards a referendum on membership, expected sometime late next year. He believes public opinion can be turned around, but, like many others, says much will depend on the attitude of the country's biggest political party, the opposition Social Democrats. The Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, are well placed, according to opinion polls, to win next September's general election. But they are deeply split on the EC. They lodged Sweden's application to join the Community when last in government, but only after a controversial volte-face in party policy carried through by the leadership. Today, more than 50 per cent of Social Democratic voters indicate in polls that they are against membership, with less than 20 per cent in favour. This would be enough of a hurdle to winning a referendum in itself, but it is an insurmountable obstacle given that a majority of voters from four of the other six main political parties in favour of membership are also opposed. Because of the split in their own ranks, the Social Democrats currently treat EC membership like fatal poison, avoiding addressing it in public. An exasperated Mr Bildt, struggling to get the case in favour across to the public, has resorted to trying to goad the Social Democratic leadership into supporting the policy it put into place when in office. Undoubtedly, the internal strains of the past three years - and the successive crises in Europe - have left many Swedes sceptical and uncertain that greater economic, political and industrial integration with Europe is the way forward. But, as Prof Lindbeck points out, it is also true that many Swedish companies have long since taken that path, becoming in the process genuine international organisations with much more of their production outside Sweden than at home. Just early last year, a majority of Swedes were in favour of EC membership. An upturn in the economy, expected to take hold next year, and a more positive stance by the Social Democrats could yet turn around opinion on the EC. By the time a referendum is held, the row over Volvo's merger with Renault will be long past, and its outcome either way is unlikely to be a significant factor in the settling of the EC debate.</p>

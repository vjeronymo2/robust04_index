			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges back as Taiwan surges 4.7% DISAPPOINTMENT over the government's failure to include income tax cuts in Thursday's emergency economic package affected sentiment, and share prices lost ground on selling by arbitrageurs and corporate investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 111.11 to 20,391.04 after a high of 20,532.65 just after the market opening, and a low of 20,305.33 in the afternoon as institutional investors moved to realise profits ahead of the September 30 book closing. Volume was 295.3m shares against 259m. Declines outpaced advances by 674 to 296 with 195 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 5.75 to 1,651.34 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 3.37 to 1,259.67. The Y6,150bn economic package is seen as containing little actual inflow of funds into the economy. The failure of the Bank of Japan to cut its official discount rate has also discouraged investors. Traders hope that the round of recent selling ahead of the mid-term book closing will have run its course by next week. However, some market participants remain pessimistic over the economy and do not expect a rush to buy shares. Large capital shares faced profit-taking. Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, fell Y5 to Y331 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y2 to Y685. Electronics companies were also lower. Sony fell Y90 to Y4,350, Hitachi declined Y17 to Y833 and NEC lost Y10 to Y955. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone lost Y5,000 to Y886,000. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 216.38 to 22,499.53 in volume of 89.5m shares. Roundup THERE was no trading in Hong Kong yesterday because of a severe storm. TAIWAN rose 4.7 per cent after the central bank cut the reserve requirements of the country's commercial banks, and later a number of banks announced further cuts in interest rates. The index jumped 176.48 to 3,941.49, but off an intra-session high of 3,963.90. The index has gained 1.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was TDollars 30bn, its highest level since May. Financial sector stocks led the day's rally, rising by 5.8 per cent. China Steel was the most heavily traded stock, ending 90 cents up at TDollars 18.80. MANILA hit a record high in an across-the-board rally spurred by Philippine Long Distance Telephone, up 15 pesos to 1,375 pesos, following a strong advance in New York. The composite index climbed 20.64 to 1,996.37 in combined turnover of 723.1m pesos, for a 4 per cent rise over the week. AUSTRALIA turned sharply higher after recent falls, helped by BHP's strong first quarter profit results and firmer gold stocks. The All Ordinaries rose 22.9 to 1,925.5, but was 0.8 per cent lower on the week. BHP advanced 52 cents to ADollars 15.96 after reporting a 22.1 per cent rise in net profit to ADollars 316.1m in the August quarter. SEOUL saw a mild technical rebound after the retreats of the three previous sessions and the composite stock index added 1.95 to 688.34, 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Exporters were helped by a trade ministry forecast that Japan's economic stimulus package would boost South Korea's export performance by Dollars 500m, while reports that the country expected its largest ever steel trade surplus helped steelmakers to advance. SINGAPORE edged higher as the consolidation continued and the Straits Times industrial index rose 7.67 to 2,008.38 after picking up from an intra-day low of 1,996.31, 0.5 per cent higher on the week. BOMBAY was higher on sustained buying by both Indian and foreign institutional investors and the BSE 30 share index rose 17.15 to 2,763.59, up 2.1 per cent in the week. NEW ZEALAND weakened in light trading, as Telecom shares lost 5 cents to NZDollars 4.10. The NZSE-40 capital index shed 23.38 to 1,945.23 in turnover of NZDollars 29.3m.</p>

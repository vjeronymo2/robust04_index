Medvedev and B.G. Korshunov, Moscow </F> Institute of Steel and Alloys; UDC 669.053.4:669.2/8]    [Abstract] Methods of intensifying hydrometallurgical  processes currently used in the nonferrous industry and  unconventional methods of accelerating lixivation of raw  minerals are reviewed on the basis of recent research done at  the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys. As the point of  departure is considered the classical relation da/dt=  (+/-)KC[.sup]n[/]S (a- degree of conversion, t- time, S- area  of interphase boundary, C- concentration of reactant of  component, n- order of process with respect to reactant or  component, K= Ae[.sup]-E/RT[/]- empirically determined  process rate constant, E- activation energy, R- universal gas  constant, T- temperature, A- coefficient) describing lixivation,  crystallization, cementation, and ion exchange processes. Use of  _g_-radiation from sources such as [.sup]60[/]Co or [.sup]137[/]  Cs for radiolysis of water intensifies  oxidation-dissolution of uranium and its use for electrolysis or  photolysis of Eu salts (sulfate) intensifies  reduction-precipitation for separation of Eu from other  rare-earth elements. Ultrasonic processing of ionite intensifies  ion exchange. Ultrasound is also used for completing lixivation  of Pb cake by dissolution of Zn,In,Cd admixtures and for  overcoming barriers which limit chemical reactions such as  A(solid) + B(in solution) C(solid) + D(in solution) by  limiting internal diffusion through solid product layers. A  simpler new method of overcoming these barriers during  lixivation of ores and concentrates has been proposed by the  authors, namely implantation of additives in the pulp which will  act as crystallization centers. Such an additive should contain  calcite or preferably dolomite for lixivation of scheelite with  soda in an autoclave, or tungstic acid (powder) for  decomposition of scheelite with nitric acid. Lixivation of Pb  cake and of concentrates with more precious contents is also  being intensified by mechanical activation: in centrifugal  planetary grinding mill with drums which rotate both about their  common axis and in the opposite sense about their own axes.  Modification of minerals such as wolframite scheelite during  comminution is being intensified either by mechanochemical  activation, namely addition of a calcium salt, or by thermal  activation into the phase-transformation range and subsequent  quenching. Cementation of metals such as Cd and Cu is being  intensified by mechanical activation in a continuous-action  vibratory reactor.

The supporting rationale and background to this rule are more fully set out in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures for the rules and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the substance for that use. The mechanism for reporting under this requirement is established under 40 CFR 721.10.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Applicability of General Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General provisions for SNURs appear under subpart A of 40 CFR part 721. These provisions describe persons subject to the rule, recordkeeping requirements, exemptions to reporting requirements, and applicability of the rule to uses occurring before the effective date of the final rule. Provisions relating to user fees appear at 40 CFR part 700. Persons subject to this SNUR must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and 5(d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (2), (3), and (5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities on which it has received the SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, EPA is required under section 5(g) to explain in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  its reasons for not taking action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. Persons who intend to import a chemical substance identified in a final SNUR are subject to the TSCA section 13 import certification requirements, which are codified at 19 CFR 12.118 through 12.127 and 127.28. Such persons must certify that they are in compliance with the SNUR requirements. The EPA policy in support of the import certification appears at 40 CFR part 707.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Substances Subject to This Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is establishing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substances under 40 CFR part 721 subpart E. In this unit, EPA provides a brief description for each substance, including its PMN number, chemical name (generic name if the specific name is claimed as CBI), CAS number (if assigned), basis for the action taken by EPA in the section 5(e) consent order or as a non-section 5(e) SNUR for the substance (including the statutory citation and specific finding), toxicity concern, and the CFR citation assigned in the regulatory text section of this rule. The specific uses which are designated as significant new uses are cited in the regulatory text section of the rule by reference to 40 CFR part 721 subpart B where the significant new uses are described in detail. Certain new uses, including production limits and other uses designated in the rule are claimed as CBI. The procedure for obtaining confidential information is set out in Unit VII. of this preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where the underlying section 5(e) order prohibits the PMN submitter from exceeding a specified production limit without performing specific tests to determine the health or environmental effects of a substance, the tests are described in this unit. As explained further in Unit VI. of this preamble, the SNUR for such substances contains the same production limit, and exceeding the production limit is defined as a significant new use. Persons who intend to exceed the production limit must notify the Agency by submitting a significant new use notice (SNUN) at least 90 days in advance. In addition, this unit describes tests that are recommended by EPA to provide sufficient information to evaluate the substance, but for which no production limit has been established in the section 5(e) order. Descriptions of recommended tests are provided for informational purposes. Data on potential exposures or releases of the substances, testing other than that specified in the section 5(e) order for the substances, or studies on analogous substances, which may demonstrate that the significant new uses being reported do not present an unreasonable risk, may be included with significant new use notification. Persons submitting a SNUN must comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of PMNs, as stated in 40 CFR 721.1(c), including submission of test data on health and environmental effects as described in 40 CFR 720.50. EPA is not publishing SNURs for 14 PMN substances: P&hyph;93&hyph;67, P&hyph;93&hyph;68, P&hyph;93&hyph;184, P&hyph;93&hyph;185, P&hyph;93&hyph;186, P&hyph;93&hyph;187, P&hyph;93&hyph;188, P&hyph;93&hyph;190, P&hyph;93&hyph;282, P&hyph;93&hyph;317, P&hyph;93&hyph;318, P&hyph;93&hyph;476, P&hyph;93&hyph;721, and P&hyph;93&hyph;959 which are subject to a final 5(e) consent order. The 5(e) consent orders for these substances are derived from an exposure finding based solely on substantial production volume and significant or substantial human exposure and/or release to the environment of substantial quantities. For these cases there were limited or no toxicity data available for the PMN substances. In such cases, EPA regulates the new chemical substances under section 5(e) by requiring certain toxicity tests. For instance, chemical substances with potentially substantial releases to surface waters would be subject to toxicity testing of aquatic organisms and chemicals with potentially substantial human exposures would be subject to health effects testing for mutagenicity, acute effects, and subchronic effects. However, for these substances the short-term toxicity testing required by the 5(e) order is usually completed within 1 to 2 years of notice of commencement. EPA's experience with exposure-based SNURs requiring short-term testing is that the SNUR is often revoked within 1 to 2 years when the test results are received. Rather than issue and revoke SNURs in such a short span of time, EPA will defer publication of exposure-based SNURs until either a Notice of Commencement (NOC) or data demonstrating risk are received unless the toxicity testing required is long-term. EPA is issuing this explanation and notification as required in 40 CFR 721.160(a)(2) as it has determined that SNURs are not needed at this time for these substances which are subject to a final 5(e) consent order under TSCA. The section 5(e) orders for P&hyph;92&hyph;776, P&hyph;92&hyph;777, and P&hyph;93&hyph;214 contain new chemical exposure limits (NCEL) provisions. In each case, the section 5(e) order allows the PMN submitter and the submitter's customers to protect workers by controlling and monitoring airborne concentrations of the substance present in the workplace as an alternative to certain respirator requirements. A clause had been added to these SNURs stating that as an alternative to the respiratory protection designated in the SNUR, manufacturers, importers, and processors may follow the same NCEL provisions found in the section 5(e) consent orders for these substances, including using only EPA-approved sampling and analytical methods if approval is stipulated by the 5(e) consent order. No general NCEL language has been added to the regulatory text of the corresponding SNURs as EPA expects that only manufacturers, importers, and processors with access to the original 5(e) consent order of the original PMN submitter will be able to readily use this clause. EPA recommends that any company proposing to substitute NCEL or other alternative control measures for SNUR provisions consult EPA either by submitting a SNUN or requesting a determination of equivalency under the procedures for ``EPA Approval of Alternative Control Measures'' in &sect;721.30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=82 g=1 f=1 --> PMN Number P&hyph;88&hyph;1304 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical name: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  (generic) Polypiperidinol-acrylate methacrylate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> CAS number: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Not available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Effective date of section 5(e) consent order: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  January 1, 1989.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for section 5(e) consent order: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i) and (ii)(I) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Toxicity concern: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Similar chemicals have been shown to cause immunotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and chronic toxicity.

EPA has determined that certain uses of the PMN substances could result in releases to surface waters where the concentration would be greater than 100 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1937 and greater than 10 ppb for P&hyph;88&hyph;1938.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Recommended testing: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  To help characterize the terrestrial effects, the following studies are recommended: Inherent biodegradation in soil (40 CFR 796.3400), earthworm toxicity test (&sect;795.150, proposed June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29155)), early seedling growth test (40 CFR 797.2800), soil microbial community test (40 CFR 797.3700), and aerobic biodegradation test (aquatic) (40 CFR 796.3100).

The basis for such findings is outlined in Unit III. of this preamble. Based on these findings, section 5(e) consent orders requiring the use of appropriate controls were negotiated with the PMN submitters; the SNUR provisions for these substances designated herein are consistent with the provisions of the section 5(e) orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the other 22 cases for which the proposed uses are not regulated under a section 5(e) order, EPA determined that one or more of the criteria of concern established at 40 CFR 721.170 were met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is issuing this SNUR for specific chemical substances which have undergone premanufacture review to ensure that: EPA will receive notice of any company's intent to manufacture, import, or process a listed chemical substance for a significant new use before that activity begins; EPA will have an opportunity to review and evaluate data submitted in a SNUN before the notice submitter begins manufacturing, importing, or processing a listed chemical substance for a significant new use; when necessary to prevent unreasonable risks EPA will be able to regulate prospective manufacturers, importers, or processors of a listed chemical substance before a significant new use of that substance occurs; and all manufacturers, importers, and processors of the same chemical substance which is subject to a section 5(e) order are subject to similar requirements. Issuance of a SNUR for a chemical substance does not signify that the substance is listed on the TSCA Inventory.

If EPA receives such a notice, EPA will publish a notice to withdraw the direct final SNUR(s) for the specific substance(s) to which the adverse or critical comments apply. EPA will then propose a SNUR for the specific substance(s) providing a 30&hyph;day comment period. This action establishes SNURs for a number of chemical substances. Any person who submits a notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comments must identify the substance and the new use to which it applies. EPA will not withdraw a SNUR for a substance not identified in a notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Test Data and Other Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that section 5 of TSCA does not require developing any particular test data before submission of a SNUN. Persons are required only to submit test data in their possession or control and to describe any other data known to or reasonably ascertainable by them. In cases where a section 5(e) order requires or recommends certain testing, Unit III. of this preamble lists those recommended tests. However, EPA has established production limits in the section 5(e) orders for several of the substances regulated under this rule, in view of the lack of data on the potential health and environmental risks that may be posed by the significant new uses or increased exposure to the substances. These production limits cannot be exceeded unless the PMN submitter first submits the results of toxicity tests that would permit a reasoned evaluation of the potential risks posed by these substances. Under recent consent orders, each PMN submitter is required to submit each study at least 14 weeks (earlier orders required submissions at least 12 weeks) before reaching the specified production limit. Listings of the tests specified in the section 5(e) orders are included in Unit III. of this preamble. The SNURs contain the same production volume limits as the consent orders. Exceeding these production limits is defined as a significant new use. The recommended studies may not be the only means of addressing the potential risks of the substance. However, SNUNs submitted for significant new uses without any test data may increase the likelihood that EPA will take action under section 5(e), particularly if satisfactory test results have not been obtained from a prior submitter. EPA recommends that potential SNUN submitters contact EPA early enough so that they will be able to conduct the appropriate tests. SNUN submitters should be aware that EPA will be better able to evaluate SNUNs which provide detailed information on: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Human exposure and environmental release that may result from the significant new use of the chemical substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Potential benefits of the substances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Information on risks posed by the substances compared to risks posed by potential substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Procedural Determinations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is establishing through this rule some significant new uses which have been claimed as CBI. EPA is required to keep this information confidential to protect the CBI of the original PMN submitter. EPA promulgated a procedure to deal with the situation where a specific significant new use is CBI. This procedure appears in 40 CFR 721.1725(b)(1) and is similar to that in &sect;721.11 for situations where the chemical identity of the substance subject to a SNUR is CBI. This procedure is cross-referenced in each of these SNURs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A manufacturer or importer may request EPA to determine whether a proposed use would be a significant new use under this rule. Under the procedure incorporated from &sect;721.1725(b)(1), a manufacturer or importer must show that it has a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  intent to manufacture or import the substance and must identify the specific use for which it intends to manufacture or import the substance. If EPA concludes that the person has shown a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  intent to manufacture or import the substance, EPA will tell the person whether the use identified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submission would be a significant new use under the rule. Since most of the chemical identities of the substances subject to these SNURs are also CBI, manufacturers and processors can combine the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submission under the procedure in &sect;721.1725(b)(1) with that under &sect;721.11 into a single step. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a manufacturer or importer is told that the production volume identified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submission would not be a significant new use, i.e. it is below the level that would be a significant new use, that person can manufacture or import the substance as long as the aggregate amount does not exceed that identified in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submission to EPA. If the person later intends to exceed that volume, a new  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submission would be necessary to determine whether that higher volume would be a significant new use. EPA is considering whether to adopt a special procedure for use when CBI production volume is designated as a significant new use. Under such a procedure, a person showing a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  intent to manufacture or import the substance, under the procedure described in &sect;721.11, would automatically be informed of the production volume that would be a significant new use. Thus the person would not have to make multiple  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submissions to EPA for the same substance to remain in compliance with the SNUR, as could be the case under the procedures in &sect;721.1725(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Applicability of Rule to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To establish a significant ``new'' use, EPA must determine that the use is not ongoing. The chemical substances subject to this rule have recently undergone premanufacture review. Section 5(e) orders have been issued for 10 substances and notice submitters are prohibited by the section 5(e) orders from undertaking activities which EPA is designating as significant new uses. In cases where EPA has not received an NOC and the substance has not been added to the Inventory, no other person may commence such activities without first submitting a PMN. For substances for which an NOC has not been submitted at this time, EPA has concluded that the uses are not ongoing. However, EPA recognizes in cases when chemical substances identified in this SNUR are added to the Inventory prior to the effective date of the rule, the substances may be manufactured, imported, or processed by other persons for a significant new use as defined in this rule before the effective date of the rule. However, 14 of the 32 substances contained in this rule have CBI chemical identities, and since EPA has received a limited number of post-PMN  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  submissions, the Agency believes that it is highly unlikely that any of the significant new uses described in the following regulatory text are ongoing. As discussed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376), EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as of this date of publication rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substances regulated through this SNUR will have to cease any such activity before the effective date of this rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUN requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has promulgated provisions to allow persons to comply with this SNUR before the effective date. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance under &sect;721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between publication and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUN requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Economic Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers, importers, and processors of the chemical substance subject to this rule. EPA's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this rule (OPPTS&hyph;50615).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Rulemaking Record  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50615). The record includes information considered by EPA in developing this rule. A public version of the record without any confidential business information is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located at Rm. E&hyph;G099, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> XI. Regulatory Assessment Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has determined that approximately 10 percent of the parties affected by this rule could be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substances. Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by this rule will not be substantial, even if all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

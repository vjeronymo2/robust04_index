			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xiao Feng (2556 0023): "Shareholding System </F> Reform Achieves Eight Great Progresses in '93--Throughout the  Nation There Are Nearly 10,000 Newly Added Shareholding System  Enterprises, Reaching a Grand Total of More Than 13,000"]    [Text] Authorities from relevant national departments have  revealed that, in 1993 Chinese shareholding system reform as the  core of the structuring of a modern enterprise system with  greater speed and greater stability expanded the area of  development and achieved distinct advances in the following  eight areas.    ---Speed. According to incomplete statistics from some  provinces and cities throughout the nation as of the end of  1993, during the year at least 9,440 new shareholding system  enterprises were added, of which 2,968 were limited stock  companies, 6,472 were limited liability companies, and 1,776  were internally held stock companies. The cumulative total of  shareholding system enterprises throughout the nation reached as  high as 13,000. Total capital stocks were 208.632 billion yuan  and, as of 31 December, there were 122 shareholding companies on  the market. Throughout the nation there were 51 securities  registering organizations and as many as 25 million  stockholders. In 1993 there were a total of 174 types of A  stocks from surface and in-depth brokers on the market, a 235  percent increase over 1992. There were a total of 41 types of B  stocks from the two types of stock brokers, a 128 percent  increase over 1992. Compared to the same point in 1992 (31  December), the total 1993 market value (for A and B stocks)  increased by 308 percent; the volume of transactions increased  by 572 percent; and the amount of transactions increased by 552  percent. In 1993 there were a total of 17 types of legal person  stocks on the market, a 467 percent increase over 1992. At the  same point in time (31 December), according to the calculation  of comparable specifications, in 1993 the volume of legal person  stock transactions increased by 186 percent and the amount of  the transactions increased by 140 percent over 1992. In  addition, last year China also added the legal person stock  circulating market, NET system.    ---Expanded Scope. The shareholding system enterprise model  has rapidly expanded to all trades and professions, from  industry to commerce, villages, cultural organizations, athletic  departments, and schools all have actively initiated  shareholding system experiments. A number of privately owned and  collective enterprises in the area of new and advanced  technology also discarded their former model of ownership and  shifted to shareholding system enterprises. Numerous newly  established enterprises and newly established projects (such as  the Three Gorges Project) conscientiously use the shareholding  system function to help to rapidly raise funds and clearly  define property rights.    ---Going on external markets, winning the initial victory.  In  1993 nine large national enterprises were designated as the  first batch to go on external markets. By the end of the year,  six enterprises already had accomplished this task. In the short  period of six months, six large and medium-sized national  enterprises on external markets had as much as HK$272.8 billion  in frozen external funds (not including globally raised  amounts), 72.6 times the funds raised in the plan. In addition,  the people-run enterprise, Sitong Group, also raised 180 million  in Hong Kong. The merger clearly was successful.    ---Progress in the legal framework is gratifying. At the  beginning of last year, the State Council promulgated the Notice  on Further Strengthening Macroeconomic Controls on Securities  Markets, establishing the keynote for this year's national  regulation of the securities market. In April the State Council  issued the Provisional Regulations on Administering the Issuing  and Trading of Stocks to provide China's shareholding operations  with an embryonic framework. Subsequently, rules and regulations  for such things as disclosing information, establishing a  securities exchange, and guarding against securities fraud were  implemented one after the other. The most gratifying was that at  the end of the year the first major national law, the Company  Law of the People's Republic of China, was passed by the Fifth  Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National  People's Congress and was formally promulgated. The legal  framework of the Chinese stock system is gradually entering the  "three dimensional" stage.    ---The interior and remote border province regions are no  longer silent. Such "developing provinces and regions" as  Shanxi, Nei Mongol, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai,  Xinjiang, and Tibet, unwilling to be left behind, are actively  engaging in experiments with the shareholding system. Especially  Tibet ended the historical gap in experimenting with the  shareholding system and in a standard and reliable way developed  four shareholding system enterprises, and Lhasa opened a  securities exchange business department. In addition, such  places as Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, and Shanxi successfully  issued stocks to society.    ---Remarkable performance convinces people.    (1) Enterprise economic performance: Thirty Shanghai  companies comparably strong on the market realized an average  128 percent increase in profits from January through June 1993.  These indices far exceeded other types of enterprises.    (2) State asset performance. Stock-issuing premium  coefficients were higher than state asset appraised reinvestment  coefficients. For example, after the state assets of 10 Shanghai  enterprises were appraised, the rate of increased value rose by  56.98 percent and the rate of new assets put into production  increased by 10.52 percent. It is obvious that in the reform of  the shareholding system the rights and interests of state assets  were fully guaranteed.    (3) Stockholder performance: In the first half of 1993, the  rate of repayment to stockholders of the first 30 companies on  the market was generally between 30 percent and 101 percent. The  majority of the outstanding repayment companies on the market  were concentrated in Shenzhen, 76.7 percent.    ----Stock issuance went safely and smoothly. In 1993 for the  first time in Chinese history, large-scale public stock  solicitation activities were carried out in various places  throughout the country. For this the State Council Securities  Commission issued "1993 Stock Sales and Subscription  Suggestions" and one after the other various places established  "stock issuing headquarters," resolutely implemented the "three  public" principle, and adopted the pattern of unlimited sale  subscription certificates and savings account quota sale  certificates. Throughout the year, stock issuing went safely and  smoothly. That is, there was nothing like the "August 10"  incident and excessively large first and second class market  profit differentials were curbed.    ---Severely punish illegal activities and clean up the stock  market environment. The Chinese government and securities  control department have resolutely attacked such illegal  activities as using stocks for private gain, black market  trading, behind the scenes trading, leaking of information,  corruption and accepting bribes, unlawful bond trading, and  disturbing the stock market. For example, relevant departments  have strongly and swiftly dealt fairly and seriously with such  cases as the case of the president of the savings bank in Zibo  city diverting 1.7457 million yuan in public funds to speculate  on stocks; the case of the Guangzhou bond trader swindling  customers; the case of a certain seventeen-year-old Shanghai  youth cheating on securities; and false stocks and false  purchasing certificates appearing everywhere. The cleaning up of  the stock market environment has won the acclaim of the vast  number of stockholders.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: A seasonal mood change For the Conservative party 1993 has been about survival. Against the odds it has survived. In spite of the best endeavours of the Tory right, Mr John Major has too. For Mr John Smith's Labour party the aim has been to prosper from the government's misfortunes. Judged by the opinion polls it can claim success. The opposition has rarely been less than 20 points in front. But the demeanour of the party's MPs and shadow cabinet members tells a different story. The confidence which comes with being ahead is mirrored by self-doubt over whether the lead can be sustained. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, the most visibly successful of the opposition parties this year, are similarly ambivalent. The undoubted boost from famous victories in the Newbury and Christchurch by-elections has not been translated into additional punch at Westminster. So it is hardly surprising that weary ministers hosting Whitehall's traditional round of Christmas parties have been permitting themselves the occasional smile. After lurching from crisis to crisis since the 1992 general election, still being there is enough. 'Who knows,' one minister offered only half-jokingly, 'next year we might start governing the country again.' The mood is shared on the Tory back benches. Peace in Northern Ireland would be an inestimable prize. Mr Major looked this week like a prime minister. His style during the Commons debate on the Anglo-Irish agreement was the most relaxed of the year. It encouraged him to return to the despatch box yesterday to take personal credit for Britain's role in brokering the Gatt world trade deal. There is more unease than has yet surfaced publicly over the implications of the accord. Dealing with the IRA promises to be a messy business for a party trying to rebuild a tattered reputation as the guardian of law and order. But the fact that the disquiet has remained below the surface - save for Mr Norman Lamont's intervention yesterday - says something about the changed mood on the back benches. It is no longer possible to state with confidence that the Conservative party is bent on self-destruction. It has brushed aside the revelation of Mr Major's clandestine contacts with the IRA, and it has swallowed a dilution of the government's commitment to the unionists. More broadly, it has actually applauded a Budget that will pave the way for bigger tax increases than ever contemplated by the Labour party. It has concentrated instead on the latest encouraging batch of economic statistics. The legislation this week to curb statutory sick pay and increase National Insurance contributions have raised hardly a murmur. The party's post-Maastricht tension has also eased as Mr Major has absorbed the rhetoric of the Euro-sceptics. The turnaround has been mirrored by restlessness on the Labour benches. Never mind the opinion poll lead. Direction is what counts in politics. Labour MPs fear the wind may be about to change. Grumbling about Mr Smith's leadership has spread from dissident leftwingers to the shadow cabinet. The modernisers are fearful that the compromises made to win the one-member-one-vote confrontation with the trade unions have stalled the process of change. Mr Smith is criticised even by some of his friends as remote. His timid shadow cabinet reshuffle did nothing to enhance his reputation for decisiveness. 'What do we stand for?' is a question asked these days as often by Labour as by Tory MPs. But this picture is an uneven one. If Mr Major is rebuilding his self-confidence his colleagues say that his private mood is still brittle. Few miss the contrast with the instinctive ebullience of Mr Kenneth Clarke, never more obvious than since the Budget. The prime minister has taken to drumming his fingers on the table during the irrepressible Mr Clarke's lengthy interventions at cabinet committee meetings. The line between friendship and rivalry in politics is a fine one. Then there is the real world, untouched by the pathological swings of mood at Westminster. Out there the voters will feel the pain of higher taxes, a squeeze on wage increases and the spending crunch for the welfare state. A modest economic upswing may not be enough to buy forgiveness. Mr Major has something to celebrate this Christmas. He is still in the game. He is more resilient and more willing to take risks than many of his critics have allowed him. The Conservatives are starting to rediscover self-discipline. But so far it adds up to a seasonal change of mood rather than a sea change.</p>

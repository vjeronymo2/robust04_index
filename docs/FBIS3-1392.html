The police said the injuries  ranged from gunshot wounds to serious hack- and stab wounds.    Reporters at the scene have described scenes of chaos, with  several bodies lying in the streets. Police say thousands of  people are still streaming into the city to join the march. The  march is to protest against next month's elections, and to show  support for a Zulu kingdom.    The marchers apparently plan to proceed towards the offices  of the Independent Electoral Commission. Business in the CBD  [central business district] has come to a complete halt, and the  Johannesburg Traffic Department has advised motorists to avoid  the city center. People in office blocks have been advised to  remain inside the buildings.    We have just heard that the police have returned the fire of  shots which were fired from rooftops in the city center a short  while ago. Several people appear to have been hit by gunfire.    Another report says that at least five people were shot dead  and eight wounded when Zulu marchers engaged ANC [African  National Congress] security guards at the ANC's Shell House head  office in Plein Street. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus told SAPA  [SOUTH AFRICAN PRESS ASSOCIATION] that there had been attempts  by armed men to enter the building. He said security guards at  Shell House had fired warning shots in the air, but were forced  to open fire in self-defense.</p>

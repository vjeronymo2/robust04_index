			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Brazil and its constitution Brazil's legislators have an historic chance this week to improve the lot of the people who voted for them. On Wednesday they are due to start work on revising the country's 1988 constitution, which has been an important hindrance to sensible government. If the opportunity is used wisely, a big step will have been taken towards improving economic management. With presidential and congressional elections due next year, constitutional revision could even open the way for a more fundamental resolution of the country's difficulties. Part of the problem lies in the current constitution's sheer complexity. The best constitutions are relatively simple: that of the US and its 27 amendments can be printed on six sides of paper. By contrast, the Brazilian constitution's 123 pages represent more of a wish list from legislators after 20 years of military government than a coherent code of individual rights and state powers. This has made Brazil - already difficult to govern because of its size and diversity  - almost impossible to rule responsibly. It has been all too effective in constraining the federal government in the fight against inflation, doling out a huge proportion of federal government revenues to the states and municipalities but leaving the concomitant responsibilities - for example for education - with the federal government. As a result local governments have engaged in a frenzy of hiring and spending, while the central government has been faced with an increasing structural fiscal deficit. Rising inflation This deficit - the public sector borrowing requirement last year equalled 40 per cent of gross domestic product - has been driving inflation. Now touching 35 per cent a month, inflation could rise to 40 per cent by the year-end. That this has not already generated consensus among legislators on the dangers of the fiscal deficit reflects conventional Brazilian wisdom that unemployment is a greater problem than inflation, and continuing confidence in economic growth - this year expected to be about 5 per cent. Yet inflation is now calling the durability of that growth into doubt. Signs of public unrest - street protests and clashes between the police and the poor - suggest that traditional Brazilian passivity in the face of inflation is breaking down. In leading the campaign for a revision, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister, acknowledges that the current constitution is a source of fiscal indiscipline. The constitutional assembly should start by addressing the mismatch of revenues and responsibilities between the centre and the regions. Given Brasilia's own propensity for waste, responsibilities should be devolved to the regions rather than more revenues kept at the centre. Job restrictions Other constraints on sensible fiscal management can also be lifted. Constitutional provisions guaranteeing the jobs of government employees for life and providing them with unequalled benefits during work and retirement should be abolished. Those restrictions, which are holding up the privatisation of state-run companies, should be repealed. While they are about it, legislators might also consider lifting the restrictions on foreign investment in some industries - in particular mining. Ideally, any constitutional revision would go much further. The system inherited from the military which grants disproportionate say in Congress to the small north-eastern states should be revised. Powers to tax and spend should be devolved to the states, after which the poorest states should be helped by transparent and explicit transfers from Brasilia that depend more on genuine need than on influence-peddling. A far-sighted assembly would also take steps to consolidate the country's fragmented political system. There are 18 political parties in Congress and the votes of all the deputies from the four largest are required to obtain a simple majority in the lower house. Unfortunately, it may be too much to hope that a radically simplified and rational constitution will emerge at the end of this process. But if Brasilia's notorious political rivalries kill off even those modest proposals that would help get a grip on inflation, those responsible could well rue the day.</p>

			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Books: Into the vortex of this perilous abyss - As Lloyd's Names count their losses, Richard Lapper considers the historical roots of the recent crisis ULTIMATE RISK Adam Raphael Bantam Press Pounds 16.99, 336 pages The difficulty in writing now about Lloyd's of London is that the final chapters of the insurance market current crisis, the worst in its 300 year history, have still to be played out. Yet Ultimate Risk by Adam Raphael is a clear and entertaining history which helps explain the depth of the market's problems. Raphael, a loss-making Name himself, is properly critical of the past incompetence and inefficiency of many of the market's underwriters and agents, and of the regulatory weakness of Lloyd's council itself. But this is a balanced account, mercifully free of the conspiracy theories which have bedevilled some recent analyses. Indeed, Raphael writes: 'What is remarkable in a market driven by money, where opportunity for dishonesty is rampant, is not the surfacing of the odd fraud and the odd failure, but how infrequent they were.' Historical detail also helps puts the current crisis into perspective. Certainly shattering losses are nothing new for Lloyd's. For example, after a British merchant convoy was sunk off St Vincent in August 1780, half the market's underwriters went into bankruptcy. A commentary by John Weskett, a market veteran of the time, could serve equally well to describe the situation two centuries later: 'We see not a few instances even of tradesmen, shopkeepers, etc, lured by the golden, but delusive bait of Premiums, especially in time of War, drawn like Gudgeons into the Vortex of this perilous Abyss, Insurance.' Early losses paved the way for the consolidation and modernisation of the market. In the same way the Lloyd's scandals of the 1970s and early 1980s, the Savonita, Sasse and PCW affairs, underlined the inadequacy of the market's regulatory framework and provided the impulse for the reforms of 1982 and 1987. This modification of self-regulation proved inadequate. Lloyd's was impotent to control the mistakes and failures which led to the rapid growth of highly speculative reinsurance business during the 1980s, to which thousands of Names 'mostly of middling wealth' were attracted. Syndicates managed by agencies such as Gooda Walker and Feltrim were swamped when the market was hit by catastrophes like Piper Alpha - the North Sea oil rig explosion - in 1988 and hurricane Hugo - in the Caribbean - in 1989. Nor were the reforms sufficient to help Lloyd's cope with the unexpected and rapid increase in insurance claims from pollution and asbestos-related diseases. The scale and severity of these recent losses has prompted a new period of reform. Raphael says of the arrival in 1992 of an interventionist chairman, David Rowland, and an unconventional chief executive, Peter Middleton, - a motor cycle riding former monk and diplomat - 'signalled a new era'. Inevitably the latter chapters of the book - in which the record of the new regime is assessed - suffers from the fact that the events described are still unfolding. Already the market's loss for 1991, which Lloyd's will report next month, is now expected to exceed Pounds 2bn, for example. Later this year Lloyd's should know whether it will be possible to set up NewCo, an ambitious new reinsurance company into which it will transfer billions of pounds in asbestosis and pollution liabilities. Decisive developments could also take place in the US as the Clinton administration grapples with the possible changes of superfund laws, which was at the root of the market's exposure to pollution claims. Raphael acknowledges the importance of the new source of funds, but amid the clutter of day to day detail, these developments receive less reflective consideration than is warranted. For if the new regime is eventually successful in its efforts, the introduction last year of some Pounds 800m in corporate capital will be seen as a significant achievement, marking a decisive break with past traditions and habits. Raphael's account is inevitably sympathetic to the plight of the hundreds of investors whose lives have been ruined by their losses. Readers may quibble with the assertion that the fate of Names has evoked little sympathy in the press and that much recent comment has been motivated by schadenfreude - the joy that comes from watching other people's misfortunes. But fewer will argue with the claim that a settlement with the loss-makers is a necessary pre-condition for future recovery. At the end, though, Raphael hedges his bets. 'Lloyd's will probably survive, albeit in a very different form,' he says. 'The biggest financial smash this century is a possibility that cannot be ruled out. Yet the market has professional skills, a world famous brand name and an institutional resilience which should not be underestimated. The charge sheet is long, the obstacles ahead daunting, the recent history shaming, but the last act has still to be played . . . The show ain't over until the fat lady sings.'</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Bosnian Moslems split on peace map THE Moslem-led Bosnian leadership yesterday remained divided over whether to support the Vance-Owen peace plan dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. President Alija Izetbegovic, who was due to fly back to New York at the end of this week to give his government's reply to the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, is now expected to delay his return until next week. In the meantime, Mr Vance and Lord Owen are to have talks in Paris today with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in an attempt to persuade him to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept their peace plan. Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, said there were certain points in the plan on which the Moslems could not make further concessions. The ambassador indicated that, at a meeting of the collective Bosnian leadership in Sarajevo yesterday, there was a feeling that ethnicity remained the predominant criterion of the peace plan. 'I think the president is convinced that he cannot sell this plan without some critical, but not necessarily major, changes,' Mr Sacirbey said. Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic says the whole question of maps must be looked at again. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph today, he warns against any attempt to isolate the Bosnian-Serb leadership to force acceptance of all aspects of the Vance-Owen map, which would divide the republic into ethnic enclaves.' The reality of my position and that of my government is that we are faced with a daily task of convincing the Bosnian-Serb civilian population that they can ultimately gain from a negotiated settlement,' he says.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Cable company shrugs off float delay TeleWest, the UK's largest cable company, promised yesterday that its decision to postpone a flotation will not affect the speed with which it builds its cable networks. Mr Stephen Davidson, TeleWest finance director, said the company would spend around Pounds 200m this year building networks capable of providing television and telephone services to between 350,000 and 400,000 homes. 'The rate will probably increase next year,' he said. The company, owned by TCI of Denver - the world's largest cable operator - and US West, the American telephone company, said it had postponed a flotation that would have valued the company at around Pounds 1.7bn 'in the light of current stock market weakness'. The company said it would return to the markets when conditions were more favourable. Autumn is possible, but next year looks more likely. The company had been planning to sell only a minimum 25 per cent stake and was not desperate for money. For instance, on Tuesday TeleWest completed a Pounds 195m debt facility to pay for the construction of cable franchises in Scotland. Some industry specialists believed there could be as much as Pounds 1bn in the London syndication markets earmarked for cable construction. One reason that TeleWest had wanted to float was to give UK investors the opportunity to invest in a US-owned cable company. The decision was the third cable flotation postponed this week - following General Cable and Comcast UK Partners. There must now be doubt whether a further group, made up of Bell Canada International and Jones Intercable, will be able to go ahead with plans for an offering. Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the Independent Television Commission, was almost relieved yesterday that the flotations had been postponed. 'I have been unhappy about some of the valuations. The prices were too far ahead of the performance of the industry.' He did not believe that the flotation decision would affect investment or the speed at which cable networks would be built. The latest figures from the ITC for the first quarter show modest gains by the industry this year. On April 1 the total number of subscribers was 642,000 compared with 611,000 on January 1. The penetration rate - the ratio of those who can subscribe to those who actually do - dipped slightly from 21.9 per cent in January to 21.5 per cent on April 1. In the first quarter of last year the ratio was 21.6 per cent. The average penetration figure hides considerable variations. Birmingham, the most successful franchise in the UK, has a penetration rate of around 34 per cent. The number of telephone subscribers to cable networks is growing much more rapidly than television subscriptions. The total has risen from 314,000 in January to 377,000 in April.</p>

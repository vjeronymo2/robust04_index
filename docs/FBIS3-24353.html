			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yegor Gaydar by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA </F> observer Aleksandr Borin; place and date not given: "The  Terrible Temptation of Centrism"]    [Text] [Borin] Yegor Timurovich, the press today is  actively discussing the unexpected actions of Sergey Shakhray,  who voted in the Duma for political amnesty. The most diverse  theories are being advanced. Some people are even assuming that  there is some kind of secret conspiracy with the president, who  would prefer that the investigation not dot all the i's. Others,  conversely, see a behind-the-scenes agreement with the Duma  leaders. It is no accident, they say, that one of Shakhray's  men, Andrey Voykov, was placed at the head of its  administration. What are your ideas?    [Gaydar] Of course there is always the temptation to see the  authorities as crafty, perfidious, and far-sighted, but most  frequently this is not the way things really are. I do not  believe in complicated political schemes in general and I  certainly do not expect them from the present executive  authority. Politics, as a rule, is arranged more simply and  rigidly. Refined schemes involving multiple moves are usually  undermined by the rough current of life right in the first  stages. Therefore I absolutely do not believe in schemes  involving intricate intrigues on the part of the president.  Shakhray's position was a bit of a surprise to me too; to be  honest, I did not anticipate such a turn. All I can say is that  I completely reject the story that there was a  misunderstanding--"ah, we were not aware, ah, we did not know."  These people are intelligent enough to know and to be aware.  What is wrong? The hypothesis I came up with is this: The  terrible temptation of centrism gained a hold. Centrism as a  means of access to power. In politics, in my view, there exist  two completely different strategies. The first: You have your  own convictions and ideas about what the country needs. You  defend them, you fight for them. If you cannot defend them while  in power, you work with the opposition. That can take years,  perhaps decades. This political strategy proceeds from the idea  to the world view. The second strategy: Politics as the art of  staying in power. It presupposes the ability to react very  flexibly to the changing political waves, to skip from one to  another, to significantly change your outlook and points of  reference. Here it is absolutely necessary to prove that you are  the greatest centrist, that you are prepared to cooperate with  everyone. And if you have come from one particular side, in  order to prove that you are a centrist, naturally, you have to  make friends with representatives of the opposing side. You have  to hold out your hand to them, demonstrate your loyalty.  Speaking in extremely simple terms, I think it is here that we  find the basis of the political drift of Sergey Shakhray and  many other former democrats.    [Borin] But someone will say to you: "I have not betrayed  anybody, I simply changed my basic principles, my attitude  toward the matter."    [Gaydar] Oh, it is difficult to pretend here. It is  immediately apparent for whom the cause is the most important  thing and for whom it is terrible painful to lose all the  trappings of power. Because power is terribly attractive. It  makes a person unusually vulnerable. The prospect of suddenly  becoming simply an ordinary private individual again is terribly  frightening. I have seen this in people who, it seemed to me,  were absolutely not susceptible to it.    [Borin] When you retired, did you experience something like  this?    [Gaydar] No, I did not experience anything of the kind, not  at all. Although I understand that feeling quite well. That is,  I can see the tiny fragments from which such a feeling is  formed. People's attitude toward you changes. Endless problems  arise. You see boorishness. And many, many things like that.  Previously a person was great and everyone loved him, everyone  told him how intelligent he was, how valuable his opinion was,  how everyone wanted to make friends with him... And suddenly it  turns out that none of that was true, that now he is some kind  of weird half-wit. And in general what has he done? Moved from  one mistake to another? And why is he still in this position?  You must also figure out...    [Borin] People are rude to him, they remind him of the  laboratory chiefs who, they say, shook the entire country.    [Gaydar] I regret very much that Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin did not share his ideas about the laboratory chiefs  and prime ministers while he was working under me. As I recall,  he was very polite, unusually polite, I would say, to the point  of being sickening. Perhaps he simply did not know that one of  the principles adopted in cultured society is that the level of  politeness does not depend on whether a person is your superior  or not... So many of those who are in power today understand  what awaits them when they leave power. And some people are  terribly frightened by this. And then they are prepared to chain  themselves to their little chairs, thinking up all kinds of  reasons why they cannot leave. Policy has changed, everything  has changed, but they still have to be there.    [Borin] Are you talking about the upper echelons of power?    [Gaydar] Not necessarily at all. It is by no means only the  pompous forms of power that are attractive. The very connection  to power is already an immense temptation. Many of the most  diverse people ask to be included on one commission or another.  The very admission to the corridors of power, the possibility of  coming and participating in the process of decisionmaking, which  might very well turn out to be quite different from what you  would like--this is still a temptation. You were there, perhaps  you even said something that did not exactly fit in with what  the boss was saying, and the boss nodded, gave it some thought,  and did it his own way--but still there is the temptation. You  are fully aware that you are playing the role of a democratic  shield for the nomenklatura, but you are incapable of refusing.  I know excellent people who have not been able to refrain from  this. And if the boss wants to surround himself with such a  clique of former democrats, he will have absolutely no  difficulty finding the people he needs. Perhaps not the top  ones, not the most courageous, not the most intelligent, but  simply with some democratic past.    [Borin] While the democrats are squabbling amongst  themselves  and betraying one another, the real power remains in the hands  of the apparatchiks, the bureaucrats.    [Gaydar] Of course! There are such incredible masters here!  I  will give you one example. In September I accepted an invitation  to work in the government again. Literally a couple of days  later--current questions were being discussed at a  meeting--suddenly, quite unexpectedly, out of the blue, a note  from Finance Minister Fedorov concerning reorganization of the  government was brought up. The note was old, from July or  August, before I was working there. The essence of the note was  that the Ministry of Economics had to be abolished and all these  functions, for which I was responsible, would be concentrated in  the Ministry of Finance. After that it was assumed that I would  immediately jump down Fedorov's throat and start a terrible  fight with him and he would then beat me off and run to complain  to the higher authorities. I got together with Boris and we had  a few laughs. But situations like this are coming up constantly,  they are created brilliantly. And what sweet temptations the  apparatus throws out to you! Let us do all of this. And why do  you not do this little bit, which would be very good for the  family. How nice and splendid it will be, and everyone will be  so satisfied! To be honest, my colleagues laughed at me when I  made them write down in the gift book the presentation of some  kind of badge, etc. But it is my deep conviction that such  purism is actually useful. It simply teaches the apparatus that  such little things do not go so cheaply.    [Borin] Have there been attempts to approach you like that?    [Gaydar] Yes, of course there have. It is inevitable.    [Borin] So, are these kinds of intrigues inevitable? Are  there no methods of fighting against them?    [Gaydar] Well, what can I say. This is a subject that is  very  difficult to discuss, to describe. If you start to bring an  intriguer out into the open, to prove how he is twisting things  and lying--then the intrigue has already achieved its purpose.  You are damned if you do and damned if you don't... These,  unfortunately, are methods it is very difficult to combat in  direct and open polemic.    [Borin] You know, in our circle we always used to be afraid  of what they called losing face. We were sentimental in the good  sense of the word, if you will. The well-known words "Let us  hold hands, friends, so we do not fall alone" expressed our main  feelings, our aspirations. But now, it seems to me, the author  himself would no longer write them, sensing that they, alas, are  as if from another time.    [Gaydar] Yes, we have lost our sentimentality. I think this  is very bad. How did it happen? A very complicated question. I  would say this. There used to be a fairly simple arrangement: us  and them. They were the authorities. They were cruel and evil.  We were not the authorities. We could be destroyed and oppressed  by them, we were dependent on them. But we were intelligent,  honest, and good. We had our morality, we had our norms of  behavior. We could hold each other's hands. This is not out of  1937. It is the way things were at the end of the fifties and  beginning of the sixties. This is not the way it was with mass  terror, this is the way it was with a gentle authoritarian  regime which, by and large, did not bother anyone who did not  deliberately pick a fight with it. It allowed people to speak  their minds in their own homes, it allowed them to be  themselves, to be intelligent and worthy, as long as they did  not sneak up to it with leaflets and dynamite. It seems to me  that this is the basis of the intelligentsia culture from which  Okudzhava and many other excellent writers sprang. Incidentally,  in a certain sense these are the revived traditions of the  Russian intelligentsia, Russian society. That is the way it was  in the 19th century as well. Then too there was a gentle  authoritarian regime, there were also "us" and "them," and we  also had our own morality. In general it seems to me that gentle  authoritarianism which precludes direct contact with the  authorities is a fairly healthy environment for this kind of  intelligentsia culture and morality.    [Borin] And now? Is this the result of rubbing elbows with  the authorities?    [Gaydar] Things are much more complicated now. It is no  longer "us" and "them." Now the authorities are divided and  society is divided. There are many very different kinds of "us"  and many very different kinds of "them." I would never have  thought that people whom I knew well would suddenly end up in  the enemy camp, as our political opponents. Evil opponents. But  that is the way it has turned out. I went to the president and  vouched for some of my friends. He said to me: "This one did  this and that." I answered: "I do not believe it, that cannot  be."    [Borin] And how did it turn out?    [Gaydar] In various ways. Sometimes it was discovered that  it  was slander, an attempt to discredit somebody. But  sometimes--yes, alas, it was true.    [Borin] In the press today there are a lot of arguments  about  the position of the former procurator general Aleksey Kazannik.  They say that since he thought that political amnesty was  disgraceful he could refuse to implement this decree and then  retire. One thing is clear: A noble person ended up as a  plaything in the hands of the others in the procuracy. I am not  saying anything about the helplessness and inconsistency of the  presidential administration.    [Gaydar] I am not Aleksey Ivanovich's judge. By and large I  agree with him. The fight against the extremely dangerous Duma  decree could have and should have been waged long before it was  adopted. Well, what about Aleksey Ivanovich? In a certain sense  he is that kind of person. In my view, he is a man of high moral  qualities. To be honest, I expected nothing less of him.    [Borin] The period when you were in the government today is  called the "romantic," "heroic" period of our reforms. How is  this to be understood? When conducting the reforms, did you try  to stay within the confines of some moral rules? Not to lie, not  to promise what you could not deliver?    [Gaydar] I think you are right. Moreover, lying is an  economic category of the highest degree. Ruslan Imranovich tried  to prove to me that panic was not an economic category. He was  wrong, panic is absolutely an economic category. It exerts an  immense influence on the development of the entire complex of  financial processes. Stock exchange panic, foreign currency  panic, etc. So lying is also a completely economic category.  Something is always being demanded of the state, of the  politician. First: Either do not promise anything, or promise  something and try to do it. This, of course, is very dangerous  if certain dangerous and difficult things are promised. The  other extremely widespread policy is when you promise things but  you do not do them. In economics this is called discrepancy  between the budget based on commitments that have been made and  the budget based on financial flows. That is, you have promised  everything to everyone. And then: "Well, you see, there is none.  I will give you none, and you none, and I will not give you any  either." This is the underlying foundation for the extremely  severe financial crisis we are experiencing right now. It is  related to the attempt to implement precisely that policy since  the spring of 1993. Then, in the autumn, we tried to fight, to  do something. But not to the end. We did not manage to, we were  unable to. Such a policy is very risky. Because it discredits  the state. Extreme financial problems are created for all who  believed in the state. Millions of people suffer, ties are  disturbed among enterprises, suppliers of raw material,  suppliers of semimanufactured products, and suppliers of  electric energy. The immense economic chain is broken. And it is  all because it was convenient for me to say: "I will do this, I  will give it to you." And then go into another room and say: "Of  course, I will not give them a thing." That is a very vulnerable  economic policy. And if it is an economic policy of realism, I  assure you it has never led anyone to anything good and it never  will.    [Borin] For decades we have lived under the power of  favorites whose principle has been: After us, the flood. Does  this mean that they are raising their heads again.    [Gaydar] Well, generally speaking, of course.</p>

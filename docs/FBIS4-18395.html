			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Address to the Nation" by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on 4 </F> April 1994; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] My dear citizens, the local elections are behind  us. I am happy that, contrary to expectations certain circles  tried to create, the 27 March elections were held in peace,  without incidents. I am at peace before you. The True Path  Party emerged as the first party from these elections. We are  the first party throughout the country. I extend my gratitude  to our nation for the trust it showed in us.    The Turkish people have faith. They are attached to their  traditions. Nobody should try to use religion as a tool for  politics. We are the guarantee for freedom of religion and  freedom of conscience. We are also the guarantee of the basic  tenets of the state, mainly secularism. Do not worry. The law  of the Turkish Republic is binding and valid for everyone and  everywhere in Turkey.    Now is not the time to look back any more. We must look  forward. I am saying it clearly: We will fulfill our promises.    I saw once again that our people always know the right thing  to do. Our people are aware of our struggle against terrorism.  They appreciate that we managed to do in seven to eight months  what was not done in eight years. With your contributions, with  your trust in us, 1994 will be a final turning point in the  struggle against terrorism. I will fulfill my promise.  Terrorism will fall far back on Turkey's agenda.    My dear citizens, we are now ready for another struggle. A  struggle as important as the one against terrorism. The  struggle against an economy which over many years has been  turned into a big tangled knot.    Tomorrow, together with Mr. Karayalcin, our coalition  partner  and leader of the Social Democratic Populist Party, we will  disclose a brand new economic implementation plan. Tomorrow  will be the start of a new era, the harbinger of improvement  that will follow. We will carry out radical reforms no  political government or leader dared implement before us. We  will lay the foundation of structural changes in the economy.  Before all else, we will carry out a revolution of mentality,  of mind sets.    These are difficult decisions. Maybe, in the first stage,  they will hurt. However, we do not have an alternative. This is  not a matter of choice. It is certainly not a political  maneuver. Nor does it have any arbitrary aspects whatsoever.    Together, we will make a sacrifice for the future of our  country, for the future of our children. Everyone will put his  share in this sacrifice in line with his or her economic  ability. We will make social justice and social consensus  sovereign. You gave me your consensus in the fight against  terrorism. We made progress. Now it is the turn of the  economy. We will break the chains of the economy. We will  break the chains of its difficulties. We will eliminate the  vicious circle of debts, interest, and foreign exchange. We  will save our youths from being jobless in the future. We will  really crush the head of the monster called inflation. We will  make the people's money the people's money. We will make the  Turkish money, our national monetary unit, trustworthy. We will  grow economically with sound resources. We will do this so that  Turkey's future will not be blocked, so that it will be open and  well-lit.    This will be a very comprehensive program. It will be a  restructuring, a kind of rejuvenation, never tried before and  involving all the sectors. I am not hiding it: In the  beginning we might have difficulties. Protests might come not  only from our civil servants, workers, shopkeepers, and farmers,  but from the wealthy sectors as well. However, you should know  that if our nation is to put these difficulties behind and look  to the future with confidence, we must take this medicine. We  might have temporary difficulties, but we will certainly gain a  healthy constitution. We will erase all the bad elements of  this inherited responsibility. We will break our links to the  past, to the mistakes of the past, and start a new era. I trust  your patriotism.    That is what makes us different. This is the spirit and  mentality which defines our political character.    My dear citizens, I am calling on you: Let us win this war  together, hand in hand. Let us get rid of the dark clouds  hovering over the country. Let us make our current difficulties  the harbingers of a happy future. Let us emerge victorious from  the economic liberation war. Our nation is strong enough to  succeed in that. Now is not the time for politics, for petty  calculations, or for egotistical interests. We are responsible  before history. Let us write our history. We are responsible  for our future. We are responsible toward our children. We all  have a duty to perform at this historic turning point. As  individuals, as a nation, we will succeed in performing this  difficult duty. History will cite 5 April 1994 as the turning  point of Turkey's economic liberation. Together, with  dedication, we will end this dark period and create light.    Everything for a proud and powerful Turkey. Everything for a  modern, dynamic, and peaceful Turkey. Everything for a  developed, faithful, stable, leader that is Turkey.    I greet you all with respect.</p>

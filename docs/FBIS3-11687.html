			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 23 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Congress  President Humberto Lucena, a centrist, today ruled out a  possible declaration of a state of national defense, restricting  constitutional guarantees, over a confrontation pitting the  Executive Branch and the Armed Forces against the Legislative  Branch and the Federal Supreme Court [STF].    Lucena indicated that the rumors that circulated today in  the  federal legislative chambers have been prompted "by the creative  imagination of pessimists." In his opinion, the institutional  crisis must be overcome without altering the independence and  harmony among the three branches of government.    Official sources reported that at Planalto Palace, the  government's seat, Brazilian President Itamar Franco discussed  the political situation today with conservative Deputy Inocencio  de Oliveira, the Chamber of Deputies president, and the official  spokesmen in Congress.    Judicial Branch sources said Attorney General Aristides  Junqueira has become a mediator between the government and the  STF and has studied a formula with Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso to overcome the crisis.    Junqueira expressed his disagreement with the fact that a  controversy on salaries and salary equity among the three  branches of government had jeopardized institutional stability.    The STF decided on a 10.9-percent salary increase for court  justices and employees with the goal of compensating for  possible losses in the conversion of real cruzeiros into the  Real Value Unit (URV) system, using dollars and the future  Brazilian currency as a reference.    Franco and his finance minister denied the increase's  payment  to the STF because they believe it violates the presidential  decree implementing the URV system.    In light of the unilateral approval of the increases for the  STF and Congress, which today preferred to abolish a similar  increase, military leaders have taken the dust off a  constitutional provision authorizing the president to declare a  state of national defense.    According to various newspapers, after implementing this  measure, the government and the Armed Forces would move up the  congressional elections, scheduled for 3 October, even though  Franco would complete his term that ends on 1 January 1995.    Franco's strong position toward the STF is supported by the  Armed Forces, which often complain about their low salaries, and  the public.    With the declaration of a state of national defense, the  right to assembly, secrecy of the postal service and  communications, occupation of public property, and services are  restricted and people may be arrested without a court order,  even though their arrest must be immediately reported to a judge.    Although it goes into effect with the president's signature,  a state of defense must be confirmed within a 10-day period by  Congress and, if rejected, it expires immediately.    If a state of defense is confirmed by Congress, it will be  effective for one month and may be extended for another month.</p>

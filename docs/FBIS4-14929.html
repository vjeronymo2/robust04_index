			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 14, 28 Mar 3 </F> Apr 94]    [Text] In accordance with the President's Decree of  October 1993 "On State Contract and State Order for 1994" the  Ministry of agriculture and foodstuffs of Ukraine, together with  other involved ministries, departments and agencies, drafted  schemes and mechanisms for forming the state's stock's of  agricultural products and raw materials in 1994.    The State Contract envisages procurement of 14 million tons  of grain, 1.56 million tons of oil crop seeds (basically,  sunflower seed), 25 million tons of white beet roots. Under the  state's agreements with agricultural growers and producers the  state's centralized fund is to stock 703,000 tons of meat and  meat products, 1,960 million eggs, 4,140,000 tons of milk and  dairy products, 636,000 tons of potatoes, 434,000 tons of  vegetables, other products and raw materials.    To make the State Contract materialize, the producers should  be paid 38.8 trillion karbovanets.    As Nikolay Solodki, chief of the Ministry's Main Agency for  food resources, disclosed at a Collegium meeting, as of March 28  contracts were concluded with Ukraine's agricultural producers  (collective and state farms) to the tune of 32 trillion  karbovanets.    Under the contracts' terms 25 per cent of the  contract-specified sums are payable within 10 days. However,  the farms were paid only 4.2 trillion karbovanets including 2.5  trillion karbovanets in short-term (up to 90 days) credits,  which cannot but have a braking effect on the vernal sowing  campaign's progress.    Ukraine's state stocks of agricultural products are  estimated  currently at 4.2 trillion karbovanets. However, their  realization domestically or marketing abroad are hampered by too  high prices, which exceed twofold the world market's averaged  ones, which questions earning the required sums.    Ukrainian Minister for agriculture and foodstuffs Yuri  Karasik attributes these too high agricultural product prices to  unwarranted fuel price raises, particularly in 1993's second  semester, when Ukrainian fuel prices exceeded the world market's  averaged ones fivefold (at about 18 million karbovanets per ton  of oil), allegedly due to the Ukrainian oil refineries' low  performance in deep processing of crude petroleum.    This year, however, the Ukrainian government is reported to  have solved the problem of purchasing a part of necessary fuels  abroad at prices not exceeding 140 USD per ton.    No state loans are envisaged in 1994 and no credits will be  granted to support the State Order, Nikolai Golub,  vice-president of the "Ukraina" agrobank, said speaking at the  Agricultural Ministry Collegium's session.</p>

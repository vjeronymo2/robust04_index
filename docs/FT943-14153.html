			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bonds and dollar lift Dow higher Wall Street A sharp rise in bonds and a rally in the dollar helped US share prices post big gains across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 34.97 at 3,739.25. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 4.68 at 453.41, while the American Stock Exchange Composite finished 2.31 higher at 430.04 and the Nasdaq composite up 4.61 at 723.96. Trading volume on the NYSE was 321m shares. After three days of minimal movement from blue-chip stocks, share prices took off yesterday, fuelled by a surprising rally in the recently-depressed bond market. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up almost 1 1/2 points, and its yield was down to 7.537 per cent. The gains in bonds were prompted by a variety of factors, including rumours of a US military invasion of Haiti (later denied by the Pentagon), strong retail demand, and short-covering by dealers. The key factors in the bond market's advance, however, were yesterday's economic releases. First, the latest weekly jobless claims data showed a bigger-than-expected rise in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance and then the June retail sales figures came in slightly weaker than forecast. Together, the data cheered fixed-income investors because it suggested that the economy might not be as strong as feared, and therefore, that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest again to slow it down. Stock market investors were delighted by the drop in long-term interest rates as measured by the 30-year yield. Another modest rise in the value of the dollar - which climbed to Y98.56 and DM1.5541 in late New York trading - also lifted share prices. Chrysler rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/4 in early trading after the company announced record second quarter profits of Dollars 956m, up from Dollars 685m a year ago. Later in the day, however, profit-taking made the stock give up its gains, and Chrysler ended down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 49 3/8 . General Motors and Ford, which are also expected to report stronger earnings for the quarter, were up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52 1/4 and down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 , respectively. JP Morgan fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 61 after reporting second quarter earnings of Dollars 350m, down from Dollars 431m a year earlier, in the wake of disappointing securities trading revenues. A broad range of cyclical, technology and blue-chip stocks were in demand, with IBM up Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 58 1/4 , Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 51 5/8 and AT&amp;T up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 54 1/2 . Talk that the collapse of the merger between CBS and QVC might spark takeover interest in CBS lifted the television group's stock Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 313 3/4 . QVC, which is the subject of a Dollars 44 a share offer from Comcast, rose Dollars 1 7/16 to Dollars 43 7/16 as investors bet that Comcast would have to raise its bid to be successful. Canada Toronto prices posted a strong overall advance in line with New York. The TSE-300 composite index added 55.19 points, or 1.33 per cent, to close at 4,195.74, as winning issues led losers by 462 to 260. Volume rose to 62.88m shares valued at CDollars 782.6m compared with 56.15m worth CDollars 665.1m on Wednesday. Thirteen of the 14 sub-indices were higher, with the management group up 3.17 per cent to lead the way. The mining group was up 2 per cent, consumer products, financial services and energy were each up more than 1 per cent on index, while industrial products was up nearly 1 per cent and golds showed little change. Alberta Energy reported solidly higher six-month earnings, and the stock was up  3/8 to CDollars 22 1/2 . Ranchmen's Resources, up  1/8 to CDollars 7 1/2 , said it has increased its 1994 capital spending budget to CDollars 40m from CDollars 30m, largely because of the higher price of oil. Videotron gained  1/2 to CDollars 12 3/4 despite reporting slightly lower nine-month earnings. Brazil Share prices in Sao Paulo closed up 4.57 per cent in heavy trade boosted by renewed upbeat sentiment over Brazil's presidential race. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-traded shares ended up 1,756 at 40,165 points. In Rio, the ISENN rose 3.8 per cent to 15,335 points. Volume was 245.3m reais (Dollars 265.2m). Stocks have rallied 10.8 per cent since the introduction of the new currency. Prices bounced back from losses earlier this week on hopes based on a poll that Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso can win the forthcoming presidential election.</p>

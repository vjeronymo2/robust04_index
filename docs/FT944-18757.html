			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Camus on revolution It is an excellent idea to revive The Just by Albert Camus in the mid-1990s  -the kind that one might have hoped would have arisen in the Royal National Theatre. The play is based on the abortive attempt at Russian revolution in 1905 when the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovitch was assassinated. Yet, written in the late 1940s, it is really about the debate within the French left: how far should you go in supporting Stalinism (or any party), right or wrong? How far should you stick to revolutionary violence if you believe that the ultimate end is benign? And, if you have to assassinate children along with the Grand Duke, for how long do you believe that the end justifies the means? Those are old questions. They do not necessarily become less interesting with the collapse of communism. As this production at the Camden Studio Theatre is clever enough not to stress overtly, there was quite a lot of Stalinism, and violence for its own sake, in the IRA. So The Just is both a period piece, historically fascinating, and still just about topical. The trouble is that Camus, for all his intellect, was not much of a playwright. He thought, as was the French fashion of the time, that the theatre could be used to debate ideas without taking much account of character, feeling, plot or variety. The Just has the touch of a seminar on moral philosophy. Yet it is a better piece than I remembered. Occasionally - when, for example, we are waiting to hear whether a shooting takes place - there is drama. And the ideas under discussion can hardly be dismissed as trivial. A relatively young audience at the Camden Studio seemed to find them riveting. It is also always possible to make an unexpected character come to life. The example here is Skouratov, the chief of police, played by Eldridge Adolfo. I doubt if even Camus, who was clearly a subtle man, would have seen him as the most enigmatic figure in the piece. But that is how he is: a civilised man trying to preserve order in an unstable state. An unusual amount of sympathy also goes to the Archduke's family: Camus was a bit more radical than that. Some of this interpretation may be put down to the acting. Those who play the old order are better performers than those who seek to launch the revolution. Still perhaps that, too, is deliberate: we are all conservatives now. This revival is directed by Kate Schaffer as part of Grande Designe Theatre Company. It is a reminder to more established theatres that there are old texts worth looking at. Camden Studio, Offstage Bookshop, NW1 (071 916 4040).</p>

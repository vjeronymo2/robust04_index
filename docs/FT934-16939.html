			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Stiffer parking fines for London MOTORISTS who park illegally in any of three London boroughs face stiffer penalties from today under parking laws due to spread throughout the capital over the next 10 months. Hammersmith and Fulham, Bromley and Lewisham have taken over routine parking enforcement from the police by becoming 'special parking areas'. The boroughs will employ their own parking attendants who will be able to issue a new type of ticket known as penalty charge notices. These carry a fine of Pounds 30 to Pounds 60 depending on the area. There will be a 50 per cent discount for motorists who pay within 14 days. Persistent offenders with outstanding fines will be clamped - and from next year will not be released until they have paid what they owe. The declamping fee will be Pounds 38. Where illegal parking obstructs traffic, cars will be towed away rather than clamped. Revenue from the scheme will go to the local authority which can use it to cover the cost of the scheme, provide extra parking and improve public transport.</p>

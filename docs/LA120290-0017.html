			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> . . . Actor -- and dance man -- Gregory Hines makes his directing debut in  January with "Gotta Dance," an independent feature about an L.A. youth who has  to choose between street life and the hard work that could lead to a dance  career.  </P> <P> . . . Cursed: After making Jamaicans the bad guys in "Marked for Death," 20th  Century Fox has done it again in "Predator 2."  </P> <P> . . . Academy Awards night isn't until March 25, but the studios are already  jockeying for position -- taking out ads in the trades touting upcoming  screenings of their films for Academy members. Next up will be those ads  "suggesting" particular Oscar nominations (to be announced Feb. 13). Stay  tuned.  </P> <P> . . . No, all those topiaries decorating the Fox lot aren't the notion of a  landscape-minded executive. The dozen or so pieces of artificial foliage --  clipped in such shapes as penguins, dinosaurs and Elvis -- are left over from  "Edward Scissorhands," the new movie from director Tim Burton that's due out  Dec. 7.  </P></p>

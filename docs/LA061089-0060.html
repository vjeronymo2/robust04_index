			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORTAR ATTACK BLACKS OUT PART OF NORTH NICARAGUA; CONTRAS BLAMED  </P> <P> Rebels attacked the country's most important hydroelectric plant with mortar  fire, blacking out the northern provincial capital of Jinotega and surrounding  towns for several hours, government radio said Friday.  </P> <P> The Central America plant, north of Jinotega, was damaged in the Thursday night  attack, and an undetermined number of people were wounded, a Voice of Nicaragua  broadcast said.  </P> <P> Sources in Jinotega, 100 miles north of Managua, said that the Contras also  blew up electrical poles along the road between the city and the plant. A  spokesman for the Nicaraguan Energy Institute said power was restored to the  area at mid-morning Friday.  </P> <P> The U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista government signed a temporary  cease-fire in March, 1988, but efforts to extend the accord into a permanent  truce have not borne fruit. The government has extended the cease-fire  unilaterally on a monthly basis, but sporadic attacks have continued.  </P> <P> Rebel responsibility was denied by Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros in a  telephone interview.  </P></p>

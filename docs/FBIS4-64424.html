			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing a True Path Party  [TPP] meeting today, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, leader of the  TPP, pointed out that the Turkish economy is being negatively  affected by the economic embargo against Iraq.    [Begin Ciller recording] The oil pipeline system, which  constitutes a valuable investment for both Turkey and Iraq, has  been left idle for three years and faces the danger of damage  and rotting. An agreement has been reached to carry out a sort  of rescue operation in order to eliminate this danger. In this  way, when the oil embargo is lifted in the future, the system  will be able to function uninterruptedly. [end recording]    Ciller explained that oil will be pumped to the pipeline and  that food, medicine, and certain basic necessities will be sent  to Iraq in return. The prime minister denied reports that the  United States gave Turkey a note in connection with this matter.  She stressed that the allies realize that this situation arose  because of a technical necessity.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Finns start the long road to Brussels: How the country sees its future as part of the European Community MUCH as the Finns hate to be seen copying their neighbours and traditional rivals in Scandinavia, tomorrow they are expected to follow Sweden's example and make a formal application to Brussels for European Community membership. The majority of Finnish politicians and industrialists see EC membership as vital to Finland's economic interests at a time when the country is suffering from a severe recession and a decline in trade with the former Soviet Union, once one of its most important trading partners. If parliament votes tomorrow in favour of applying for membership, the government aims to start membership talks as soon as possible and will join its fellow Efta-members, Sweden and Austria, in parallel negotiations. Its aim is to be a full member of the EC in 1995, but will hold a referendum before a final decision to join. EC membership is firmly supported both by the opposition Social Democrats and by the Conservative Party, which rules in a coalition with the Centre Party. But the issue has proved a difficult one for Prime Minister Esko Aho's Centre Party. His party represents the country's farmers, many of whom are concerned that EC membership will spell an end to their generous subsidies. Mr Ilkka-Christian Bjorklund, a member of the Social Democrats' EC working group, says: 'The Centre Party has faced a dilemma. It is the most anti-EC of the three parties, but it has been forced to lead the EC application because it knows that if it opposed EC membership the existing Conservative-Centre government would split and it would be succeeded by the Red-Blue Finland's previous Conservative-Social Democrat governments)'. However, Mr Bjorklund predicts that there will be no problem in winning parliamentary approval for membership. 'Even if it's in our interests to fight against this government, we think that this is a matter of national and historic interest and we have no intention of jeopardising it.' Three weeks ago, the Centre-Conservative government agreed to apply for EC membership provided it received parliamentary approval, saying 'Finland can best pursue its national interests as a member of the European Community.' The Confederation of Finnish Industries (CFI) pointed to the important economic and trade benefits of EC membership in a recent statement, saying that it would 'lower domestic costs and prices to a competitive European level' and 'stimulate exports and domestic investment as well as allow the possibility to influence the future development of the Community.' It adds that Finland would become 'more appealing' to Russia as a trading partner, and would be able to join in the closer co-operation between the EC and the central and eastern European countries. However, it is on the matter of economic and monetary union (Emu) that the CFI sees the clearest advantages: the fact that Emu remains outside the scope of the European Economic Area 'necessitates Finnish membership in the EC,' the Confederation says. The advantages would include lower interest rates, stable exchange rates, and lower state budget deficit and debt levels. Such a scenario seems all the more attractive in the light of Finland's current economic woes: GNP fell by 6 per cent in 1991, unemployment hovers around 10 per cent, and three-month money market rates soared to nearly 15 per cent last autumn, although they have fallen back to around 12 per cent since the devaluation of the markka in November 1991. On a more positive note, annual inflation is gradually falling, reaching 2.6 per cent in February, down from 2.9 per cent in January and 5.0 per cent in February 1991. While industrialists and politicians are excited about the economic advantages of joining the EC, Finland's small but outspoken farming community is less enthusiastic. Agriculture accounts for a mere 3.9 per cent of Finland's GDP and 7 per cent of the workforce, but the sector receives generous subsidies. Mr Jarmo Vaittinen, of the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners, is resigned to the fact that Finland will apply for EC membership, but adds: 'we must get EC members to understand our special climate - we want the EC to understand why Finland has subsidised agriculture, why we need to keep a big country populated, because it is vital for us and for the EC to keep the north populated.' Mr Erkki Tuomioja, a Social Democratic MP, says he expects Finland 'will get a fair deal on agriculture ..subsidies will have to be adjusted and phased out gradually and there will be a period of adjustment.' Plans to make Finnish agriculture more competitive include a more favourable tax burden and low-interest loans to encourage farmers to increase the size of their farms. 'Agriculture is very, very small in terms of GNP, but very important in terms of population,' says Mr Keijo Korhonen, former Finnish UN ambassador and now editor-in-chief of Kainuun Sanomat, a Centre Party newspaper in Northern Karelia. Mr Korhonen opposes EC membership, warning that if Finland makes sacrifices on agriculture, it will lead to higher unemployment and 'pauperisation.' He also believes membership would compromise Finland's neutrality, adding that Finland cannot afford to take risks on its security given its historical relations with Russia and the fact its powerful neighbour is in a potentially unstable state. 'When it comes to supranational decisions (in the EC) our own weight would be very very small indeed. Quite simply the cost of membership outweighs the benefits,' he says. Whatever his views though, a national poll taken by Gallup in mid-February showed that 55 per cent of those questioned thought EC membership would provide more advantages for Finland, 21 per cent thought it would bring disadvantages and 23 per cent couldn't tell.</p>

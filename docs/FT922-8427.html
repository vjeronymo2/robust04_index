			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Germany's engineering union gives employers ultimatum OPEN hostilities between Europe's biggest trade union and the mighty German engineering industry will break out on May 25 unless employers improve their 3.3 per cent pay offer. The industry - which produces annual sales of DM1,000bn (Dollars 606bn) - has been given until the end of this week. Announcing his ultimatum and the starting date for the long-expected strike, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of the IG Metall union, which represents 4m engineering workers, said yesterday that his only options now were 'capitulation or strike'. Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, said its 3.3 per cent offer remained the basis for any further negotiation. A deal approaching last year's 6.7 per cent would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, added Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the association president. Both sides have rejected arbitration. A structured deal giving more to the lower paid, similar to that agreed in the recent 5.4 per cent public sector settlement, is also ruled out. The union claimed yesterday that such 'social elements' were unsuitable in a workforce where pay ranged from DM2,000 to DM6,000 a month. In the absence of a new offer, Mr Steinkuhler said, an extraordinary union executive meeting would be called next Monday to decide which regional members would be balloted for strike action. Voting would be from May 20 to 22. The dates ann-ounced yesterday comprise the final data needed to complete the programming of a strike which seemed inevitable from the start of negotiations in early March. If it follows its tradition of seeking maximum effect with minimum outlay in terms of strike pay, IG Metall is most likely to start by calling out suppliers to the motor industry. The industry employs some 900,000 and has annual sales of almost DM300bn. Beyond the pre-strike rhetoric, there is wide agreement that German manufacturing industry faces a drastic slimming cure as it strives to restore competitiveness and cut unit labour costs. However, most plans are based on natural wastage and early retirement. Employers' threats of job losses have yet to make much impression on a workforce determined not to see living standards undermined. Forced redundancies are rare and difficult to implement in the rigid German labour market, and unemployment benefits are about two-thirds of basic pay. SPD attacks Kohl, Page 2</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to a report from the Commerce Ministry,  during the negotiations on tax reduction under the General  Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, the United States demanded that  Thailand reduce its tariffs imposed on cinematographic film  imports from 10 to 2 baht per meter. However, Thailand insisted  on the minimum rate of 5 baht per meter and would agree to  further lower the tariffs only if the United States removes it  from the (PWL) watchlist.    Regarding the U.S. call for the calculation of import tax  based on the value of the imports, the Finance Ministry said  that it could not give up the present calculation system, which  is based on the condition of the imported goods. However,  futher details of the present tax calculation system will be  spelled out in the memorandums on trade with the United States  and New Zealand so as to convince the two countries that their  exports to Thailand will not be subject to high import duties,  at least, not higher than those calculated in the U.S.-proposed  system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Difficulties in the negotiations with the  Palestinians in Paris: The chief Israeli and PLO delegates to  the economic talks, Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and  Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], held another tete-a-tete this  afternoon in an effort to overcome the outstanding problems.  Our correspondent Eldad Beck reports from Paris:    Both the Israeli and the Palestinian delegations realized  last night that the fundamental discrepancies between their  stands on the main unresolved problem -- import regime and  customs -- are unbridgeable. The sides failed to reach  compromise despite the vigilant participation in the discussions  of the two chief delegates, who are again meeting tete-a-tete at  this very moment.    We have learned from the Israeli delegation that the  negotiating teams are treading water and that the positive  atmosphere, which prevailed past week, has changed noticeably.    In view of the difficulties, and since both sides realize  they will be unable to reach an agreement this week, the current  round of talks is expected to end tomorrow as planned.    The issue of the import regime and customs got stuck over  the  question of whether the sides should reach a basic agreement on  this matter, working out the details on the basis of this, or  whether they should start immediately discussing the list of  products to which import regulations and customs rates will  apply. The Palestinians are insisting on deciding on their own  customs for numerous items of equipment for the industrial and  agricultural development of the territories. [passage omitted]</p>

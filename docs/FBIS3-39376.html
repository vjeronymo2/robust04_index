He </F> Will Be the Powder, We Will Be the Fuse"]    [Text] Bormio -- This is how, with audacious metaphor,  [League Secretary] Umberto Bossi, before sitting down at the  table at a time when he usually goes to bed, put the problem to  his grassroots supporters who are not exactly jubilant at his  marriage of convenience with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi.  "We will be the fuse and he will be the powder." Indeed, it is  an unusual enough marriage: That is clear, since not all the  grassroots League supporters gladly accept the embrace of the  smooth TV mogul, nicknamed Cavaliere [the Cavalier], and his  impeccable squires. The marriage was, however, the only way  open and perhaps "the lesser of two evils" as Umberto Bossi, in  his own version of realpolitik said in Bormio: It was the price  that had to be paid to beat "the communists" and to leave the  door to government ajar for the League, "slitting the Christian  Democratic Party's [DC] throat from ear to ear." It was  precisely to convince his party that Bossi spent a good half of  his rally in the Alps on Saturday night [12 February] at Alberto  da Giussano's party on skis, in front of 1,500 fans in jackets  and apres-ski wear.    The League secretary distanced himself slightly from events.  From the stage, he retold the story of these last few months:  the lost battle of the municipal elections, the arrest of  Patelli, caught by "a bomb planted two years ago," the  preconference meeting at Assago and the unfolding of a strategy  largely based on [League lower house floor leader] Maroni's  raids. Maroni had been sent out to negotiate with [Pact for  Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary]  Martinazzoli's group just to reveal its inalienable social  democratic nature. In Bormio, Umberto Bossi placed [Judge] Di  Pietro among the "villains" since he helped support the  anti-League maneuvering "of the large Italian families" in the  Patelli case. Now, finally it is the "year of the samurai," the  year when accounts will be settled for transformations like  those of [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto  and Martinazzoli, for whose "plastic surgery we would need 17  surgeons working together, and maybe even that would not be not  enough."    Yes, this electoral campaign that started with Berlusconi  entering the race and the arrest of Paolo Berlusconi at almost  the same time "will spare nobody: They will use every means,  nobody will be spared, I repeat nobody" Bossi predicted. His  speech conjured up the image of a whole blaze of "missile  attacks"; fireworks, while "the problem is to truly change" the  country. Bossi reasoned that to prevent being isolated the  League needed a shore "against the pole of statism and  centralism," Christian Democrats, the left, and [National  Alliance leader] Fini -- "the fascist Fini" -- it needed a prop  to even out the road to federalism in both the north and the  south. He said: "We reckoned on it and we saw in the local  elections that they can defeat us in the north because it is not  easy for us to unite the people: We do not have TV access and  we do not yet have the newspapers." Then his big idea begins to  take shape: "We must invent a party that is no longer statist,  no longer centralist, and that perhaps is not yet federalist  like the League, a party that bridges the gap between the old  and the new," good enough to present to the south. In short, a  kind of party omnibus, perhaps a little amphibian, too. Bossi  finally met with Berlusconi and the TV cameras at Arcore. Bossi  also commented that it is necessary to "create the reins to  somehow put the League in the hands of this superintelligent and  irresistible Cavaliere" to win people over, even south of the Po  Valley. Thus, when, on the road to Brianza, Berlusconi stepped  forward "it went so well we did not even go to see the troops."    Silvio Berlusconi himself, who "before, went with the old  regime, like all entrepreneurs," is now ready. "When we saw him  I said: `This is the container in which we will bear the ruins  of the DC.'" Berlusconi has now been transformed into a wide  net. This then "is the reason for the agreement, while the  League, my friends, is going straight ahead with no turning  back." This holds true even if, in the south, "Berlusca" is  with Fini, who wants to land in Milan but must be careful  "because we will never give you the north, dear Fini." Now, the  League is ready to govern to "lead the way for change." The  applause begins but is a little muted. The realpolitik is fine,  but, for these League diehards the rose-colored Berlusconi still  looks like an alien come down from a sky that does not resemble  theirs.</p>

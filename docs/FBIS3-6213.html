			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 12 (YONHAP) -- GEC Alsthom, selected as  priority negotiator on the supply of trainsets to the projected  Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway line, has agreed to transfer its  TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) technology individually to members  of the consortium to be formed for the project, instead of  through any particular member, Daewoo Heavy Industries, Ltd.  said over the weekend.    Late last year, the French company named Hyundai Precision  &amp;  Industry Co. as the consortium's prime contractor in order to  transfer its technology only through Hyundai, but the agreement  was a reversal of this decision.    Under the agreement, GEC Alsthom will transfer its  technology  related to the manufacture of TGV locomotives and coaches  equally to consortium members, the officials said.    Daewoo and GEC Alsthom will negotiate details of the  technology transfer and consortium forming in the near future,  they added.    Because of the agreement between Daewoo and GEC Alsthom, the  forming of a consortium for the production of high-speed  trainsets will be expedited, along with the negotiations between  the government and the French firm for the final contract.    Officials of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry Co. refused to  make any official comments on the Daewoo-GEC Alsthom agreement  but unofficially welcomed it, saying it would expedite the  forming of the consortium.</p>

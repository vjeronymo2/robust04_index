Lambeck: "Consternation in the CDU/CSU </F> Following Schaeuble's Speech"]    [Text] Bonn -- Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CDU  [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU [Christian Social Union]  Bundestag Group, has called on the the CDU and CSU to urgently  display unity. At a meeting of the CDU/CSU Bundestag Group  yesterday, he said: "There is nothing that we need less than  for public opinion to perceive the CDU/CSU as lacking unity and  being in disagreement." Regarding the latest dispute between  the CDU and CSU over the early announcement of the future  CDU/CSU presidential candidate, Roman Herzog, Schaeuble said  that he did not want to raise the issue once again.    However, at a meeting of the group's executive board the  previous evening, he clearly set out his position on the  dispute. CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze said that he would  also have preferred a more orderly procedure for presenting  Herzog as the presidential candidate. Some of the party is now  annoyed with Hintze for having made CSU Chairman Theo Waigel's  mistake of speaking about Herzog too soon a public issue.  Michael Glos, chairman of the CSU Land Group, was also present  but did not take part in the debate. A former CDU minister  said: "It was not a professional political job. We have a  difficult election year ahead of us. Every dispute is  unnecessary."    Schaeuble issued an appeal to deputies in the same vein. He  said that the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] has  created an "impression of unity" since its party congress in  Wiesbaden. For the first time in a long time, it now stood a  chance of winning power. There is "dissatisfaction" in the  population with those "who bear responsibility for the  government." The population now believes that a change of  government following the Bundestag election is "possible or  likely." The group chairman said: "The combination of red and  green no longer frightens people."    If public opinion continues to perceive the CDU/CSU and the  coalition as disunited that will have "serious consequences."  Schaeuble warned: "Citizens rightly want action instead of  disputes. Every disagreement harms the coalition partners."    Some deputies reacted to Schaeuble's warnings with  consternation. Deputy Herbert Werner openly criticized  Schaeuble's, saying that it provided little motivation. Other  members of the Bundestag said that it was not a speech to mark  the beginning of election year. In addition, Schaeuble did not  even mention the chancellor once.    Schaeuble, who wants to shake up the CDU/CSU, did, however,  set out his program at the meeting of the group's executive  board. He said that the CDU/CSU has to be particularly active  in four areas: economic and employment policy; foreign, defense,  and EU [European Union] policy; domestic security policy, and  the strengthening of the family. Schaeuble said: "There are  very few areas in which the CDU/CSU has to make it clear that it  is more competent."</p>

			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sales at Mitsubishi Motors surge 6.2% MITSUBISHI Motors, the Japanese car-maker, moved sharply ahead in Japan's domestic vehicle market last year, increasing sales by 6.2 per cent in a market that declined by 3.2 per cent. It grabbed market share at the expense of big producers such as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda. Mitsubishi is now firmly in third place behind Toyota and Nissan, with 10 per cent of the market, while Honda is trailing in fourth place with 8.8 per cent. Mitsubishi's success is particularly bad news for Toyota, the largest producer and one which has dominated the luxury end of the market, where profits are highest. Mitsubishi's success is due largely to is popular Diamante luxury model. Toyota saw its domestic market share fall by nearly 1 percentage point to 31.3 per cent, while sales, measured by registrations, declined by 5.9 per cent. Nissan held up somewhat better, with sales off by 4.2 per cent, giving it a market share of 17.9 per cent. Mazda saw its sales fall by 7 per cent, in spite of the introduction of a new luxury model, giving it a share of 7.3 per cent. Toyota's vehicle production last year declined by 3 per cent to 4.08m units, with passenger car production off by 5 per cent to 3.12m. With domestic sales declining, exports posted a 1.6 per cent gain to 1.7m vehicles. Overseas production was off by 1.2 per cent to 669,741 vehicles. Nissan posted a 3.6 per cent decline in domestic production, at 2.33m units, while overseas production climbed sharply by 13.6 per cent to 751,528 vehicles. Nissan said the increase was due to the expansion of production of its Primera model in the UK, which has proved popular throughout Europe. Nissan's exports rose by half a per cent to 960,960. Worldwide production for the company rose marginally to 3.08m vehicles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zhengzhou, April 1 (XINHUA) -- An association for  the prevention and mitigation of natural disasters has been  founded in central China's Henan Province, which suffers from  frequent natural disasters.    The association consists of a dozen departments and  enterprises in the fields of agriculture, meteorology, geography  and industry. It aims to promote efficiency in natural disaster  reduction and prevention.    Henan is a major grain and cotton producer, but natural  disasters such as drought, flood, plant disease, and pests have  hampered the growth of agricultural production.    In 1986 over 5.33 million ha of farmland, about 80 percent  of  the total, was hit by a serious drought, causing a loss of two  billion kg of grain.    In 1992 its cotton crop was hit by bollworms, causing a loss  of 1.386 billion yuan (about 154 million U.S. dollars).    In order to seek more effective ways of reducing disasters,  local scientists and other experts have carried out a series of  major research projects in the field.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Visa to buy Plus ATM network VISA International is to buy the 70 per cent of the Plus ATM (automated teller machine) network it does not already own, intensifying the competition for the international cash-withdrawal business with rival Mastercard. Visa said it would exercise an option to buy Plus in three years, and in the meantime will run the system. It took a 10-year option to buy Plus, which is majority-owned by the banks which issue Plus cash-withdrawal cards, when acquiring its initial 30 per cent stake in 1988. The acquisition of 101,000 Plus terminals in 40 countries will take the Visa total to 160,000. The payment organisation said it plans to take the total to 250,000 by 1996 by absorbing other bank-owned ATMs into the system. Mastercard, by contrast, made a big move into ATMs in 1987 with the acquisition of rival network Cirrus, and now has 143,565 ATM machines internationally. Visa's aggressive plans to expand its network could lead to a greater polarisation between the two ATM systems, forcing banks to choose between issuing Visa or Mastercard debit cards (use of which leads to an immediate debit to the user's bank account). The expansion of the ATM network is part of a move to expand the use of its debit cards, Visa said. It currently has 68m debit cards in issue, compared with 318m credit cards, but plans to expand the number to 220m within two years. The availability of ATMs internationally, which allow users to debit their accounts from abroad, is part of a move to enhance the attractiveness of the Visa debit cards.</p>

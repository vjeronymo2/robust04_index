			<p>ONLY  <F P=103> PY3103132394 </F> <F P=104>  Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL </F> <F P=105>  Portuguese and Finance </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Selected remarks by Finance Minister-designate Rubens </F> Ricupero as published in various past newspaper articles]    [Text] Thoughts of Minister Rubens Ricupero  <H5>  Productivity </H5>   "Due to the crisis, productivity and competitiveness have  increased over the past few years in Brazil. I was surprised  recently when I could verify that in fact many Brazilian  companies have become smaller and more competitive. But there  still is much to be done in this field, especially sectors that  are lagging behind international quality standards." Interview  published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994.  <H5>  Industrial Policy </H5>   "An industrial policy, which unfortunately we still lack,  must be adopted in Brazil. The country opened its market and  removed customs barriers, and the industrial policy model of  replacing imports (a policy that privileged domestic  manufacturing, imposing trade barriers on the importation of  products similar to those manufactured locally), is no longer  applicable. Brazil has not adapted its industrial policy to the  reality of foreign trade." Interview published in JORNAL DO  BRASIL on 6 February 1994.  <H5>  Inflation </H5>   "The main problem with inflation, even with monetary  correction, is that it destroys future expectations, making  people live only in the present -- an increasingly short  present. This trend is not compatible with the idea of  investment because financial speculation is more profitable than  economic activities." Article published in FOLHA DE SAO PAULO  on 22 February 1994.  <H5>  Stabilization </H5>   "The solution is stabilization. As the Catholic Church used  to say before the Second Vatican Council: Out of stabilization,  there is no salvation. There is no measure, no matter how  appropriate it may be, nor any internal or external plan, that  will work without economic stabilization." Interview published  in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6 February 1994.  <H5>  Social Pact </H5>   "Since 1986 I have observed many similarities between what  is  happening here and in Russia (...) In Brazil, as in Russia, the  old country resists changes. What is happening in Brazil and in  Russia is that there is no consensus. Social pacts have been  broken, there is an absence of hegemonic thought, and we are  facing the situation that Italian politician Antonio Gramsci  [1891-37] used to describe: The old resist dying, the new world  cannot be born, and in this impasse all sorts of morbid symptoms  appear. Corporate interests break up the political system in  such a way that it is very difficult to make decisions for the  common benefit because no one understands what the common  benefit is." Interview published in JORNAL DO BRASIL on 6  February 1994.  <H5>  Social Action </H5>   "To hamper the economic adjustment means running the risk of  precipitating expectations capable of complicating the election  process, restraining and paralyzing any future government,  leaving the way open only for the destructive alternative of  hyperinflation to break the impasse (...) To end inflation is  the first and best social measure." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 31  December 1994. [date as published]  <H5>  Speculation </H5>   "Among broad sectors of society, there is no true awareness  about the need to curb inflation. On the one hand, we have half  a dozen people who, in real partnership with inflation, are  multiplying their wealth with no effort at all. On the other  hand, the majority of the people, who are suffering the impact  of the steep price increases, daily express their anguish in  face of this reality, but in the end accept living with it."  Article published in O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO on 8 February 1994.  <H5>  Political Transition </H5>   "Political support -- as a result of consensus -- for the  stabilization program will be capable of generating enough  psychological power to turn around the negative expectations  that still prevail in Brazil. The concrete chance to  successfully walk along the path of economic stabilization will  lead us to a much better political transition in 1994, free of  the frights of 1989-90." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994.  <H5>  Democracy </H5>   "The issue is not to support President Itamar Franco's  government or a given minister, although the different political  forces have promised to do so when he came to power. The  presidential candidates must understand that the more they try  to put off the struggle against inflation to 1995, the greater  the risk of affecting their mandates, bringing forward voters'  frustrations and wearing out people's confidence in the  democratic system." FOLHA DE SAO PAULO on 22 February 1994.  <H5>  Elections </H5>   "Now that we are approaching the time when people will elect  their next rulers and representatives, it is our duty as  citizens to unite in a national movement to stabilize the  economy. (...) It is imperative that now more than ever the  exercise of democracy go way beyond the act of voting." O  ESTADO DE SAO PAULO on 8 February 1994.</p>

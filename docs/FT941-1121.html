			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: Orient Overseas renews payout Orient Overseas (OOIL), the Hong Kong shipping group, yesterday underscored its turnround in fortunes - brought about largely by non-recurring factors - by awarding shareholders its first ordinary dividend since 1985. Net profits rose to USDollars 136.5m in 1993, compared with Dollars 1.5m the previous year, and the directors recommended a dividend of 1.3 cents. Results were buoyed by the the sale of the group's remaining interest in the Hongkong International Terminals group for Dollars 120.1m, which was taken above the line. While the core shipping activities still suffered from competition and over-supply, investments performed well. Mr C. H. Tung, chairman, warned: 'The group's investment portfolio benefited from increased bond values and buoyant equity markets, particularly in Hong Kong and south-east Asia. Substantial returns on the portfolio were achieved. However, the group believes it is unlikely that these returns will be repeated in 1994.' OOIL held cash balances and portfolio investments of Dollars 477.7m at December 31 1993, compared with Dollars 260.1m a year earlier. The group has ordered six new container vessels costing Dollars 484m, and expects further improvement in container transport business as a result of higher load factors. Strategic investment in China began last year with a property development project. Operating profit after financing last year rose to Dollars 17.4m, which compares with a loss of Dollars 28.2m in 1992. Earnings per share rose to 27.7 cents against a 1.6 cent loss.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The heads of state and government participating in  the fourth Latin American summit are taking advantage of their  meeting in Cartagena de Indias to hold bilateral meetings.  Cuban President Fidel Castro has expressed his interest in  meeting with Felipe Gonzalez. Juan Luis Diaz Prats reports from  Colombia:    [Diaz Prats] King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Felipe  Gonzalez have held separate meetings with other leaders  attending the fourth Latin American summit. The king received  Chilean President Eduardo Frei, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto  Lacalle, and Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres. King  Juan Carlos was interested in the situation in Chile and Costa  Rica and in Central America. He said he regretted having to  delay until next year his official visit to Uruguay, a country  which has begun the electoral process.    Gonzalez held meetings with the presidents of Colombia,  Uruguay, and Honduras. The summit agenda was discussed during  these meetings, but so was the situation in Cuba. Cuban  President Castro has asked to speak to Gonzalez at 0700 Colombia  time, which is 1400 Spanish time. Castro was the last leader to  arrive in Cartagena, after 2300 local time.    The Uruguayan president confirmed to Gonzalez that his  government would continue to collaborate in the fight against  terrorism, restricted only by respect for judicial decisions.  Gonzalez also spoke about cooperation with the three Latin  American leaders. In the specific case of Colombia, the Spanish  prime minister offered to continue aid to the areas devastated  by the floods in Cauca and Huila, which will be visited at the  end of the summit by Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for  international cooperation and Latin America, who is responsible  for drawing up a Spanish aid plan for southwest Colombia.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / NY judge dismisses Altman charges US GOVERNMENT attempts to prove that Mr Robert Altman helped the now-collapsed Bank of Commerce and Credit International gain illegal control of a US bank were dealt a blow yesterday when a New York judge dismissed four of the eight criminal charges against the prominent Washington lawyer. Judge John Bradley of the New York state supreme court did not explain why he dismissed the charges, which included the most serious count of bribery. The move came in response to a call from Mr Altman's lawyers for a dismissal on the grounds that federal prosecutors had failed to prove the lawyer had received bribes from BCCI. The prosecution had alleged that during the 1980s Mr Altman participated in a conspiracy to allow BCCI illegally to acquire First American Bankshares, Washington's biggest bank. Mr Clark Clifford, a former US defence secretary and leading figure in the Democratic party, was indicted on the same charges last year but was deemed too ill to stand trial. During the four-month trial prosecutors argued that Mr Altman and Mr Clifford, who were senior officers of First American, acted as 'front men' for BCCI, which secretly controlled the Washington-based bank. The two lawyers were accused of accepting millions of dollars of bribes from BCCI in the form of loans, share profits and legal fees. Although yesterday's dismissal is a victory for Mr Altman, he still faces four counts, including charges that he schemed to defraud regulators by submitting false documents. His defence team began its presentation yesterday, and is due to conclude by August 9. The indictments against Mr Altman and Mr Clifford were filed in July last year.</p>

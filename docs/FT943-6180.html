			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Arts: Lucinda Childs - Edinburgh Festival After the Edinburgh Festival's matchless double thrill - Miami City Ballet's treasure trove of works by Balanchine; the Mark Morris Dance Group's life-affirming L'Allegro, il Pensaroso ed il Moderato - the Lucinda Childs Dance Company was bound to come as a sobering experience. For anyone interested in post-Judson (that is, post-post modern) American dance, Childs is required viewing. But the wider significance of her work is to be found in its illustration of the consanguinity between ideas and procedures first employed by Merce Cunningham/John Cage, and the new dance movement which developed in Britain during the 1970s and early '80s. After discarding much of the outwardly limp, if formative, radicalism of the 1960s, Childs set about building and refining a style of minimalist dance which seemed blankly driven by obsessive order and symmetry, and symbiotically informed by the repetitive rhythms provided in the music of contemporary composers such as Philip Glass. Her company, currently celebrating its 20th anniversary and making its British debut, brought a selection of five works to Edinburgh's Playhouse Theatre. Dance, Childs' oldest, longest and most successful piece, dominated programme one; the second programme - a triple bill of pieces created between 1991 and 1993 - showed Childs' predeliction for even tighter minimalistic structures than those she employed back in 1979 for Dance. Most inscrutable and monophonic of this recent batch of works - all accompanied by harpsichordist Elisabeth Chojnaska - is Concerto, a nine-minute drill for seven perfectly behaved dancers whose incorruptible step patterns are finally broken by the last, plangent chords of Gorecki's score and by the photographic flash of light which catches the line up of approaching figures in a sudden ghostly relief. In comparison, Ribbon Plus and One and One seem tinged with a secret lyricism - although Childs, who makes solo appearances in both works, ensures that it is kept closer to her head than to her heart. However, beneath the dancers busy, precise footwork, collective mask of solid concentration, and willowy and balletic - but oddly unyielding - postures, one can seen a physical language which is both sporty and classical, cerebral and yet intuitive. And it is a language which in Dance finds a natural partner in the grainy, black and white film supplied by Sol LeWitt. Behind LeWitt's vertically and horizontally-split, moving images of the work's original cast (including Childs) of 15 years ago, the dancers echo and follow the complex cycles of repetition executed by their screen counterparts. Philip Glass's ensemble score grows wearisome, limiting the progression of Childs' response in a more insidious manner than the Ligeti and Xenakis compositions of her later dances. But there is much to savour in the perfect alliance and sometimes hypnotic interaction between film and movement here. Unfortunately, such fine-tuned synchronisation tends to bring out the worst in some viewers. At a lecture given by Childs, an elderly gentleman expressed concern that Childs happens to blink, when otherwise stationary, on LeWitt's film. 'Was this intentional?' he queried. 'Well,' answered a completely unruffled Childs, 'I suppose you have to allow for biological accidents - like breathing.' Like her comments, Childs' dances leave you either fascinated or alienated. Lucinda Childs Dance Company appears at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, 18-20 October, as part of the Dance Umbrella festival</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Fyffes plans expansion in Europe and the US Fyffes, the fresh fruit and vegetable distributor, is planning this year to diversify out of its UK and Ireland base into continental Europe and the US to boost sales of bananas. The move is aimed at sustaining earnings growth into 1995. The plans were announced yesterday alongside results for the year to October 31 which were better than expected following difficult trading in the previous 12 months. On turnover up 17 per cent at IPounds 611.4m (Pounds 593m), compared with IPounds 524.3m, pre-tax profits rose 11 per cent to IPounds 31.8m (IPounds 28.5m), slightly ahead of market expectations. The increase largely reflected improved foreign exchange rates with the UK, which accounts for 60 per cent of group turnover. Mr David McCann, managing director, said that total banana sales in 1994 were projected to grow to 28m boxes, against 17m in 1993 and 14m in 1992. The increase was largely a result of new supplies coming on line from a 9,000 acre plantation in Guatemala, which Fyffes was helping to finance. He said that up to 2m boxes would be sold in the US, a new market which was opened last November, with most of the remainder going into continental Europe. At the end of the period Fyffes had cash of IPounds 92m. Net interest contributed a lower IPounds 9.61m (IPounds 10.9m) as a result of falling rates. Interest income is expected to decline further this year to about IPounds 6m, putting pressure on the company to use its cash for acquisitions to maintain the momentum of earnings growth. The company spent IPounds 12m on acquisitions in 1993, and IPounds 20m in capital expenditure, mainly on improving distribution and ripening facilities. Operating profits grew by 25 per cent to IPounds 21.4m (IPounds 17.1m). However, brokers estimate that to achieve earnings growth of 10 per cent in 1994, operating profits will have to advance by at least IPounds 6m this year to offset the anticipated fall in interest income. Earnings per share were 6.1p (5.9p) and a 10 per cent increase in the final dividend of 0.9876p per share is recommended for a total of 1.378p (1.2527p). COMMENT Fyffes' ambitions in Europe and the US are finally bearing fruit since the company secured a supply of low-cost Central America 'dollar' bananas after a five-year struggle. In contrast to Geest, its main UK competitor, Fyffes has not been affected by Black Sigatoka disease in Central America, nor seemingly by uncertainties still surrounding the EU banana regime. Since the regime's introduction in July prices have fluctuated sharply. Fyffes has indicated it is seeking earnings growth of at least 10 per cent this year, which would imply a prospective p/e of about 16 on shares up 5p yesterday at 105p. Although a slightly higher rating than Geest's shares, its modesty reflects Fyffes' vulnerability to further challenges to the EU banana regime by Latin American producers. Moreover, Fyffes' plans to expand European sales volumes may come at the expense of profits if oversupply recurrs and prices weaken again.</p>

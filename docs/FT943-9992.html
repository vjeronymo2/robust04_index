			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Russians not taken in by image MMM presented Sir, Two thoughts on John Lloyd's article and his reports from Moscow on MMM ('The Possessed', July 31). Lloyd claims, first, that the anger of MMM's shareholders is 'directed more at the government than at MMM', and second, that Lenya Golubkov is presented as a typical 'Russian figure in transition'. Both claims are myth crea-ted mainly by MMM itself. According to the results of a public-opinion poll conducted by the Independent Institute of Parliamentary Sociology (Moscow) on July 25, 39 per cent of MMM's shareholders blame their troubles on MMM, 24 per cent on themselves and only 9 per cent on the authorities. The research also says that Lenya Golubkov is considered unpleasant by the public: 58 per cent of all polled, 60 per cent of workers, and 54 per cent of MMM's shareholders do not like his image (nearly 20 per cent in each group were indifferent). His image meets a more or less favourable response only from government executives - 26 per cent of those polled enjoy watching him on the screen. I believe that Russia (as well as other nations) stands not on Golubkovs - a type of money-fixated idiot, whose mental abilities are restricted to understanding where money comes from - but in defiance of them. Of course, our economic situation presents ordinary people with a lot of problems, which demand new approaches, but not to the extent of total trust in advertising, as the article puts it. I think that MMM's success was achieved mainly due to the low degree to which people have adapted to the market and the relative rarity of such pyramid-base schemes in today's Russia. Sooner or later this gap in the market would be filled. In my opinion, if a similar scheme, combined with powerful TV advertising, were introduced, say, in Britain for the first time in a particular generation, as in our case, the effect would be at least the same - except Lenya who would be probably replaced by John. And, last, the article describes a TV advertisement, in which two brothers - surely Golubkovs - are at the football match between Russia and Argentina. As the whole story it is only partly true - in fact, in this advertisement the brothers are at the match between Russia and Brazil.

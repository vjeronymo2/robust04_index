			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters suffers The impact of recent currency shifts, arbitrage activity and analysts' caution conspired to push down Reuters Holdings. The shares, already under pressure, fell a further 25 to 1277p. At that level analysts said the stock was well supported. The shares are ex-dividend in the UK but not in the US and the disparity between prices has prompted arbitraging which has forced the price down. Also, UBS discussed the company at the morning meeting, particularly reports that a broker had switched from Reuters new electronic trading system Dealing 2000-2. News that Hanson was returning to the acquisition trail added encouraged further buying of the stock which added 1 1/4 at 233 3/4 p on heavy turnover of 8.9m. RTZ, the world's largest mining company, fell 10 1/2 to 647 1/2 p after copper prices hit a five and a half year low. SmithKline Beecham lifted 6 to 419p in the 'A's as a result of the announcement late on Thursday that the company had settled its patent dispute with Glaxo over the anti-nausea treatment ondansetron. The removal of uncertainty was broadly positive for both companies but was unable to counter the persistent selling pressure on Glaxo which ended the day a net 8 lower at 554p. Transport and distribution group NFC shook off recent weakness after SG Warburg turned buyers of the stock. Pointing out that NFC had underperformed the market by 15 per cent over the last quarter, Mr Andrew Fitchie at the securities house said NFC remained attractive on fundamentals with good US and UK exposure. The shares rose 6 to 247p on turnover of 2.8m. Shell Transport edged up 2 1/2 to 583 1/2 p with heavy turnover of 5.8m shares said to have been stimulated by sizeable switching from Royal Dutch. An early attempt at a rally in the regional electricity stocks (recs) and the power generators prompted minor gains in the sectors but these were mostly eroded as the wider market tumbled after the inflation numbers. One securities houses was said to have been especially positive on the generators, citing expectations of above average dividend growth. All the utilities sectors have come under pressure this week as some institutions have switched from the safer high-yielding areas of the market into recovery stocks. PowerGen was the most resilient, closing 3 up at 347 1/2 p. National Power edged up 1 1/2 to 341 1/2 p. Water stocks, which outperformed the market by 8 per cent during the first quarter, remained out of favour. The Footsie stocks were given another mauling, with Thames 13 off at 513p, North West 11 lower at 491p, Anglian down 10 at 505p and Severn Trent down 11 at 491p. SG Warburg continued to tell clients to reduce weightings. It says the sector will underperform ahead of next summer's expected outcome of the regulatory review. The water companies are expected to reveal capital expenditure plans for the next five years later this month. Irish-based fresh produce and foods group Fyffes jumped 23 to 123p, after it said it had received an approach which might lead to a bid. Geest moved 4 ahead to 448p, in sympathy. Bid speculation was once again heard in United Biscuits sending the shares 5 up at 389p. Engineering and defence group Vickers hardened a penny to 132p as Robert Fleming Securities yesterday reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock predicting a recovery for Vickers on the back of a better performance from its Rolls Royce cars subsidiary begining in 1994. Investors appreciated the enhanced scrip alternative to the final dividend offered by BICC and the shares jumped 13 to 358p. In the rest of the transport sector, P&amp;O fell 15 to 547p, on suggestions that James Capel had cut profit expectations.</p>

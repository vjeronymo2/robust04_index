			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, 6 Mar -- The vanguard group of experts  from the ministry of emergency situations and other Russian  departments arrived in Tuzla today. In the Bosnian town under  Muslim control, it is to pave the way for accommodating a larger  group of observers called on to monitor consignments arriving at  the local airport.    Russian observers are being sent to Tuzla in line with an  understanding reached with the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs  in Moscow recently. Radovan Karadzic, their leader, agreed that  Tuzla airport should be opened to receive humanitarian  consignments provided they are monitored by observers from  Russia. Tuzla airport is in a frontline zone and normally can  operate only with the agreement of the Serbian side.    According to estimates by the UN headquarters, flights may  begin to Tuzla airport as early as 18 March. Dozens of  observer-monitors will become operational to inspect and check  the consignments with a view to banning anything of a military  nature. Experts from other countries will be here along with  their Russian colleagues.</p>

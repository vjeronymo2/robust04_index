The source says the  government and UN delegations waited for the Renamo delegation  for more than 60 minutes, adding that so far no explanation has  been given about the boycott. The meeting was scheduled to  discuss recent rioting at Renamo assembly areas. The agenda  included the destruction of explosive devices collected from  both sides, the transfer of war materiel from assembly areas to  UN Operations in Mozambique regional depots, and the start of  demobilization.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: British Rail The market has had its fill of prospectuses recently, so perhaps it was just as well that yesterday's White Paper on the future of British Rail was as exciting as a railway timetable, though without the hard information. By all accounts there is considerable private sector interest in the project, but until the Government spells out details like the extent - if any - of debt obligations, the nature of the track charging system and the powers of the regulator, it can scarcely be translated into action. The real frustration is for companies like BICC and Trafalgar House, which would benefit if BR's investment matched its aspirations. Maybe the answer is to sell the whole network to SNCF in return for a French promise to support London's pitch for the European central bank.</p>

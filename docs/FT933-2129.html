			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: EC's row over farm trade hits tariff talks THE THREAT to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks posed by French resistance to last year's US-EC farm trade pact is having an adverse impact on vital multilateral talks in Geneva designed to lower tariffs on industrial and agricultural goods. At a stocktaking meeting last Friday, a number of countries expressed concerns that the negotiations were being impeded by the continuing row within the EC over the Blair House accord. Although intensive talks are continuing, aimed at cutting overall tariffs by at least a third, countries are unwilling to come forward with further concessions while the row is unresolved. Community officials have been unable to convince trading partners that they should bargain seriously on the basis of an EC market-access offer for farm goods that derives from the Blair House deal. Failure to make progress soon could delay the tariff negotiations which, with parallel talks on market-opening measures for services, are an integral part of the Uruguay Round package. The Round must be completed by December 15, when US fast-track negotiating authority expires. For agricultural exporting countries, liberalisation of farm trade is the key to successful completion of the Round and there is strong opposition to any watering down of the Blair House accord. This was stressed last Friday, both in Geneva and in Montevideo, where the Rio Group of Latin American nations said they needed better market-access terms for their agricultural goods if the final Uruguay Round package was to be acceptable. Developing countries also repeated complaints in Geneva on Friday that the tariff-cutting deal negotiated by the 'Quad nations' (the US, EC, Japan and Canada) in Tokyo in July did not meet their concerns in such areas as textiles, tropical products and natural resource-based products. The situation looks more promising for services, where a stocktaking meeting yesterday reported progress in finalising the draft framework agreement laying down rules for services liberalisation. However, trade officials say they do not expect the issue of audio-visual services, in which the US is pitted against the EC, to be resolved at this stage. The EC wishes to preserve its freedom to restrict the showing of non-European TV programmes and to continue support for European film makers.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Fears of more pit closures increase FEARS OF a new round of pit closures increased last night as Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, warned that neither National Power nor PowerGen was likely to provide the industry with significant contracts in the near future above those already agreed. He told a coal conference in Amsterdam that neither company would make important additional commitments in the run-up to privatisation 'other than at a price which would allow them to add to stocks in place of future additional purchases'. This is a reference to a suggestion by one of the generators that it may be prepared to buy coal in the short term but only at a price considerably below the 92p a gigajoule offered by British Coal. British Coal is reluctant to agree to such a deal because it would jeopardise future sales at a potentially higher price by a privatised coal industry. Mr Clarke's comments come amid anxiety in coal communities that the corporation will move shortly, possibly this week, to close pits among the 15 or so considered vulnerable. British Coal operates 30 pits, following 21 closures since last October. Mr Clarke warned last week that he was pessimistic about the prospects of 12 mines reprieved by the government in a white paper last March. He told yesterday's conference of international coal executives that the scope for import penetration in the UK was very limited. The UK coal market was being squeezed out by other fuels 'for reasons which appear to have little to do with the economics of generating electricity.' The Major Energy Users' Council, representing large companies including Imperial Chemical Industries, has urged Offer, the electricity regulator, to refer the electricity generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. In its submission the council says the MMC should examine the behaviour of the electricity companies and the operation of the wholesale electricity pool. It asserts that there is 'little, if any, evidence of vigorous competition and this is probably inevitable with a duopoly structure'. Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

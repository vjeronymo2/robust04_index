			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / TGWU in costs shake-up BRITAIN'S biggest union, the Transport and General Workers', has agreed to rationalise its regional structure and appoint a finance director in an attempt to reduce bureaucracy and improve value for money for its 1m members. A special rules revision conference yesterday agreed to implement some of the main findings of a report by management consultancy Adam Klein, including the recommendation to reduce the eight English regions to five. The merging of the east coast, Yorkshire and the north into one region and a merger of the south coast and south-west will save the union about Pounds 5m a year. The move is politically controversial because it will reduce the power of the minority right-wing group in the union. The Klein report also criticised the union for having no budgeting and little accountability for spending. After a deficit of Pounds 12m in 1991 the union is expected to report a Pounds 3m surplus this year.</p>

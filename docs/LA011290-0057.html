			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Painting Slashed: A man with a knife slashed a painting by 16th-Century Italian  artist Federico Baroccio at the National Gallery in London, officials said. He  was ordered to stand trial on Feb. 1 on charges of causing criminal damage.  </P> <P> The state-funded gallery, home of some of the greatest art treasures in  Britain, said in a statement that the painting -- "The Madonna and Child With  St. Joseph and the Infant Baptist" -- was cut in nine places in Wednesday's  attack. Guards wrested the knife from the assailant, identified as Martin Came,  27. The National Gallery said its conservation and restoration department will  take "maybe more than a year" to repair the painting, which is said to be worth  up to $1.6 million by one source and as much as $25 million by a British art  critic. It has been on display since 1831. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

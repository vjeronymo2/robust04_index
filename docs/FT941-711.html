			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / People: Departures At the end of this month Peter Batchelor, one of the best-known figures on the UK car market scene, will be ending a 40-year career with General Motors at the age of 56. When he first joined GM as an apprentice at its AC Delco parts division at Dunstable, Vauxhall was producing pseudo-American cars like the Velox. He joined Vauxhall itself in 1982 and few see it as coincidence that since then Vauxhall's UK market share has doubled, to the point where it is treading hard on the heels of market leader Ford. His current post of vice-chairman, commercial operations at Vauxhall will depart with him. It was created last year specifically in order to help Batchelor oversee an orderly transition to a new regime which will be in place from April. Under this, Ian Coomber, who stepped into Batchelor's shoes last year as sales and marketing director, and Jim Raymond, after-sales director, will report directly to Vauxhall's chairman and managing director, Charles Golden. Although he has just become eligible to play in the British Seniors (golf) Championships, he will make time to remain as motor industry representative on the government's National Board of Crime Prevention.</p>

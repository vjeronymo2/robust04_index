			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. N. Kolokoltsev; UDC 517] </F>   [Abstract] Multiplicative exponential asymptotics of the  splitting value in any order of a small parameter h is computed  for the Shroedinger operator. A general case of several  symmetrical point-wells, and wells organized in nondegenerated  manifolds is also examined along with the multiplicative  asymptotics of the lower eigenfunctions. First, a case of two  potential wells is examined and three theorems are derived.  Employing the Wentzel/Kramers/Brillouin method, equations can be  obtained for a general situation, when the potential V is  invariant under the impact of a finite group of orthogonal  transformations and when there is a nondegenerated potential  minimum in each fundamental region.

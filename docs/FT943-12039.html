			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Approval for Pounds 9.8m Everton rescue plan Shareholders of Everton football club yesterday gave their approval to a Pounds 9.75m rescue package by businessman Mr Peter Johnson. The extraordinary meeting held at the club's Goodison Park ground started at the traditional football kick-off time - 3.00pm. But it took less than the customary 90 minutes to vote in favour of the 1-for-1 rights issue that is expected to give Mr Johnson, chairman of Park Food, the Christmas hamper company, and the Nightfreight delivery group, control of the Merseyside club. In anticipation, the Everton directors met after the EGM and elected Mr Johnson as their new chairman. Shareholders, many of whom had inherited one or two of the 2,500 shares first issued in 1892 and kept them more out of loyalty to the club than personal investment, voted Mr Johnson on to the board. The former chairman of Tranmere Rovers, a rival Merseyside club, needed 75 per cent support for the rights issue motion and received about 1,660 of the 1,680 votes cast. Mr Owen Jones, a former director of BICC, the cables group, who has a share in the club said: 'There has been a terrible dullness about Everton over the past few years.' The cash call has been priced at Pounds 4,000 a share - significantly higher than the underlying price of about Pounds 2,750. Although existing holders have three weeks to take up the rights it is expected that none will do so and Mr Johnson will get 50 per cent of the equity.</p>

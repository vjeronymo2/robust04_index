			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Devaluation of the Punt: Germany to hold steady course THERE may be more exchange rate tensions ahead, but the Bundesbank will stick to its prime tasks of maintaining D-Mark stability and holding the core of the European monetary system intact, German economists agreed yesterday. 'There is no chance of a sudden change of tactics or position,' said Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank. This view was tacitly supported by Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, who said the prime cause of the punt's devaluation was Ireland's close economic relationship with Britain. It was important now that Ireland, where the economic fundamentals were 'good', should continue with its stability-oriented policies so as not to endanger its progress toward economic convergence, he added. The Bundesbank offered no comments on complaints from Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, that it had not supported the punt with the same resolve as it had the French franc. 'The aim of our activities is to support (the monetary system) and therefore all member currencies, including the punt,' a spokesman said. However, the devaluation cast doubts on the German central bank's persistent claims, repeated last Thursday by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, that the exchange rate mechanism 'has regained stability'. According to Mr Pietsch there will be 'more unrest as long as German short-term interest rates remain high'. The Bundesbank's staunch support for the franc is based partly on economic realities and partly on the need to avoid drawing the blame if the ERM breaks down. Its interest rates policy - hardened by a 4.4 per cent rise in the west Germany consumer prices index in January - is founded on the need to protect its credibility as guardian of a stable D-Mark. According to Mr Adolf Rosenstock, senior economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, last month's increase in value added tax accounted for only 0.5 percentage points of January's 1.1 per cent month-on-month rise in prices. The rest was due to unabated increases in rents and the cost of services.</p>

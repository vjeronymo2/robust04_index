			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Advance for Democracy -- "The decision by Transkei's  military  regime to allow the National Party [NP] to open offices in the  homeland is belated but welcome. There ought never to have been  any question about the NP Operating in Transkei. That is the  democratic right of all parties," notes an editorial in  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 30 March on page 18. "The  ANC [African National Congress] and its allies have been enraged  by Buthelezi's resistance to allowing his opponents to organise  or even to help faciliate the right to vote in the April  election," but they have remained "conspicuously silent about  their `favored militay dictators' Holomisa" and Ramushwana of  Venda. "A similiar reticence marks their attitude to corruption  in Lebowa and kwaNdebele." "The use of South African troops to  help srabilise" the government in Qwaqwa "is another welcome  development. It shows that the SADF [South African Defense  Force] is capable pf pre-emptive stabilising action, and will  not be called upon to mop up once violence has already run its  course."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   A Fateful Choice -- "Monday's events in Johannesburg in  which  more than 30 Zulu royalists were killed, must fall into the same  category as the shootings at Boipatong and Bisho and the  assassination of Chris Hani, as far as their impact on the  transition process is concerned," an editorial in Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on 30 March on page 14 states. "Each of  these events had the potential to derail the process," but each  also produced a "countervailing force -- prompting renewed and  more determined efforts." "The same two possible scenarios lie  ahead now -- intensified conflict or a new successful phase of  negotiations." "It is becoming increasingly apparent that an  election in Natal can be no more than a stopgap measure, if  that. A comprehensive political settelemnt before the end of  April is impossible." "Even though Inkatha does not have a hope  of winning a `struggle to the end,' it doubtless has the ability  -- like Angola's UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] or Mozambique's Renamo [Mozambique  National Resistance] -- to hamper or even render impossible  South Africa's attempts to democratise and develop." The ANC,  NP and others "might be on the point of deciding that the only  way to secure a relatively free election is to neutralise  Inkatha now through mass action, emergency rule and, ultimately,  brute force. No one dare take that fateful step before every  other action is tried."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Postmortems -- The "finger pointing" and postmortems  concerning the "spectacular" events in Johannesburg have already  begun, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on  30 March on page 10. "Two important things can result from the  event. The first is that the security situation before the  elections has got to be tightened up and made more effective.  The second is the calling of the summit of major political  leaders." "We are afraid the time for political point-scoring is  fast becoming real" and we are "sickened by the manner in which  ordinary people are used in a battle for power that has very  little to do with the future of South Africa."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Frolov, deputy of the State Duma: "How </F> the Duma Voted for Amnesty: The Algebra of Compromise"]    [Text] Early in the morning you wake up    And you open the newspaper    And on the first page--    Golden words!    It is Klim Voroshilov    And brother Budennyy    Who granted freedom--    The people love them!    That is what they used to sing in the camps in the age of  the  great and terrible amnesty after Stalin's death. I do not know  whether in Lefortovo, Sailors' Rest, or other not so distant  places they will compose another song in honor of the amnesty of  23 February 1994, but if they do a whole song will not be enough  to contain the names of those who are loved by the people.    Eight factions and deputy groups of the State Duma found the  strength within themselves to take an extraordinary step for the  sake of social harmony--to declare, along with the criminal  amnesty, political and economic amnesty as well, accompanying  this act with the adoption of the Memorandum on Harmony. Let us  list just their formal and informal leaders. They include Duma  Chairman Ivan Rybkin (Agrarian Party), Vladimir Medvedev (New  Regional Policy), Alevtina Fedulova (Women of Russia), Sergey  Shakhray (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy (Liberal Democratic Party), Nikolay Travkin  (Democratic Party), Gennadiy Zyuganov (Communist Party), Sergey  Baburin and Yuriy Vlasov (Russian Way). Nor can one fail to  mention along with them the chairmen of Duma committees on  legislation and security--Vladimir Isakov and Viktor Ilyukhin,  who did an immense amount of work to find a solution that was  mutually acceptable to the majority of deputies, even if it was  on the third go-around.    By adopting it the Duma actually put forth its own political  anticrisis platform and was days ahead of Yeltsin, who delivered  a watered-down and content-deficient message "On Strengthening  the Russian State." Therefore it is no wonder that from the  president's circle one could immediately hear irritated comments  and appeals not to implement the Duma's decision which,  according to the text of the Constitution, which was written in  that same circle, is its exclusive prerogative.    The reason for the irritation is understandable. His circle  never expected that with such a varied and contradictory  composition parliament would manage to achieve such a complex  and multistage compromise. Therefore it is worthwhile to  consider in detail how this was done.    The quantitative results of the voting in which the final  decision was adopted ("for"--252, "against"--67,  "abstentions"--28) far from fully reveals the picture of the  struggle and even creates the illusion that the supporters of  the decision had an overwhelming majority. But that is far from  true. In the first place, to adopt any decision requires a  minimum of 223 votes, and therefore not only a direct vote  "against" but also an "abstention" and failure to participate in  the voting and absence from the meeting actually mean to vote  against it. In the second place, there were two votes, and the  first was not successful.    The fact is that it was decided to adopt four documents all  at once as a single package: the Memorandum on Harmony, the  decree on general criminal amnesty, the decree on political and  economic amnesty, and the decree on abolition of the commission  for investigating the events of 21 September-4 October. But  first, at the suggestion of the factions of the Agrarian and  Communist Parties, they voted on a "small package"--without the  four decrees. The negative result ("for"--209, "against"--81,  "abstentions"--16) immediately put the success of the "large  package" in real jeopardy because for many it was exceedingly  difficult to vote to abolish the commission, on whose creation  immense effort had been expended. And not all were willing to  accept this difficult compromise.    The results of the two roll-call votes with a breakdown  according to factions are presented in the table. It takes into  account not only those who voted but also all deputies who were  physically present at the session, and for greater clarity,  abstentions and failure to vote are equated to a vote "against."  From this it is very clear what kind of dramatic struggle took  place in the hall and in the soul of each deputy and the  elements from which the final decision was formed. The overall  total of columns I and II gives the number of votes "for" and  the total of columns III and IV is equal to the number of votes  "against" in the first vote. And for the second vote the number  of votes "for" is equal to the sum of columns II and III, and  the number of votes "against" is equal to the sum of columns I  and IV.    Thus the block of 209 votes "for" in the first vote changed  (in just a couple of minutes!) by the second vote not only  quantitatively but also qualitatively. It lost 18 of its  previous supporters but it acquired 61 new ones. If there had  been half this number--everything would have been ruined.    After studying independently how similar processes took  place  within the factions, the reader will be able to judge the  essence of their positions and the degree of unity and  discipline, and also the efforts it takes the Duma to make  literally every one of its decisions.    Spiteful critics call this horse trading, a business deal!  We  call it something else: compromise, without which, with the  present alignment of forces, nothing can be done in the  parliamentary arena. Did the opposition have to concede  something important and valuable? It did. Was this easy to do?  Absolutely not. But what was achieved was very  important--political defendants and prisoners were freed from  persecution: participants in the events of 19-21 August 1991,  and 1 May and 21 September-4 October 1993. That is the first  thing. The second thing is that, by adopting its Memorandum,  suggesting the idea of forming a national accord government  based on a parliamentary majority, the Duma firmly stated that  it does not intend to remain in the back yard of political life,  where it was assigned a place by the "creators" of the new  Constitution. The country simply does not need a powerless  parliament.    To find a source of confrontation in these obvious steps  toward civil peace would take a truly deranged imagination.

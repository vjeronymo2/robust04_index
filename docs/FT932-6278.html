			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Survey of UK Relocation (21): Good year for big landlords - The Commission for New Towns and English Estates JOHN WALKER and Tony Pender have had a pretty good year. One sold 500 acres of development land and the other let more than 2m square feet - not a bad record during a recession. In fact, you might expect them to be carried through the streets on shareholders' shoulders. Their feet remain firmly on the ground, however. In the first place they want to do far better before contemplating celebrations. It might also be a little difficult for more than 50m backers to gather in appreciation. As two of the country's largest landlords, they play a key role in the property industry, yet you would search in vain for a share listing. They represent the rump of a once-huge public sector drive to help businesses find better locations, competing in the private sector but still owned by the taxpayer. Mr Walker is chief executive of the Commission for New Towns, controlling a portfolio worth Pounds 1.7bn, including 18,000 acres of land and more than 9.5m sq ft of buildings. At least that was the score at the end of the last financial year. By now it could be less, as he is managing to tap a continuing demand for space around the 21 new towns he handles. 'You can't compare the figures with previous periods because we have taken on Milton Keynes and Telford in the last two years and these make up a quarter of our land bank,' he says. But there is one telling comparison with the competition. 'Five hundred acres is equivalent to one of those proposed private new towns. And they were planned to take 15 years, whereas we are selling that much each year.' Things could be a lot better. More than 1,000 overseas companies surged into the new towns before the worldwide slump took hold, so a return to some kind of normality could see twice as much land being absorbed. For the moment, however, he has to feed off smaller fry. 'A lot of medium-sized component companies are looking to set up on the back of the big Japanese manufacturers which have already found their niche. The only problem is they take a long time to plan these moves.' he says. Slack has also been taken up by more local moves, as companies take the opportunity to gear up for the recovery. Not all these are stimulated by rock-bottom prices. While industrial land values more than halved in the south, some parts of the north have seen prices climbing even in the recession, says Mr Walker. It should all make taxpayer 'shareholders' smile, with almost Pounds 180m going back into the Treasury from asset sales in the last financial year. Tony Pender is knee-deep in local moves. That is not surprising, considering that one of his main tasks as chief executive of English Estates is to provide premises small companies cannot get from the private sector. It means a higher rate of premature lease terminations through business failures than a listed company could accept, but that is all part of the remit of this state-owned group, which is due to be absorbed soon into the new Urban Regeneration Agency. Things got a little out of hand last year when he had to take back 2.5m sq ft, more than wiping out the 2.1m sq ft let. But the fact that the figures reversed in 1992-93 is a sign that recovery is under way. 'It is still a flat market but there are signs of revival because of sterling devaluation and the economy pulling around,' he says. Overseas companies have been knocking on his door, too, particularly for premises in the north-east. Already in place are names such as Mitsumi and Hashimoto in Tyne and Wear, while others are keen to get space to meet deadlines for UK production quotas. This is partly why English Estates is considering boosting its speculative building program after cutting back over the last couple of years to concentrate on land sales. Nothing is put up nowadays without rigorous research into likely demand, and this shows good prospects for units in the 30,000 to 50,000 sq ft range in areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside, and the north. Other busy areas include buying and servicing sites for sale to local developers on behalf of the Rural Development Commission in an effort to encourage relocation into more efficient buildings to mop up pockets of unemployment in the countryside. A special project is also under way to offset the rundown of VSEL in Barrow and British Nuclear Fuels in Whitehaven. But the biggest relocation project must be the comprehensive redevelopment of Chatham Dockyard, where Colonial Mutual Assurance has been provided with a new headquarters and Countryside Properties is confident enough to join in with a 92,000 sq ft speculative office scheme. As fast as it builds, English Estates is also selling. Under government orders to liquidate the whole 22m sq ft portfolio it sold 757 units in 1991/92, putting almost 80m into Treasury coffers on top of the rent roll of around half this amount.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VARIABILITY IN REGIONAL COST AND ASSISTANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Regional cost*    Regional cost   Regional selective          variations: absolute    variations: %         assistance**                    difference       difference        variations: %                 (Pounds 000s)     from average      difference from                                                             average                          1992             1992              1990-92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South East             +571.5            +11.2 Scotland               +417.1             +8.2               +224.5 North East               +147             +2.9                 -5.7 North West               -6.7             -0.1                -17.2 East Midlands           -42.4             -0.8                -97.5 South West             -146.4             -2.9                -80.3 Wales                  -177.2             -3.5               +106.5 East Anglia            -182.3             -3.6 Yorks &amp; Humberside     -280.5             -5.5                -64.1 West Midlands          -300.4             -5.9                -66.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Variable operating cost for a 50,000 sq ft plant with 300 employees, including transport costs. ** South-east and East Anglia are not eligible for RSA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: KPMG and Employment Gazette  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar rise 'may run out of momentum' The recent upturn advance in sugar prices may run out of momentum, says London trade house E. D. F. Man, because of a lack of 'prompt physical offtake'. But it expects prices to be maintained by 'a background of tight fundamental (supply/demand) balance and the expectation of offtake later in the year. In its latest Sugar Situation report Man says the 'much anticipated upward trek in prices has started despite persistent uncertainty surrounding import demand prospects'. It notes that import demand has languished, 'plagued by political procrastination and administrative delays'. But, 'surprisingly', market interest in potential Russian, Chinese and Indian demand 'show little sign of fatigue'.</p>

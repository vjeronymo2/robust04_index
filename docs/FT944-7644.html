			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Cabinet to resign if rebels defeat Euro-budget bill: Clarke raises stakes in fight with Tory rightwingers Mr Kenneth Clarke yesterday raised the stakes in the government's battle with its Euro-sceptic backbenchers by revealing a cabinet pact to resign en masse if the government loses a crucial vote on Monday. The chancellor's disclosure followed rightwing anger over Treasury figures admitting that UK contributions to the EU budget will be Pounds 732m higher than expected this year due to faster economic growth. The party's discomfort over Europe was further highlighted last night when Mr Patrick Nicholls, a Tory MP, resigned his post as Conservative vice-chairman after launching an outspoken attack on the French and Germans in his local newspaper. The Treasury's admission was seized on by Euro-sceptics as justification for their plan to oppose the second reading of the European communities finance bill. It prompted rightwing claims that up to 24 Tory backbenchers are now willing to back a challenge to Mr John Major's leadership of the Conservative party, probably by someone intended to draw out a serious challenger. Mr Clarke yesterday demolished Euro-sceptic claims that the defeat of the EU finance bill would trigger a leadership vote rather than the general election threatened by Mr Major. Mr Clarke said 'the entire cabinet' agreed with the prime minister's decision to make the bill an issue of confidence, and ruled out Mr Major's replacement by any senior government member. 'If anything silly were to happen on Monday, it would be the inevitable consequence of the defeat that the government would fall,' he said. Asked if any of Mr Major's colleagues would forestall an election by standing for the leadership if the bill was defeated, Mr Clarke replied: 'No member of the present cabinet could honourably take such a course.' He also dismissed Euro-sceptic claims that the Queen might refuse a dissolution. The decision to risk the future of the government by treating the bill as a confidence issue was taken by Mr Major and a group of six senior cabinet ministers at Downing Street 10 days ago. The ministers present - Mr Clarke, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip - all backed Mr Major's strategy. Downing Street officials said the issue was not minuted formally by the cabinet, but other ministers were consulted by the prime minister and chancellor. Mr Clarke said the increase in this year's forecast contribution, from Pounds 1.7bn to Pounds 2.4bn, reflected faster economic growth and factors such as changes in the timing of payments under the EU's Common Agricultural policy.

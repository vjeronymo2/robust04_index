			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Because inaccurate information was supplied to The Times Orange County Edition,  a story and table in Tuesday's Business section contained incorrect figures for  average fourth-quarter office rents in Orange County as calculated by Grubb  &amp; Ellis Co. The correct figures are: John Wayne Airport area, $1.25 to  $2.60 per square foot per month; south county, $1.25 to $1.85; central county,  $1.05 to $2.15; north county, $1 to $2; and west county, $1.25 to $2.25.  </P></p>

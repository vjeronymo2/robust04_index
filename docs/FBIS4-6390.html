			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il sent thanks to the revolutionary relics  preservation institute of the Hamhung Branch of the State  Academy of Sciences.    Its scientists found tens of thousands of peeled trees  throughout the country and discovered many revolutionary  slogans on trees by methods of newly-developed fluorescent  light projection and exposure of letter.    They contrived simple devices to see slogans on trees in the  open air and generalized them across the country. They also  successfully solved scientific and technical questions in  permanently preserving revolutionary relics including  slogan-bearing trees.    Comrade Kim Chong-il sent thanks to the working people who  had done good things for the society and collective -- director  of the Red Cross General Hospital of Korea Ho Chol-yong and 8  other medical team members, director of the Chongpyong County  People's Hospital Kim Yong-il and secretary of the Primary  Party Committee of the Hospital Han Chong-sun and other medical  workers, officials and workers of the Sinchang shallow sea  cultivation station, instructor of the Songdowon Tourist Hotel  Kim Kum-ok and others of the service section No 2, officers of  the Chungsan County public security station in South Pyongan  Province, workers of the Mundok County commercial management  office and Mun Yong-su who is working as a three-revolution team  member after graduating from the metal processing faculty of the  Pyongyang University of Mechanical Engineering.</p>

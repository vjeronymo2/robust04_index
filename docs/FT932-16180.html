			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / People: Grabiner moves at Telegraph Stephen Grabiner, the marketing director of The Telegraph, publisher of the Daily and Sunday Telegraph, has been appointing acting managing director. His appointment follows the illness of Joe Cooke, 61, the company's managing director. Cooke - a central figure in masterminding the modernis-ation of the Daily Telegraph - is in hospital for tests following a mild stroke at the beginning of last week. In a statement yesterday The Telegraph said that it was too soon to predict when Cooke would be able to return to the office. As well as being appointed acting managing director, Grabiner, who is 34, has also been elected to the board of The Telegraph. He was first associated with the Daily Telegraph as a Coopers &amp; Lybrand consultant and joined the company as marketing director in October 1986. Cooke's illness comes at an awkward time for The Telegraph since he has been involved in the efforts to persuade shareholders of the wisdom of buying a stake in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group.</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Manifesto appeals for revolution  -Volvo's 66-page document offers a radical restructuring that goes beyond the proposed merger with Renault Volvo seems undeterred by the growing clamour in Sweden over the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's Renault. Yesterday, the group said it was asking its shareholders to approve revolutionary changes in the shape of the country's biggest and most famous manufacturing group. The 66-page information leaflet circulated to shareholders contained much about the Renault deal. However, it also amounted to the clearest exposition to date of Volvo's strategy involving a radical restructuring in which the proposed Renault merger is a vital, but not exclusive element. When shareholders gather in Gothenburg on November 9 to vote on the Renault agreement, they will also vote to approve Volvo's terms for acquiring 100 per cent control of Branded Consumer Products, the food and drinks operations of Procordia, a conglomerate jointly controlled by Volvo and the Swedish government. Under a complex deal struck earlier this year with the state, Volvo will become the sole owner of BCP and hold a minimum 25 per cent interest in Pharmacia, Procordia's big pharmaceutical operations, after the Swedish government sells off its Procordia holdings. If these transactions go ahead, Volvo's profile will be transformed. Its traditional role as a car, truck and engineering group will become, in effect, an arms-length investment and its biggest direct involvement will be in the production of beer and soft drinks, food products and matches. 'A new Volvo group, with considerably improved dividend capacity, will be formed,' wrote Mr Soren Gyll, the chief executive, in the leaflet. 'The competitiveness of the automotive operations will increase. Volvo will gain control over a large, profitable consumer products operation with development potential, a favourable cash flow and a moderate investment requirement,' Mr Gyll wrote. Cash flow and investment costs are two of the important factors behind the restructuring. Volvo says securing a stand-alone future in vehicle production would cost up to SKr8bn (Dollars 1bn) in capital investment. Meanwhile, Volvo has estimated, on a pro forma basis, that in the first six months of the year the inclusion of BCP would have produced positive cash flow of SKr400m, compared with a negative SKr200m if only the Renault merger was envisaged. However, these arguments have not persuaded those Swedish sceptics who doubt the strategy of Volvo increasing its role in food and pharmaceuticals and who remain unconvinced at least by the terms of the proposed merger with Renault. Pro-forma income statements in yesterday's leaflet for the merged Renault-Volvo company show some short-term reasons for this. Volvo estimated that in the first six months of 1993, Renault-Volvo would have produced pre-tax profits of FFr320m (Dollars 56.5m) on sales of FFr119.2bn, scarcely more than the SKr380m in profits Volvo produced on sales of a little more than one quarter of the merged company. Volvo quoted a less-than-enthusiastic opinion from Credit Suisse First Boston that the Renault merger was 'financially reasonable' from the point of view of Volvo shareholders. Critics continue to suggest that, in effect, an improving Volvo, which will have a 35 per cent share in the new company, has been undervalued in the merger with Renault, which has suffered a sharp decline in profits. They complained that the information leaflet gave no indication of what values were put on Volvo's and Renault's respective assets when the deal was negotiated. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, wrote only: 'It is important to recognise that short-term fluctuations in results have had little impact on agreed values.' The leaflet said Volvo would initially value its 35 per cent holding in the merged company at SKr22.6bn, but it gave no estimate of the present value within the existing Volvo structure of the car and truck operations. Mr Gyllenhammar insisted the share structure meant Volvo 'should have a major influence on the shaping and destiny of the new company'. But he offered nothing new on the other important Swedish concern - the present and future role of the French state in the merged company - beyond repeating his faith in the French government's commitment to privatise Renault soon.

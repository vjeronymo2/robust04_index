			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank of Ireland boosts core capital BANK of Ireland yesterday raised a total of Pounds 110m core capital, boosting its capacity to lend through simultaneous preference share issues in London and Dublin. The irredeemable preference shares, denominated in both sterling and Irish punts, were placed with institutional investors in the UK and Ireland. The Pounds 50m UK tranche was the first issue of sterling preference shares by an overseas bank. The paper carries a coupon of 12 5/8 per cent and was priced to yield 350 basis points more than UK government long-dated bonds. The IPounds 65 tranche carries a coupon of 12 per cent and was priced to yield 325 basis points over long maturity Irish government bonds. The transaction, lead-managed by Salomon Brothers, boosts Bank of Ireland's core capital  - allowing it to increase lending activity. The bank's ratio of core capital to assets rises from 5.6 per cent to 7.2 per cent, against a 4 per cent ratio demanded by the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy. As an overseas institution, however, dividend payments from Bank of Ireland's sterling preference shares do not count as franked investment income under UK law. Instead, tax is payable on gross income received from the shares. In this respect, the shares are comparable to permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs), the undated, deeply subordinated capital instruments issued by UK building societies.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AZERTAC report: "Meeting of the National Assembly"] </F>   [Text] A regular meeting of the National Assembly was held  on 18 May. Republic of Azerbaijan President Geydar Aliyev took  part in its work.    After opening the meeting, Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the  Supreme Soviet of the republic, reported that discussion of the  drafts of the Laws of the Azerbaijan Republic "On the Commodity  Exchange" and "On Veterinary Science," and also the question of  the 1994 budget of the Republic of Azerbaijan had been  envisioned. However, taking into account various rumors and  conjectures that were being circulated in the republic after the  signing of the Bishkek Protocol, and also the appeal of a group  of deputies, the head of parliament asked the members of the  National Assembly to express their opinion on the advisability  of including this question on the meeting agenda. According to  the speaker, some circles, inciting passions regarding the  Bishkek Protocol, are pursuing specific objectives and  attempting to exploit this as a means of attaining power. Rasul  Guliyev repeated once again that the protocol was in the nature  of a recommendation.    The opinions of the deputies were divided concerning the  need  to include the issue of the Bishkek Protocol on the agenda and  to discuss it at length.    Afiyaddin Dzhallilov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet  of the Republic, who spoke at the meeting and headed the  Azerbaijani delegation at the Bishkek meeting, presented  information on the work that had been accomplished in the  capital of Kyrgyzstan.    Jurists Murtuz Aleskerov and Safa Mirzoyev expressed their  views on the Bishkek Protocol.    On the suggestion of Rasul Guliyev, members of the National  Assembly expressed their position on placing the issue of the  Bishkek Protocol on the agenda. Nineteen deputies voted "for,"  19 -- "against," and two abstained. Thus, this issue was not  placed on the agenda of the parliament meeting.    After a recess, some of the members of the National Assembly  once again raised the issue, which aroused a heated discussion.  Shadman Guseynov read out a statement on behalf of members of  the National Assembly who came out with a proposal to include  this issue on the agenda. After this, 13 members of the  National Assembly walked out of the meeting hall. It was  proposed to continue the meeting and to express a position with  respect to the actions of the people's deputies who had walked  out of the hall.    After a short recess, the National Assembly adopted a reply  statement in which it condemned the actions of the people's  deputies who had walked out of the meeting hall.    With this, the regular meeting of the National Assembly  concluded its work.</p>

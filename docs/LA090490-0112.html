			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN SOLDIERS CLOSING IN ON DEFIANT MOHAWKS  </P> <P> Heavily armed Canadian soldiers Monday tightened their perimeter around a group  of armed and defiant Mohawk Indians who refused to surrender.  </P> <P> Army spokeswoman Capt. Lynne Bermel said the army moved several hundred yards  closer to "The Pines," an Indian alcohol and drug treatment center on the  Kanesatake reserve, west of Montreal.  </P> <P> Oneida Nation Chief Terry Doxtator told reporters outside the treatment center  that the remaining Mohawk Warriors "will not lay down their arms if the army  moves in."  </P> <P> About two dozen members of the Mohawk Warriors and an unknown number of women  and children were reportedly holed up in the treatment center.  </P> <P> The dispute in Oka began several months ago over a proposed expansion of the  town's golf course on land that Mohawks on the Kanesatake reserve claim is an  ancient burial ground. It turned violent on July 11, when a provincial police  officer was killed.  </P></p>

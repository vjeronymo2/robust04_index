			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: Chicago-Tashkent - The Place The Place is once again playing host to a season of what can conveniently but optimistically be called 'new dance'. With financial sponsorship from Holsten Pils, experimentalists from seven European countries are being given a London show-case during the next three weeks. Very laudable, but it would be a brave soul who believed that everything on offer was of merit. There is good avant-garde dance in Europe, and The Place has earned our respect for bringing us an artist as gifted as Belgium's Wim Vanderkeybus, and the magical illusion from the Dutch Dans Produktie. (It has earned something rather different for its obsession with the higher pretentiousness of what passes for modern dance in France.) The problem is that for every one group where choreographic skill and technical prowess match creative vision, there are half a dozen miscreants whose efforts are banal, predictable and self-indulgent. In this bran-tub the critic dips warily, and Alastair Macaulay and I have reported here on numbing evenings at The Place, where the chiming of the nearby church clock (how can a quarter of an hour last so long?) sounds in the auditorium like a death-knell to any hope of escape. The bells were faintly discernible on Wednesday night above the miserable racket of drumming that was the accompaniment to Chicago-Tashkent, an offering from the Munich-based Dance Energy troupe, which was making a British debut. The idea behind Micha Purucker's 75 minute piece was a journey from high-energy (typified by Chicago) to some relative calm, associated with Tashkent. The premise was dubious; the visualisation depressing. Seven dancers rushed about and indulged in those grapplings and falls that are the commonplace of student efforts at what is merrily called 'choreography'. They were animated for Chicago; less so for Tashkent. Various other incidents - a bit of a puppet show; a mysterious observer in head-scarf and mad waterproof - served to decorate the issue. The accompaniment (by Robert Merdzo) was monotonous bangings; the clothes were a rag-bag of Oxfam cast-offs. The movement idiom was limited, and herein lies the flaw in so much of the experiment we are subjected to by well-intentioned but undiscriminating presenters like The Place. Far too much of current new wave choreography is unsustained by any compositional skill: ideas are blocked and frustrated in expression because no adequate technique has been acquired to speak of a theme. Cliche rules, and the most striking thing about such an evening is the inability of the dance to do its task.</p>

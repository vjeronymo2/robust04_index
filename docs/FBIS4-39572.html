			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice-Premier Anatoliy Chubays in an exclusive  interview with the Financial Information Agency today said that  after the deadline for using privatization vouchers (July 1)  Russians might still have about 5 million unused vouchers (over  three percent of the 148 million vouchers distributed among  Russian citizens).    "Inevitably a part of the vouchers will remain unused.  However, those five million amount to only three percent of the  total number and the fact that 97 percent of Russians will have  used their vouchers by July 1 is an indication of the  large-scale success of privatization", Chubays said.    At a Wednesday news conference in Moscow Chubays said that  by  June 6, 126 million vouchers had been invested. The State  Property Committee will auction 63 very promising companies for  vouchers this month, among them platinum producer Norilsk Nikel,  the oil company Megionneftegas and the Beryozka chain of stores.    Chubays said that this unprecedented drive will allow  Russians who have not yet invested their vouchers to exercise  their right to purchase a share of former government property.  He denied rumors about the prolongation of privatization for  vouchers, stressing that July 1 was the deadline.    Commenting on the results of privatization, Chubays said  that  by June Russia had turned 18 out of 22 thousand big and  medium-sized companies subject to privatization into joint-stock  companies. Over 50 percent of industry is now privately owned,  by July 1 the figure should grow to 70 percent. Over 250 major  manufacturing facilities have been sold through national  auctions held in 86 regions. Since the beginning of the year  government property worth 45 billion rubles was sold for  vouchers at auctions. Chubays said he believed the figure in  June would be 93 billion.    Chubays said that most of the 600 voucher investment funds  had held the first meetings of share-holders over the past two  months and paid small but acceptable dividends.    He added that the State Property Committee has serious  complaints against 15 funds and their operations will be  investigated.    Speaking of privatization after the expiry date for  vouchers,  Chubays said that by June 15 amendments to the draft program  will be collected and after that the program will be submitted  to the government for final approval. He said that after July 1  it is expected that some 20 percent of government property be  sold for cash.</p>

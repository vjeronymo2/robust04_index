			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (13): When the spending stopped - Consumer Electronics THE heady growth of the 1980s for the consumer electronics industry has come to a screeching halt. The prolonged recessions in the US and the UK, along with the slowdown of the Japanese economy, have put a drag on the industry. But, just as important, electronics companies have hit a gap in the product development cycle. The big mass-market products of years past such as video tape recorders or Walkman-type cassette players have already found their way into homes everywhere and sales have slowed down. Video recorder sales are actually going into reverse in many of the big markets. One of the few bright spots is the brisk sales of 8mm hand-held video cameras, developed by Sony. Sales of the tiny video cameras has taken off following repeated reductions in size and weight, along with steady improvements in quality. Profits at electronics companies have been hit hard in the Far East and in Europe. The travails of the European consumer electronics industry are well established. Philips, the Netherlands based group which is Europe's leading consumer electronics group, is widely expected to emerge this year from a sustained bout of cost cutting imposed by Mr Jan Timmer, the company's president. He has taken Philips into important joint-ventures with Japanese producers to help to develop the next generation of products as well as taking the company out of some areas such as the loss making mini computer division. The other leading European groups such as Thomson of France and Nokia of Finland are also under pressure to cut costs and find partners to help to shoulder rising research and development costs. Far less familiar are the across the board cuts in capital spending in the Japanese industry which have become the rule of the day. Sony, one of Japan's most aggressive and innovative companies, this year is likely to cut spending by 30 per cent in the year starting in April. Its mid-term profits to the end of September were down 26 per cent. Sony and Matsushita Electric Industry are also suffering from their expensive purchases of US film producers. Sony paid Dollars 3.4bn for Columbia Pictures just over two years ago, while Matsushita bought MCA for Dollars 6.1bn in December 1990. With the US industry going through a slump, the financial gains from these acquisitions have been extremely elusive. While interest in hits of the past has lagged, products of the future - especially high definition television - have been maddeningly long in coming. HDTV produces a significantly higher picture quality, approaching but not matching cinema projection, by increasing the line count on television monitors. Japanese electronics companies such as Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing manufacturing facilities for HDTV. HDTV broadcasts were expanded in Japan last November to 8 hours a day, but with the price of a large picture tube needed to appreciate the higher quality of HDTV and the electronic decoding equipment still costing about Y4m (Dollars 32,500), and programme offerings comparatively paltry, sales have been scant. Meanwhile, the Japanese companies have formed two separate development groups jointly with a number of US companies and with Philips of the Netherlands in order to share the huge costs of developing sets of semiconductor chip sets that will reduce the size, complexity and the cost of making HDTV equipment. The appearance of these groups amounts to an admission that the risks of going it alone have become prohibitively high. The Japanese are also aiming to ease trade friction with the US, which has complained about the exclusion of US semiconductor companies from the Japanese electronics industry. Beyond this, the electronics companies are struggling to develop concepts for a new generation of hit products that will re-ignite the growth which the industry has enjoyed for decades. Many focus on the still nascent concept of multimedia - interactive devices that combine high quality audio-visual functions with computing capability. Sony has launched with modest success a forerunner of multimedia with its Data Discman - a hand-held compact disc player that displays reference books on a flip-up LCD screen. The Data Discman can display simple illustrations and pronounce dictionary entries. The product, already launched in Japan, the US, and Germany, will reach the UK in the spring. Philips has already launched its CD-I (compact disc interactive, developed jointly with Sony), to mixed reviews. The machine allows users to call up moving pictures, CD-quality sound, and text from a CD. But it appears so far to lack the applications software needed to turn it into a hit product. Attention is now focused sharply on how to use CD-ROM (read only memory) technology to design products. Many specialists, for example, believe that CD drives will soon become standard equipment on personal computers. Sony is teaming up with Apple Computer to design a new generation of hand-held multi-media computers. Sony believes that the personal computer and audio-visual industry will gradually become indistinguishable. From a technological standpoint, this is likely to be true. The biggest uncertainty facing the industry, however, is whether consumers will go for the fancy machines and prices dreamt up in research laboratories.</p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Chinese students turn from Marxism to business THE People's University of China is abandoning courses in Marxism in favour of business studies. The Beijing-based university, bowing to the pressures of China's economic reforms, is introducing courses in such capitalist pursuits as real estate management and marketing. Some 14 new business subjects will be made available at the university, established by the Communist party to train young revolutionaries before the People's Republic was founded in 1949. According to China's Business Weekly, the new subjects will replace 17 courses related to communist dogma that have died through lack of student interest. China's Community Party School, the main centre for training high-level party cadres, is also joining in by announcing that for the first time it will begin teaching China's leaders about stock market operations. This coincides with an explosion of interest throughout China as people, starved of investment opportunities for so long, seek better returns for their savings. Party school courses in the rudiments of capital markets also come at a time when China's State Council (cabinet) is considering a new securities law to help regulate the country's growing equities markets in such places as the Shenzen special economic zone in South China and in Shanghai. The Communist party newspaper, People's Daily, said reform of the party school's curriculum was necessary to deal with practical developments after calls last year by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, for swifter market reforms. Deng's call helped prompt an explosion of economic activity throughout the country with annual growth rates in some places exceeding 12 per cent. This rapid growth is causing disquiet and has led to calls for a slowdown to prevent the economy overheating. The People's University, a hotbed of Red Guard activity after Mao Zedong launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, has been finding it increasingly hard to attract students to its outmoded disciplines. Bright young Chinese, who would have fought to gain entry to the People's University, now stream south to make their fortunes in the new economic zones, or drift towards institutions offering more business-related courses. Revealingly, the People's University is establishing a department of national economic management to replace the planned economy department.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Leninsk February 10 TASS -- During his official  visit to Kazakhstan, which ended today, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev had talks with Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev on the Baykonur cosmodrome. It was agreed to set up  a special working team to study the problem. It is to draw up a  draft agreement on this unique scientific complex for the  Russo-Kazakh summit, scheduled for the end of March.    Kozyrev visited the Baykonur cosmodrome on the last day of  his official visit. He was accompanied by Kazakh Foreign  Minister Tuleutay Suleymenov.    Baykonur holds pride of place in the history of world  science, especially cosmonautics. This is from where mankind  had for the first time ventured into outer space, turning a new  page in the history of civilisation. The world's first  artificial earth satellite was orbited from Baykonur in October  1957. The first cosmonaut, Yuriy Gagarin, was launched into  outer space from there in April 1961.    The first "Buran" reusable vehicle was launched from  Baykonur  in 1988. The international space observatory "Granat", orbited  from there in December 1989, is still functioning in outer  space. It is designed to carry out strategic observations and  to study cosmic, roentgen and gamma rays. Russia, France,  Bulgaria and Denmark are taking part in the project.    A spaceship, carrying a Soviet-Australian expedition,  including a representative of Kazakhstan, was launched from  Baykonur for the first time in the 40-year-long history of the  space centre, on October 2, 1991. The next stage of the  cosmodrome's history was marked by the launching of a Soyuz  TM-13 rocket. This event ushered in a new era in the  cosmodrome's history.    Kozyrev overflew the installations of the cosmodrome and  talked to the heads of Baykonur's military and civilian  personnels. Taking part in the talk was Colonel-General  Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Military Space Forces of the  Russian Defence Ministry, Acting Chief of the Baykonur  Cosmodrome Major-General Viktor Grafinin, and head of the  Leninsk Administration Vitaliy Brynkin.    In accordance with a decree signed by the Kazakh president  in  1991, all the enterprises, organisations and institutions on the  territory of Kazakhstan were declared Kazakh state property,  including the Baykonur cosmodrome. Naturally, this posed new  difficult problems before the complex. It will not be an  exaggeration to say that Kazakhstan is unable to cope with all  the problems linked with the exploitation of this unique space  complex. Suffice it to say that Russia had spent 47 billion  roubles to keep Baykonur going in 1993 alone. Ninety-four per  cent of all the spendings on the complex are borne by Russia and  only six per cent by Kazakhstan in accordance with an agreement  concluded between the two countries. As much as 259 billion  roubles will be required to finance Baykonur in 1994.    During the meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Chief  of the Cosmodrome Viktor Grafinin said that 22 launchings of  different space vehicles, both military and civilian, were  effected from Baykonur in 1992, and four in 1994, including one  piloted vehicle. Dwelling on problems facing the cosmodrome  today, he laid accent on two main problems -- determination of  the cosmodrome's status and solution of tasks linked with the  social protection of its personnel.    Kozyrev flew to Moscow right after his tour of Baykonur  installations.</p>

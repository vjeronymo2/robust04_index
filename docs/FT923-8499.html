			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent starts the week in negative mood BOURSES remained depressed by the low dollar, high interest rates and poor corporate progress reports and share prices were marked down further yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT dropped 1.7 per cent, the DAX index closing 26.95 lower at 1,582.55 after a 7.57 fall to a new 1992 low of 628.09 in the FAZ index at midsession. Turnover rose from DM3.4bn to DM4.2bn. Selling of construction stocks left Bilfinger &amp; Berger off DM32 at DM870, Hochtief by DM43 at DM977 and Holzmann by DM54 at DM912. There was no particular rationale about this, except that the sector had performed this year and investors still had profits to take. Daimler weakened noticeably on a story that a Swedish consortium involving Saab, Ericcson and Volvo was planning to offer a substitute for the sidelined European Fighter Aircraft (EFA). The shares fell DM15.20 to DM647; the decline was beaten in percentage terms, however, by the DM14.50 drop to DM543 at BMW, still regarded by some as the quality stock among carmakers. In retailing, Douglas extended last week's declines on a disappointing progress report with a fall of DM14.50 to DM499.50; but Kaufhof followed it down with a drop of DM9.50 to DM487.50, although most retailers were satisfied with the results of the two-week sales which ended on Saturday, and that all of them were hoping for a boost in the second half. PARIS remained depressed with Peugeot and St Gobain continuing declines begun at the end of last week on disappointing second quarter results. The CAC 40 index fell 25.11 or 1.4 per cent to 1,752.16 and turnover remained weak at an estimated FFr1.1bn. Peugeot remained active as investors reviewed the carmaker's sales figures and some negative analysts' notes were issued. Its shares lost FFr25, or 3.9 per cent to FFr617. Downgradings were also in evidence at St Gobain, which ended the day FFr5 lower at FFr515, and a couple of large sellers were said to be responsible for the 6 per cent fall in Cap Gemini, down FFr13.50 at FFr208.50. Air Liquide's first half was unexceptional, according to some analysts, but the stock showed resistance, off FFr5 at FFr770. Yves St Laurent bucked the trend with a FFr4 gain to FFr829 on a 6.8 per cent increase in first half revenues. AMSTERDAM anticipated poor half year results from Fokker, due today and its shares plunged 6 per cent by the close, down Fl 1.60 at Fl 23.70. The aircraft manufacturer surprised the market by bringing forward its results by a week. The CBS Tendency index eased 1.9 to 114.0. Hoogovens remained weak, also ahead of its results, shedding Fl 1.20 to Fl 38.90. Analysts are forecasting disappointing earnings following the deterioration in the European steel industry during the second quarter. News that Polygram is to take a 51 per cent stake in a US film producer failed to lift sentiment as this group, too, prepared to release figures today. Its shares came off Fl 1.40 to Fl 44.50, while its parent, Philips, shed 70 cents to Fl 23.00. MILAN suffered after last week's technical recovery, and although it closed above its lows the final MIB index, which takes into account 35 shares traded by computer, showed a drop of 22, or 2.7 per cent to 799; it had opened 3.4 per cent lower. Turnover was estimated at little more than Friday's L57.8bn. Banking and insurance shares were among the most affected by yesterday's declines, Credito Italiano and Mediobanca losing L80 to L1,300, and L610 to L11,590 respectively, and Generali dropping L1,180 to L26,805. Mr Michele Pacitti at County NatWest said that domestic investors were out of the market and that, with foreigners seen as the main potential sellers, the more liquid sectors like financials and telecoms were being marked down. ZURICH was more resilient than most, the SMI index falling 9.6, or 0.5 per cent to 1,800.0 in thin volume from 1,809.6 on Friday. Banks, chemical and food shares reduced earlier losses, Ciba-Geigy registered topping the active list with a fall of SFr6 to SFr659 and Nestle registered coming second as they closed SFr40 lower at SFr9,180. BRUSSELS declined as the market continued to react to Petrofina's disappointing half-year results last week. The Bel-20 index lost 7.86 to 1,125.42 in turnover of BFr533m. Petrofina closed at a year's low, down BFr275 at BFr10,150. Societe Generale de Belgique eased BFr15 to BFr1,960 while Solvay fell BFr50 to BFr12,350. MADRID saw dull trading with the general index down 1.85 to 213.86. Repsol weakened Pta30 to Pta2,560 and Telefonica slipped Pta15 to Pta1,020. OSLO tumbled for the seventh consecutive session, the all-share index falling 9.46, or 2.6 per cent to 353.18 in thin trading. The weak dollar continued to affect oils, metals and shipping, Norsk Hydro losing NKr4 to NKr130, Elkem free shares dropping NKr5 to NKr60 and the shipping index falling 13.9 to 292.11. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index shed 16.5 to 834.4 in low volume. The bank and finance sector fell 3.7 per cent with SE Banken A shares down SKr2 to SKr22 and Handelsbanken's A declining SKr2.50 to SKr44. HELSINKI fell further following last week's increase in interest rates. The HEX index fell 7.17 to 675.37. VIENNA slid to new lows under pressure from the new ATX stock index futures contract, the all share index closing down 7.26 at 346.88, its lowest since May, 1989. The oil company, OMV, lost Sch36, or 6 per cent to a year-low of Sch556. ISTANBUL rebounded slightly after the 75-share market index fell below 3,900 in early trade on some disappointing half-year results. The index closed up 7.23 at 3,939.78.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1057.30  1056.72  1056.66  1054.08  1053.14  1050.39  1049.64  1049.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1057.32            Day's Low  1049.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------       Aug 7       Aug 6       Aug 5        Aug 4        Aug 3      1067.01     1078.71     1081.21      1076.44      1069.17  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Amoco Canada takes CDollars 429m write-off AMOCO Canada Petroleum, which bought the troubled Dome Petroleum for CDollars 5.2bn in 1988, took a CDollars 429m (USDollars 363.50m) write-off on its western Canada oil and natural gas properties in the first half. This represents the cost of consolidating these holdings and expected losses on asset sales. The write-off was even higher than the company had estimated earlier this year. After the special charge, the final second-quarter loss was CDollars 510m, against a loss of CDollars 108m a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 887m, compared with CDollars 967m, reflecting lower gas prices mainly. The company, 100 per cent owned by Amoco of the US, became Canada's largest gas producer with the takeover of Dome and also had the largest reserves. The first-half loss was CDollars 481m, against a deficit of CDollars 129m a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 1.8bn against CDollars 2.1bn. The Canadian company's CDollars 2.6bn debt is guaranteed by the parent. Amoco Canada is completing a broad restructuring including heavy layoffs, asset swaps with other companies and also asset sales and shutdowns.</p>

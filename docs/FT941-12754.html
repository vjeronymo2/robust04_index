			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Euro Disney drawing on cash earmarked by parent Euro Disney, the struggling leisure group, is understood to have run out of money and to be dependent on the financial support of Walt Disney, its US parent. Walt Disney made a provision of Dollars 350m (Pounds 233.3m) in its figures for the fourth quarter of the year to September 30, partly to cover its exposure to Euro Disney. It has earmarked Dollars 175m to meet the cost of providing limited financial support to the European group during the current quarter. Euro Disney, which is trying to negotiate an emergency financial rescue package with its creditor banks, warned last autumn that it could face a serious cashflow crisis early in 1994. Neither it nor Walt Disney would comment on the financial position. But Euro Disney is understood to have exhausted its cash. The US group, which owns 49 per cent of Euro Disney, has promised to provide enough money to meet its working capital and short-term investment requirements until March 31, giving it enough time to complete negotiations with the banks. However, Walt Disney has warned the banks that it will only support Euro Disney until the March deadline. If the two sides have not agreed terms for a financial restructuring by then, Walt Disney has said it will withdraw support. Euro Disney would then almost certainly go into receivership and the lavish EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris would close. Meanwhile the Euro Disney banks are preparing for a special meeting in Paris next Wednesday at which they will discuss the findings of an investigative audit commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy group. KPMG was asked by the banks to assess the present financial condition and future requirements of Euro Disney and to evaluate its corporate strategy. Walt Disney has already asked the banks to consider a series of restructuring proposals that include halving Euro Disney's FFr20.3bn (Pounds 2.28bn) debt through the combination of a FFr5bn rights issue and a debt-for-equity swap. The banks are expected to demand concessions from Walt Disney such as waiving royalty fees on Euro Disney merchandise and ticket sales. It might also be asked to pump capital into Euro Disney by buying assets, notably the EuroDisneyland hotels.</p>

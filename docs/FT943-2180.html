			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Bonds and stocks fall amid fears of inflation: US trade gap widens; Wall Street and European markets drop sharply World bond and stock markets fell yesterday after worse-than- expected US trade figures and mounting concerns about the outlook for inflation and interest rates in Europe and the US. The immediate spur was US Commerce Department figures showing that the US trade balance deteriorated significantly in July and recorded the second-largest monthly deficit ever for trade in goods. The data added to market fears about inflation prospects in the US and sharply depressed US bonds and stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 67.63 in a broadly based retreat to 3,869.09. In the Treasury market, foreign investors sold heavily in response to fears of a weaker dollar, with the US and Japan preparing for a fresh round of trade talks. Bonds managed to recoup some losses during the afternoon. Late in the New York trading session, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at 96 25/32 , raising the cost of long-term finance. Meanwhile, the dollar fell against the yen in European and US markets. By late afternoon in New York, the dollar was quoted at Y97.675, down from Y98.51 late on Monday. The falls exacerbated a broader slide in most European bond and equity markets. Economists emphasised that the underlying reason for the retreat was not so much the US trade figures but a growing fear in European and US markets that US inflation pressures are mounting while the European interest rate cycle is likely to rise. The FT-SE 100 share index fell 41.8 points to close at 3,037.3. UK government bonds also fell sharply in the morning, with the December gilt contract touching a low of 97.50 before rebounding at the end of the day to close at 98.03, down from the opening price of 98.15. Short sterling futures were also weak amid heavy trading. Meanwhile, yields on 10-year government bonds also rose through the psychologically important level of 9 per cent. The declines were reflected in most European markets, where stock markets in the Netherlands and Germany fell by about 1 per cent. European bonds also had a volatile day, further strained by concerns that German money supply figures, expected today, might be worse than expected. The main factor driving the equity markets' fall, economists said, was the volatility in international bond markets, where dealers apparently remain unconvinced about governments' ability to maintain low inflation. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at UK brokers James Capel, said: 'The fall in the Footsie is being generated as much by international factors as from domestic figures.' Broader inflation concerns, economists said, were likely to continue to depress UK gilts in spite of the UK government's interest rate rise last week. With the UK company results season now coming to an end, gilt markets are expected to act as the key factor driving equity markets in the month ahead. Mr George Magnus, international economist at brokers SG Warburg in London, said: 'There is a feeling in the markets that we have now crossed the Rubicon, and what we have seen in the US in terms of rising inflation and interest rates is migrating over to Europe now.' Meanwhile, Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'It is a combination of growth coming out stronger than expected, further upward pressure on US rates and a sense that the German interest rate cycle has changed.'

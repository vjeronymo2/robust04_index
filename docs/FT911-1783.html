			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Costs appeal ruling DIRECTORS of a company compulsorily wound up in February yesterday cleared the legal ground for an appeal against an order that they should pay part of the legal costs of the case. Mr Justice Harman ordered the winding up of Land and Property Trust Co on the petition of John Lelliott Management, creditor for Pounds 6.6m. He refused leave to appeal against his costs order. But yesterday the directors, who were not personally parties to the winding-up proceedings, won an Appeal Court ruling that they do not need leave to launch such an appeal.</p>

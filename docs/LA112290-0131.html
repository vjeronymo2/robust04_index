			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALLS TO DUTY PUT CAREERS ON HOLD;  </P> <P> ARMED FORCES: FREQUENT TRANSFERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SPOUSES TO BUILD  CAREERS. THE MILITARY SPOUSE CAREER NETWORK OFFERS SUPPORT.  </P> <P> Two months ago, Becky Crusoe enrolled in a graduate program in Los Angeles,  planning to pursue a long hoped-for degree in clinical psychology.  </P> <P> Last week, her husband, a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, announced some  unwelcome news: He is due to be reassigned to another city sometime next year.  </P> <P> After 18 years as a military spouse, Crusoe says, she should be used to this  sort of disruption. But the experience is still jolting.  </P> <P> "It's not a real good time to get orders," the Torrance resident said somberly  as she broke the news to members of the Los Angeles/Long Beach chapter of the  Military Spouse Career Network, a group she helped found and now heads.  </P> <P> In fact, the group had gathered for the evening at the Ft. MacArthur Community  Center in San Pedro to talk about exactly that -- the effects of military life  on spouses struggling to maintain careers.  </P> <P> They talked about the problems they face building their careers. Spouses who  need to get state licenses -- as psychotherapists, for example -- might gather  the needed credentials and then have their husbands reassigned to another state  with new requirements. Some employers are reluctant to hire military spouses,  fearing they will learn the job and then leave. And on some more conservative  military bases, wives who manage to piece together careers can find themselves  without a support structure.  </P> <P> "The traditional military wife, the idea of her working -- you just wouldn't  hear of it," Crusoe said. "Her job was, first, to get him promoted, and two, to  raise her family."  </P> <P> The kind of disruption military spouses face is reflected in the turnover among  officers of the fledgling career network.  </P> <P> Crusoe, 39, is the second president of the one-year-old chapter. Its first  president, Audrey Cleary Bailey, was whisked off to San Francisco in August  when her husband, a Navy captain, was reassigned. And the network's treasurer  is due to leave with her husband this winter.  </P> <P> During the last two decades, the feminist movement and economic necessity have  propelled large numbers of women into the work force. For military spouses --  who remain predominantly women -- that transition has been particularly  difficult because their lives are punctuated by "new orders" that mandate  frequent cross-country moves.  </P> <P> These are the people that the Military Spouse Career Network seeks to serve.  Its founders describe it as a forum where military spouses from all branches of  service can exchange information, support one another and develop contacts with  others who share their career goals.  </P> <P> This kind of support system could soften the impact of moving, said Bailey, who  has moved 14 times with her husband.  </P> <P> "Keeping two careers going is one thing," she said. "Trying to take it on the  road every two years is something else."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles/Long Beach network, founded in November, 1989, now has about  100 members, predominantly Air Force and Navy spouses. They pay $20 annual dues  and attend general meetings every two months.  </P> <P> The local network is only the fourth of its kind in the country, members say.  Groups also are operating in Washington, D.C., San Diego and Hawaii, all areas  with large military populations. The San Diego network, formed in late 1988,  has nearly 200 members, primarily Navy spouses.  </P> <P> The concept is spreading. Bailey, the former Los Angeles president, plans to  form a Bay Area group. She said another group is organizing in Charleston, S.C.  And there is talk of a chapter in Japan. Organizers hope that in time, a truly  national organization will develop so that spouses moving around the country --  or even the world -- will be able to plug in to the network in their new  cities.  </P> <P> As last week's meeting began, Crusoe asked the 20 women and one man to stand  and introduce themselves.  </P> <P> A young woman said she has two daughters. "Right now, they're my career. Beyond  that, I'm undecided. That's one of the reasons I'm here tonight."  </P> <P> Another woman complained: "Every time I move, I change careers." The women  around her laughed knowingly.  </P> <P> About 75% of military wives now work, Crusoe said.  </P> <P> Most of those who spoke are working outside the home, but few have jobs in  their chosen fields.  </P> <P> A former teacher said she is now working as a secretary.  </P> <P> Peggy Shaver, 42, a military spouse who moved to Los Angeles in July, has  worked in politics and marketing. Now she is busy with her three children, ages  16 months, 2 1/2 and 4. She said that her MBA degree, matted in pink, hangs  over her kitchen sink. "I have no idea what I'm going to do," she said. She has  thought of trying to develop a free-lance business as an events planner. One  speaker at the network meeting urged women to bring in their business cards for  other women in the network.  </P> <P> Shaver leaned over and offered the woman sitting next to her a blank index  card. She said wryly: "Here. Here's my card."  </P> <P> Rick Metzer is also a military spouse, but one with a different perspective.  </P> <P> His wife is Patricia A. Tracey, the Navy captain who this summer took command  of the Long Beach Naval Station.  </P> <P> Like the women in the network, Metzer knows the tribulations of military life.  Tracey moves about every two years, he said. Although Metzer and Tracey have  been married 13 years, they have lived together only about half that time, he  said.  </P> <P> Metzer, whose background is in computer software development, found a job  relatively easily with a data communications firm in El Segundo. The computer  field is more flexible than some careers for people who move frequently, he  said.  </P> <P> Both he and Tracey attended the network meeting, and Metzer says he plans to  stay involved. He has even thought of developing a jobs bulletin board, a  computer listing that military spouses could use to send out their resumes. The  spouses' group could build such a computer network as it spreads to new cities,  he said.  </P> <P> The main speaker at last week's meeting was Dorothy B. Mitchell, coordinator of  the Long Beach City College Career Center. A former military spouse herself,  she described how she married at age 15 and, as a young mother, trained herself  to wake up at 4 a.m. to study for college.  </P> <P> "It took me 18 years to become a clinical psychologist," she said.  </P> <P> Organizers of the Los Angeles network hope it will grow to serve the needs of a  variety of spouses -- those working part time and full time, those raising  families, and those married to enlisted military personnel as well as those  married to officers.  </P> <P> In fact, the group recently changed its name from the Military Spouse Business  and Professional Network.  </P> <P> "We thought that people were perceiving that you had to be a, quote,  professional, in order to join this network," said Glenda Collins, the  publicity coordinator.  </P> <P> The group's focus is very different from that of the traditional officers'  wives clubs or spouses clubs, Crusoe said. Those clubs are more socially  oriented, with events serving women whose main focus is raising their families,  she said.  </P> <P> "The working wife, she wants to know, 'Who are the good employers? Is there a  bias here?' "  </P> <P> Network organizers have talked of starting a weekly job-hunting support group,  Crusoe said. It might meet on a Monday morning, and members could share  information and their goals for the week. Once members found jobs, they would  automatically drop out of the group, Crusoe said.  </P> <P> Organizers hope the network will grow of its own accord, spread by members who  move on to new cities.  </P> <P> Crusoe described a letter she received from a dentist who recently married into  the military.  </P> <P> "Now she's living in a foreign country, on a base where they staff their  dentist office with military people, and she couldn't get a job. It was awful.  And worse, it took three months for the letter to get to me."  </P></p>

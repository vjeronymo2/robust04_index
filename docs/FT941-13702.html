			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: IMI The privatisation of IMI offers a rare chance to buy shares in a financial institution which has managed to accumulate capital rather than fritter it away. Its caution in corporate lending in Italy has led to steady erosion of market share but contributed to unusually stable profits. IMI has also avoided more than token exposure to recent corporate failures - such as Ferruzzi and Efim - which have blighted some of its peers. With a BIS capital ratio of over 20 per cent, though, IMI looks overcapitalised. Since it has no branch network and is dependent on wholesale markets, a strong balance sheet and good credit rating contribute to a lower cost of funds. The concentration of loans to a handful of groups, albeit state-owned, also argues for a strong capital base. As the privatisation programme continues, many of these loans will anyway lose their government guarantees, so the ratio will tend to fall. Even so, investors might wonder whether a capital ratio twice that of broadly comparable institutions, such as Credit Locale of France, is really necessary. This embarrassment of riches leaves IMI well placed to regain market share in corporate banking as the Italian economy turns. But its real ambitions lie elsewhere. Fund management, mutual funds and life insurance are already producing good profits. If IMI can successfully manage the transition from corporate bank to fully-fledged financial services group without recourse to shareholders, its cautious approach to lending will not have been in vain.</p>

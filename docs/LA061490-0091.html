			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PEERING INTO THE GLORY HOLE;  </P> <P> WITH RIGHT TOUCH, MAGICAL METAMORPHOSIS TRANSPIRES  </P> <P> The heat's the thing. Gas-fed flames rage at 2,000 degrees inside cylindrical  ovens known as "glory holes." These are used to heat glass for shaping and  blowing. Glass blowers hover close to the heat in a sort of fire ritual,  wielding their "blow pipes" gracefully.  </P> <P> The moves are slow and deliberate, like the Oriental martial art known as t'ai  chi ch'uan.  </P> <P> Barry Reed sits on a bench watching two students work, their foreheads beaded  with perspiration. Through portholes in two glory holes, you can see flames  swirling. Even 15 feet away, the heat is intense.  </P> <P> Reed heads the glass-blowing program at Palomar College in San Marcos, the only  such program in San Diego County. The department is so well thought of that  artists often come down Los Angeles for the summer session.  </P> <P> Reed worships this art. As he uses a chisel to break colored rods of glass into  hunks for melting, the metamorphosis begins. Until this point, he has moved  slowly, talking casually, hiding from the bright fire behind dark glasses.  </P> <P> As he becomes engrossed in the work, his movements quicken. He moves on the  balls of his feet, thrusting the blowpipe into a glory hole for several  seconds. He pulls the end of the pipe out of the hole and begins shaping the  softened glass at its tip by rolling it on a flat steel table, a technique  known as "marvering." Occasionally, he adds more glass by dipping the tip of  the pipe into a pool of molten glass at the bottom of a special oven, a step  known as "gathering."  </P> <P> Throughout the process, he rotates the pipe in his hands to keep the hot glass  from sagging.  </P> <P> Blowing gently into the pipe, Reed watches a vase bloom at the other end. He  thrusts into the glory hole, marvers, blows, gathers, thrusts, shapes the hot  glass against a folded newspaper in the palm of his hand, repeating the motions  in different combinations over and over.  </P> <P> Reed started out as a ceramic artist, earning his fine arts masters from  Humboldt State University. When he took a glass-blowing class at Palomar  College in 1976, he was hooked. By 1979, when the glass program's founder, Val  Sanders, stepped down, Reed was the resident expert, so they put him in charge.  </P> <P> He is not the only one to become suddenly entranced with the fragile art.  </P> <P> Tom Licone, one of Reed's students, played bass in a rock band -- until he  tried glass blowing. Now he spends most of his time dancing gracefully with a  long metal tube.  </P> <P> Rina Fehrensen studied art at UCSD, but when she experienced the primal energy  of glass blowing, she too became a "vulture," spending much of her free time  waiting to swoop in on an available glory hole.  </P> <P> Licone is attempting to duplicate a difficult glass pitcher he made a few days  ago. Sitting on two front "legs" and a "tail," it looks like some odd sea  creature; Licone calls it "nuclear scampi."  </P> <P> After several thrusts of the pipe into the glory hole, a number of gentle  breaths to expand the evolving creation, and a variety of shaping techniques,  the replica is coming to life.  </P> <P> Then Licone makes a crucial error. He lets the vase get too cool.  </P> <P> When he puts it back into the glory hole, the change of temperature is too  drastic, and the glass explodes. He has worked for an hour or so, but seems  unperturbed. Almost immediately, he starts over.  </P> <P> Reed said glass blowing taught him control in his life. "I used to be angry all  the time. I thought my fists were immune to solid objects."  </P> <P> Now Reed takes a turn at the glory hole. In 30 minutes or so, he has grown a  foot-long cylindrical vase at the end of his pipe. He "punti's off" -- attaches  a steel rod to the bottom of the vase with a hot piece of glass and cuts the  blow pipe loose. Using the rod as a handle, he finishes the top of the vase,  where the pipe was attached.  </P> <P> After some shaping, the piece is complete, a perfect form with a swirling,  marbly array of fine colors embedded in the glass.  </P> <P> Reed places it with several other pieces in a 1000-degree "annealing oven."  Overnight, the temperature of the oven will drop gradually so the pieces inside  will cool without shattering.  </P> <P> All of this heat and drama does not come cheaply. The gas bill for a one-man  studio can easily top $1,000. Blow pipes are $50 and up. The $220 fee that  advanced students pay each semester helps cover the cost of glass; more than  1,500 pounds are used by the department each week.  </P> <P> But Reed prefers to describe glass blowing in more reverent terms.  </P> <P> He recalls the words of a friend who seemed to capture some of the spirit:  "We'd come in here in the morning, and it would be mystical, with the coastal  overcast. He said that our pipes were swords, and he was fending off the  dragon. This is about as close as you can get to the fire and the material."  </P> <P> </P> <P> MORE ABOUT GLASS ART  </P> <P> Shows: Several times a year, Palomar College's Art Department holds a show and  sale of student work, with pieces priced from under $100 to several hundred  dollars. The next sale will be in August. For information, call 744-1150.  </P> <P> Galleries: Several San Diego area galleries feature blown glass art, including  the work of Palomar College graduates. Among them: Lane Gallery in Horton  Plaza, Clear Horizons in Seaport Village and Gallery 8 in La Jolla.  </P> <P> Artists: Among the artists who studied at Palomar College and whose work is  nationally known are Buz and Wally Blodgett, who have a studio in Leucadia, and  Noel Laue, who works out of Escondido.  </P> <P> Classes: Visitors are welcome to visit Barry Reed's glass blowing classes at  Palomar College. Those interested in watching or taking a class, can call  744-9933.  </P></p>

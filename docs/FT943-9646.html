			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Management: Just in time to fuel the debate - Japanese-style working practices lead to lower profit margins in the UK Can it really be true that enthusiastic UK users of Japanese-style practices in human resources and relations with suppliers, as well as in production, suffer from lower profit margins than companies which have been less inclined to follow the trend? That is the conclusion of a study* published this week by the University of Cambridge. It found that, in spite of big improvements in manufacturing efficiency and sales per employee, high users of methods such as just-in-time stock control (JIT) and kaizen (continuous improvement) had lower profitability than low users. It sounds like a direct challenge to the management and manufacturing consultants who have been promoting these concepts among UK companies during the past decade. They have been quick to respond. Adrian Reeve, director of the Hampshire-based consultancy World Class International, says there is tangible evidence that implementation in the UK of these Japanese-style practices and other world class manufacturing techniques does indeed raise profits. He says a recent benchmarking exercise in the Midlands by World Class for the Engineering Employers Federation found a clear relationship between the adoption of these practices and a higher profit margin. A parallel exercise for engineering companies in the north produced the same result. Nick Oliver, co-author of the Cambridge report with Gillian Hunter, is sticking to his guns, although he stresses that the findings are preliminary. The results could even be reversed as the UK emerges from recession, he suggests: the negative effect of excessive employment, resulting from concessions made to win workers' co-operation for Japanese-style methods, could become a benefit because companies will have the skills they need to exploit better market conditions. At the very least the findings of the Cambridge study will start a debate, because scant attention has been paid to tracking the financial benefits - or otherwise - of introducing Japanese-style methods into UK manufacturing. This is because of the inherent difficulties in doing so. Complicating factors include the financial condition of companies before they start introducing the methods, the vagaries of market conditions, and differences in profitability and the competitive environment among industrial sectors. It is often difficult or even impossible to separate from all these external factors the effect on profits of a specific change in methods, particularly when the change involves 'people issues' which by definition cannot be quantified numerically. Moreover, any process of change is likely to generate disruption and costs for a year or two, producing financial benefits only later. The Cambridge study found that the peak for introducing new manufacturing methods was reached around 1988, and the study continued to 1992, giving just about enough time to assess the benefits. Oliver says the findings are not all bad news. First, the use of Japanese production methods does result in reduced stocks, as is clearly intended by JIT. Second, sales per employee among the high users shows a greater improvement during the period 1986-1992 than those of the lower user group. The performance gap becomes noticeable around 1988, by which time most companies had introduced Japanese methods, and widens to a differential of about 30 per cent in 1992. The operating profit margin of both low and high users fluctuates between 6 and 8 per cent from 1986 to 1990. But after that it falls sharply for the high users, to about 4 per cent in 1992. In contrast, the low users' average profit margin rose to 9 per cent in 1991 before dropping back to about 7 per cent in 1992. One explanation for this may be that it is simply a random variation. Or some of the costs of implementation of the methods may not have filtered through until 1990-91, although this is not wholly consistentwith a 1988 peak for their introduction. That leaves a third explanation, according to the study: that for some reason the high users of Japanese methods proved more vulnerable to the recession - or at least to an economic environment that is fluctuating and unstable - than did the low users. Oliver believes that the fragility of Japanese lean production methods may explain the financial performance. Companies can lose orders to competitors if they have de-stocked excessively. Cultural differences in attitudes to kaizen may also be to blame, he suggests: in Japan, a group of workers which comes up with a new method would pass on the financial benefits to the company, whereas a similar group in the UK could in some circumstances retain the benefits themselves as time saved. No one is saying that trying Japanese methods is a waste of time in Britain. But the Cambridge study does further reinforce the argument that they cannot simply be applied anywhere and by anyone without regard to local conditions. More research into the link between lean production and profits in the UK environment is needed. *The Financial Impact of Japanese Production Methods in UK Companies, by Nick Oliver and Gillian Hunter.

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 8  February.    Ricardo Duran, Panama Chamber of Commerce president, has  rejected a survey published by THE ECONOMIST last week which  included Panama among countries in which foreign investors are  afraid to invest. Duran said he does not know what the  publication is based on because Panama's annual economic growth  rate of approximately 9 percent shows investors have confidence  in the country. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 4 Feb  94 p 9A)    Commerce and Industries Minister Ricardo Fabrega has  reported  that the Foreign Ministry sent a note to Mexico and Venezuela  calling for a meeting to be held as soon as possible to discuss  a proposal for paying the petroleum debt to those countries. He  said interest on the petroleum debt has raised the debt to  approximately $220 million. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in  Spanish 4 Feb 94 p 2A)    The Cabinet Council has authorized the signing of agreements  with various foreign banks and financial organizations to  eliminate the risk of some public enterprises or autonomous  institutions becoming delinquent in the payment of their  obligations or credit lines, which could lead to legal  proceedings against the country and the elimination of credit  lines. A cabinet decree indicated that the measure is part of  the policy to normalize the state's credit situation with its  international creditors. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 6 Feb  94 p 4A)</p>

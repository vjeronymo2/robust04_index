			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Separatists warn Quebec institutions Quebec separatists have caused controversy in Canada's investment community over the past week by threatening to withdraw business from banks and securities firms which draw attention to the economic costs of a possible breakaway by the francophone province. The threats come amid nervousness in financial markets about the forthcoming Quebec election, which is expected to be held in September. The separatist Parti Quebecois (PQ) is well ahead of the ruling Liberals in public opinion polls. If it wins, the PQ has promised to hold an independence referendum within a year of coming to office. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the PQ's leader, urged Quebeckers to shun Bank of Montreal, one of the biggest financial institutions in the province, after the bank's chief economist warned that the PQ would create 'a great deal of fear' in financial markets if it treated an election victory as a mandate to launch independence negotiations. A similar warning last week by Wood Gundy, a Toronto-based securities dealer, elicited a veiled threat from the PQ that the firm risked exclusion from underwriting the province's bonds, if the separatist group comes to power. The political uncertainty has contributed to a widening gap between Quebec and other Canadian bond yields, as well as rising spreads between Canadian and US government bonds. Foreigners hold an estimated 25 per cent of Canadian public-sector debt. The spread between Quebec and federal government 10-year bonds has grown in the past month from 85/100ths of a percentage point to about 1.03 points. By contrast, bonds issued by the province of Alberta now yield only 50 points above federal government issues. PQ leaders hope to reassure Quebec voters that a breakaway will be relatively painless, since an independent Quebec would continue to benefit from the North American free trade agreement and from close economic ties with the rest of Canada. An economist at one domestic bank said yesterday that it was impossible to make an accurate forecast of Quebec's economic prospects under an independence-minded government. But he noted that uncertainty among foreign investors about the future shape of Canada 'is inevitably going to cause some dislocation in financial markets.'</p>

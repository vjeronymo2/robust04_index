			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: J Latham maintains recovery James Latham, the timber importer and building materials merchant, maintained its recovery in its second six months, to March 31, to end the year with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.34m. This compared with a Pounds 2.21m loss previously. Turnover climbed 18 per cent to Pounds 71.5m helped by increased volume and significant price increases, particularly in dollar-related products. Current sales were running about 10 per cent up on last year. Mr Christopher Latham, chairman, said housebuilding was again positive, but other sectors of the construction trade continued a downward trend until the latter part of the year. Earnings per share came through at 21.4p (43.9p losses) and the recommended final dividend is 2.5p for a total of 4p (1.5p).</p>

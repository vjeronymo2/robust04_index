			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AS A KNICK, KIKI VANDEWEGHE IS FOLLOWING IN FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS  </P> <P> For Kiki Vandeweghe, the chance to play for the New York Knicks, after spending  his first nine pro basketball seasons in Denver and Portland, was an  opportunity to carry on a rich family tradition.  </P> <P> His father, Dr. Ernie Vandeweghe, was a popular guard for the Knicks in the  early '50s, known for his relentless hustle and unselfish play.  </P> <P> Kiki is a more gifted scorer than his father and should have a chance to win  over the New York fans now that All-Star playmaker Mark Jackson will be lost  indefinitely with a knee injury that may require arthroscopic surgery.  </P> <P> "We have a good inside game with Patrick Ewing," said General Manager Al  Bianchi, "and you try to surround that with as many good outside shooters as  you can get. It's especially important in the playoffs when the game gets  reduced to a half-court game. People talk about defense, but the bottom lime is  putting the ball into the basket.  </P> <P> "With Kiki, I had no concern about how he would fit in with us. I've known him  for years. Johnny Newman and Kenny Walker wouldn't be human if they didn't  wonder how bringing in another small forward would affect their role. But  they're the type who can handle it."  </P> <P> In his second appearance for the Knicks, March 2, Vandeweghe scored 23 points  in 24 minutes against the Miami Heat. He is being used in a supporting role to  Newman, but he is cutting into the minutes of Walker, an inconsistent shooter.  </P> <P> Without Jackson, however, the Knicks will be hard-pressed to maintain one of  the four best records in the Eastern Conference and gain a home-court advantage  in the playoffs. They are being pressured from behind by Milwaukee and Atlanta.  </P> <P> "Losing Mark is like cutting off your head," Coach Rick Pitino said. "It will  be a very difficult experience, but we have a lot of confidence in (rookie) Rod  Strickland. If he can hold up stamina-wise, he'll be all right and so will we."  </P> <P> When the 1988-89 college season began, the top-ranked seniors by National  Basketball Association scouts were Stacey King of Oklahoma, Pervis Ellison of  Louisville, Sean Elliott of Arizona, Danny Ferry of Duke and Glen Rice of  Michigan.  </P> <P> But scouts have re-evaluated the blue-chippers, with Ellison falling out of  favor and Ferry now being viewed as no worse than a second choice.  </P> <P> "Trouble with Ellison is that he seldom breaks a sweat," said one NBA scout,  preferring anonymity. "Right now, I'd rate King and Ferry 1 and 1A. Both could  play center for certain pro teams, but Ferry's great passing ability makes him  more valuable as a forward."  </P> <P> The most interesting scenario, of course, would have the Washington Bullets  involved in the 1989 NBA lottery, winning the first pick and forcing General  Manager Bob Ferry to decide whether to choose his well-rounded son or King, a  more prolific scorer and superior shot blocker.  </P> <P> It just might make sense for Ferry to serve as Danny's agent. Who knows better  how to negotiate multi-million dollar contracts?  </P> <P> With a shortage of proven big men among the 1989 graduating class, it is  expected that juniors J.R. Reid of North Carolina, Dwayne Schintzius of Florida  and Derrick Coleman of Syracuse will declare themselves eligible for the draft.  Otherwise, look for NBA teams to take a first-round gamble on the likes of  UConn's Cliff Robinson, 6-10, and Joe Calavita of Vermont, who ordinarily might  be second-round selections.  </P> <P> First-round sleepers: Arizona forward Anthony Cook, Houston forward Richard  Hollis, Wisconsin guard Trent Jackson and Seton Hall forward Daryll Walker.  </P> <P> One Grant too many: On draft day last June, Chicago forward Horace Grant was  hoping the Bulls would draft his twin brother, Harvey, of Oklahoma. Picking  right before the Bullets, the Bulls selected center Will Perdue of Vanderbilt.  </P> <P> "I thought with (Bulls forward) Scottie Pippen hurt, the Bulls might pick me,"  Harvey said. "But I really didn't want to play in Chicago because I didn't want  to get caught up with people saying, 'Harvey had this kind of year. Now it's  your turn.' "  </P> <P> Dutch treat: While the Indiana Pacers rank as one of the season's major busts,  the rapid improvement of rookie center Rik Smits, the native of the Netherlands  who played at Marist College, bodes well for the future.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing I've done is to get the other guys to accept Rik," Coach  Dick Versace said. "I told them, 'You're witnessing the changing of the guard  at center. This kid is a worker. And, until further notice, I expect you to get  him the ball.' "  </P> <P> Detroit playmaker Isiah Thomas is being credited with being the man behind the  scenes in the acquisition of his Chicago pal Mark Aguirre from Dallas in  exchange for Adrian Dantley. Said Dallas TV analyst Bob Weiss: "If the Pistons  win the title, should Isiah be voted NBA Executive of the Year?"  </P></p>

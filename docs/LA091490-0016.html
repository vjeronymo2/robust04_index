			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> COACHES' LOSSES ARE OTHERS' GAINS  </P> <P> Seattle Coach Chuck Knox and Raider Coach Art Shell lost a combined 106 pounds  during the off-season, helping raise $124,000 for the Miami Project to Cure  Paralysis. For each pound lost, the charity received $500 from a liquid diet  product.  </P> <P> Knox lost 63 pounds, dropping from 236 pounds to 173, and Shell lost 43, going  from 338 pounds to 295. Shell and Knox are featured in a TV commercial along  with the other NFL coaches who participated: Bill Parcells of the New York  Giants, Buddy Ryan of the Philadelphia Eagles, Joe Gibbs of the Washington  Redskins and Dan Henning of the San Diego Chargers.  </P> <P> The Raiders have sold more than 1,000 season tickets since Tuesday's  announcement that the team will remain in Los Angeles, Raider Executive  Assistant Al LoCasale said.  </P> <P> The Raiders, however, won't disclose the total number of season tickets sold  this season.  </P> <P> After installing the run-and-shoot offense, the Seahawks punted nine times and  were shut out at Chicago in their season opener last Sunday, 17-0, prompting  cynics to label the new offense the run-and-boot.  </P> <P> Dave Krieg, who signed a five-year, $7.5-million contract during training camp,  was sacked three times, threw three interceptions and passed for 97 yards.  </P> <P> Although Shell has refused to say who will start at tailback for the Raiders in  Sunday's game at Seattle, it appears that Marcus Allen is going to get the nod  over Vance Mueller, according to Mueller, who started at tailback last Sunday  against Denver.

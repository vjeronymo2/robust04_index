			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Police To Get 8 Billion French </F> Francs Over Five Years"--first three paragraphs are LE MONDE  introduction]    [Text] The interior minister presented a sweeping plan to  improve France's domestic security during a "roundtable" that  was held on Thursday, 28 April. The meeting was part of the  mission Charles Pasqua delegated to his close collaborator,  state advisor Pierre Bordry (see LE MONDE, 14 November, 1993),  to reflect on and make proposals concerning internal security  issues.     -  MODERNIZATION--The minister unveiled the broad  outlines of his draft orientation and program bill for the  national police before a gathering of law and order  organizations. His audience included the Independent Federation  of Police Trade Unions (FASP, a left-wing organization that  represents the majority of noncommissioned officers and police  officers); the National Independent Police Federation (FNAP, a  moderate association representing most "nonmilitary" police  inspectors and superintendents); the Union of Trade Unions for  Specific Divisions (USC, the second-ranking, right-wing  organization of "police in uniform"); and all the directors of  the national police.    -  MULTIYEAR PLANS--That same morning, the  prime minister promised Charles Pasqua that his reform would be  funded by a budget package of 8 billion francs [FR] over five  years.     Charles Pasqua wants his draft orientation and  program/appropriations bill for the police to "not only  highlight the social role of police officers and bring them  closer to the French people, but to lay the foundation of a new,  national police organization; change its working conditions; and  provide it with the resources it needs in terms of personnel,  equipment, and methodology to lay the groundwork for the police  force of the 21st century." But the minister's ambitions are  actually even grander in scale: the Pasqua plan affects all  state or private employees that play a role in France's domestic  security. This includes the national police and gendarmerie,  customs, prison administration, municipal police, and security  or fund-transfer companies.    Indeed, although the plan's central focus is the national  police, the minister's comprehensive approach aims to clarify  the areas over which various players have jurisdiction. However,  Pasqua was careful to put off until later detailed discussions  of questions that normally stir up passions.    The National Police and Gendarmerie The safety of  citizens is the exclusive responsibility of the state, the  minister asserted; his bill unambiguously confirms this as the  sovereign mission of the national police and gendarmery.  However, the prickly question of the respective territorial  jurisdictions of the latter will be referred to a decree before  the Council of State. For the last 50 years, the constabulary  supposedly has had jurisdiction over communes with fewer than  10,000 inhabitants, but the accelerated urbanization of the last  few decades has left that principle a bit worse for wear.    Customs and Prison Personnel Customs officers have  an acknowledged domestic security role to play in specific areas  such as the fight against narcotics trafficking, "dirty" money  laundering, and even illegal immigration. But the minister is  opposed to their demand to become officers of the Criminal  Investigation Unit (CIUO). Moreover, says the minister, the  prison system will take charge of prisoners as soon as they are  turned over to the justice system, thereby freeing police  officers from "unnecessary tasks" (escorting and guarding  prisoners) that consume police personnel. According to Pasqua,  1,500 penitentiary staff jobs--which fall under the Justice  Ministry--will be created over the next three years. To get  active police officers out of the station house, the minister  also announced that approximately 1,000 administrative and  technical personnel a year would be recruited over the next five  years.    Municipal Police and Security Companies There is  no question of the state withdrawing from security, the minister  insisted, thus quashing "remedies" proposed by boosters of the  municipal police, especially from his own political camp.  Municipal police force action will be limited to infractions  that fall under local law and to the execution of decisions  signed by the mayor. Certain tasks that until now had been  performed by French state police, among them lost-and-found,  animal impounding, lost identification papers, and proxy votes,  will be transfered to the "municipals." A specific law  concerning the municipal police will be presented to parliament  at a later date, said the minister, who was probably anxious to  end the debates raging within the majority, notably concerning  Paris. The minister also postponed a separate bill on the  status, jurisdiction, and recruitment of private security guard  and money-transport companies, which also fall within the scope  of the Pasqua bill.    Five-Year Modernization Plan To successfully  modernize the police, Pasqua extracted assurances from the prime  minister that he would have a five-year program plan allocating  Fr8 billion. This is less than what the police unions, who  expected Pasqua to come up with a package of Fr11 billion over  five years, had counted on. But the minister's office compares  the Pasqua plan to the military program/appropriations bill, and  says it will be adjustable and renewable every five years. A  "watchdog committee" to monitor the budget plan will be set up  for the Interior Ministry, which, unlike the Defense Ministry,  will not have an ad hoc committee in Parliament. The Pasqua  plan, which is comparable to the modernization bill launched in  1986 by then-Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, will target real  property, vehicles, transmission, data-processing, and more  protective gear for the CRS's [riot police].    Police Officer Professional Statute To stem  grumbling among police troops, the minister has promised that a  recognized "professional statute" will be written into the law.  This statute, which partially repeals civil service provisions,  will make it possible to jointly negotiate compensation and  promotional opportunities--in other words, to escape the ax of  the budget and civil service ministries--the FASP happily noted.    The minister also mentioned that extra compensation would be  awarded to street officers with difficult jobs in certain urban  areas. Pasqua cited the anticrime squads, which specialize in  "surprise sweeps." The FASP would like to see rescue  officers--"a job that is at least as risky"--benefit as well.  Discussion of specialized unit issues and of others, notably  measures to provide low-cost housing for police, is still open;  the minister invited the unions to an upcoming meeting in  mid-May. Pasqua noted that his law would be debated during the  ordinary session of parliament that has just opened.    Finally, when it comes to the well-worn issue of a  professional career track, the minister proposed a simplified  system organized into three professional corps: a top management  corps (superintendents); a command and supervisory corps  (inspectors, commanders, and officers); and an enforcement corps  (all other police categories, essentially NCOs and police  officers). Pasqua's reform is pushing to break down the walls  between "civilians" and "police in uniform," whose officers and  commanders will be accorded to status of CIUO.</p>

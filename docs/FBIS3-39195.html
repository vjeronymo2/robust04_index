Speaking on this subject at  the Walloon Enterprises Union (UWE), Robert Urbain, minister of  foreign trade and European affairs, listed the positive aspects.  He highlighted four from a European viewpoint: "The growth  incentives proposed in the white paper with regard to  competitiveness and employment will be substantially increased,"  he stressed. Indeed, the OECD thinks that the liberalizing  effect of a general reduction in tariffs will lead to an  increase in the level of prosperity in the world equivalent to  $270 billion for the year 2002.    "The legal guarantees have been strengthened: The  multilateral rules bring clarity and certainty to trade, while  restraining unilateral tendencies.    "The service sector which represents 60 percent of European  GNP is subjected to multilateral regulation for the first time;  the liberalization of services within the General Agreement on  Trade in Services will facilitate the expansion in this sector.    "Intellectual property is protected thanks to the Uruguay  Round. The Commission estimates the shortfall suffered by  industry in the European Union through violations of royalties  at ECU2.6 billion. In addition to this there is the forging of  trademarks, violations of patents, and so forth. Our high  technology industry can only benefit from better protection in  this sphere."    As for the impact on the Belgian economy in particular, it  seems promising because of the importance which foreign trade  has for our GNP: "More than 60 percent of our GNP depends  directly on foreign trade, whereas this figure varies between 20  and 25 percent for most other industrialized countries."  <H5>  Case Study </H5>   Referring to the international flow of investments and their  effects on employment, Robert Urbain warned against simplistic  or glib ideas. This is a direct allusion to the debate on  relocation which he refuses to avoid but which requires a degree  of intellectual caution. "When a foreign enterprise is  established in Europe, it creates jobs. However, it is  important to see whether the production unit thus created does  not replace local enterprises which will have to reduce their  production. Let us bear in mind the transplanted Japanese  automobile manufacturing factories: Their production competes  directly with that of the European manufacturers."    The minister, an expert in case studies, then reversed the  observation: "When a European enterprise creates subsidiaries  abroad, it does not necessarily reduce employment on the Old  Continent. For instance, when Belgian enterprises like Jansen  Pharma and Bell Telephone create joint ventures in China, and  when they are ranked first and second, that boosts Belgium's  reputation on the Asian markets and not only generates exports  in their own sector but also creates business opportunities for  other enterprises and other national sectors."  <H5>  Social Clause and Fair Trade </H5>   Having said that, Urbain does not deny that the ferocity of  international competition and the big disparities in production  costs might prompt European enterprises to relocate to Asia,  North Africa, or East Europe. "The government is aware of this  problem," he stressed, while immediately noting that it must be  tackled at the level of the European Union's trade policy,  without ruling out its implications at the level of GATT and the  future World Trade Organization (WTO, which will be established  on 1 January 1995). What is the solution...? The minister  referred to the suggestion to introduce a social clause: "In  this sphere, many preliminary points will have to be resolved,  like a definition of the fundamental social rights, the means of  incorporating a social clause into agreements with third  countries, the means of monitoring respect for this clause and  punishing failure to respect it."    In the absence of the textbook case in which production  conditions would be comparable throughout the world, free trade,  pure and simple, is impossible, Robert Urbain also said. Hence  his plea, instead of this, for a combination of "free trade" and  "fair trade."    And he concluded with an appeal to continue the efforts. The  result of the Uruguay Round "does not mean that the work is  over." Belgium, like Europe, must pay more attention to the  competitiveness of its economy in a more open world economy (and  in particular stimulate high-level research and development),  "multilateral negotiations must be furthered, especially as  regards the link between trade and environment, and between  trade and social rights."</p>

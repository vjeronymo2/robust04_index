			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Voronkov and Gennadiy </F> Kulagin]    [Text] London March 22 TASS -- The key task at present is  preservation of peace through the establishment of a global  system of responsibility. This calls for working out new  principles of a world order in which both developed and  developing countries are interested, according to President  Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who presented his vision of  the world process to an audience at the British Institute of  International Relations on Wednesday.    The world process is now passing through a crisis following  the collapse of the former socialist system, Nazarbayev said.    He said the development of the post-Soviet space was  determined by two tendencies. On the one hand, national states  continue to take shape, and on the other these new independent  states tend towards integration within the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    From the Kazakh leader's viewpoint, time is now ripe for  reforming the commonwealth with a view to creating a belt of  stability and security in the region and upgrading the degree of  predictability of its political evolution.    A renovated commonwealth will then be able to play a  stabilizing role in averting or regulating possible conflicts in  the region after creating collective peacekeeping forces.    This would in turn strengthen substantially the system of  global security, Nazarbayev predicted.    Kazakhstan, jointly with other commonwealth countries and  first of all with Russia, is already contributing to the  process. "We consider ourselves to be part of Central Asia and  the Commonwealth of Independent States, but we are also aware of  our responsibility for the preservation of stability and  security in the entire region," the president stressed.    "In analyzing processes underway in our country, one should  not cherish the illusion that we are ready to draw exclusively  on the system of values worked out in the West. Kazakhstan,  just as the other commonwealth countries, is passing through a  stage of transition, and the world must understand that this  stage is characterized by a lengthy evolution of all institutes,  first of all political. The collapse of a totalitarian system  does not automatically lead to a market economy and a full-scale  democracy. We have to effect modernization in society and the  state," the president said.    Kazakhstan is one of the few former Soviet republics in  which  stability has prevailed in recent years, which enables it to  confidently pursue its economic reform course, Nazarbayev said.    The recent elections to the parliament and local governments  undoubtedly were a success of Kazakhstan's nascent democracy, he  said.    Many countries and international financial organisations  have  commented on the substantial headway made by Kazakhstan in its  switch to a market economy, and its commitment to large-scale  privatisation, reforms and macro-economic stabilization,  Nazarbayev recalled.    Speaking about priorities in his country's foreign policy  President Nazarbayev pointed to three basic factors. The first  one is that Kazakhstan last year joined the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty -- an historic step because the  republic voluntarily assumed the obligation to eliminate all  nuclear weapons on its territory.    Another factor is Kazakhstan's geopolitical position which  makes it necessary for the country to stick to a multi-polar  foreign political orientation.    Nazarbayev said his country is prepared to become a centre  for strengthening security on the Asian continent. This problem  has acquired a huge significance in the region which is plagued  by numerous armed conflicts and ranks second after Europe in  concentration of armed forces and nuclear arms.    Nazarbayev reminded his audience that he had proposed in the  United Nations a plan for the gradual creation of a single  collective security system for Asia. The first step in this  direction can be made by convening a conference on interaction  and confidence-building in Asia, similar to the Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe.    The president said that one of the basic tasks in the  foreign  political sphere is "the creation of a belt of confidence and  good-neighborliness" along the entire perimeter of Kazakhstan.    The third factor is connected with membership of the  Commonwealth of Independent States. "I was and remain a  supporter of historically-shaped relations of friendship,  cooperation and mutual understanding, which have been linking  our peoples through the centuries of our common history", he  stressed.    Kazakhstan consistently supports the idea of economic  integration within the commonwealth, but there can be no  question about a return to the past since each republic made its  final and irrevocable choice in favour of their sovereign  development. The Commonwealth of Independent States is not a  state in itself, not a national entity but a natural mechanism  of regional interaction in the present conditions. "We rely  first of all on the development of age- old traditional ties  with Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia, Turkmenia and Tajikistan and attach  the greatest significance to cooperation with Russia," the  president stressed.    The system of global responsibility calls for a policy aimed  at reducing the number of nuclear powers and ensuring regional  stability based on reasonable compromise and consensus. This is  a policy Kazakhstan is committed to, Nazarbayev said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic walked out of peace talks here Wednesday [as received],  saying he refused to participate unless the responsibility for a  mortar attack in Sarajevo that killed 68 was determined.    The routine meeting here came the day after NATO, reacting  to  Saturday's mortar attack, issued an ultimatum of February 21 for  heavy artillery to be withdrawn from around Serb-besieged  Sarajevo or it would launch air strikes. Karadzic had earlier  threatened not to participate but then met with his Bosnian  Moslem and Croat adversaries under the aegis of EC and UN  mediators.</p>

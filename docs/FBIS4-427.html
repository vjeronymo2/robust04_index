			<p>BFN     [Text] If a Rwandan human rights organization in Brussels  is to be believed, the killing of members of the opposition and  looting spread today to the southwest of the country, in  particular to the Cyangugu region, which is a town on the border  with Zaire.    As for Zaire, the ambassador of Zaire in Brussels says that  calm reigns throughout the whole country, especially in Goma,  another border town, this time on Lake Kivu near the Rwandan  town of Gisenyi. Nearly 1,000 refugees have poured into the  town in the last few days, including 900 expatriates. These  refugees are regarded as guests by the Zairean Government, the  ambassador says.</p>

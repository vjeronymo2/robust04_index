			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A PERSONAL CHECK  </P> <P> Because I do rely upon your movie-rating system, I was confused and  disappointed by your having given a single check ("Desperation Time") to the  worthy film "The Seventh Sign" (Oct. 3, Channel 5). Aside from a miscast Jesus  (Christ) and a penchant for some obviousness, I found the movie to meaningfully  bring together biblical prophecy with current events, and to portray what a  personal act of faith would be, in a rather inspiring way.  </P> <P> Barry Klein, Los Angeles  </P></p>

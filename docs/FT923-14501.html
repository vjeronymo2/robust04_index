			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Searching for a new niche in the supermarketplace - John Thornhill considers Asda's attempts to return to basics and restore its former fortunes ROMAN emperors who wished to enhance their prestige would often start their reigns by running down the achievements of their predecessors and erasing their names from their monuments, a process known as damnatio memoriae. There was a touch of the laurel leaves about the new Asda team yesterday as they chose to take a swingeing exceptional write-down of Pounds 451m, mostly to cover the previous management's costly mistakes. Their greatest trophy, the 60 superstores acquired from Gateway for Pounds 705m in 1989, is now listed in the accounts at about Pounds 270m below acquisition price. Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman of the UK's fourth biggest grocery chain, left little doubt as to where the blame for Asda's current woes should be pinned. 'These results reflect the past management failures and the decisive first steps by the new team to address the situation. It is the end of the past,' he said at yesterday's press conference. In saying so, he handed over to Mr Archie Norman, Asda's youthful chief executive, who then laid out the strategy designed to ensure its 'robust renewal'. Mr Norman emphasised that this was at least a three-year programme which would not produce significant results in the immediate future. Nevertheless, he suggested that the company was already achieving a number of small 'wins' by pegging its costs and insisting on more competitive pricing. The 10-point recovery plan, which has already been presented to 1,000 store managers, concentrates on returning the company to its early successful heritage of 'meeting the weekly shopping needs of ordinary working people and their families'. The strategy, which has been evolved over the past six months, calls for a narrower definition of Asda's marketplace, the re-establishment of its reputation for keen prices, an increased emphasis on fresh foods, greater product innovation and more varied regional ranges and higher levels of productivity. Although these changes might not sound revolutionary, Mr Norman nevertheless claimed that they would produce significantly enhanced results and give Asda a distinct position in the grocery marketplace. 'We need to break out into a virtuous circle,' Mr Norman said, arguing that improved productivity would increase price competitiveness, restoring customer flow and sales volumes, leading to better buying terms and increasing profitability. Over the next three years, Asda will redesign 140 of its 200 stores to emphasise the values associated with the company's new strategy. 'We aren't going to be like anybody else. We are going to be like Asda,' Mr Norman said. Asda will differ from the likes of J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway by continuing to stock a wide range of non-food items, although the lay-outs of these departments will be significantly altered. 'We are committed to clothing, home and leisure and we can do a lot more with George,' Mr Norman said, referring to the range of casual clothes stocked by Asda, designed by Mr George Davies, the former head of Next. But although Asda will not be opening any new stores, it does not rule out the possibility of rolling-out entirely new store concepts. It is currently experimenting with a discount superstore concept, called Dales, which will sell a range of 7,000 cut-price lines in a smart shopping environment. The first Dales store has already opened in Longsight, Manchester, and initial customer reaction is said to have been encouraging. Another experimental store format will open this autumn although the company's scope for such ventures will be limited by this year's capital expenditure budget of Pounds 130m. Asda also promises to move to staunch the losses at its Allied Maples furnishings subsidiary. The company, which incurred a Pounds 9.8m loss last year, is being cut to its profitable core, focusing mainly on carpets. Already 17 stores have been shut and 13 per cent of the staff shed. Such action will help stabilise Asda's financial position, allowing it to concentrate on developing its core business. 'We are more confident than we have ever been about making Asda a great company again,' Mr Norman said. At present, the City is not quite sure what to make of this line. Asda is undoubtedly a finely-balanced risk-reward scenario and the stockbroking community is sharply divided about its prospects. The bulls argue the downside of Asda's position is now distinctly limited. Its financial position is stable, if still uncomfortable with year-end borrowings of Pounds 677.8m, its sales losses are beginning to be stemmed, and its core business can steadily restore its profitability. There is little reason why Asda cannot successfully renew its trading format and derive meaningful profits from its Pounds 4bn of sales and Pounds 2bn of assets, they argue. But the bears suggest that the industry's highly competitive pressures leave little room for error and that Asda will be unable to drive down its debts from normal cash flow. Raising further equity to enable it to do so further down the line will only dilute any future rewards for shareholders. Mr Bill Myers, food retailing analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, argues that Asda's shares represent dead money, at best. 'Asda is not going to die. But shareholder value will be at least three years in coming and maybe five. Why should you hold the shares in the interim?' he asks. The answer for the big institutional investors, who were persuaded by Cazenove to back last year's rescue Pounds 357m rightsissue is that they have no alternative, given Asda's current share price of 29 1/2 p, which is still 5 1/2 p shy of the rights issue price. But no doubt they will be persistently whispering such thoughts of mortality into the ears of Asda's new emperors.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- ASDA  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Exceptional charges (Pounds M)                    Year to May 1992  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Permanent dimunition in value of retail properties      189.9 Other provisions relating to retail property and  fixed assets                                            89.9 Gazeley property development provisions                  39.1 Write-off of Central Distribution start up costs         19.1 Financial restructuring                                  11.1 Restructuring and repositioning  Asda                                                    72.8  Allied                                                  29.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                                   451.6  -------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Like-for-like sales growth (%)                1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Asda            6.1    5.0    5.5    3.5    2.5    2.4    0.5    0.5 Safeway           -      -      -    8.0    5.5    5.7    8.7    4.1 Sainsbury       8.5    6.8    4.9    6.3    5.0    7.1    7.7    4.3 Tesco          15.0   10.0    6.5    7.0    5.0    9.0    8.9    3.7 Average         9.9    7.3    5.6    6.2    4.5    6.1    6.5    3.2  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Goldman Sachs  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

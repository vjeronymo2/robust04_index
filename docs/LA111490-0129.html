			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> 2 SLIGHTLY INJURED IN BALBOA BAY CLUB FIRE  </P> <P> Two people suffered minor injuries Tuesday night during a fire that caused  extensive damage to an apartment at the exclusive Balboa Bay Club, fire  officials said.  </P> <P> A 32-year-old maintenance worker, identified as Leo Pilapil, was taken to Hoag  Hospital in Newport Beach for treatment of minor smoke inhalation.  </P> <P> John T. Schuler, 76, who lives in the apartment complex at 1221 W. Coast  Highway, suffered a cut to his right hand and was treated at the scene by  paramedics.  </P> <P> More than 30 firefighters battled the blaze, which started shortly before 6:30  p.m. in the kitchen area of Unit 130, Newport Beach Fire Capt. Randy Scheerer  said. The fire was contained in about 10 minutes, he said.  </P> <P> The resident of the unit, Herlane Levin, was not inside the apartment when the  fire broke out, Scheerer said.  </P> <P> The cause of the second-alarm fire was under investigation, said Scheerer, who  added that a damage estimate had not yet been determined.  </P> <P> About 20 units of the complex were evacuated for several hours as firefighters  mopped up the area and the smoke dissipated.  </P> <P> During the blaze, firefighter Terry Lewis rescued a small white cat named Baby,  which belongs to Schuler's 77-year-old wife, Eileen.  </P> <P> "He saved my Baby, I can't believe it," Eileen Schuler said. "I was scared to  death that Baby was in there. It was awful."  </P> <P> John Schuler said his wife tried to go back into the apartment after she  realized that her cat was still in the unit, which was directly above the  apartment that was on fire.  </P> <P> "She couldn't get back in because there was too much smoke," he said.  </P> <P> After Lewis saved the cat and handed her back to Eileen Schuler, the relieved  owner kissed the firefighter.

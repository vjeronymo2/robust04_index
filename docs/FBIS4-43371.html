			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "deu./ub./csc": "SPD Chairman Scharping Rejects </F> Committing Himself to Coalition With Greens"]    [Excerpt] Bonn/Munich -- In the Bundestag election  campaign, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will  clearly point out the differences to the Federal Government but  rejects committing itself to a coalition with the Greens.  Following the defeat in the European election in favor of a  coalition statement for the Greens, new appeals by individual  SPD officials in the party's left wing found hardly any response  in the party and the SPD Bundestag group. The Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP] is beginning to concentrate on the  dispute with the Greens as its main competitor for the role of  the party that can create a majority after the Bundestag  election.    In an address to the SPD Bundestag group on Tuesday [14  June], SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping admitted mistakes in the  election campaign strategy and the image of his own party in the  past few months that might have led to the defeat in the  European election. "The SPD, and I, must deal with Federal  Chancellor Kohl more offensively," Scharping said. To be able  to do this, however, he must have his "back free." In the past  few weeks, he was repeatedly forced into the role of arbiter in  his own party. "This ties up forces preventing us from  launching offensive attacks."    In Scharping's words, the Bundestag election in October is  not at all lost, even though, after Sunday's defeat, the  challenge is now "more difficult than before." The SPD chairman  called for solidarity and asked to stop the debate about a  coalition between the SPD and the Greens. The important thing  is to get across the SPD's reform program to the voters.  Scharping emphasized that "the SPD cannot delegate parts of its  reform policy to other parties, hoping that it might benefit  from it at a later stage."    Individual representatives of the party's left wing,  including Deputy Chairperson Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, had  earlier called for a commitment to an SPD-Greens coalition as a  result of the election result. However, the great majority, not  only in the Presidium but also the Bundestag group, rejected  this as "nonsense." "This would mean to fall into Helmut Kohl's  trap, because this is exactly what he wants," said Peter Struck,  parliamentary manager of the SPD Bundestag group. The tenor of  almost all deputies was that the party must, first and foremost,  clearly define its government program, which clearly describes  the differences to the Federal Government, and get it across to  the voters more dynamically and energetically. One has to show  solidarity and "thrash" the Federal Government, said Gerd  Andres, head of the "Seeheimer Circle" and group of deputies in  the party's right wing.    Within the FDP, a discussion has been initiated on how to  increase the support from the bourgeois city residents again.  On the day after the disaster, FDP Executive Committee Member  Gerhart Baum demanded in the Executive Committee that it must be  made possible again to identify the issues of ecology and civil  rights with the FDP. Despite the FDP's reduction to an  "economics party," only the Christian Democratic Union  /Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] are benefiting from the turn  of economic trends. Baum warned that the FDP must be careful  and prevent the liberal bourgeois from completely wandering off  to the Greens. Kinkel, too, described the Greens, which  received twice as much support as the FDP in the European  election, as the "main opponent" in the Bundestag election.  Guido Westerwelle, a member of the FDP Executive Committee,  told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the FDP and the Greens had long  since become serious competitors among voters under 40, as far  as lifestyle is concerned.

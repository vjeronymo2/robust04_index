			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> WEST REGIONAL NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LITTLE IS THE SAME AS FOES COME FULL CIRCLE AFTER FOUR MONTHS  </P> <P> The confrontation was the first game of the season for both teams, and now, for  one of them, it will be the last.  </P> <P> When Nevada Las Vegas and Loyola Marymount played in the Thomas &amp; Mack  Center Nov. 15, UNLV was playing without starting center David Butler and  reserve forward Moses Scurry, both academically ineligible.  </P> <P> Loyola was playing the game with Hank Gathers, who scored 18 points and had 11  rebounds. This time the Lions are playing in his memory.  </P> <P> The past four months have brought so many changes to these teams that UNLV  Coach Jerry Tarkanian says the Rebels' 102-91 victory in a preseason NIT game  no longer has much significance in today's West Regional final. But the players  remember it.  </P> <P> Larry Johnson was playing his first major-college game that day, and he became  winded against the Lions' all-out, scrambling running game.  </P> <P> "I was tugging on those shorts more than since I've been here," said Johnson,  whose first shot as a Division I player was blocked by Gathers.  </P> <P> UNLV won by outshooting Loyola, 54% to 47%, and by going to a zone defense in  the second half. The zone slowed Loyola's offense, limiting the Lions to 37  points in the final 20 minutes -- a season low until Friday's 62-60 victory  over Alabama.  </P> <P> The Rebels won by not abandoning their own running game, and they say they will  not do that this time.  </P> <P> "We're not going to slow the game up," Tarkanian said. "We did run against them  and we'll run again. I don't think we want to get in a race-horse game, because  they play that way every time they're on the court. We're going to play the way  we play."  </P> <P> Neither Bo Kimble nor Gathers had a particularly good game against UNLV. Kimble  scored only 21 points on seven-of-17 shooting, and missed all four of his  three-point shots.  </P> <P> "It was early in the season, and I don't think I was playing the way I am now,"  Kimble said. "I think I'll be able to do what I've been doing all year."  </P> <P> Jeff Fryer led Loyola in scoring with 23 points, making only four three-point  shots in 10 attempts.  </P> <P> Anderson Hunt led UNLV, scoring 26 points and making three three-pointers, and  Johnson added 24 points. But Hunt has been in a slump, making only two of 14  three-point shots in the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> Loyola's Paul Westhead, asked how he would coach against his own team, offered  specious advice: "I'd play real fast. I'd push that ball, burn our guys right  out, because we win slow, as you saw last night (during the victory over  Alabama)."  </P> <P> Tarkanian acknowledged that his team isn't as well conditioned as Westhead's.  </P> <P> "For years I said no one would work as hard as we do and nobody would be in  better shape," Tarkanian said.  </P> <P> "We're not in as good condition as Loyola and I'll be the first to admit it."  </P> <P> Westhead says his team is better and faster than in the first game.  </P> <P> "I think we're an immensely faster team now," he said.  </P> <P> "One thing I've learned about my system the past two years is we are totally  unprepared to be a fast-break team until we've played about six games. We need  six games under our belt to be a running and pressing team."  </P> <P> Tarkanian, in a complimentary assessment of the Loyola team, said he was  surprised that Loyola beat New Mexico State in the first round, more surprised  that Loyola beat Michigan in the second round, and more surprised still that  Loyola beat Alabama in the third round.  </P> <P> Said Kimble: "The world is full of surprises. There are lot of people out there  who are really surprised. Hopefully, he'll be surprised again Sunday."  </P> <P> Loyola's Chris Knight compared UNLV's Johnson to a boxer susceptible to tiring  in the late rounds, saying that he was strong in the first three rounds, but  beatable after eight.  </P> <P> Johnson's response: "I'll compare me to a boxer, too. When I was boxing, I  didn't go past the third round. Knockout."  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Hank Gathers is being remembered by both teams. The UNLV players have worn  black bands on a shoulder of their jerseys since Gathers' death at the  suggestion of Stacey Augmon, who played with Gathers on a Cal State Los Angeles  summer league team.  </P> <P> Bo Kimble's 1,089 points this season place him 10th on the all-time list led by  Pete Maravich's 1,381 for Louisiana State in 1970. Kimble will pass Otis  Birdsong of Houston with his next basket, and is 36 points shy of Hersey  Hawkins' mark of 1,125 for Bradley in 1988, the sixth best Jeff Fryer has set a  tournament record for three-point attempts with 81. He is one basket away from  tying the record of 35 three-pointers set by Michigan's Glen Rice last season.  . . . UNLV's NCAA tournament record under Coach Jerry Tarkanian is 23-10. . . .  Only one team seeded 11th, as Loyola is, has ever made it to the Final Four:  Louisiana State in 1986.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WORD WARRIORS' SHOULD CAP POISON PENS  </P> <P> I am sad to learn about the warfare between these two Asian-American literary  giants. Ever since they immigrated to America, Asians have not had an equal  footing with whites.  </P> <P> This situation is even more pronounced in the literary world.  </P> <P> Since Frank Chin and Maxine Hong Kingston have achieved success and have won  acceptance (as writers), they ought to act as role models for the young  Asian-Americans and encourage them to pursue a career in this less popular  field among Asians. It is unhealthy for Chin and Kingston to continue  bickering. I would like to be the matchmaker between the dragon and the  phoenix, so that they may come down from heaven "to make the pearl together, to  make it perfect."  </P> <P> LUKE W. M.

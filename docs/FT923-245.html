			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oils index on drawing board IN AN effort to internationalise its agricultural futures business, the Chicago Board of Trade is designing a futures contract based on an index of the prices of four of the world's most heavily-traded edible oils. The exchange dominates world pricing of soyabeans and soya oil but has had limited success drawing in other vegetable oil traders to its futures pits. Oilseed traders say poor correlation between price movements in soya oil and products like palm oil make hedging international oils in the CBoT pits treacherous. Exchange officials also recognise that their soya contracts are most efficient in domestic pricing, and say a worldwide maze of agricultural tariffs and subsidies distort international prices and make CBoT futures less reliable for managing risk for international users. Mr William O'Connor, Chairman of the exchange, announced preliminary details of the price index last week at the world congress of the International Association of Oilseed Crushers. 'While we are hopeful of relief from tariffs and subsidies, we know better than to count on it,' he said. 'A more productive approach. . . is to design a market which is least affected by the resulting price distortions.' The proposed edible oils price index will be based on crude palm, soya, sunflower, and rapeseed oils, which represent 85 per cent of the world vegetable oil trade.</p>

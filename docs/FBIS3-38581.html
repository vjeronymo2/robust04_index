			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UN Commissioner Guenther Greindl by </F> unidentified NEWS correspondent; place and date not given: "The  Blue Helmets Must Continue To Be Impartial"]    [Text] [NEWS] For the first time in connection with a UN  mission, serious accusations have been made about the blue  helmets in Bosnia. Why did the reaction come so late?    [Greindl] It would be naive to believe there are no problems  with such large-scale missions, even more so since this biggest  ever UN peace mission includes countries that are providing a UN  contingent for the first time and do not have any experience in  this respect. If, as was the case at the beginning of the  mission three years ago, the necessary controls do not work  properly, it occasionally leads to the confiscation of relief  goods and participation in black marketeering. The temptation  is great, precisely in such an extreme situation as the  encircled Sarajevo.    [NEWS] Are you not finding excuses for the chaotic situation  surrounding the UN troops in Bosnia?    [Greindl] The UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina started with  support for the relief convoys. But then the following  phenomenon occurred: Without a specific political mandate, the  UN soldiers were forced to take over more and more tasks:  mediating between the warring parties, supplying hospitals,  establishing and protecting protective zones for refugees,  taking official government representatives to the negotiations,  and so on. They were neither prepared nor adequately equipped  for all this.    [NEWS] At the same time, all sides are dissatisfied with the  UN work. For example, the Muslims accuse the blue helmets of  standing by and watching their women and children being murdered.    [Greindl] Believe me, this hurts each individual UN soldier  very much. But they simply have neither the political mandate  nor adequate strength to intervene effectively there.    [NEWS] Are the UN troops in ex-Yugoslavia not gambling away  their reputation as peacemakers?    [Greindl] The prerequisite for a successful UN mission is  that all parties to the conflict also want the mission.  Moreover, there must be a political concept for the objectives  to be achieved. Then an area has to be specified where the UN  contingent is recognized as the only authority by the parties to  the conflict. In my opinion, all these prerequisites are  missing in the UN commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [NEWS] The United Nations is being led up the garden path by  the warring parties in Bosnia.    [Greindl] Not only does the United Nations lack the big  units to force peace in Bosnia by military means, it does not  have any capacity for military planning. The only realistic  variant is the one applied during the Kuwait crisis. The United  Nations entrusts a powerful state or powerful organization with  the mandate for an "action to force peace." In Bosnia probably  only NATO is qualified.    [NEWS] In 1993, Austria canceled its participation in the  humanitarian UN mission in Somalia at short notice. Is the UN  headquarters still annoyed with it?    [Greindl] Austria continues to be one of the most important  countries providing troops for UN missions. Precisely today,  where, as a result of "peacekeeping," UN troops are increasingly  becoming parties to a conflict rather than arbiters, the utmost  importance is attached to our cooperation in New York.  Precisely for such arbiter roles, small countries like Austria  are important. On behalf of the United Nations, we are  currently developing a new training program for UN officers that  is directed exactly at these problems.    [NEWS] Are the Austrian blue helmets fair weather troops who  are only available for relatively safe UN missions?    [Greindl] Because of their training alone, we cannot employ  our soldiers in any offensive operations. However, we have to  ensure in the future that we make allowances for the changed  conditions under which UN missions operate today. The  preparation time for such missions is becoming shorter and  shorter and is four to six weeks at most. We should face these  new challenges with specially prepared units that are  operationally ready at any time, for example, regarding  equipment or the establishment of special UN units.</p>

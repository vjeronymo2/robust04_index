			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul (AA) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has  announced that they have agreed with Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias to `introduce a new atmosphere' into  Turkish-Greek relations.    Cetin and Papoulias met at the Ciragan Palace this  afternoon.    Papoulias said that it is necessary to create `a good  atmosphere' in order to overcome the problems in Turkish-Greek  relations. He added, however, that this can only be achieved  through the efforts of both sides. Cetin stated that mutual  cooperation is needed to overcome misunderstandings.    In a statement after his meeting with Cetin, Papoulias said  that `the meeting had gone well and that the results would be  good.'    Pointing out that the two ministers decided to establish  `habitual relations' to be attended by officials from their  respective ministries, Papoulias further `welcomed' the  statement made by Cetin on relations with Greece at his news  conference yesterday.    Papoulias said: It is my personal view that this meeting was  positive and that it will yield good results.    Also making a statement after the meeting, Cetin described  his meeting with Papoulias as a `beneficial' one.    Noting that at the meeting they dwelt on the need to  cooperate in order to prevent mutual misunderstandings, Cetin  added: At the meeting we discussed the statements and comments  made by the Turkish and Greek publics from time to time. It was  very beneficial. We discussed refraining from behavior that  might incite the public, that both sides should be careful on  the issue and that there should be cooperation to prevent  misunderstandings.    Cetin said that at the meeting Papoulias noted that Greece  also suffers from terror and added: He told me that they are,  therefore, ready to discuss the issue if there is any  information on it, that they are ready to assess it and that  they categorically do not and will not support terror. We also  dwelt upon the fact that it will be beneficial to get together  more frequently in order to develop relations.    Cetin later met with Douglas Hurd, British secretary of  state  for foreign and commonwealth affairs.</p>

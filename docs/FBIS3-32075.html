			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio on </F> 31 January; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] Dear Guatemalans: Yesterday the Guatemalan people  took a very significant and unprecedented step in the nation's  history by consolidating our democratic process. The results of  the popular consultation prove that the Guatemalan people have  left behind the sad pages of their history, especially the pages  pertaining to confrontation, bloodshed, and corruption.    The indisputable yes-vote victory, with 377,044 yes-votes  and  70,761 no votes, clearly proves the Guatemalan people support  the moral revolution initiated by the president of the Republic,  and thereby they are paving the way for a renewal phase through  peaceful means, with respect for the legal and institutional  framework and, in this case, the most powerful weapon democracy  has: the citizens' vote.    Much has been said these past few hours about the abstention  phenomenon. The truth is, as one of today's newspaper editorials  states, the fact that a high percentage of citizens did not  participate in the election does not mean abstentionism won.  Although every citizen had the option of abstaining, the  democratic process only considers the number of yes and no votes  and in the country's 330 municipalities, the yes vote won. In  other words, the yes vote is the option that won.    The issue is that the law and the result of the popular  consultation must be respected because that is the very essence  of the de jure state we hope to consolidate in Guatemala. With  the approval of the constitutional reforms from yesterday's  popular consultation, it is now up to the Congress of the  Republic to fulfill its pledge to reform the Electoral and  Political Parties Law and the Congressional Internal System Law  as soon as possible so new deputies can be quickly elected with  the participation of civic committees and other organizations.  The entire country is awaiting the fulfillment of these reforms.  At any rate, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will schedule the  election of new deputies very soon.    The results of the popular consultation will allow us to  continue purging the branches of state. The yes vote has won,  but there are no winners or losers. The winners are the  Guatemalan people, who with their participation have proven that  regardless of the misinformation generated by certain groups  they know what they want: to live in peace and democracy.    The electoral event was conducted in a peaceful manner  despite the terrorism and blackmail perpetrated on the eve of  the consultation in an effort to surround the process with  insecurity and instability. Consequently, the democratic system  has been saved and strengthened. This is the first time in  Guatemalan history it is possible to reform the political  Constitution without resorting to the traditional coup d'etat,  which confirms we are paving the way for a better future. The  results of the popular consultation mark the beginning of a  truly democratic culture.    As we conclude this phase, I must emphasize that we are  making a different scenario possible. A country seeking and  working for peace must not foster confrontations, impunity, and  corruption. Therefore, the popular consultation was the  mechanism used to purge the branches of state. It took more  time, but it adhered to the law and was peaceful, which is how  things should be in a de jure state.    Now, the people and government must work together in a  spirit  of solidarity for our country. The time has come to leave behind  our personal interests. Guatemala has lost many years because of  its fragmented and confrontational positions. We must not lose  the opportunity that is now available to us.    This is why as president, committed only and exclusively to  the Guatemalan people, I call for national unity to work in  solidarity for a single goal, to consolidate a national project.  Political, economic, and social sectors should adopt national  commitments that foster the right scenario for the country's  governability. Elections are already a handsome page in our  history. Now we must continue to move ahead. As president, I  have the responsibility to keep the commitments established in  the government agenda that allow for laying down the  irreversible basis for a more modern economy and a society with  equality. I know this is a challenge, but my mind is set to  achieve it.    I want to tell you that I am proud of the demonstration we  have given the world, because slowly but surely we are  confirming that we prefer to solve our problems with words and  not with violence. Proof of this was the responsible attitude of  the public workers who, understanding the political moment we  were living, ignored summonses to paralyze the public  administration this past weekend. This shows we are maturing.    I firmly request the National Transportation Coordinating  Board to put aside its differences and continue talks aimed at  solving the stated problems. We cannot continue with this  political agitation. We must resolve these differences at the  dialogue table and spend our time working for Guatemala.    Our government starts the year with a tight-knit team, a  strengthened team bent on reaching a single goal: to execute the  government agenda. We cannot continue to ignore or pretend to  ignore the tremendous social and cultural reality of our  society. We have no ties to any political party or any other  ambitions. That is why, I repeat, our only commitment is to the  people of Guatemala. I am convinced that all the sacrifice and  all the blood that has been shed during our country's history  has not been in vain, because the seed of peace and democracy  flourishes in the hearts of all Guatemalans.    Let us work so that Guatemala may at last achieve peace and  grow free and strong for the sake of our children's happiness  and that of future generations. Guatemalans, this is the moment  for all of us together to say: Go ahead, Guatemala! Many thanks  and good night.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government decided to support the resolution  calling for sanctions against the North which was drafted by the  United States and which is being discussed among the UN Security  Council member states, and to maintain close cooperation with  friendly countries for the passage of the resolution through the  United Nations. This decision was made at a meeting of the  unification and security-related ministers after they were  informed by the United States yesterday of the draft resolution  on sanctions against the North.    In this connection, a responsible Foreign Ministry official  said that ample discussion was held with our government prior to  the U.S. draft of the resolution calling for sanctions against  the North which stipulates an arms embargo and a one-month grace  period and that it thus well reflects our government's position.    The Foreign Ministry official said that because former U.S.  President Carter made clear in his remarks that North Korean  nuclear transparency was the premise for normalization of  U.S.-North Korean relations, this does not significantly deviate  from the basic policy of the ROK and the United States to solve  the North Korean nuclear problem thoroughly and comprehensively.</p>

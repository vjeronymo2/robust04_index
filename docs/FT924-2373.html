			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Braced for the storm / A look at weather-related insurance RAIN and violent storms have caused a great deal of damage in recent weeks and insurance companies are bracing themselves for a rise in weather-related claims. Householders should check the extent of their policy cover and take preventative action in the home to minimise the need to make a claim. Burst pipes are the most common cause of weather-related damage. Since building and contents are likely to be affected it is important to be covered for both. Damage to roofs, windows, doors and walls falls under a buildings insurance policy, while damage to carpets and furniture is covered under a contents policy. Donald Malcolm, of General Accident, says that fitted units, tiles and wallpaper are also considered part of the building. Repair to pipes burst because of freezing weather usually will not be covered, according to Swinton Insurance brokers. The insurance companies all stress prevention when it comes to winter. 'Act as if you did not have insurance and be prudent,' says Steve Turner, of Sun Alliance. He advises people to lag cold and hot water pipes and to clear gutters and drains to prevent damage during a thaw. Check the roof for loose slates or tiles. Noel Privett, of AA Insurance, suggests opening the loft door to let warm air into the roof cavity when the weather turns very cold, since that is where pipes and water tanks are at their most vulnerable, and to keep on the heating at night. If you are going away, you should turn off the water supply and drain the hot and cold water system. Alternatively, you could keep the heating on low while you are away. Turner says the worst thing is to turn the heating off while leaving water in the pipes. A prudent measure is to leave keys with someone in case of an emergency. If a pipe has burst, the water must be turned off immediately, so make sure that whoever comes around knows where the stopcock is. Remember that if you go away for more than 30 days, your policy is unlikely to cover you at all. There can be confusion when it comes to cover for items outside the house. Garden furniture is usually covered under a contents policy but, if it is damaged by bad weather, you will find it hard to find an insurer willing to pick up the tab. Garden furniture should be stored either inside the home or in a shed. If a storm blows off the shed roof the stored garden furniture would be covered under your contents policy and the shed under buildings. Some restrictions, on paths, fances and gates for example, can bemuse policyholders. Most insurers will not cover damage to fences or gates because of a storm or flood. Some insurers, for example AA, will pay for damage to fences and gates caused by a falling tree but many policies will not do this if the tree fell as a result of a storm. Damage caused by a falling tree (for whatever reason) will be covered by Sun Alliance if it fell on to a wall but not if it fell on gates or fences. Your insurance company will not pay to clear away a tree which has fallen unless it causes damage. Make sure that both buildings and contents are insured for their full value  -if a pipe were to burst in the roof causing torrents of water to cascade through the house, remember that the payout on an individual item will be restricted. You should have the item specified or see if your insurer will agree to increase the single item limit. The standard excess on most buildings policies is Pounds 50. If a pipe freezes, the Association of British Insurers recommends that you turn off the main stop valve and thaw the pipe with hot water bottles or a thick cloth soaked in hot water. You should start at the end of the pipe nearest the tank. If the pipe has already burst, you should once again turn off the main stop valve. If you cannot stop the flow, open all cold water taps to drain the system but do not open the hot taps as the hot water cylinder could collapse if the pipes feeding it are frozen. You should also turn off the central heating. Before contacting a plumber, the ABI recommends contacting the insurance company immediately to see if they have preferred contractors, which will save you the bother of collecting different estimates for the damage. Some insurers also have emergency helplines. If you are flooded, you should switch off electricity at the mains and move as many belongings as possible upstairs. The ABI recommends leaving windows and doors open to allow air to circulate. Furniture should be pulled away from the walls. Swinton Insurance says you should keep damaged items to show a loss assessor, in case the insurance company decides to appoint one to look at the damage. Since you will probably need to claim both contents and buildings insurance, having these policies with one insurer simplifies the claims process and you will only need to submit one claim. However, it could be a while before you can redecorate and get life back to normal again. Walls should be treated with anti-mould solution and floorboards should be given six months to dry out. Many insurance companies will contribute to the costs of drying out and should pay for a short period of temporary accommodation if the property has been made uninhabitable. Prevention is not only in the insurer's interest: averting a disaster means much less hassle for the homeowner, too.</p>

			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASCINATION WITH L.A. IS TURNED TO FEAR  </P> <P> Alexis de Vilar would occasionally raise his head from his reading to look out  the bus window for the landmark Pacific Design Center on Santa Monica Boulevard  near his stop.  </P> <P> It was a sunny day and the novelist, visiting from Spain, was looking forward  to returning to his West Hollywood apartment in time to get in some tennis.  </P> <P> His head was down when he noticed an approaching shadow. Then came the stunning  blow to the back of his head.  </P> <P> When de Vilar looked up, he peered directly into the crazed and frightened eyes  of a disheveled man, as the stranger pulled a five-inch blade out of the side  of de Vilar's head.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friend Murdered  </P> <P> "Why?" de Vilar recalls asking his attacker. "I have done nothing to you."  </P> <P> The terrifying attack aboard an RTD bus last week came in the wake of the  unrelated but equally senseless murder of one of de Vilar's close friends in  April. The spate of random violence has stunned the writer and world traveler.  De Vilar is afraid to be alone and seldom leaves the friend's apartment where  he has taken refuge.  </P> <P> And he feels the attack reveals a hideous side of this city. Although he has  worked as a war correspondent in Uganda and a free-lance writer in Thailand and  China, de Vilar said he has seldom been afraid. "But here there's a kind of  insanity . . . you can feel the danger in the air.  </P> <P> "There's a kind of monster that is being built here."  </P> <P> His numerous projects, including adapting two of his books to the screen and  finding a publisher to translate his works, have all come to a standstill, said  de Vilar, 40, whose novels have received several literary awards in his native  country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans to Leave  </P> <P> Although he came to Los Angeles three months ago with the intention of staying,  all de Vilar can think of these days is catching a plane back home. He said he  will stay only as long as required for court appearances. A 38-year-old man  with a history of violence has been charged in the assault.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles is a fantastic place to have an office and to come with projects  to sell, but not a place to live," said de Vilar. The novelist and free-lance  writer said he had planned to establish offices in Paris and Los Angeles, and  divide his time between the two cities. He had even considered bringing his two  small children to spend time here with him, he added, but not anymore.  </P> <P> "This is no Disneyland," he said.  </P> <P> Police described the man suspected of assaulting him as a transient with a  history of mental problems who, according to witnesses, had been babbling  incomprehensibly before pulling the knife on de Vilar.  </P> <P> Adding to the writer's anguish was the slaying of his friend, Charles  Washington, who befriended him soon after his arrival. Washington, 61, a Los  Angeles car salesman, disappeared after taking a prospective buyer on a test  drive last month. A 21-year-old drifter, apprehended while driving the stolen  car in Nebraska about a week later, is said to have told authorities he shot  Washington and dumped his body on a highway on his way to Palm Springs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tribute to a Friend  </P> <P> While riding the bus last week, de Vilar was touching up a free-lance piece he  had written about the murder. In it, he referred to his friend as an oddity in  Los Angeles, "a Renaissance man" of broad interests, whose spirituality and  sweet disposition ran counter to the city's flagrant materialism.  </P> <P> De Vilar is concerned that in his own case, his attacker may get away with only  a minimum sentence. The suspect, Harold Bevoid White, who was arrested as he  walked away from the bus after the attack, has pleaded not guilty to a charge  of attempted murder. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for the end of the  month.  </P> <P> According to investigators, White served time at Patton State Hospital for the  criminally insane in San Bernardino in 1987 after he was convicted of cruelty  to animals in a case involving the killing of dogs.  </P> <P> On the bus, witnesses said he was talking to himself and railing about not  being the anti-Christ, said Detective Joel Brown of the West Hollywood  Sheriff's Department Station.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt the guy is not normal, but how crazy he is," Brown added, has  yet to be determined by the courts.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Near-Fatal Wound  </P> <P> Doctors who treated de Vilar said that the stabbing would have been fatal had  the knife struck the jugular vein, which it missed by an inch, Brown said. The  wound required 20 stitches but de Vilar did not require hospitalization.  </P> <P> De Vilar's attorney said he plans to file a claim against the RTD, charging  negligence on the part of the transportation agency in not taking the necessary  precautions to prevent the attack. De Vilar, who said he has lingering pain  from the head wound, added that his main concern is any long-term neurological  disability from the injury.  </P> <P> De Vilar, who said he has been "fascinated" by America since first traveling  here in 1973, said he plans to write a novel about Los Angeles. He will not  paint a rosy picture. De Vilar said he will write about the absence of family  ties, the uprootedness and isolation of the city's inhabitants.  </P> <P> "It's strange because in many parts of the world, California is seen as the  last hope, a place to start a new life," he said. "But the reality has nothing  to do with the dream."  </P> <P> For de Vilar, the dream ended abruptly aboard an RTD bus last week.  </P></p>

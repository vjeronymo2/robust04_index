			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 1 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  on Tuesday approved a proposed defense doctrine allowing for a  reasonably-sized army which corresponds to the need for a  rational deterrent in the national interest.    "Slovakia does not feel immediately threatened, but in the  current military-political situation preserves the right and the  ability to defend itself against possible military and  non-military attack," the text of the doctrine reads.    The Slovak Republic wishes to promote its interests by  peaceful cooperation with all democratic countries, with  emphasis on neighboring countries, the doctrine continues. The  aim of this cooperation is to form a European security system  without military confrontation. The doctrine also confirms the  interest of Slovakia in entering NATO and the Western European  Union, and claims the right to share in the activities of the UN  as a guarantee of peace and security.    The document contains an undertaking to strictly conform to  the limits established by international agreements concerning  the number of soldiers and the main types of weapons, and to aim  at reduction in these respects.    The proposal also allows for the civil control of military  power by parliament.</p>

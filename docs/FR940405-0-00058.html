			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to adopt the unidirectional requirement. The agency agrees with Century that it would make sense for the infant restraint to return to its original horizontal position after a crash. If the restraint did not return to the original position, an apnea-prone infant restrained in the seat would remain in the upright position, which is the position the child should not be in for any prolonged period of time. Also, having the restraint return to the supine position may be beneficial in a multiple impact crash if the restraint rotated upright in the second or subsequent impact. The movement from a supine to a nearly upright position could help dissipate the stored kinetic energy during the crash because part of the energy of the crash may be consumed by the motion of the restraint (in changing adjustment position). Part of the energy of the crash may also be consumed by frictional forces of the restraint's moving parts, e.g., springs and other mechanisms, that may be used to engage the movement of the child seating surface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Sebring's comment in support of a unidirectional requirement accorded with NHTSA's tentative determination in the NPRM that a unidirectional requirement could minimize possible stresses on the neck of the infant. However, NHTSA has concluded there is insufficient information on this issue justifying a unidirectional requirement, particularly in view of the potential benefits (discussed in the preceding paragraph) of permitting an infant restraint to return to the original horizontal position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Sebring believed that the return of the restraint to the original horizontal position will result in ``obvious bending moments'' in the occupant's neck ``as a result of whiplash action.'' Information supporting this assertion is unavailable. To evaluate the claims of Mr. Sebring, NHTSA requested that Century provide a copy of the videotape that Century presented at the juvenile products show that Mr. Sebring attended. (NHTSA has placed the video Century provided in NHTSA Docket Number 74&hyph;09; Notice 30.) Contrary to the commenter's description about what he allegedly saw happening to a dummy restrained in Century's restraint, the video did not show any dummy occupying the displayed child restraint. NHTSA was unable to clarify Mr. Sebring's comment. The agency repeatedly attempted to contact Mr. Sebring for information clarifying the references to the videotape and to the ``obvious bending moments'' it appeared he saw, but NHTSA could not reach Mr. Sebring at his given telephone number, and there was no listing for him in the given area code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any event, the agency's evaluation of the film provided by Century did not reveal movement in the child restraint that would cause ``obvious bending moments'' in the neck of a child occupant. Nevertheless, while there is no information at this time indicating a safety need to adopt a unidirectional requirement for the motion of the restraint, NHTSA will monitor accident data to evaluate whether neck injuries are occurring in infant seats that change adjustment position in a crash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Academy of Pediatrics suggested that there should be some restrictions on the amount and type of movement allowed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> It is important that moveable parts should not be able to move too easily and should move only upon impact. Sudden movement from a horizontal to an upright position can be difficult for a medically fragile child and should only occur when absolutely necessary.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA is not specifying limits on the ease with which an infant restraint can change adjustment position. The agency believes such limits are unnecessary because as a practical matter, a restraint that too easily changes adjustment position from the supine to the upright position negates the benefits the restraint is designed to provide to apnea-prone infants. NHTSA believes that manufacturers who wish to market restraints for apnea-prone infants will not design a restraint that ends up transporting the infants in a position that is too upright for their breathing condition. Also, NHTSA believes that manufacturers have a commercial incentive to design a suitable threshold force into the restraint to trigger the release mechanism, since a restraint that too easily changes adjustment positions could appear unsafe, uncomfortable and thus unattractive to consumers. In any event, NHTSA will also evaluate the performance of these restraints and monitor accident data on this issue, to see whether a safety need emerges to limit how easily an infant restraint can change adjustment position.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

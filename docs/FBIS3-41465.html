Tribunko;  place and date not given: ``Ground -- for Dessert to Mother  Nature'']    [Excerpts]    Tribunko: How serious is the ecological situation  in Chernyakhovskiy rayon?    Sakharnykh: The situation is very grave. The  city's water-supply and sewage enterprise is the main polluter.  This enterprise yearly discharges more than 6 million cubic  meters of untreated sewage into water reservoirs, causing 2  billion rubles [R] worth of damage in 1993 alone.    In 1993, the maximum acceptable level of nitrous ammonia in  water exceeded the norm by 71 times, that of phosphorus -- by 37  times, and of oil products -- by 100 to 300 times.    Tribunko: One gets the impression that there are  no sewage treatment plants in the rayon.    Sakharnykh: Such plants exist, but their number is  insufficient. For example, out of 11 treatment plants not a  single one functions in accordance with its planned operating  schedule. Only four plants provide the mechanical treatment of  sewage, while the remaining seven provide no treatment at all.  The situation is aggravated by all kinds of accidents at city  enterprises.    Tribunko: Could you cite any examples?    Sakharnykh: I will only cite the most serious  ones. In 1993, the engine house discharged more than a tonne of  oil products into the Angrapa river, causing damage estimated at  more than a R1 million. There were similar accidents  accompanied by discharging industrial oil at joint-stock  enterprises ``Molochnyy Zavod,'' ``Chernyakhovskmebel,'' and  ``Tekhmash.'' On 12 January, an industrial oil spill occurred  at ``Tekhmash'' through negligence. [passage omitted]    Tribunko: I would like to know your opinion  regarding the building of the facility for processing toxic  waste.    Sakharnykh: This is not a bad idea. If everything  goes according to plan, and all the technological requirements  are observed, the functioning of the facility will not aggravate  the ecological situation in the region. However, we cannot  disregard the notorious ``what if'' factor which can bring about  big trouble, including deaths.    Besides, I do not understand the haste with which this idea  is being implemented. Geologic research has not been completed,  there has been no independent experts' evaluation of the  project, nor its technical and economic justification. Thus, I  believe that it is too early to speak about the facility at this  point.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Heiton declines 36% but curbs losses from UK operations A REDUCTION of 36 per cent in pre-tax profits was announced by Heiton Holdings, the Dublin-based steel stockholding and buil-ders' merchant group, for the half year to October 31 1991. The fall to IPounds 820,000 (Pounds 762,000) compared with IPounds 1.28m last time and was struck on turnover down 13 per cent, from IPounds 34m to IPounds 29.7m. Mr Richard Hewat, chairman, said the lower turnover 'was largely due to the major rationalisation implemented in our UK operations' where sales dropped to just IPounds 128,000 (IPounds 4.51m). He added that the second half would be difficult but that losses in the UK had been eliminated. Last year Mr Leo Martin, the group's financial dir-ector, said that the group planned to wind down its UK operations as 'we see no upturn in demand in the UK for the next 18 months or two years'. The company's focus was now to concentrate on ex-panding Atlantic Homecare, its DIY retail division, which had continued to increase turnover in spite of the recession. Earnings per share worked through at 1.75p (2.54p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.65p. An extraordinary IPounds 200,000 charge represented additional costs for the implementation of the rationalisation plan in the UK. Heiton also announced the merger of four companies involved in solid fuel distribution, including its 41.5 per cent owned Consolidated Holdings. Heiton will receive a 22 per cent stake in Jubilata, the new company.</p>

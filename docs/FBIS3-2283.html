Guo Chengdong, Zhang Guozhong, Wang Jingsan and Yin Jin left  Taiwan more than one year after thy escaped persecution on the  mainland and sneaked into Taiwan in 1992. "They are the first  group of mainland dissidents who have been granted political  asylum by a Western Government after escaping to Taiwan," the  association said.    The four, all in their early 30's, have been wanted by  mainland authorities for their roles in the student-led  Tiananmen demonstrations which ended after a bloody crackdown on  June 4, 1989.    They sneaked into Taiwan in September 1992 and were first  detained at a special reception center in Hsinchu, Northern  Taiwan along with other illegal mainland immigrants. After  repeated petitions, they finally convinced the Republic of China  [ROC] government that they were political dissidents and should  not be repatriated to the mainland.    With the assistance of human rights organizations in Taiwan  and New York, the four applied for "political refugee" status  with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The  Swedish Government recently agreed to accept the four as  "political refugees."    The ROC Government gave each of them US$1,000 pocket money  and other gifts before their departure. The government will  also provide them with one-year grants for Swedish language  study and other living expenses.    Taiwan is reluctant to let them stay in consideration of  relations with the mainland, some observers said.</p>

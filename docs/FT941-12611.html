			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Investors in Russia find going tough Foreign companies operating in Russia expect little change to an already difficult investment climate, with many pointing out that conditions for investing or selling their goods and services had begun to deteriorate even before Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, announced 'corrections' to the government's market reforms last week. Mr Max Dajnowicz, representative for General Motors, said the government's year-end increases in import tariffs had killed off legal car imports, encouraging an influx of unsafe, stolen cars and reducing tax revenues. 'It's not clear who is protecting whom here,' he said. A western telecommunications executive, who asked not to be named for fear of hurting his company's relations with the authorities, said various ministries were violating a presidential decree issued last autumn to protect foreign investment. 'The ministries are reimposing monopolies and altering the terms of the licences on which companies based their decisions to come here,' he said. He pointed to the ministries for telecommunications, agriculture and oil as examples. Mr Byron Ratliff, the oil expert at Price Waterhouse in Moscow, agreed that constant changes in tax, legislation for joint ventures and never-ending negotiations over bigger deals in 1993 meant that oil companies expected similarly poor treatment this year. Even when pro-western reformers at the top had proclaimed a desire for foreign investment, it had been blocked at lower level by officials reluctant to share the country's biggest export earner with foreign investors. He said the new government had decided to 'listen to the election results' last month in which communists and ultra-nationalists were successful. Despite the 'one bright spot' of a new law allowing production-sharing, which offered potentially more secure revenues for western companies than joint ventures, he believed significant investment by oil companies would be possible only when the country really wanted it. 'I think (western oil) people are just waiting for some unforeseen event which will say, 'Yes, foreign investment is required and welcome'.' Some were optimistic in so far as they said matters could not get worse. 'If you consider what has happened over the past three years, this is just another blip on the screen,' said Mr David Geovanis, director of Ducat-Liggett, a joint venture which produces cigarettes and develops property. During three tumultuous years, which have seen the collapse of the Soviet Union and two failed coups, his company has managed to overcome difficulties including a protracted dispute with the workforce of a Moscow cigarette factory it has since invested in. 'There is an entrepreneurial drive in this country which moves ahead regardless of what happens,' he said. A few bankers even expressed hopes of an improvement. The bankers have little reason to miss the radical reformers, who failed to reschedule Russia's commercial debts on terms desired by western banks and supported Russian banks' demands for protection against the western competition. 'They were the ones who cut back the terms of our banking licences,' said one who declined to be identified, referring to a presidential decree restricting the terms of licences given out by the central bank. Mr Dominique Menu, the representative of Banque Nationale de Paris, said there was hope 'for some discipline' if Mr Chernomyrdin displayed as prime minister the ability and strength he had demonstrated as head of Gasprom, the country's gas monopoly. Whatever happened, he faced an extremely difficult task in trying to keep industry afloat, while keeping a grip on spending. 'It's like riding a bicycle,' he said. 'You have to keep moving so the bicycle does not fall over, while being able to control it at a downhill speed. Now we're going to see if Mr Chernomyrdin can ride a bicycle in these conditions.'</p>

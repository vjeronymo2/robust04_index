			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Ukraine demands admiral be fired UKRAINIAN leaders yesterday called for the sacking of the Black Sea fleet's pro-Russian commander, Admiral Igor Kasatonov, raising the tempo of their conflict with Moscow over control of the fleet. At a press conference yesterday, Mr Vitold Fokind, the Ukrainian prime minister, said that the conflict over the Black Sea fleet could not be resolved until the commander was replaced. Ukrainian television and radio reported that Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk sent telegrams to Commonwealth military leaders demanding that Admiral Kasatonov be sacked. Admiral Kasatonov is an ethnic Russian who took the helm of the Black Sea fleet after the attempted putsch last summer. He makes a point of taking orders only from Moscow, going so far as to refuse to meet with Ukrainian MPs this week. The Ukrainian move could provoke an angry reaction from Moscow, whose interest in the fleet was underscored by Russian President Boris Yeltsin's unscheduled visit to Novo-Rossysk, Russia's Black Sea port, earlier this week. The controversy over the Black Sea fleet, which flared up earlier this month when Ukraine asked seamen to swear an oath of allegiance, has being hotly debated. Both sides agree that Ukraine should take the non-strategic ships and that the strategic forces should go to the Commonwealth, but the definition of strategic is fiercely contested. Many believe the struggle for the fleet is in fact a struggle for the coveted Crimean peninsula. Mr Fokind also said yesterday that the Russian takeover of Vnesheconombank, the former Soviet foreign trade bank, earlier this month prompted his declaration that Ukraine will pay its 16.37 per cent share of the Soviet Union's foreign debt independently. Mr Fokind said he believes the west is backing away from its insistence that Ukraine pay its debt 'jointly and severally' with other republics. Germany has taken the hardest line but Mr Fokind said he hoped Mr Kravchuk will persuade Chancellor Helmut Kohl of the Ukrainian position when the two meet on Monday.</p>

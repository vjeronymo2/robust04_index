			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) EPA Hazardous Waste Number;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The corresponding treatment standards for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, and wastes prohibited pursuant to &sect;268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). Treatment standards for all other restricted wastes must either be included, or be referenced by including on the notification the applicable wastewater (as defined in &sect;268.2(f)) or nonwastewater (as defined in &sect;268.2(d)) category, the applicable subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste-specific criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanides), and the CFR section(s) and paragraph(s) where the applicable treatment standard appears. Where the applicable treatment standards are expressed as specified technologies in &sect;268.42, the applicable five-letter treatment code found in Table 1 of &sect;268.42 (e.g., INCIN, WETOX) also must be listed on the notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Waste analysis data, where available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The certification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies with the treatment standards specified in 40 CFR Part 268, Subpart D and all applicable prohibitions set forth in 40 CFR 268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). I believe that the information I submitted is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of a fine and imprisonment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) If a generator's waste is subject to an exemption from a prohibition on the type of land disposal method utilized for the waste (such as, but not limited to, a case-by-case extension under &sect;268.5, an exemption under &sect;268.6, or a nationwide capacity variance under subpart C of this part), with each shipment of waste he must submit a notice to the facility receiving his waste stating that the waste is not prohibited from land disposal. The notice must include the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) EPA Hazardous Waste Number;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The corresponding treatment standards for wastes F001&hyph;F005, F039, and wastes prohibited pursuant to &sect;268.32 or RCRA section 3004(d). Treatment standards for all other restricted wastes must either be included, or be referenced by including on the notification the applicable wastewater (as defined in &sect;268.2(f)) or nonwastewater (as defined in &sect;268.2(d)) category, the applicable subdivisions made within a waste code based on waste-specific criteria (such as D003 reactive cyanides), and the CFR section(s) and paragraph(s) where the applicable treatment standard appears. Where the applicable treatment standards are expressed as specified technologies in &sect;268.42, the applicable five-letter treatment code found in Table 1 of &sect;268.42 (e.g., INCIN, WETOX) also must be listed on the notification;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The manifest number associated with the shipment of waste;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Waste analysis data, where available;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) For hazardous debris, the contaminants subject to treatment as provided by &sect;268.45(b) and the following statement: ``This hazardous debris is subject to the alternative treatment standards of 40 CFR 268.45''; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The date the waste is subject to the prohibitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If a generator is managing prohibited waste in tanks, containers, or containment buildings regulated under 40 CFR 262.34, and is treating such waste in such tanks, containers, or containment buildings to meet applicable treatment standards under subpart D of this part, the generator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes the procedures the generator will carry out to comply with the treatment standards. (Generators treating hazardous debris under the alternative treatment standards of Table 1, &sect;268.45, however, are not subject to these waste analysis requirements.) The plan must be kept on site in the generator's records, and the following requirements must be met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The waste analysis plan must be based on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative sample of the prohibited waste(s) being treated, and contain all information necessary to treat the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this Part, including the selected testing frequency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Such plan must be filed with the EPA Regional Administrator (or his designated representative) or State authorized to implement Part 268 requirements a minimum of 30 days prior to the treatment activity, with delivery verified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this paragraph must comply with the notification requirements of &sect;268.7(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted based solely on his knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used to make this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's files. If a generator determines whether the waste is restricted based on testing this waste or an extract developed using the test method described in Appendix I of this part, all waste analysis data must be retained on-site in the generator's files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) If a generator determines that he is managing a restricted waste that is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exempt from Subtitle C regulation, under 40 CFR 261.2 through 261.6 subsequent to the point of generation, he must place a one-time notice stating such generation, subsequent exclusion from the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exemption from RCRA, Subtitle C regulation, and the disposition of the waste, in the facility's file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Generators must retain on-site a copy of all notices, certifications, demonstrations, waste analysis data, and other documentation produced pursuant to this section for at least five years from the date that the waste that is the subject of such documentation was last sent to on-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. The five year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator. The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even when the hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the waste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste under 40 CFR 261.2&hyph;261.6, or exempted from Subtitle C regulation, subsequent to the point of generation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) If a generator is managing a lab pack that contains wastes identified in Appendix IV of this part and wishes to use the alternative treatment standard under &sect;268.42, with each shipment of waste the generator must submit a notice to the treatment facility in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The generator must also comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, and must submit the following certification, which must be signed by an authorized representative: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste and that the lab pack contains only the wastes specified in appendix IV to part 268 or solid wastes not subject to regulation under 40 CFR part 261. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (9) If a generator is managing a lab pack that contains organic wastes specified in Appendix V of this Part and wishes to use the alternate treatment standards under &sect;268.42, with each shipment of waste the generator must submit a notice to the treatment facility in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The generator also must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this section, and must submit the following certification which must be signed by an authorized representative: I certify under penalty of law that I personally have examined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through knowledge of the waste and that the lab pack contains only organic waste specified in Appendix V to Part 268 or solid wastes not subject to regulation under 40 CFR Part 261. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the possibility of fine or imprisonment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Small quantity generators with tolling agreements pursuant to 40 CFR 262.20(e) must comply with the applicable notification and certification requirements of paragraph (a) of this section for the initial shipment of the waste subject to the agreement. Such generators must retain on-site a copy of the notification and certification, together with the tolling agreement, for at least three years after termination or expiration of the agreement. The three-year record retention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved enforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22492 Filed 9&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

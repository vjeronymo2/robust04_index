			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Toronto invites bids for 53% of Telesat Canada THE Canadian government yesterday called for private sector bids for its 53 per cent stake in Telesat Canada, which has a monopoly on the country's satellite communications. As with earlier privatisations, foreign ownership will be restricted, in this case to a 20 per cent holding. The sale will be subject to review under the Competition Act. Telesat owns and operates six satellites and a network of about 500 earth stations. It earned CDollars 26.4m (USDollars 23m) in fiscal 1990 from revenues of CDollars 177.8m.</p>

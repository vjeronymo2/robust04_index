			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] After the news on the Hangchou [Hangzhou] City  Intermediate People's Court in Communist China's Chekiang  [Zhejiang] Province announcing the death sentence for the three  accused in the Chientao [Qinqdao] Lake murder case was reported  in Taiwan, families of some victims expressed their utter  refusal to recognize the verdict before the whole truth came  out. They said they would try to request a meeting with  President Li and Premier Lien Chan in the next few days to  appeal to the government for a clear and definite answer to the  proper handling of the case. The following is a report filed by  (Huang Mei-ting):    [Begin recording] [(Huang]) After Communist China's Hangchou  City Intermediate People's Court announced the death sentence  for the three accused in the Chientao Lake incident, family  members of some victims said that though the verdict was no  surprise to them, the death sentence for the three could not  replace the life of the 24 victims from Taiwan. Meanwhile, as  the trial was conducted not in public and without the presence  of the families of the victims, they have refused to recognize  whatsoever the verdict before the whole truth comes out, even  though the accused have been sentenced to die.    [Unidentified voice] The trial was conducted without the  presence of the bereaved families. What has angered us most is  that the trial was not open. Therefore, despite the death  sentence, we cannot recognize the verdict.    [(Huang)] As far as compensation is concerned, the bereaved  families regard it as secondary because they believe that the  way Communist China handles the case can absolutely not satisfy  the demand of the families in dire financial need. They  indicate that should the government fail to make a demand on  Communist China, the families can only pressure the government  for a proper settlement. Therefore, the victims' families will  (?meet with) Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan this  Wednesday [15 June] to study the possibility of requesting a  meeting with President Li and Premier Lien Chan, and will then  decide the next move. We think of our dear ones on festive  occasions more than ever. To the families of the 20-odd victims  of the Chientao Lake incident, this year's Dragon Boat Festival  will be a sad occasion. They said what they want to know is  just the truth. But judging from the current situation,  Communist China is persistently trying to cover up the facts.  The truth will probably never come out.

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Equities: Markets braced for flurry of Asian issues ASIAN companies are set to launch a stream of international equity issues in the next few weeks, with offerings from Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and India. Investment bankers point out that Far Eastern names are likely to account for much of the activity in the international equity markets in the immediate future, as recent turmoil in Europe's financial markets has led some European companies to postpone their offerings. The largest of the Far Eastern deals is Hyundai Motor's proposed Dollars 150m issue of global depository receipts, expected next month. Johnson Electric, a Hong Kong micro-motor manufacturer, plans to launch a Dollars 60m global equity offering, with Morgan Stanley and Robert Fleming as lead managers. President Enterprises, Taiwan's largest general retailer and food manufacturer, is planning a Dollars 70m offering of global depository receipts in the first half of November, lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. Investors can expect three offerings from India in the next few weeks - from Grasim, the cement, textiles and fibre group, Essar Gujarat, an iron company, and Hindalco, an aluminium producer. Grasim had to delay its Dollars 90m offering this summer when trading on the Bombay stock exchange was halted. The offering is now expected in mid-November, with Citicorp and Merrill Lynch as joint lead managers. However, investors are likely to be wary of the latest Indian offerings after their experience with Reliance Industries earlier in the year. Shares in Reliance suffered a sharp fall after the global offering, and many investors were annoyed when Reliance increased the size of the issue from Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHOPPERS SPURN PLEAS FOR HELP;  </P> <P> COLD GRIPS HOMELESS COUPLE  </P> <P> It wasn't Los Angeles' cold weather that was bothering Alicia and Philip  Hetzel.  </P> <P> It was the city's cold heart that discouraged the couple as they stood Friday  in a shopping center parking lot in Studio City.  </P> <P> "Desperate! Been Robbed. Need a Job. We been in a cleaning business in  Sacramento!" read the hand-painted cardboard sign held by Alicia Hetzel.  </P> <P> Shoppers hurrying in and out of the trendy shops that line Ventura Boulevard  looked the other way.  </P> <P> No one paused long enough to ask 48-year-old Philip Hetzel about the robbery --  or to look at the carefully folded police report on the dashboard of his 1969  Rambler that told how two armed men took $1,200 from him Jan. 24 in Northridge.  </P> <P> They didn't stop to examine his letter of recommendation from his last employer  in Warren, Mich., or to discuss the couple's recent experience in Sacramento as  housecleaners and janitors.  </P> <P> There was a fine line between sympathy and suspicion from shoppers, who  recently have been subjected to increasing numbers of panhandlers in Studio  City and to a well-publicized fraud involving parking-lot con artists, the  "Yuppie Panhandlers," pretending to be down on their luck.  </P> <P> "I come from a part of the world, Russia, where people are poor. I think  they're legit. If I could, I would give them a job," said Isak Bekman of North  Hollywood, who passed them on his way to a bank.  </P> <P> "They're just another face asking for money. Sometimes I give, sometimes I  don't," said Studio City resident Paul Lichtenberg, who passed the Hetzels  without stopping. "It could be real or it could be a scam, either one."  </P> <P> A Woodland Hills resident leaving a boutique was sure it was the latter. "You  see too much of this now. If you need a job, it's out there," said the woman,  who would not give her name.  </P> <P> The Hetzels said they were unaware of the "Yuppie Panhandlers," Jeffrey Dwayne  Allman, 31, and Tracy Chris Hartland, 24, who were sentenced to 15 months in  jail Jan. 30 for swindling more than 300 people in the Los Angeles area by  pretending to be penniless travelers. Allman and Hartland allegedly made up to  $200 an hour by begging in shopping center parking lots.  </P> <P> Alicia Hetzel, 32, said she and her husband want to earn only enough money to  return to Michigan, where Philip Hetzel worked for 10 years before permanently  injuring his back in a factory accident.  </P> <P> The couple spent the $18,000 received from a disability settlement to move a  year ago to Citrus Heights near Sacramento, where they started a cleaning  business. When business dropped off, they sold all their belongings and came to  Los Angeles, where Alicia Hetzel has relatives.  </P> <P> She said she had a falling-out with her family.  </P> <P> Hetzel said he was robbed as he left a temporary janitorial job at a Northridge  firm two days after arriving in Los Angeles. They were living in their car and  his pocket was the safest place for the money, the proceeds from selling their  furniture in Sacramento, he said.  </P> <P> "I don't like L.A. We just want to leave," Alicia Hetzel said.  </P> <P> By day's end, the couple had received two job leads, but no promises. They said  they were hoping for a mild night because they were going to sleep in their  Rambler.  </P> <P> "It's a cold world," Alicia Hetzel said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> However, anyone who cannot perform the baseline work will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered unable to engage in substantial gainful activity, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a finding of disability will be justified. The range of work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented by less than the baseline will be considered so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrow that despite any other favorable factors, such as young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> age or higher education or training, an individual would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to have a realistic opportunity to perform substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gainful work in the national economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For individuals who are not nearing full retirement age, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability or inability to perform previous work is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant factor. These individuals should be capable of making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a vocational adjustment to other work, as long as they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functionally capable of performing the baseline work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Individuals Nearing Full Retirement Age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For individuals who are nearing full retirement age, SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will compare the individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s functional abilities against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional demands of the individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s previous work. Individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearing full retirement age can not be expected to make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vocational adjustment to work other than work they have performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the recent past. However, consistent with the statute, if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual, even one nearing full retirement age, is capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing his or her previous work, SSA will find that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual is not disabled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those individuals who have no previous work, SSA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compare the individual <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s functional ability to the range of work-related functions that represent work that exists in significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers in the national economy, i.e., baseline work, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding of not disabled will be appropriate if the individual is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of performing the baseline work. In such claims, when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact that the individual has no previous work is not related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existence of his or her impairment(s), a finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability will not be appropriate if the individual retains the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functional ability to perform a range of work-related functions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that represent work that exists in significant numbers in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national economy. In contrast, those individuals who have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant functional limitations caused by a medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinable impairment and lack of education would not be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to perform a range of work-related functions that represent work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing in significant numbers in the economy. Such individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be found disabled, as they are today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Medical Consultant Expertise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SSA will continue to rely on medical consultants to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expert advice and opinion regarding medical questions and issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will arise in deciding disability claims. Disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudicators at all levels of the administrative review process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will call on the services of medical consultants to interpret  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical evidence, analyze specific medical questions, and provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expert opinions on existence, severity and functional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consequences of medically determinable impairments. Additionally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a national basis, SSA may identify specific types of issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may require a medical opinion. If a medical consultant is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> called on to offer expert advice and opinion, the medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultant will provide a written analysis of the issues and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rationale in support of his or her opinion. The written analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be included in the record and will be considered with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other medical evidence of record by disability adjudicators at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all levels of administrative review. Additionally, medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultants will assist in the training of other consultants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability adjudicators; contact other health care professionals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to resolve medical questions on specific claims; carry out public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relations and training with the medical community; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the quality assurance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Childhood Disability Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with adults, SSA must have a structured approach to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability decisionmaking in childhood claims that takes into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration the relatively large number of claims and still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides a basis for consistent, equitable decisionmaking by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudicators at all levels of administrative review. The approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for childhood claims must also derive from the statute. Under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute, ``an individual will be considered to be disabled for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this title if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of not less than 12 months  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (or in the case of a child  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the age of 18, if he suffers from any medically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinable physical or mental impairment of comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' &sect;1614(a)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of course, any decision approach for childhood claims must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be consistent with the Supreme Court <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s interpretation of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory language in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sullivan v. Zebley, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  493 U.S. 521 (1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Four-Step Evaluation Process for Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The disability decision methodology for childhood claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will consist of four steps that are based on the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of disability. As with adults, the approach is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provides accurate decisions that can be achieved efficiently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and cost-effectively, primarily by ensuring that documentation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are directed toward the ultimate finding of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability. To the extent possible, the approach for childhood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims should mirror the adult approach. The four steps are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 1_Is the child engaging in substantial gainful activity?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If yes, deny.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If no, continue to Step 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 2_Does the child have a medically determinable physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or mental impairment?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If no, deny.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If yes, continue to Step 3.*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 3_Does the child have an impairment that is included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Index of Disabling Impairments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If yes, allow.*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If no, continue to Step 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 4_Does the child have an impairment(s) of comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity to an impairment(s) that would prevent an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adult from engaging in substantial gainful activity?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If yes, allow.*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If no, deny.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> *An impairment must meet the duration requirement of the statute;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a denial is appropriate for any impairment that will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabling for 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Step 1_Engaging in Substantial Gainful Activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

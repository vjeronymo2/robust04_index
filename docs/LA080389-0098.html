			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GLENDALE TO CONSIDER LIMITS ON BEHEMOTH HOMES  </P> <P> Responding to complaints about what some residents are calling the  "mansionization" of Glendale, Mayor Jerold Milner said Tuesday that he will  recommend imposing size caps on single family homes at an upcoming City Council  study session.  </P> <P> Milner's comment came in the wake of a controversy over a 7,150-square-foot  home under construction at 1621 Vista Drive, which residents claim will ruin  the neighborhood's character.  </P> <P> The study session, at which the council will consider zoning restrictions in  single family neighborhoods, is scheduled Aug. 15.  </P> <P> In recent years, the trend toward tearing down existing homes and building  massive houses that nearly fill the lot has grown in several Los Angeles County  communities, particularly affluent Westside neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills City Council last year adopted an ordinance limiting the size  of houses to 55% of the lot's size. Pacific Palisades adopted a similar  ordinance in April, and the Los Angeles Planning Commission is studying a  proposal to reduce height limits on single family homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raggio Reluctant  </P> <P> Councilman Carl Raggio said he "hated passing ordinances" and would vote for  one only if it is determined that the Vista Drive project is not an isolated  incident but part of a citywide trend.  </P> <P> "That house is clearly out of line for the type of neighborhood it is in, and I  would hope that other developers have more sense than that," he said.  </P> <P> Some 20 members of the newly formed Northwestern Glendale Homeowners Assn.  attended last week's council meeting to complain about the Vista Drive project.  </P> <P> Randy Carter, the association's president, said the new house will be out of  character in a neighborhood of medium and small houses, and that he was  concerned about a trend toward "mansionization."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Public Works Director George Miller told council members that the  Vista Drive project did not violate zoning rules, since there are no size  limitations in single family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The project, Miller said, met the setback requirements, which stipulate the  minimum distance between the building's exterior and the adjacent street and  property lines.  </P> <P> Following Miller's report, Milner said he would like to see floor area  restrictions, a method for controlling building size used in apartment zones,  extended to single-family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The floor area ratio measures the relation of floor space in a building to the  area of its lot.  </P></p>

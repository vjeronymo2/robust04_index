			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> FORMER HUGHES EMPLOYEE WINS BIG JURY AWARD;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE WORKER SAYS HE WAS FIRED AFTER ACCUSING THE COMPANY OF  OVERCHARGING ON DEFENSE CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY PLANS TO APPEAL.  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury awarded $1.95 million Tuesday to a former Hughes Aircraft  Co. employee fired after he accused the company of overcharging the government  on defense contracts.  </P> <P> After five days of deliberations, the jury found that Hughes discriminated  against Bobby Coffey, 55, of Woodland Hills, because of his age and upheld his  claims that Hughes charged the government for employee time not performed on  various contracts.  </P> <P> "Mr. Coffey and I are extremely gratified," his lawyer, Melanie Lomax, said  after the award was announced.  </P> <P> "The part he was happiest about was the false (overcharges). The jury has sent  Hughes a clear message not only on the honesty of billing charges, but on how  they treat their longtime employees."  </P> <P> Hughes spokesman Bill Herrman said Hughes was "disappointed" by the verdict and  plans to appeal. A Hughes lawyer also attacked Coffey's work record.  </P> <P> Coffey was first hired by Hughes in 1969 and was assigned as a programs control  administrator charged with keeping tabs on the costs of government defense  work.  </P> <P> He was fired in December, 1989, allegedly for falsifying a time card,  indicating that he had worked eight hours a day on two days in which he worked  only half days.  </P> <P> Coffey sued Hughes, charging that his time card offense was an oversight, that  he should not have been fired for it and that the real reason he was dismissed  was because he pointed out allegedly fraudulent practices Hughes engaged in by  overcharging the government on defense contracts.  </P> <P> Coffey sought $8.5 million in punitive damages and lost wages.  </P> <P> The jury awarded him $127,477 in general damages, $75,000 for his pain and  suffering and $1.75 million in punitive damages.  </P> <P> "Hughes played games on U.S. defense contracts" by charging employee hours  against projects they never worked on, Lomax said in closing arguments in the  case last week.  </P> <P> She said in one instance, Hughes charged the government $48,000 for materials  that the company was able to obtain for $2,000, and on a secret project,  charged $90,000 in employee time when actual charges totaled only $35,000.  </P> <P> Krischer denied Coffey's allegations that Hughes overcharged the government,  saying some of the work employees did was for secret projects that they did not  know about.  </P></p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Lloyd's reveals proportion of working Names LLOYD'S has issued figures which outline the proportion of working and external Names on all the syndicates in the insurance market and the aggregate values of those participating for each of the past six years. Lloyd's is to make the data - covering 1986-91 - available to all Names. In a recent letter addressed to Sir William Clark MP, Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, explained the decision by saying the information 'should not be available on a selective basis'. Sir William is a member of the independent four-man committee which is to investigate alleged malpractices at the insurance market under the direction of Sir David Walker, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board. Table 1 lists nine syndicates, expected to be shown to have been among the worst performers in 1989 when full results for that year are reported in June. All the syndicates have a below average proportion of working Names. In the Lloyd's market as a whole approximately 12 per cent of Names are categorised as working members. This suggests insiders may have steered clear of these hard-hit syndicates. Table 2 lists the 10 syndicates which provided Names with the best returns after expenses in 1988, the last year for which results have been reported. It shows that working Names were substantially over-represented on these syndicates - accounting on average for more than 18 per cent of syndicate members. Each of the six most attractive syndicates is of below-average size, however, with one (number 952) capitalised at less than Pounds 500,000, compared with a market average of about Pounds 27m. Table 3 lists the 10 syndicates with the highest propor While seven of them produced positive returns for their members, the table suggests that a high proportion of working Names is no guarantee of profitability. Syndicate 764, with more than 41 per cent of working Names, registered particularly heavy losses.  ------------------------------------------ 1: SYNDICATES WITH HEAVY 1989 LOSSES  ------------------------------------------  Syndicate           % Working   number               Names  ------------------------------------------    216                  8.20    255                  7.86    290                  7.61    298                  6.54    299                  8.62    164                  8.21    540                  6.10    387                  3.95    847                  5.16  ------------------------------------------ 2: MOST PROFITABLE SYNDICATES - 1988**  ------------------------------------------  Syndicate              % Working   number                   Names  ------------------------------------------     45                     35.66    575                      7.75    952                     47.73    260                     25.85    536                     16.10    657                     13.87    271                     11.10    923                      8.72    561                      9.56    204                      5.57  ------------------------------------------ ** after expenses  ------------------------------------------   3: SYNDICATES WITH        HIGHEST %  OF WORKING NAMES - 1988  ------------------------------------------  Synd   % Working   Profit   No       Names    (loss)*  ------------------------------------------  389       52.81    1,376  952       47.73    3,087  505       41.84   (1,063)  372       41.64      804  764       41.51   (7,495)  429       39.80      858  431       39.09      725   44       38.60    2,721  332       36.73      (20)  990       36.60    1,101  ------------------------------------------ *share of Pounds 10,000 line  ------------------------------------------</p>

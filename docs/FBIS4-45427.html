			<p>BFN     [Text] The police today also arrested the largest drug  trafficking gang in Santa Catarina State. Cocaine was brought  in from Bolivia and taken to Rondonia State. It was then taken  to Joinville, north of Santa Catarina State, from where it was  distributed to several cities in Santa Catarina and Parana  States. Santa Catarina police have been closely following every  step of this drug trafficking gang for the past year and a half.  During the investigations the police arrived at this estate in  Joinville. The estate belongs to the leader of the gang, whose  name is Lorival Pires Ribeiro, aka Juca, who was arrested  together with his wife Gertrudes Pires Ribeiro and lawyer Luiz  Fernando Martins. The police also arrested Juca's lover, Arcila  Ortiz, Bolivian, on the border between Bolivia and Brazil.  During the investigations the police identified 27 members of  this same gang. A Joinville policeman, a member of this gang,  is currently at large.    This is the largest drug trafficking gang in Santa Catarina.  It operated for at least the past five years in this state,  placed up to 100 kg of cocaine on the market every month, and  distributed 500 kg of drugs this year alone. Among the evidence  incriminating this gang, the police have recordings of the phone  calls made from Juca's home. In the following recorded portion  he is ordering drugs: [begin recording]    Juca: [words indistinct]    Unidentified voice: Yes?    Juca: Is it already all laminated?    Voice: No, it is not.    Juca: Then do it, man. [end recording]    In this other recording, Luiz Fernando Martins orders  cocaine:[begin recording]    Martins, in progress: ...of price. We must reach  an agreement on the price, because we must earn something and  all that, you know.    Unidentified voice: I understand, yes.    Martins: It must be something short and sweet.  [end recording]</p>

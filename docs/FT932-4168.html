			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Interest cut gives boost to Caffyns Reduced exceptional costs and interest charges helped Caffyns, the motor dealer, expand pre-tax profits from Pounds 63,000 to Pounds 262,000 in the year ended March 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 123.9m reflecting the closure of four branches, and trading profit was cut from Pounds 1.77m to Pounds 1.55m. Interest charges were Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 1.47m) mainly as a result of a reduction in the stocking of new cars. Several manufacturers have introduced new systems whereby they stand much of that cost and in return reduce the dealers' margins in an attempt to forego heavy discounting. Currently, the group was in negotiation to restructure its activities in the Brighton and Hove area. Negotiations were also in progress with Shell about future arrangements regarding the petrol stations operated under the Shell Share franchise. Earnings per share were 0.8p (losses 5.6p). The recommended final dividend is 6.5p for an unchanged total of 11.5p.</p>

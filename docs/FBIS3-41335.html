			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Rocio Galvan] </F>   [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 1 February--The local  agency of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  [PGR] warned teachers and parents of the presence of stickers  impregnated with drugs and poison being offered to students.  This announcement was made today by the head of that office,  Arturo Ochoa Palacios.    He indicated that the illustrated stickers known as "Blue  Star," pieces of paper with a blue star, were analyzed, and  discovered to be saturated with drugs and poison.    He explained that they are the size of a pencil eraser, and  that each star is permeated with lysergic acid (LSD); although  others contain one of the most deadly poisons, strychnine.    The purpose of the distribution of these items among  secondary school students is still unknown. Nevertheless,  according to the official, "The information being given to  students and teachers has been intensified, and flyers are being  disseminated as well, to warn all educational establishments."    He noted that some teachers have notified the PGR  authorities  that the stickers are also being sold as tattoos, appearing on  brightly colored paper and resembling postage stamps, with  sketches of cartoon characters.    These stickers have been distributed wrapped in a fine metal  sheet and, he added, constitute a new method of selling drugs to  children and adolescents.    He said that teachers have also reported symptoms caused by  contact with these substances, such as hallucinations, intense  vomiting, uncontrolled laughter, mood swings, and body  temperature changes.    Admitting that the distribution center is unknown, as is the  length of time that these stickers have been circulating in Baja  California, he concluded by saying: "The most important thing,  however, is to advise parents and teachers to take precautions."</p>

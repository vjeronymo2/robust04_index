			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEMAND FOR UNCUT DIAMONDS HIGH, PRICES HIKED 5.5%  </P> <P> De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's biggest diamond producer,  announced today that it will raise prices for uncut stones by 5.5% next Monday  to cash in on strong demand.  </P> <P> The South African mining firm controls about 80% of world trade in rough, or  uncut, diamonds through its London-based Central Selling Organization.  </P> <P> It noted exports were running at record levels, particularly from manufacturing  centers like Israel and India, for polished stones of up to 1 carat in weight.  </P> <P> "The market shows strong, sustained and sustainable demand," a De Beers  spokesman said. "It's not a flash in the pan."  </P> <P> This had led to premiums being charged on stones of up to 1 carat sold in the  open market outside CSO control, which influenced the organization's decision  to raise its prices.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the </F> Jerusalem Ramada Hotel by Shlomo Raz on 16 January -- recorded  "a short time ago"]    [Text] [Peres] What we can learn from the Geneva news  conference is that we still have a lot to learn. In other  words, we still do not have all the details, which we will  receive from the U.S. peace team. The overall terminology was  okay, the detailed terminology has still not been uttered. It  is still too early to draw conclusions. It is clear that  President Clinton made a supreme effort to advance the peace  process, for which we admire him. We are ready to resume the  peace talks between the heads of delegations at the end of the  month as planned, but to what extent the general terminology is  translated into practice, we will know -- at the earliest --  tomorrow, and even that is not definite.    [Raz] But can we refer to satisfaction, temperate  satisfaction, or disappointment that President al-Asad did not  go into more detail on normalization?    [Peres] The tone was too positive to be disappointing, it  was too general to arouse satisfaction. At this stage, we know  some of the things -- we know the overall tone -- we do not know  the details, and there is no point in guessing.    [Raz] In your meeting tomorrow with the two U.S. emissaries  -- Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk -- will you have to provide the  Americans with answers concerning the news conference?    [Peres] Our answers are ready today. We say that in return  for full peace, including diplomatic relations, open borders --  not only normalization because that is a general word, we have  to know what lies behind normal relations -- discussions on  security arrangements, an understanding on Lebanon, and the  proper conduct of the negotiations, our answer is affirmative.</p>

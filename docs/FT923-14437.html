			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Violent protests embarrass Dinkins VIOLENCE erupted in a mainly Hispanic neighbourhood in northern Manhattan on Monday night as hundreds of demonstrators burned cars and buildings and looted shops in a rampage that left one man dead and 15 injured. The rioting, in the Washington Heights section of New York, is an embarrassment to Mayor David Dinkins less than a week before the city hosts the Democratic party's national convention. Mr Dinkins has been trying to smarten up New York's image. The six hours of violence began when residents marched through the streets to protest at the shooting by a policeman last Friday of Mr Jose Garcia, a member of the local Dominican community. Police said Mr Garcia was shot dead in a struggle to disarm him, but the protesters claimed he was unarmed. The demonstrators split into smaller groups and began shouting and hurling rocks and bottles at helmeted anti-riot police. The protesters - mainly Dominican teenagers - then set cars, rubbish bins and buildings on fire. One man died after falling off the roof of a five-storey building. A police spokesman said the violence resulted in 28 arrests, the injury of 15 protesters, two fire fighters and eight policemen, and damage to eight police cars and one ambulance. Mayor Dinkins and other local politicians visited the neighbourhood as the violence began, seeking to reassure the Dominican community that there would be a full investigation of the circumstances of Mr Garcia's death. Mr Brian Murtaugh, a Democrat in the New York assembly, who was an eyewitness to the violence, said the incident was 'nothing like the recent riots in Los Angeles' and consisted mainly of 'teenage looting and rampaging'.</p>

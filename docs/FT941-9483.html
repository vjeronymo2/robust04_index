			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / US President pledges economic assistance to Kazakhstan President Bill Clinton yesterday pledged Dollars 396m (Pounds 270m) in new US economic assistance to Kazakhstan to help the former Soviet republic move to a market economy and dismantle nuclear weapons, Reuter reports from Washington. Last year US aid to Kazakhstan was Dollars 91m. Mr Clinton, at a news conference with Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, promised the aid after Mr Nazarbayev presented him with papers documenting his country's decision in December to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He said he was prepared to extend another Dollars 85m this year and in 1995 to help Kazakhstan dismantle a nuclear arsenal left on its territory after the collapse of the Soviet empire two years ago. Mr Nazarbayev told Mr Clinton his country wanted to join Nato's Partnership for Peace, which offers former Soviet satellites military ties to the western alliance but not full membership. Senior US officials lauded Kazakhstan as doing more toward market reform than any of the former Soviet republics.</p>

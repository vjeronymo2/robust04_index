			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / MGN board given record of meetings beforehand DIRECTORS OF Mirror Group Newspapers were presented with detailed minutes of board meetings before these were held, according to MGN directors. When directors arrived for the first board meeting after the company was floated on the Stock Exchange in June 1991 they found red leather folders around the boardroom table, say three directors present. The name of each director was embossed in gold letters on each folder. Inside were the minutes of the meeting that was about to be held. One director said he thought it 'a bit odd. It was my first public company directorship and nothing was said so I assumed that such things happened'. The board meetings of the newly publicly quoted company followed a period of five years when no formal board meetings of Mirror Group, then a private Maxwell company, were held, say directors. A confidential report into the events at MGN by accountants Ernst &amp; Young has blamed some directors for being too afraid of being sacked or sued by Robert Maxwell to carry out their duties as effectively as they might. This is denied by the MGN directors. On October 29, a week before Robert Maxwell's death off the Canaries the last MGN board meeting failed to confront him with the issue of 'unusual transactions' although by then some knew these were occurring. Instead, Mr Clements and Sir Robert Clark, the new MGN chairman, raised the issue with Mr Maxwell after the meeting. The Ernst &amp; Young report also raises the possibility that MGN's 1990 accounts, upon which the flotation offer was based, were padded by an injection at the last minute of Pounds 30m worth of short-term loans. Some directors believe the Pounds 30m in fact only became available to MGN much later and that the investment was only there for a few days. A letter from Mr Kevin Maxwell to Coopers &amp; Lybrand shows that the purchase of Pounds 30m in commercial paper from Midland Bank was carried out by LBI, a Maxwell Pension Fund vehicle, on December 27 1990 and was available to the Mirror at year end. It was redeemed on April 16 1991. The letter says that the money was held on behalf of MGN and would be returned to the newspaper group no later than April 30 1991. Ernst &amp; Young says it cannot think of any reason for a retrospective arrangement other than to 'window-dress' the balance sheet by showing a liquid asset in place of an inter-company debt of the same amount. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which has since been replaced as MGN auditors, says that so far as it is concerned it was a bona fide transaction that was settled after the year's end. Coopers' auditors, it is believed, were shown the book transactions covering the return of the money by Mr Michael Stoney, then deputy managing director (finance) of MGN. The sum appears as a short-term investment in the 1991 accounts published last week and no provision is made for any loss concerning it.</p>

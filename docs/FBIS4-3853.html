			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher have agreed to meet for talks on Bosnian settlement  in Geneva on Tuesday [26 April], the Russian Foreign Ministry  announced today.    At their working meeting, the two ministers will discuss  urgent issues of mutual concern, including the implementation of  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to hold a high-level  meeting to discuss Bosnian settlement with the participation of  Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United  Nations.    Moreover, Kozyrev and Christopher also plan to consult some  European powers and, if the need arises, representatives of the  warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In a statement issued earlier on Monday, the ministry said  that "active work of the special envoys to the former Yugoslavia  and the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the  European Union with the participation of the United Nations"  must provide the basis for an upcoming high-level meeting on  Bosnian solution.    "We expect that the Bosnian sides and our partners in the  settlement process will take an active part," the ministry said.  It stressed that "despite the complexity of the situation,  military measures must not overshadow the line for a political  settlement."</p>

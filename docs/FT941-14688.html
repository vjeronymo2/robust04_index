			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Death toll mounts as LA counts quake cost: Louise Kehoe tours a city afraid to go home It wasn't the 'Big One' that California has been dreading - but that was no comfort to the thousands of Los Angelenos who spent Monday night in tent cities that sprang up in parks and open areas of the San Fernando Valley, to the north-west of the city. For many yesterday, going home was not an option. At least 1,000 buildings are believed to have been structurally damaged, making them uninhabitable. Interiors have been wrecked in thousands more. Although basic services have been restored to some areas, about 300,000 homes are still without electricity and 100,000 have no running water. Telephones that went dead after the initial quake are working again in most areas, but services remain limited, with local calls especially difficult. It is fear, however, that is keeping many people from their homes. Aftershocks come by the minute. Most are mild tremors but some, such as the 4.7 roller that hit in the middle of yesterday morning, rock buildings and rattle windows. The jolts may continue for days or weeks. 'We could sleep in the apartment tonight, but we're not taking the risk,' said Mr Juan Magallanes, who drove his van on to the baseball diamond at a local park. The Red Cross and others have set up dozens of shelters in schools and recreation centres, providing camp beds, food and bottled water. The White House said President Bill Clinton would visit the affected areas today. The death toll yesterday had risen to 34, with uncounted thousands of injured. In Northridge, 20 miles north-west of the city centre and at the epicentre of Monday's pre-dawn quake, 16 people died in the Meadows apartment building. 'All the bodies we found were in bed. They didn't have a chance to wake up,' a city firefighter said at the scene. The National Guard and police stood guard outside the wrecked building yesterday morning, deterring sightseers. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was loosely enforced across the city on Monday night and about 75 people were arrested for crimes such as looting. 'We were prepared for a whole lot (of trouble) but we didn't get it,' the police department said. Schools remained closed and police chief Willie Williams called on businesses to close to reduce traffic on damaged highways. However, roads from the San Fernando Valley to the city centre were jammed as commuters struggled to find alternative routes. Skyscrapers in the city centre were barely damaged by the quake and tourist attractions such as Disneyland and Universal Studios were also unscathed. In the worst-hit San Fernando Valley, residents swapped stories of narrow escapes and courageous rescues. 'Three homes collapsed on the next hill,' said Mr Neil Dickson, an actor who lives in Studio City. 'Our neighbours across the street dragged the people out alive, but they have nothing left.' At the Northridge shopping centre, a multi-storey car park collapsed, crushing a maintenance worker. Freeing him, which took nine hours, became a television drama adding to the intensity of 24-hour coverage carried by several stations. Unlike Hollywood productions, however, this drama has no neat ending. Picking up the pieces in Los Angeles will be a lengthy process. Many quake-weary residents have yet to find the energy to begin.

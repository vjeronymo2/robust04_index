			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK SEAN WATERS;  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE SHAKES UP SERIES PLANS FOR BOWEN  </P> <P> Mike Bowen, a junior wide receiver at Nordhoff High, has tickets to Friday's  World Series game, but he'll survive if he doesn't attend.  </P> <P> In fact, Bowen is happy he lived through his first attempt to see a World  Series game.  </P> <P> On Oct. 17, Bowen and his father attended what was supposed to be Game 3 in San  Francisco.  </P> <P> But an earthquake struck Candlestick Park and Bowen had more on his mind than  baseball.  </P> <P> "I've never been so scared in my life," Bowen said. "It was something I'll  always remember."  </P> <P> Bowen sat in the lower deck, anticipating the start of the game. He said he  heard a load roar that he mistakenly thought was the sound of stamping feet.  </P> <P> "It was my first time at the World Series and I was totally ecstatic," Bowen  said. "I heard the pounding and the roar and I thought the fans were just going  crazy. It got louder and then it was silent for a second. Then the whole  stadium shook. It was just insane.  </P> <P> "We were underneath the overhang of the upper deck. I thought it was going to  come down and we were going to die.  </P> <P> "The best thing that happened was that everyone remained calm. They even  cheered after it was over."  </P> <P> Bowen said he didn't realize the damage the earthquake caused until seeing  pictures on another fan's portable television.  </P> <P> "We were in the parking lot for a good four hours trying to get out," Bowen  said. "People were taking home fallen pieces of concrete as souvenirs. You  could see the fires over the hillside."  </P> <P> And after that experience, Bowen would rather concentrate on football. This  Friday, Nordhoff, 1-6 overall and 0-2 in league play, will hold its homecoming  game against Agoura.  </P> <P> "Maybe it will rain and I'll get a chance to see it Saturday," Bowen said of  the World Series. "But no more earthquakes. I wouldn't wish that on anyone."  </P> <P> Just for laughs: A group of Santa Clara High players cornered sophomore Steven  Klein and asked if he had any new jokes to tell.  </P> <P> Klein stared at the palms of his hands and replied: "Nothing on hand."  </P> <P> Meet Klein, team manager and punster extraordinaire.  </P> <P> Nicknamed the "General" and "Koolmoedee"' after the rap band, Klein delivers  one-liners before Coach Larry Lawrence instructs his players at practice. He  also performs his schtick on return bus trips from away games.  </P> <P> Here's a sample of last week's material:  </P> <P> "Have you heard the joke about the bed? It hasn't been made up yet."  </P> <P> "Have you heard the latest about the sidewalk. It's all over town."  </P> <P> OK, Johnny Carson he's not. But Klein knows how to work his audience for laughs  -- mostly moans and groans.  </P> <P> "Our manager works hard," Lawrence said. "Koolmoedee tells a couple jokes and  makes us laugh. He keeps practices from becoming monotonous."  </P> <P> Add Saints: Santa Clara (5-2, 2-0) has plenty to laugh about after pulling off  its second consecutive upset. The Saints beat Agoura, 45-35, a week after  surprising Santa Ynez, 24-20, in a Frontier League opener.  </P> <P> The Saints' special teams set the stage for the upset with two touchdowns in  the first quarter. Kwinn Knight returned a punt 55 yards for Santa Clara's  first score. Agoura answered with Dave Caramanis' 66-yard scoring run, but  Knight returned the ensuing kickoff 89 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Medical update: Tailback Jayden Morrison, Nordhoff's leading rusher, is  expected to play against Agoura after missing three games with a dislocated  right elbow. . . . Santa Clara played last week without cornerback Danny Lopez  (broken bone in left hand) and three linemen -- Justin Cajiuat (knee injury),  Joey Cabrera (knee) and Joey Zargoza (foot). . . . Junior Lewis Cayce of Oxnard  fractured his pelvis returning a kickoff against San Marcos and will miss the  rest of the season. . . . Hueneme High might have one of its top offensive  performers back in the lineup by next week. Tailback Mel Nunnery, out three  weeks with a torn ligament in his left knee, may return Nov. 3 against San  Marcos. Quarterback Damon Hicks (bruised right shoulder) and receiver/back Doug  Brooks (bruised knee) are doubtful to return.  </P> <P> Football miscellany: Nordhoff quarterback Rob Fournier needs 44 yards to erase  the school's single-season passing record. Jeremy Anthony set the record with  1,243 yards last season. . . . Trevor Matheson, Fournier's favorite target,  needs one reception to tie the school mark of 43 set by Steve Blundell last  season. . . . Al Borderias, a transfer student from Spain, has replaced Johnel  Turner as the Oxnard kicker. In two games, Borderias has made nine of 10  extra-point attempts.  </P> <P> Numbers game: The Western State Conference football race has produced some  interesting numbers, through most of them look remarkably alike.  </P> <P> Ventura, L. A. Southwest and Moorpark are each 1-0 in Northern Division games.  The Pirates (6-0 overall) are 5-0 in the WSC and Southwest (5-0-1) is 4-0-1.  </P> <P> Ventura is ranked sixth in the state and Southwest is eighth. The teams are  ranked third and fourth in Southern California.  </P> <P> Ventura has the state's fourth-best defense (210.5 yards a game) and Southwest  is eighth (238.2).  </P> <P> Breaking in: After a record-setting career at Santa Clara High, Matt Young has  been somewhat less prolific as a freshman wide receiver for Moorpark College.  Last week, however, he caught his first college touchdown pass.  </P> <P> In the third quarter of a 44-0 blowout of Harbor College, Young tipped a pass  to himself to complete an 18-yard touchdown pass from Kris Dutra. "He made a  tremendous catch," Coach Jim Bittner said. "It was a very nice play on his  part. He's got very good hands."  </P> <P> Young caught 81 passes as a Santa Clara senior, but at Moorpark he's part of a  four-receiver rotation. Young alternates possessions on the right side with  sophomore James Gambrell.  </P> <P> Jeff Riley and staff writer Brendan Healey contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Several of the Meretz ministers have expressed  reservations with the idea of imposing a total closure on the  territories for an indefinite period. Minister Shulamit Aloni  favors imposing a closure until after Independence Day [15  April] while granting permits to work inside israel to as many  laborers from the territories as possible. Aloni told our  political correspondent Shlomo Raz that the opposition's  incitement should not dictate the government's moves.    Minister Yosi Sarid believes that imposing a closure on the  territories was necessary; however, Sarid said, the duration and  scope of the closure would have to be discussed further.    Minister Ya'ir Tzaban supports imposing a closure that would  be limited in its duration and scope. At the same time, Tzaban  called for vigorous action to reduce the damages the closure  will cause.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the past 24 hours 131 rockets were fired into  residential areas of Kabul. According to a report of the Kabul  garrison command, the rockets were fired into the city from the  directions of Balahesar and Maranjan Hill. As a result four  defenseless residents of the city were martyred and 10 others  were injured.    According to another report, positions of the Islamic army  were attacked yesterday evening west of Kabul. A security  source considered the internecine clashes of Hezb-e Wahdat over  the appointment of the future party leader as the reason for the  attack. The report adds that the adventurist section of Hezb-e  Wahdat wants to hide its internal problems from the public by  fanning conflict between the Islamic Army and Hezb-e Wahdat.  However, Islamic Army units have been emphatically instructed  to exercise forbearance before such provocations.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (2) Little room for complacency - Local economy is less secure than it seems that, says Mr Jonathan French, North Yorkshire County Council's senior assistant economic development officer, summarises the county's economy. North Yorkshire is probably the most prosperous county in the north of England. With its beautiful countryside, charming towns, its air of wellbeing and its unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent compared to the UK's 9.6 per cent national average, it might seem to have nothing to worry about. In January this year, only Berkshire and Oxfordshire, among English counties, enjoyed lower unemployment figures. Yet North Yorkshire's economic development officers insist that there is no room for complacency. While some northern areas are tussling with population decline, the county faces the challenge of satisfying the employment needs of a citizenry which is growing at more than twice the national average: 714,000 last year - this is expected to reach 761,000 by 2001. By 2006, the workforce may have risen by 10 per cent; an increase which, just to stand still, would require 2,300 net new jobs every year. Given its relatively low unemployment, North Yorkshire, England's largest county, might seem well equipped to cope, especially because its schools' educational achievements are well above average and its workforce is highly qualified, with nearly 50 per cent in white collar occupations. But its economy is more vulnerable than is immediately apparent. The first Labour Market Study by the North Yorkshire Training and Enterprise Council, published last year, estimated that agriculture was 3.6 times more significant in the local economy than nationally, followed by coal extraction (3.2 per cent), railways (2.9 per cent) and food and drink (2.9 per cent). According to the county's 1992-1993 Economic Development Strategy, 12,600 of its 270,000 employees work in agriculture - 5 per cent, compared with just 1 per cent nationally. Mining and power engineering account for 4 per cent in the county, against 2 per cent nationally. The reformed EC common agricultural policy looks certain to mean more job losses from the agriculture sector - in North Yorkshire and nationally - as land is taken out of production. And not even the modern, strongly performing Selby mining complex in the south of the county can presume itself immune from the struggles of the British coal industry to compete against cheap imports, competition from gas and the uncertainty over future demand from the electricity generators. Railway engineering, centred on York, has been through traumatic times in recent years, and B r i t i s h R a i l privatisation proposals mean that the county cannot take its railway jobs for granted, even though it has the benefit of being served by the now fully electrified east coast line, cutting York-London journey times to just 1 hour and 43 minutes. And only this month the county has been reminded of the vulnerability of the defence sector, which provides 18,000 jobs for servicemen and civilians within its boundaries. As part of its Options for Change review, the government announced that it is to close both the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers army workshop at Strensall near York, at a cost of about 200 jobs, and the RAF's Catterick base, where 75 civilians work. Hopes that the Army will take it over have not been confirmed. Harrogate, which is already undergoing the loss of 550 white collar jobs in National Power's corporate restructuring, also faces 1,250 civilian job losses in the proposed relocation of the town's RAF support base - a national facility - to Huntingdon. The presence in North Yorkshire of large food companies, such as those which make up York's confectionery sector, looks relatively secure, but jobs are still likely to go through technological advance and capital investment. However, the food sector in the county brought some good news last week: Dalepak, the Leeming Bar manufacturer of frozen and chilled foods, reported a 30 per cent growth in profits to Pounds 3.93m on turnover of Pounds 40.6m. In a bid to spread awareness of the county's high quality food producers, including diversifying farmers, the county council formed The Yorkshire Pantry, providing buyers with a focal point of contact for products ranging from wild boar to handmade biscuits. The Pantry's latest showcase was its own food hall at this month's Great Yorkshire Show in Harrogate. Yorkshire food has also had an inadvertent publicity boost from the Milk Marketing Board's (MMB) decision to close its Wensleydale cheese factory in Hawes; the last commercial producer of the cheese in the dale. Yorkshiremen - and cheese lovers nationally - were outraged at the MMB's temerity in suggesting that Wensleydale made in Lancashire could taste just as good. (A rescue committee, led by Dales businesspeople who are convinced of Wensleydale's good market prospects, is trying to clinch a deal to buy the dairy from the MMB.) With brewers John Smith, Sam Smith and Bass all at Tadcaster, brewing is important too - and not only for beer lovers. To the sober souls at County Hall in Northallerton, brewing represents biotechnology, a growth sector. In April this year the county's brewing tradition led to a highly successful Pounds 850,000 share offer, under the Business Expansion Scheme, for Mr Paul Theakston's new Black Sheep Brewery in Masham. Mr Theakston, formerly managing director of the family brewing firm T&amp;R Theakston before its takeover by Scottish and Newcastle in 1988, is about to start commercial production of traditional Yorkshire ale. Between 1981 and 1989 the numbers employed in North Yorkshire grew by 29,400; a growth rate of nearly 1.5 per cent a year, three times the national average. But nearly 80 per cent of the net new jobs were part time, and three quarters of them occupied by women. And since 1989 the growth has come to a halt. Losses in traditional manufacturing industry have also contributed to a drop in the number of companies, with more than 300 employees, serving non-local markets. In 1978, 20 per cent of North Yorkshire's employment was in this sector; by 1989 it had dropped to 14 per cent, spread between 41 firms. 'While we've had a steady increase in employment, we're going through a very substantial change which has an impact on the labour and land markets,' says Mr French. 'Very few children will work in their parents' workplaces.' The county's position in the top three of the low unemployment league is also ambiguous. Since January 1989 it has shot from the 23rd position, a rise caused largely by the relatively greater impact of the recession on the south. The risk is that, after the recession, the county will slide back down the league table again. Recent recession-related increases in unemployment in North Yorkshire have been greatest in the better off areas. But the county's enduring economic problem areas are on its fringes, in the coastal strip a r o u n d W h i t b y a n d Scarborough, and on its border with West Yorkshire. North Yorkshire's strong tourist industry provides seasonal employment on the coast - and spin-off for much of the year in York - but it cannot be expected to solve deeper structural problems within the local economy. The council is lobbying the government to preserve Development Area status for the Whitby and Stokesley Travel to Work Areas in the forthcoming national review. It is also pressing for UK and European aid for the Selby coal mining area. It is also monitoring the Rural Development Commission's review of its operating areas: the RDC currently spends more than Pounds 1.5m every year in the county. Mindful that self-help is the theme of the times, the county council recently launched the North Yorkshire European Community Office, a Pounds 100,000 project to ensure that the county's companies, especially its 25,000 small businesses, are geared up to compete in the Single European Market. The county's high technology sector has been strengthened by the decision of Smith &amp; Nephew, the health care products manufacturer, to relocate its R&amp;D headquarters from Harlow in Essex to the new science park at York University. Smith and Nephew's Pounds 10.5m building, where 200 scientists and researchers will work, is now being fitted out. The park, a Pounds 23m joint project by the university and P&amp;O Developments, is one of the few private-sector-funded UK science parks. Smith &amp; Nephew's building is the first and largest on the 21-acre site; the park's second phase is now being marketed. The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food has also opted to relocate its central science laboratory and its headquarters operations for food, pesticides and plant health to North Yorkshire, further boosting the county's strengths in research and bio-science. Like neighbouring Humberside, North Yorkshire is in the first wave of local authorities which are being examined under the government's review of the structure of local government. Unsurprisingly, the county council favours the status quo, arguing that devolution of its services to the eight districts would cost Pounds 12m a year.</p>

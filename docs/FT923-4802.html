			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Strength of sterling sparks off interim complaints WHILE the markets' attention has been riveted on the pound's weakness within the ERM, company chairmen have been peppering their interim reports with complaints about sterling's strength. Yesterday, for example, Rolls-Royce, Courtaulds Textiles Burmah Castrol, Ladbroke and Reckitt &amp; Colman all drew attention to the impact on their results. At Rolls-Royce, the weak dollar reduced half-year profits by about Pounds 10m compared with the same period the year before. Courtaulds Textiles said its pre-tax interim profit had been half as high as it should have been because of the dollar's weakness. Burmah Castrol said that if the dollar remained at its current level, there could be a 10 per cent deterioration of the dollar-related portion of its profits in the second half. For UK companies with operations in the US, every dollar of American profits is now worth less when converted into pounds. And those that export from Britain have costs that seem high in dollar terms, placing them at a disadvantage in the US market or when competing with rivals with costs denominated in dollars. Analysts at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stockbroker, put together a hypothetical portfolio of companies with high overseas earnings, most of them heavily exposed to the dollar. It has actually done rather better than the market as a whole in recent weeks. Mr Alun Jones of UBS says part of this is due to a relatively strong performance by big pharmaceutical stocks, which have been affected by factors other than currencies. Stripping out those companies, however, still leaves the overseas earners performing no worse than the market as a whole. He believes this is because the recovering US economy gives many of the companies concerned healthier revenues, offseting what they lose from currency translation. Those companies which suffer the dollar effect without a big enough offset from US demand, however, have the worst of both worlds. Oil companies and clothing and textile manufacturers are two examples. As Courtaulds Textiles' chief executive, Mr Martin Taylor says: 'You can't hedge against economic disadvantage'.</p>

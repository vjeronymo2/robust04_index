			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Myong-chol] </F>   [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- Labor-management relations  have improved greatly from last year thanks to expanding mutual  trust, an increasing consensus on the need to sharpen Korean  products' competitive edge and dissident unions' restraint on  forming a second labor front independent of the Federation of  Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). Moreover, labor disputes are on the  decrease and collective bargaining on wage hikes is sailing  before the wind.    According to the Labor Ministry, 20 labor disputes have been  recorded so far this year compared with 18 during the same  period last year. Noteworthy is that the manufacturing sector  saw only five disputes against 13 last year, while the remainder  involved small taxi companies.    Employees participating in these disputes decreased from  12,712 last year to 4,739 and working hours lost to the disputes  amounted to 20,520 hours, only 15 percent of the figure  registered a year ago.    Of the 5,483 firms employing 100 or more workers, 918 or  16.7  percent had completed collective bargaining on wage hikes as of  May 3. Last year, the same 16.7-percent rate was achieved May  11.    The improved labor-management relations and the resulting  smooth sailing of collective bargaining are attributed chiefly  to an increasing worker-employer consensus on the need to  increase the international competitiveness of their products.    This need is felt not only by FKTU-affiliated unions but  also  dissident unions which last year launched general strikes, such  as the Hyundai group workers union, the Daewoo group unions'  conference and the National Council of Trade Unions (NCTU).  These unions have refrained from starting labor disputes or  from going to extremes when a dispute is indeed launched.    In most workplaces which have suffered strikes and work  stoppages since 1987, when the winds of democracy began to blow  in the country, labor and management have come to believe that  extreme labor movements are consumptive and losing propositions.  Toward the end of last year, businesses in such industrial  areas as Ulsan, Changwon and Koje Island began to improve  labor-management relations on the basis of cooperation.    Striking a discordant note, the dissident National Congress  of Union Representatives (NCUR) charges that the wage guidelines  calling for a 5 to 8.7 percent increase agreed between the FKTU  and the Korea employers' federation was a product of secret  bargaining. Nevertheless, these guidelines are accepted as  reasonable by unions in most industries except those in such  growth sectors as electronics, automobiles, steel and  shipbuilding. Collective bargaining on wage hikes at many firms  is proceeding according to these guidelines.    The NCUR, consisting of the Hyundai group workers union, the  Daewoo group unions' conference, the NCTU and the conference of  industrial unions, wants to form a second labor front  independent of the FKTU this year, and therefore will not resort  to prolonged strikes and other extreme action which might impede  this goal.    At a separate May Day ceremony, the NCUR adopted a  resolution  warning that if the government and employers fail to show  sincerity in collective wage bargaining -- instead citing the  need to increase international competitiveness and the wage  guidelines agreed between the FKTU and the Korea employers'  federation -- it will launch a nationwide labor struggle in late  May and early June. This warning is considered a demonstration  of force for forming a second labor front.    The hard-line unions of Hyundai heavy industries, Daewoo  shipbuilding heavy machinery and Kia Motors may launch a  short-term strike because of their leading roles in the NCUR,  but few expect a prolonged general strike like the one staged by  Hyundai group unions in Ulsan last year.    The wage increases offered by unions at large firms for this  year are 2 to 3 percentage points lower than last year: 12.6  percent at Hyundai heavy industries, 13.82 percent at Daewoo  shipbuilding and heavy machinery, 15.07 percent at Kia motors,  and 16.3 percent at Daewoo motor. With such offers, these  firms' unions have just started collective bargaining, with an  eye to completing the process by early June.    The bottom line? It is premature to adopt an optimistic view  toward labor-management relations in the coming year because of  labor's demand to participate in company management, price  hikes, the government's plan to check unions, and other  political and economic problems affecting labor.</p>

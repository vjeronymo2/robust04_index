The alarm at the  consequences of Boris Fedorov's departure from the cabinet had  barely abated when the Foreign Ministry and its head came under  ever more pronounced attack. Some observers now ask how long  will Andrey Kozyrev manage to stay in his post? Let us hear the  point of view of the political scientist Andrey Kortunov:    [Kortunov] Kozyrev is currently one of the last  representatives of the radical team within the new, moderate  government. I think that heightened criticism can be expected  in the nearest future in many areas indeed.    In the first place, it is thought that the Foreign Ministry  is not defending the interests of the Russophone population in  the close neighboring countries with enough consistency. It is  thought that the ministry is taking a stance that is too  pro-Western as far as a whole gamut of international issues is  concerned, essentially following in the wake of Washington's  foreign policy, for instance regarding the former Yugoslavia.    Apart from this, Kozyrev is blamed for the somewhat  discursive nature of our foreign policy and for the inability to  determine with any precision the new place and role of the  Russian state within the system of modern international  relations.    This criticism is not wholly justified, in the first place  because foreign policy is not being made by the Foreign Ministry  alone -- the Security Council and other ministries and  departments have taken an active part in the elaboration of our  foreign policy, which, in the final analysis, is Yeltsin's  foreign policy and not Kozyrev's.    However, the question is to what extent can this criticism  lead to changes in Russia's foreign policy and in the personnel  composition of the Russian Foreign Ministry. I think that if  one proceeds from the constitutional norms, the Russian  Federation president has enough powers to have foreign policy  made exempt, in practical terms, from debates in the State Duma,  so as to be able to pursue a sufficiently consistent and  constructive foreign policy course.    Yeltsin is clearly intent on pursuing presidential foreign  policy, a policy that would be independent of the domestic  political circumstances in Russia. On the other hand, if one  focuses on the evolution of the Russian Federation's foreign  policy course over the past several months, a certain tightening  up is, of course, clearly discernible. In particular, it is  possible to speak of a greater pressure, above all economic  pressure, but also diplomatic pressure, upon the close  neighboring countries. It is also possible to speak of attempts  to set up Russia's own, liberal concept of nationalism that  would oppose the ideology of Zhirinovskiy and his party and it  is also possible to speak of some new nuances in the attitude  toward the West.    How great are the current foreign minister's chances to  retain his place within the new Cabinet?    I think that what is, perhaps, the best circumstance in the  minister's favor is the fact that the president has essentially  removed the power-wielding ministries from the remit of the  council of ministers and the prime minister. The foreign  minister, the defense minister, and the minister of internal  affairs are currently subordinate directly to the president of  Russia and hence there is a hope that Boris Yeltsin will,  nevertheless, retain Andrey Kozyrev as his minister.</p>

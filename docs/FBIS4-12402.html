At 1000 GMT 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, who is representing  President  al- Asad at the rally, delivers the Ba'th Party speech. He  begins by speaking about the annual celebration of the party's  anniversary and conveys the greetings of al-Asad and the Ba'th  leadership. Al-Ahmar eulogizes the late Basil al-Asad and is  interrupted by a poet reciting a poem hailing Basil al-Asad.    While speaking about Arab unity, al-Ahmar is interrupted by  the Iraqi poet, who recites a short poem hailing al-Asad and  criticizing Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, stressing that Saddam  should quit. Al-Ahmar continues to speak about Arab unity, the  crisis it is facing, and the Ba'th ideology for attaining this  unity.    He elaborates on the Ba'th Party's struggle and thoughts and  on the efforts made by President al-Asad to unleash the  capabilities of the Party and Syria. He refers to political and  economic pluralism in Syria and the development program in the  country as well as national unity.    He says Syria is working to realize Arab solidarity with the  aim of restoring the occupied territories and rights, and  stresses that the right to self-defense and to defend land and  rights are guaranteed by all laws.    Al-Ahmar emphasizes: "As in the past, al-Asad's Syria today  will not be dissuaded from its pan-Arab role that defends the  Arab rights by any pressures, false accusations, or unjust  lists, on which the Zionist lobby insists." He says this lobby  is trying to harm Syrian-U.S relations and to influence Syrian  peace positions. He adds "this lobby, and its assistants, are  annoyed because of Syria's adherence to its Arab rights and  constants and the diplomatic successes it realized, which were  clearly manifested in Syria's dealing with the peace process."    On the peace process, al-Ahmar reiterates the Syrian call  for  a just and comprehensive peace, and refers to the Syrian efforts  to render this process successful. He says: "Syria does not  accept that this process be derailed from its specified track,  and the formula agreed on in Madrid." He says Israel  maneuvered to obstruct this process in a bid to impose  capitulation on the Arabs. He is interrupted by a group of young  men chanting patriotic Palestinian songs.    He refers to the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the church  explosion in Lebanon, which he says were aimed to obstruct the  peace process. He says "the Security Council Resolution 904  shows that the whole world began to complain about Israel's  terrorist behavior." On the church explosion, he says that it  exposed those who have links with Israel. He is interrupted by  people chanting slogans hailing Syrian-Lebanese relations and by  the Iraqi poet who recites a poem hailing al-Asad's position at  the Geneva summit with President Bill Clinton. Al-Ahmar  stresses that Syria will not relinquish any Arab right and  insists on having just and full peace in the region.    Speaking about international issues, al-Ahmar notes that the  end of the Cold War has not brought world peace, and that  conflicts and wars broke out in several places.</p>

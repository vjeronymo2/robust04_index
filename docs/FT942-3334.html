			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Observer: Party pooper Talking of dogs, what do we make of Labour MP Ken Livingstone's support for the 'Scoop that poop' campaign which he helped launch in Battersea Park last weekend? The aim is to 'persuade owners to clear up after Britain's 7.5m dogs' and the sponsors, dog-food manufacturers James Wellbeloved &amp; Co, wanted a tame MP to pose for the cameras, because fouling by dogs is an issue upon which MPs receive more mail than any other. Another sign, perhaps, that the Labour leftwinger is not taking seriously his other campaign - to collect colleagues' signatures for his candidacy in Labour's leadership race?</p>

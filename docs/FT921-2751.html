			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Children's Medical Charity Investment The Children's Medical Charity Investment Trust has agreed to call an extraordinary meeting to consider winding up the trust and has decided to immediately realise its assets. The decision followed an offer of 55p per share made on behalf of Mr Andrew Perloff, a director, to acquire all the outstanding shares of the trust. Mr Perloff said that he and those deemed to be acting with him had recently increased their stake to 400,000 shares (39.9 per cent) necessitating the offer. However, directors argued that as the net asset value was 80p per share the interests of shareholders would be best served by the voluntary winding up of the company. Mr Perloff said he would vote against the winding up motion and it would therefore not be passed as a 75 per cent majority was needed. He added that the proposed immediate realisation of investments was not in the company's best interests.</p>

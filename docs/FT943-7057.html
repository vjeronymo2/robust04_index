			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Victaulic bolstered by acquisitions Victaulic, the maker of pipeline products for the gas, water, construction and mining industries, lifted pre-tax profits 7 per cent in the first half of 1994, helped by input from acquisitions and higher overseas sales. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 6.2m (Pounds 5.8m) on turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 57.6m (Pounds 51.5m). Mr David Stewart, managing director, explained that as the 'long-standing, traditional, high-margin' business from British Gas had been reduced on the back of anti-monopoly regulation, so the group had picked up new business which, because of the learning curve, was lower margin. Sales to the UK gas industry are now only 17 per cent of turnover, compared with 34 per cent in 1991. However, Mr Stewart said there had been no loss of market share. The 1994 acquisitions made operating profits of Pounds 400,000 on turnover of Pounds 3m, with Action Hose Couplings, acquired in 1993, accounting for Pounds 200,000. Victaulic has spent Pounds 11m on acquisitions since June 1993 and Pounds 16m since 1992. At the period-end cash balances stood at Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 9.6m), leading to interest receivable of Pounds 200,000. Mr David Winch, chairman, said the company was 'generating more cash than we can spend', though he added that the 'strike rate on acquisitions is quite low'. The group wants to expand in continental Europe, the UK and east Asia, though the latter would be with partners. In April the company acquired a 51 per cent stake in Blakeborough Valves in Singapore and Malaysia, which could open up sourcing possibilities and new markets in east Asia, especially China. Overseas sales advanced 18 per cent to Pounds 14m - some 24 per cent of total turnover. Earnings worked through at 9.4p (8.8p) per share and the interim dividend is lifted 0.1p to 2.6p. The shares closed down 3p at 274p.</p>

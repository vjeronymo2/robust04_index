			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A husband's bad conduct with the aim, I suspect, of gaining a financial settlement if it came to a separation or divorce. I am particularly concerned about two assets: (a) a house I gave my daughter (value Pounds 60,000 after the wedding, value Pounds 90,000 now), and (b) a personal equity plan of Pounds 50,000 in my daughter's name, which I funded. The marriage was eight years ago and there is one female child aged two. The husband has virtually no assets. Is there any advice you can offer to mitigate this situation? We live in Scotland. The house which you bought and gave to your daughter will not be taken into account in assessing her husband's share of the matrimonial property, owing to the fact that it was given to her. The personal equity plan is slightly more problematical. It might be more difficult to prove that you funded it. If, however, you are able to prove that you did, then it would also fall out of the definition of 'matrimonial property.' Accordingly, it would not be shared by the husband on divorce. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

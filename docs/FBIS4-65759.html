			<p>BFN     [Text] Several Turkish military aircraft bombed the Zalakh  camp in northern Iraq at about 1200 yesterday. We contacted the  Kurdish Workers Party's Kurdish People's Liberation Army [KPLA]  Press Office immediately after the hour-long air attack. The  KPLA Press Office confirmed the air attack, and said there were  no casualties in the camp.    However, the Turkish General Staff Press and Public  Relations  Office stated that the air operation took place from 1200 to  1220. It said that 19 aircraft took part in the attack on Zalakh  camp and that the aircraft returned to their bases after  destroying their targets.    The Zalakh camp was bombed for the first time on 28 January,  after the government's move to devalue the Turkish lira. A  statement made at the time said all of the targets were  destroyed.</p>

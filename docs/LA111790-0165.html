			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> WITNESSES TO POSSIBLE HIT AND RUN SOUGHT  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department traffic investigators are seeking the public's assistance  in locating witnesses to a possible hit-and-run accident that left a bicyclist  hospitalized.  </P> <P> Stephen C. Balcom, 19, of San Clemente was found lying on Coast Highway at 5:48  p.m. Thursday by a passing motorist, who called 911, sheriff's spokesman Lt.  Bob Rivas said.  </P> <P> Balcom remained unconscious Friday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center  in Mission Viejo, suffering from a broken leg, fractures to his face and  internal injuries, Rivas said.  </P> <P> "So far, we have no real witnesses," Rivas said. "We are really trying to find  out more about what happened. We need assistance."  </P> <P> Although Rivas said that investigators have not ruled out the possibility that  Balcom fell off his bike, he said that "we're investigating it as a possible  hit and run."  </P> <P> Rivas said that a preliminary investigation has concluded only that Balcom was  riding his bike north along Coast Highway in the city's Capistrano Beach  section.  </P> <P> He was spotted lying in the road, with his undamaged bicycle a few feet away.  </P> <P> "Other than that, we don't know anything," Rivas said.  </P> <P> Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at (714)  249-5200 and request the traffic division.JAMES M.

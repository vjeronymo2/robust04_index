			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A POET'S BAZAAR A JOURNEY TO GREECE, TURKEY &amp; UP THE  DANUBE BY HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN TRANSLATED WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY GRACE  THORNTON (MICHAEL KESEND: $13.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> In 1840, three years after the publication of "The Little Mermaid" and "The  Emperor's New Clothes," Hans Christian Andersen received a royal grant that  enabled him to travel to the Mediterranean and the Balkans. The diary from that  journey has the unassuming appeal of his better stories.  </P> <P> Andersen had a sharp eye for the details of daily life in other countries, but  his observations are restricted to a personal level. He attends a concert by  Franz Liszt and notices a fat woman in the audience, lolling on a couch "like a  walrus with a fan," but never considers the significance of the composer's  music. The diary includes four stories that Andersen wrote during his travels:  "The Pact of Friendship" and "A Rose From Homer's Grave" seem a bit too  self-consciously "adult," but "The Bronze Boar" and "My Boots" are genuinely  charming.  </P></p>

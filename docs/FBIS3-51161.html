After having won World War III  without firing a shot, the United States and its allies, the  winners, are hastening to collect the booty, especially the  political booty. They are leaving the economic loot for later.    The problem for them at present is to keep the process  taking place in the countries of the former socialist bloc --  that is, the transition to capitalism -- from backsliding; to  channel relations with these countries along particular lines;  and to diminish these countries' defensive capabilities,  especially nuclear, as much as possible.    One of the NATO agreements reached at the recent summit in  Brussels was to create a so-called Partnership for Peace --  proposed by the United States -- to receive the former members  of the Warsaw Pact interested in strengthening ties to NATO,  establish military cooperation, and participate in peace-keeping  missions -- preventive interventions, to call them by their true  name. But without a timetable for new members to join NATO, it  is a formula for commitment that commits to nothing.    Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic received the news  with satisfaction. Russia, to which the Partnership for Peace  could also extend, reacted with caution because it does not know  to what extent such an association is in its national interests.    The Russian Government's caution is understandable when we  bear in mind Lithuania's request also to join NATO, and the  not-to-be- dismissed possibility that an anti-Russian bloc could  be formed in central Europe and the Baltic republics in the  future.    With the creation of the Partnership for Peace, the United  States and its allies subordinate the former socialist countries  in military matters without offering them anything. That is,  they place them in a kind of transitional period with no set  limit, a period during which they are guaranteed consultations  and cooperation but not security. On the other hand, that  intermediate position is an invitation to comply with whatever  orders they are given, so as to win entry into NATO.    Another sign of the times is the policy designed to disarm  the former enemies. The entire nuclear arsenal of the former  USSR is concentrated in four former Soviet republics: Russia,  Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The objective of the United  States and its allies is that Russia alone maintain a limited  nuclear capability. They have promised the others economic and  technical aid if they agree to destroy their arsenals. In a  statement on 11 January in Brussels, U.S. President Bill Clinton  announced that his country, Russia, and Ukraine would be signing  an agreement under which Ukraine relinquishes its nuclear  arsenal of 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and (?1,500)  nuclear warheads. Indeed, Clinton visited Kiev yesterday before  going to Moscow for three days of meetings with Boris Yeltsin.  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is invited to participate.  The agreement is to be signed tomorrow [14 January].    As will be recalled, the Ukrainian Parliament conditioned  ratification of the strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty,  known by its U.S. acronym "START I," to the attainment of  certain guarantees of security and economic compensations.    If what has been agreed on is accomplished, Ukraine would  cease to be a nuclear power, which the western nuclear powers --  the United States, France, and Great Britain -- would like very  much. These nations seek disarmament for everyone but themselves.    I cannot fail to recall the second half of the decade of the  forties, the post-war period, when the United States had a  monopoly on nuclear weapons and blackmailed the whole world with  it. Will the same thing happen again? I don't doubt it. The  United States will do so if it furthers its hegemonic interests.    This 13th NATO summit was a big success for the great  powers,  especially for the United States. Simply put, the world moved in  a single direction and they are now reaping the fruits. This is  a sign of the current period. I wonder: for how long?</p>

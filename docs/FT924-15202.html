			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Observer: Interlude Picture the scene. A party of wealthy corporate sponsors was invited to pop into the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden last week to 'take a sniff at work in progress'. But the event lost some of its spontaneity when the orchestra, rehearsing Porgy and Bess, downed tools. An official plays down the incident saying it was all a misunderstanding. The visit had been cleared with the orchestra representative so long ago that 'it had slipped a few minds'. After the 'temporary communications blip' had been sorted out the rehearsal went ahead. However, at least one hard-nosed City type present was unimpressed and says that the event is yet another sign that the Opera House 'has failed to come to terms with basic management issues and is squandering its money'.</p>

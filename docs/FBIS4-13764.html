			<p>BFN     [Text] In issuing a statement, the Harakat-e Eslami-ye  Afghanistan [Islamic Movement of Afghanistan] has said: This  party will not remain indifferent and will take necessary action  via-a-vis those individuals who for their self-interest intend  to disrupt peace and security in the west of Kabul and attempt  to stir up the fighting once again. Highlighting the tragic and  painful events of the past two years in the west of Kabul,  resulting in insecurity, destruction, and fratricide, and  bringing various calamities to the people, the statement  denounces every terrorist and adventurist action.    The statement adds: The Harakat-e Eslami emphasizes its  peace-seeking policy and supports the atmosphere of peace and  understanding, and regards talks and understanding as the only  way to a solution of the existing issues in the country.    This statement has been issued after sporadic clashes  started  two days ago in Kabul city by irresponsible individuals. The  responsible officials of the belligerent sides also denounced  these clashes and have managed to stop this fire.</p>

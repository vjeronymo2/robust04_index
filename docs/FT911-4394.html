			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: US agriculture secretary 'optimistic' on EC reforms MR EDWARD Madigan, the new US agriculture secretary, has expressed 'optimism' about the outlook for agriculture policy reform measures in the EC. In a congressional testimony this week, he said preliminary reports indicated that it might be 'some time' before reforms emerged. However, the reform effort had led to 'a more constructive attitude on the part of the EC negotiators' in the Uruguay Round. On the domestic front, the secretary predicted that US farm exports would decline in the 1991 fiscal year to Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.6bn) from some Dollars 40bn last year. This was partly due to increased production abroad. He also pointed to potential reductions in imports in large markets such as the Soviet Union. The sector's balance sheet is showing a healthy improvement. Farmland values rose by about 3 per cent in 1990, after showing moderate increases in the three preceding years. Total farm debt fell from Dollars 193bn in 1983 to Dollars 134bn. As a result the debt-to-asset ratio stood at 16 per cent in 1990, lower than it was in 1980 and substantially lower than the 23.9 per cent level in 1984. Although some producers were still experiencing threats to their farms, the sector as a whole had recovered from the severe stresses of the 1980s, the secretary said. Commodity prices are expected to be only slightly lower than last year. Stocks of wheat and dairy products are expected to rise. Livestock and poultry output is climbing, but market conditions are likely to remain favourable for hog and cattle producers. Farm income is likely to be 'relatively stable' in 1991 with net cash income forecast in the Dollars 53bn-Dollars 58bn range, compared to Dollars 58bn in 1990. Net farm income may drop slightly to the Dollars 42-Dollars 47bn level as a result of lower crop prices and higher input costs.</p>

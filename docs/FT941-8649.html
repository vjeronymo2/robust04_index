			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo's rise masks weak areas Glaxo's achievement in breaking the Pounds 1bn barrier for six months' worth of pre-tax profit hides wide variations in performance between countries and products. Zantac, the world's biggest selling drug, accounts for 43 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. Sales in the six months to December 31 rose by 5 per cent in constant currency terms to Pounds 1.2bn and by 11 per cent in the US. In Germany, however, sales fell by 21 per cent as healthcare reforms cut doctors' prescribing powers. Sales in Italy, where the scheme under which the state contribution to the cost of drugs is being reformed, fell by 6 per cent. In the UK the sales fall was 9 per cent, exacerbated by cheaper imports from France and Spain. Parallel exports to the UK helped boost sales in France and Spain, but the overall effect was not enough to prevent Zantac's share of the world market falling from 38 per cent to 36 per cent in 1993. The biggest gain in market share was by Losec, made by the Swedish company Astra. This drug is now Glaxo's main competitor in ulcer treatments. Glaxo's second most important treatment area is in respiratory drugs, mostly for asthma sufferers. Ventolin increased sales by 8 per cent in constant currency terms to Pounds 272m. Sir Richard Sykes, chief executive, said that even though the drug was no longer under patent protection, potential competitors were finding it difficult to deliver the active ingredient via inhalers safely into the lungs of asthma sufferers. Sales of a new asthma drug, Serevent, jumped by more than half to Pounds 46m and the product is to be launched in the US in April. Sir Richard blamed the fall in Ventolin's market share from 14 per cent to 12 per cent, on the strong sales of Serevent. Glaxo has the anti-migraine market to itself and its product, Imigran (Imitrex in the UK), saw six month sales jump from Pounds 35m to Pounds 113m. With the tablet version likely to be approved in the US shortly the company has launched a 'Migraine disease awareness programme' there. The other main new product, Zofran, which controls nausea in chemotherapy patients and after operations, increased sales by 17 per cent in constant currency terms to Pounds 207m. The sharpest growth was in the US. European sales fell by 3 per cent. Sir Richard blamed cost pressures, lower doses and sampling by doctors of newer products, for the decline. The final product area, antibiotics, saw steady growth of 7 per cent in constant currency terms to Pounds 431m. Market share increased by one point to 14 per cent.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: Savings shortage feared THE persistance of relatively high real interest rates in most industrialised countries for the past decade suggests a savings shortage, according to the Economic Outlook. The report, which says that real interest rates are too high in many member states for the current point in the business cycle, warns that the shortage of savings could result in lower investment, slower growth and difficulties in providing adequate finance for developing countries. It points out that while real short-term rates in the US and Japan have declined sharply, reflecting the need to boost demand, rates have moved counter cyclically in Europe. Last year European rates generally firmed, in spite of weakening activity. The OECD also reports that France companies benefit greatly from lower short-term interest rates while German corporations, which rely on longer-term financing, benefit relatively little. A study shows the impact of lower interest rates varies according to the speed with which a country's debt-servicing obligations change as a result of a market rate fall. In the UK, for example, short-term interest rates are particularly important and debt servicing obligations respond quickly to changes in market rates. However, in Germany more than 80 per cent of bank lending to the private sector is long-term.</p>

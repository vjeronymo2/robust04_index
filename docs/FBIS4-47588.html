			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: ``A Protector by the Name of Thymogen''; first </F> paragraph is ZDOROVYE introduction]    [Text]In view of publications about peptide bioregulators,  and with appearance in pharmacies of the first one, thymogen,  readers began to write the editorial office asking to tell about  the properties of thymogen, whether or not it is dangerous to  use immunomodulators. These questions are answered by Sergey  Mikhaylovich FURGAL, candidate of medical sciences, assistant in  one of the departments of the Military Medical Academy in St.  Petersburg.    ``For 8 years now specialists in the department of military  and general epidemiology are working on systematic validation of  the principles of immunocorrection to prevent influenza, acute  respiratory infections, sore throat, acute pneumonia, and  suppurative skin diseases. We studied how epidemics break out in  large organized groups of adults. A similar situation is found  in kindergartens and schools. There always are so-called  frequently sick individuals in every group. They usually  constitute 15-17 percent. But, as a rule, they account for 60-80  percent of morbidity and, mainly, play a deciding role in  development of an epidemic.    We also considered the fact that many pathogens of  infectious  diseases against which there are no vaccines circulate among the  people. After all, sore throats, pneumonia, and acute  respiratory viral infections can be caused by the most varied  viruses or bacteria. Furthermore, in a patient, both the  infection proper and adverse ecological conditions, as well as  the not uncommon stresses at the present time, weaken immunity  first of all. This is why we are searching for effective agents  to prevent infectious diseases among products that can enhance  resistance and improve the immune status of the body.    We have examined about 10 different drugs. And we decided on  thymoline (thymogen), a peptide preparation. This bioregulator  turned out to be the most physiological, safest, and does not  require special supervision during intake. For example, when  dibasol hydrochloride is used to prevent influenza blood  pressure has to be monitored. But thymogen can be taken by  anyone independently. There has not been a single case of  allergic reaction to it or any other adverse side-effect.    Preventive intake of thymogen in specially developed doses  solves three problems: --to enhance immunoresistance of large  population groups, lower morbidity and complications in groups,  as well as absenteeism; --to correct immunity deficiencies in  people who are often sick for long periods of time, and improve  their health; --to enhance the immune response to inoculations  (for example, influenza vaccine) with possible lowering of  vaccine dosage and longer persistence of immunity. If an  individual takes at least three thymogen injections along with  vaccine, his resistance to influenza stays high for about 2  years.    Unfortunately, once in a while there are items in the press  to the effect that all interventions in the immune system are  harmful. This is an unwarranted fear. Our many years of  observation indicate not only that cytomedin-bioregulators are  entirely safe, but also that thymogen is of enormous benefit to  people, with its significant preventive efficacy.    How is thymogen taken? What is better, injections or nose  drops? Both routes are effective. But hypodermic injection  maintains the appropriate level of resistance to disease for  about 8 months, but not from the very first days. In drop form,  thymogen has an immediate action and is active for about 2  months.    For an essentially healthy person, it is enough to instill  0.5 ml solution in each nasal passage for 3 days at the start of  the seasonal rise in respiratory diseases. It is beneficial to  do this for people returning to work after a leave, children  when they start kindergarten or school after vacation (the  dosage is the same for all). Of course, thymogen should be  instilled as a preventive measure if sick cases occur in a group  or at home, or if one experiences early signs of malaise. Those  who are sick frequently, weakened after surgery, or stress can  use thymogen for up to 10 days.    After 2 months, instillation for 3 days can be repeated if  necessary (for example, when a new wave of respiratory disease  is expected, or when going to work on a farm). But even if one  gets sick, the disease will be overcome sooner and without  complications under the protection of thymogen.''</p>

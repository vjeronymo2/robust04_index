			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Tutorskaya: "Doctor Achilles' Fire </F> Alarm. An International Expert from Frankfurt Inspects CIS  Nuclear Power Stations"]    [Text] Even tragedies can turn into farce, apparently. A  year or so ago information was published on the extremely poor  fire protection at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station.    You might expect, after everything that had happened, that  the station would be properly protected against fire. A year  ago, when Doctor Achilles delivered his report at an  international symposium, he showed some slides: Rusty hydrants,  which would be hard to operate when trying to get water into the  hoses in the event of a fire; emergency exists clogged up with  garbage; failure to observe the rules for dividing the station  area into sections that can be sealed off, with special  fireproof doors....    According to the international rules, Doctor Achilles said,  the buildings must have a fireproof partition with a special  door every 60 meters. But at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Station this year, as last, you can cover 200 meters and not  encounter a partition. This means that, if a calamity were to  occur, the fire would spread like lightning, without hindrance.  The fire protection system has not been put into shape in the  year since the first inspection at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Station.    How many years now has a vast multitude of people been  enduring the consequences of the Chernobyl accident -- a massive  accident with massive consequences. As the oncologists  predicted, there continue to be more and more cases of thyroid  cancer among children exposed to radiation. People from various  countries are pooling resources and efforts (the new child  cancer experts' seminar that has just been held in Minsk was an  example of this) to devise a treatment strategy, indeed to  provide basic drugs and equipment for sick children. I do not  have to remind you that it is all very expensive. According to  the experts, the personnel responsible for fire protection at  the Chernobyl station are military people without special  training, and there are only 14 of them. There are four on duty  at night and two by day -- in the enormous station building.  Many of the instruments that are intended to warn of the danger  of a fire are in locked closets and are not freely accessible.  Instead of special fireproof doors you have conventional doors,  which would rapidly melt in a big fire, and in some cases simple  wooden doors.    The EC is allocating funds to plug these gaps, although the  money has not been received yet. But what money do you need to  provide free access to instruments and clear away garbage  blocking emergency exits?    Electricity produced by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station  goes to Austria, and the station is making good money. But it  remains an open question why, here and at other nuclear power  stations, notably Zaporozhye (also visited by an international  commission recently), they have virtually the same, forgive me  for saying so, fire condition red.    If the technical impotence and nihilism of the station  personnel are cause for amazement, then Doctor Achilles himself  is a source of equally strong emotion. Do you think he stamped  his feet and hollered "I'm leaving"? Not a bit of it. He is  quite determined to effect positive changes in the mental  outlook of our engineers and technicians -- a truly Herculean  task. Without making a song and dance, doggedly and  systematically, Achilles is getting through and securing a  willingness to cooperate. It is to be hoped that the impetus is  converted into positive change before, God forbid, fire breaks  out again owing to faulty wiring, negligence, or whatever.</p>

The collapse of the Berlin Wall in  November 1989, with all its consequences, seemed to offer  Washington and Moscow the opportunity to put "human interests"  before the traditional kind of contemptible superpower policy,  according to Gorbachev's definition. The fiction of a permanent  U.S.-Russian harmony appeared, which was to last in spite of all  the natural differences between these major states, thus  allowing a bilateral, global peace management. But the success  of the nationalist-communist forces at the Russian parliamentary  elections swept this idea away and made it obvious that Russia  is continuing its traditional efforts to expand its power.    During his visit to Moscow in January, President Clinton  still allocated to his hosts a peacemaking role in their region  -- as defined by the Russian military doctrine; but now a  countermovement is beginning to form in Washington that does not  want to grant Moscow the right to use disciplinary measures  against its neighbors. This was triggered by the shrill  nationalist rhetoric that is even being used by Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev,  trying to outdo the "patriots" of all shades on the right-wing  side. Other things worth thinking about are the removal from  government of many reformers, Moscow's pressure on the Baltic  states, its increasingly dominating position over Belarus, its  ambiguous policy toward the Ukraine, its attempts to make the  CIS a de facto USSR, and, last but not least, a new tone that  can easily be recognized as the old Soviet one.    In the spring, Moscow returned to its old playgrounds in the  Balkans and the Middle East -- with intentions that are still  unclear. Thus, Kozyrev told his U.S. colleague Christopher in  Russia's Far Eastern fortress of Vladivostok that they now have  a "mature relationship," which can only mean: Moscow feels  equal to Washington and there is no trace of subordination.    Russia cannot be expected to stay in a submissive position  in  the long run, following Washington's orders and not conducting a  policy of its own interests. It cannot be blamed for wanting to  maintain its interest; this is legitimate, as long as it is not  done at the expense of others. This is the crucial point where  more and more U.S. politicians stop because they think they can  discern a new imperialistic tone in Moscow's behavior and  demands. Now the question arises whether today's and tomorrow's  Russia is still the one with which the United States can conduct  politics based on partnership.    Are the premises on which the concept of a partnership of  superpowers is based still correct, even if Russia is to join  the Partnership for Peace program under NATO's umbrella? It  demands a special status for itself, which worries Washington  just as much as East and Central Europe. After his visit to  Moscow, U.S. Secretary for Defense Perry spoke of a "pragmatic  partnership"; the new formula admits that relations between the  two superpowers have become more difficult, and it contains  Washington's announcement of wanting to adapt itself to this.    The security adviser of former President Carter and  spokesman  of an opposition group within the ruling Democrats, Zbigniev  Brzezinski, has now demanded an investigation into President  Clinton's Russia policy, with the aim of reassessing Russia's  future role in the light of possible new developments. Among  these he counts the failure of democracy in Russia, or  continuing political instability, together with internal  radicalization. In this case, Washington's concept would be  outdated anyhow. Also, there are considerations about how and  for how long Boris Yeltsin can remain in power, and who his  successor will be.    Brzezinski is not the only critic of an U.S. foreign policy  that was for a long time uncritical toward Russia, and he is not  warning in vain either. President Clinton himself has set a  corrective sign by receiving in short order the presidents of  Ukraine, Georgia, and Kazakhstan, all reform states under  Moscow's pressure. He spoke out for the "territorial integrity"  of Ukraine at a time when it was jeopardized from the periphery  and the Crimea. Today, Washington holds the view that an  independent Ukraine is more important for the West's security  than a nuclear-free one. Another view is that Russia must not  be allowed to patch its old empire back together. Next year, the  small CIS states and the Baltic republics together are to  receive as much in financial aid as Russia. The United States  still needs Russia for disarmament and peacekeeping measures,  but it has stopped overlooking its intentions and its neighbors.</p>

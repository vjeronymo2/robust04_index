			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Indian minister quits over Bofors letter MR Madhavsinh Solanki resigned yesterday as India's foreign minister following his admission that he delivered a mystery letter to his Swiss counterpart last month on the Bofors case. Mr Solanki's action has greatly embarrassed Mr P V Narasimha Rao's Congress government which is being accused of going slow on the investigations into the scandal over payoffs by Bofors, the Swedish armaments company. The Bofors case, which rocked the government when the late Mr Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister, was one of the principal reasons for the defeat of the Congress party in the 1990 elections. With Mr Solanki's resignation - the first since the latest Congress government was formed eight months ago - the Bofors affair has been successfully resurrected by the opposition which is determined to embarrass the government further. A parliamentary debate is to be held today. Mr Gandhi and others were alleged to be recipients of payoffs from Bofors which was awarded a Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 800m) contract in the early 1980s for supply of howitzers to the Indian army. The charges have surfaced repeatedly since then. Mr Gandhi was assassinated in April last year and the truth about the payoffs has never been told. Following a parliamentary storm over a newspaper report on Monday, Mr Solanki admitted that he handed over a note to Mr Rene Felber, the Swiss foreign minister, from a private lawyer on the status of pending Bofors cases. 'I now regret that I handed over the note which has caused embarrassment to me and avoidable misunderstanding,' he said. Mr Solanki claims he did not know the contents of the note. The Indian Express, which carried the report, said that the note contained a sentence asking Switzerland not to take any action on the Bofors cases in the country until a petition pending in Indian courts was disposed of. The Indian Express also reported the note said the Indian government believed there was no urgency in the case and that the matter could held in suspension. A parliamentary investigation in the mid-1980s absolved Mr Gandhi of charges of corruption but the investigation was reopened by Mr V P Singh when he was prime minister. Mr Singh ordered a fresh inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation more than three years ago but this has not been completed yet. Mr Rao's government has denied accusations of slowing down the investigations.</p>

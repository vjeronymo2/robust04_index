			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Further oil and gas exploration announced Further oil and gas exploration rounds, which will take in new frontier areas as well as the North Sea, were announced by the government yesterday as official figures showed a continuing surge in UK hydrocarbon output. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the 15th round of offshore licensing would include all available unlicensed acreage in the southern basin and the central North Sea, where gas is predominant. The round would be 'fast track' to encourage rapid exploration. Applications should be in by July 26, and awards will be made in the autumn. Mr Eggar is also seeking nominations for blocks companies would like to see offered in the 16th round, which will cover coastal areas of Britain and the north of Scotland, including west of Shetland where BP has made a promising discovery. When blocks are in sensitive areas, the government will ask applicants to say how they would address environmental concerns. Later this year Mr Eggar will also give details of the 17th round which will include frontier areas such as Rockall. Mr Eggar said he did not expect any territorial controversies over these regions. The new rounds came with the release of figures showing that UK oil and gas reserves are at record levels with production heading for new highs. The government's Brown Book says recoverable reserves continue to rise at a faster rate than consumption. Oil production last year rose 6 per cent to 2.13m barrels a day. Gas output was up 17 per cent to 2.31 trillion cu ft. The book also shows that the number of exploration wells fell by 30 per cent last year. Mr Eggar said this was more likely to have been caused by the softness of the oil price than the government's decision to increase North Sea oil taxation. The Energy Report Vol 2.

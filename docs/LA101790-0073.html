			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAINING FOR WELFARE MOMS  </P> <P> We are pleased that The Times reported on an important new study on training  welfare mothers for work (Part A, Sept. 20).  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the headline, "Basic Education Found to Be Job Path for Poor,"  is misleading.  </P> <P> In fact, the study showed that only when basic education was integrated into  specific job skill training was the program truly successful.  </P> <P> Considering that the states must begin to implement new programs to shift  welfare mothers to self-sufficiency under the Family Support Act, the article  was right on target when it said that one of the purposes of the study is to  "prompt state officials to consider alternatives to the traditional  school-first work-training programs."  </P> <P> This is wonderful opportunity to try on a much broader scale the model for  training welfare mothers for work we find so promising.  </P> <P> PHOEBE COTTINGHAM  </P> <P> Project Director  </P> <P> Minority Female Single Parent Demonstration  </P> <P> Rockefeller Foundation  </P> <P> New York  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Freedom Front Beneficiary of Conservative Party Votes --  "The emergence, replete with lists of national and regional  candidates, of Constand Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] as a  contesting party in the April election is a positive  development," says a page-12 editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR  in English on 18 March. "It means that a substantial proportion  of Afrikaner conservatives will pursue the establishment of a  volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] within legal parameters and,  sensibly, seek to make use of the Volks [people] Council to  advance their objective." However, the FF's participation in  the election is "bad news" for F. W. de Klerk's National Party  (NP). "Had the FF stayed out, many CP [Conservative Party]  voters might have voted for the NP as the next best bulwark  against ANC [African national Congress domination. Similarly,  in the absence of the FF, the NP is the most likely beneficiary  of IFP voters who defy an Inkatha boycott call. The NP's loss  will, however, be South Africa's gain. The more inclusive the  election and settlement, the better."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Inkatha Leadership Not Searching for Solutions --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 18 March in a page-8  editorial warns that if President de Klerk is working on a new  initiative with the IFP which might lead to some kind of  breakthrough, "he had better work skillfully, because the  signals from Ulundi tell a different story." "The Inkatha  leadership is not behaving in a manner suggesting it is  searching for solutions and for a way to contest the April  elections." It has "sabotaged" the meeting planned for 18 March  between Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and Nelson Mandela. The  speeches at the opening of the kwaZulu legislative assembly on  17 March "were aggressive and threatening, despite the calls for  peace. King Goodwill Zwelithini's words were in a similar vein."  BUSINESS DAY says it seems Inkatha President Buthelezi "fears  allowing the king to be exposed to Mandela's powers of  persuasion." Buthelezi invited "all and sundry" to the  Zwelithini-Mandela meeting, and "switched the venue from inside  the legislative assembly buildings to the grounds outside, so  that it would become an Inkatha jamboree of royals, chiefs and  subjects, with Mandela uncomfortably at the centre." "Inkatha  has made valid objections to the interim constitution, and its  obduracy has won concessions. It could still win more through  international mediation. But this does not mean it can continue  holding the country to ransom."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   Parties Must Heed Bophuthatswana Warning -- Johannesburg  RAPPORT in Afrikaans of 13 March says in a page-20 editorial:  "In the hurly-burly of events in Bophuthatswana this past week  the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] stormed in with a  performance which, tragic ending and all, caused much harm not  only to themselves, but also to others who do not associate with  them but whose cause they claim to serve." "The far-right must  give serious thought to this and several other issues; they will  realize that the old South Africa is gone for ever." "But the  finger of the Bophuthatswana mess also points accusingly at the  ANC, its leaders, and its unbridled followers. In Cape Town  Major General Bantu Holomisa declared gleefully that  Bophuthaswana had received a stiff dose of `Vitamin ANC', and  that kwaZulu was next in line. His statement at an election  event let the cat out of the bag. Worried South Africans now  have reason to expect that the ANC `vitamins' form part of its  election plan for the rest of the country." "It is time," warns  RAPPORT, "that ANC leaders get it into their heads that South  Africa needs no revolution but an orderly transition to a new  constitutional dispensation, managed under strict Western  democratic standards. But the ANC leadership does not concern  itself with the brain drain or the millions of rands fleeing the  country. All one hears is the old refrain that whites need nor  fear the ANC." "If the AWB is guilty of hot-headed stupidity,  the ANC's plundering hordes are just as guilty. Mr. Nelson  Mandela is not doing nearly enough to curb his party's lust for  power and its arrogance." "If a firm grip is not forthcoming,  there will be no escaping the violence of the past few days.  Would that all political parties read what the warning finger  of Mmabatho has written, and take it to heart."</p>

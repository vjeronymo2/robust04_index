			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (News): Big boost in government investment will help hesitant upturn - Treasury Forecasts A HESITANT economic upturn in the final half of this year, helped by a large boost in government investment, was predicted by the Treasury in forecasts released with the Budget. The predictions indicate much higher than expected government borrowing over the next two years, partly resulting from limited growth in tax income caused by the recession and higher state spending in such areas as social security benefits. One factor behind the forecasts is a sharply more pessimistic outlook for the world economy than that contained in the Treasury's predictions in November's Autumn Statement. Nonetheless, the Treasury insisted that the main ingredients for recovery from the 18-month recession were in place. These are 'lower interest rates, falling inflation and the fiscal stabilisers (the effects of increased government spending boosting the economy)'. According to Mr Norman Lamont UK gross domestic product will increase by 1 per cent this year, a figure at the low end of predictions by private-sector economists. It contrasts with the Treasury's more bullish projection for next year of 2.25 per cent, made in November. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of GDP, is expected to rise by a weak 1 per cent, while growth in manufacturing will be just 0.5 per cent, after a drop of more than 5 per cent in 1991. The economy is expected to benefit from a sharp rise in government investment, likely to increase by 10.75 per cent neat year, after a 9.25 per cent fall last year. According to the Treasury, government investment this year is likely to be 24 per cent higher than in 1988 and 50 per cent up on 1979. But business investment is predicted to fall by 2.75 per cent this year, after a 11.75 per cent drop on last year. The Treasury said the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) would be Pounds 28bn in the fiscal year beginning on April 1, after Pounds 13.75bn in 1991-92. In 1993-94, it is likely to rise still more to Pounds 32bn, or 4.75 per cent of gross domestic product and to fall to Pounds 25bn in 1994-95. Between 1991-92 and 1992-93, general government income including income tax and corporation tax is predicted to rise by just Pounds 8bn, from Pounds 222bn to Pounds 230bn. Over the same period government spending is likely to climb Pounds 22bn from Pounds 236bn to Pounds 258bn. The Treasury said that growth in the seven biggest industrialised economies  -the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - would be just 1.5 per cent this year, with world trade rising by 3.75 per cent. The Autumn Statement put these figures at 2.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. On the expected recovery in the UK, the Treasury said this will be held back by a weak housing market, high levels of consumer debt, and only a slight reduction in savings as a percentage of disposable income. This expected to fall by just 0.5 of a percentage point over the next 12 months, from 10 per cent to 9.5 per cent. The Treasury says GDP in the first half of this year will show virtually no increase on the same period last year, but in the second half the economy will have expanded by 2 per cent compared with last time. It foresees 3 per cent growth between the first halves of this year and next. Many economists will take the projections with a pinch of salt. The message that the recovery is coming, but has been delayed, is very similar to the tone of the Treasury's Autumn Statement and Budget 1991 forecasts, both of which turned out to be inaccurate.</p>

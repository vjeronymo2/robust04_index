			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (1): Fasten your safety belts - Aerospace faces its worst cyclical down-turn since World War Two. As the industry prepares to go on show at Farnborough, parts of its military and commercial sectors are bracing themselves for some radical reshaping TO MAKE a small fortune you should start with a big one, saysMr Jean Pierson, the chairman of the European Airbus consortium. This old adage from the farming industry is becoming increasingly apposite for aerospace which during the past two years has faced the worst cyclical downturn in its post war history. As the industry prepares to gather in force for its regular Farnborough showcase next week, it is facing a series of severe problems both in the military and commercial sectors which are likely to lead to a radical reshaping of some significant parts of the business. This process has already begun. The last few months have seen Deutsche Aerospace negotiate a partnership with Fokker of the Netherlands which is expected to lead to a broad restructuring of the European regional aircraft industry. McDonnell Douglas of the US has been striving to forge an alliance with aerospace manufacturers in the Far East to form a new international commercial airliner partnership. In the UK, British Aerospace is in the throes of a sweeping restructuring aimed at refocusing the company around its core military aircraft and large civil airliner activities in the European Airbus partnership. Mergers, partnerships and consolidation have also accelerated in the airline business still struggling to recover from the air travel slump caused by the combined effects of the Gulf crisis and the recession in many western economies. The most spectacular recent deal involved the proposal by British Airways to buy this summer a stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, in an effort to form a global airline. Other carriers have also been scrambling to negotiate partnerships. Air France acquired this year stakes in Sabena of Belgium and CSA, the Czechoslovak national airline. The military side of aerospace has also been forced to scale back its operations to adapt to the reductions in government spending in the new post Cold War defence climate. This has led to large scale job cuts and attempts by manufacturers to diversify increasingly in commercial activities to offset the loss of defence business. Even though the civil market remains soft, the contraction in the defence industry is expected to continue spawning new ventures in commercial aerospace. In turn, this is bound to put even greater pressure on the excess capacity already evident in the commercial sector. 'It seems clear to me that the growing problem of excess capacity, and defence conversion, will have a huge impact on our industry over the next five to ten years,' says Mr Larry Clarkson, a vice president of Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial aircraft. Boeing has been cutting back production as have Airbus and McDonnell Douglas. But even with 55 per cent of the world commercial airliner market and an order backlog worth Dollars 97bn, Boeing has also been forced to change the way it does business. The Seattle-based company is adopting a much more open stance towards the outside world and is actively encouraging airlines, suppliers and subcontractors to participate in the design of its latest airliner, the 777 widebody twin engine jet. It is also openly talking for the first time of forging close ties, including equity partnerships, with other companies. It has been forced to do so by the huge investments required to launch new programmes in a market where the risks have kept steadily rising. 'I don't know where our next partners will come from but I am not ruling out partnerships with any other company in the world,' Mr Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman, said at the company's annual meeting this year. Airbus, which has now become Boeing's principal competitor building up a 26 per cent share of the world market during the last 20 years, is also anxious to expand international collaboration as a response to the increasing challenges and complexities in designing, funding and developing new aircraft. 'At the same time as alliances are developing between American and Asian interests, Airbus is exploring, sounding out, talking with new potential partners wherever they may be, and why not the US,' Mr Pierson said in New York this summer. The problem for the industry is that there is a fundamental difference between the current downturn and previous cycles, which have tended to occur at regular 10-year intervals. For the first time, the prolonged recession in civil aviation has coincided with deep cutbacks in defence. In the past, the industry was able to rely on its military activities to tide it through a cyclical recession in the commercial sector. This has not been the case during the last two years. Instead, the industry has had to restructure simultaneously both sides of its business. The end of the Cold War has not only shrunk the defence market but has also changed the emphasis on the types and scale of military projects either already in progress or envisaged. In the past, the industry's activities were dominated by projects designed to address a potential conflict between super-power blocks. But the political upheavals of the past two years, with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, have altered that philosophy. The emphasis has now turned more in favour of lighter, cheaper and more tactical weapon systems rather than the former dominance of long range strategic military aircraft or missiles. However, the disappearance of the risk of a super-power confrontation has now highlighted the fact that in many other regions of the world there is still the possibility of local conflagrations requiring weapons more suited to that threat. To respond to such threats, many Air Forces are increasingly looking for lighter and more operationally flexible systems. The UK has argued vigorously that this situation also applies to the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), which is fighting a political battle for survival. The EFA issue is bound to be one of the dominating themes at next week's Farnborough air show. The UK is expected to use the occasion to lobby hard Germany, Spain and Italy to continue participating in the production phase of the controversial programme. Germany provoked the EFA crisis when it announced this summer it did not intend go ahead with production of the new fighter, although it would continue to participate in the project's development. Both Spain and Italy have also expressed concerns about EFA's costs and are still, at this stage, by no means committed to production. The collapse of the EFA programme would be a huge blow for the European aerospace industry. It would have repercussions on jobs and the future aerospace technological capabilities of the four EFA countries, and could also have implications for France which is developing its own advanced combat aircraft, the Rafale. A decision to scrap EFA could lead to a reappraisal of the Rafale by the French administration in Paris, some French aerospace officials fear. The industry is worried that the possibility of EFA and other military programmes being dropped or downgraded could have a long term effect on commercial aerospace activities, which are still regarded as having good long term growth prospects. These concerns largely stem from the fact that advanced technology in new materials and production techniques developed for military programmes find their way in many cases into commercial programmes. These techniques are likely to become all the more important in the future as the industry starts to turn its attention to the next generation of supersonic airliners and the development of 600-800 seater super jumbos. Demand for super jumbos and a second generation Concorde is expected to emerge around the turn of the century.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (9): Obstacles to growth / A look at efforts to unblock the infrastructure SIT behind a crawling container truck choked by diesel fumes and dust on the 400km from Seoul and Pusan, and one becomes aware of the large sums of money South Korea needs to spend on improving its inadequate infrastructure. The journey along the congested highway between the country's two biggest cities can be tedious. In Seoul, the capital, congestion is even worse. The exhaust fumes of 1m cars hangs like a pall over the city for much of the year. Traffic jams cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production time adding to the discontent of a people that wants its standard of living to rise in line with economic growth. The metropolitan area of Seoul houses 18m people, 43 per cent of the country's population, and accounts for 59 per cent of South Korean manufacturing output. Pusan in the south east is the country's biggest seaport. Traffic between the two cities, therefore, is large. Central government has estimated that road congestion in 1990 cost the country Won1,200bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in wasted energy and lost time. The main Seoul-Pusan rail link has already reached maximum capacity increasing the potential for road congestion as distributors are forced to use container lorries. South Korean infrastructure in many areas is struggling to cope with the rapid growth in the economy. Delays in cargo handling at the ports of Pusan and Inchon are estimated to have cost the country a further Won700bn (Dollars 1bn) in 1990. Kimpo airport, South Korea's leading airport handling 85 per cent of international passengers and 95 per cent of air freight, is forecast to reach its maximum capacity in 1996. The need for increased infrastructure spending is undeniable. Without higher investment production bottlenecks will intensify and inhibit future growth. Social unrest also is likely to increase as living standards come under increasing pressure from inadequate services. The government, in a bid to co-ordinate spending plans, has established a special task force under the president, the Planning Agency for Social Infrastructure Development (Pasid), to identify priority projects. One of its major aims is to encourage greater investment away from over-crowded cities to less economically successful areas, particularly the south west of the country. Improvements in transport are regarded as essential. The task force has proposed that Won40 trillion (Dollars 52bn) be spent by central government on infrastructure between now and 1996. More than half of this is planned to be invested in roads and railways. About Won19 trillion (Dollars 24.6bn) is expected to be spent on constructing 450km of new roads and upgrading a similar length of existing roads. The programme includes beginning work on three new motorways. The most important is a 353km expressway, costing Won3 trillion, between Seoul and Mokpo in the south west, the region which has been identified by the government for expansion. In the past, heavy emphasis has been placed on connecting Seoul with other cities. The latest crop of motorways will instead connect regional cities with each other including a 289km highway between Ch'unch'on and Taegu costing Won2 trillion and a 160km motorway between Taejun and Chinju. Investment in the south west will be further aided by the expansion of Kwangyang which is intended to become a major seaport. There are also plans for increased spending water services, power generation and land development. The government hopes that this will encourage the private sector to invest in new factories, offices and homes in the south west as well as other less developed areas. A further Won8 trillion (SDollars 10.3bn) is expected to be invested between now and 1996 on upgrading and electrifying South Korea's railway network including starting work on a high speed rail link between Seoul and Pusan which is expected to cost Won5.8 trillion (Dollars 7.5bn) when it is completed towards the end of the century. Other high speed rail routes are planned including a link between Seoul and Mokpo but these programmes have still to be allocated a budget. There is also substantial investment planned in improved water and sewerage facilities, a trebling in the size of the Seoul subway system and a large power station building programme. As a result central government spending on infrastructure as a proportion of GNP is forecast to almost double from 1.7 to 3 per cent between 1991 and 1996. About Won7 trillion is planned to be spent on improving drinking water and installing new water services. The government intends to extend sewage treatment from about 35 per cent of the population to about 70 per cent by the mid-1990s. The Ministry of Energy and Resources, which has a separate budget funded out of a special petroleum revenue tax, plans to invest Won70 trillion by the year 2000 on new power stations and transmission equipment. The country currently runs nine nuclear power stations. Last year, these provided nearly half the country's electricity. By the year 2000, South Korea expects to have another 11 nuclear stations either built or under construction, making it one of the world's biggest users of nuclear power. Funding such a vast programme will not be easy. Rising inflation caused by over-heating in the economy means that the Korean government is seeking to slow down the overall rise in construction output while leaving infrastructure spending plans intact. Restrictions on the issue of building permits for private residential and commercial development have been introduced in a bid to reduce activity. The controls which had been expected to be lifted in the Spring have been extended. They are expected to remain in force at least until the end of the year - such is the difficulty of restricting rises in construction output which has been blamed for the doubling of the country's annual inflation since 1985. The aim is to restrict real increases in construction output, after allowing for inflation, to between 3 per cent to 4 per cent a year between now and 1996. Current forecasts are that total construction output will rise by 7 per cent in real terms this year.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Asahi Glass pre-tax profits dip ASAHI GLASS, Japan's leading glassmaker, yesterday disclosed a one-third fall in interim pre-tax profits to Y22.7bn (Dollars 181.6m) from Y33.9bn, and revised sharply downward its forecasts for the full year. In a gloomy commentary accompanying the results, it said a decline in consumer spending and a tighter rein on capital investment by manufacturers, meant 'the Japanese economy began to take on aspects of a business recession'. Citing a production slowdown in the automotive industry and dull domestic demand for television sets, two main markets the company supplies, it said circumstances were 'harsh' and the outlook 'does not allow much room for optimism.' Asahi Glass is projecting pre-tax profits of Y48bn for 1992 as a whole, down 20.3 per cent from the previous year. Until yesterday it had been forecasting a modest 2.9 per cent rise to Y62bn. Sales for the first half to June dipped 2.2 per cent to Y487.6bn but are expected by the company to edge 0.8 per cent ahead to reach Y1,030bn for the full year. The previous forecast was for Y1,060bn in revenues. Glass and construction materials, which account for half its total business, showed sluggish sales except for energy-saving products and those with high safety or design specifications.' The company benefited from a 6.3 per cent rise in non-operating income to Y14.6bn and a 15.4 per cent drop in its interest bill to Y3.6bn. As planned, the interim dividend of Y5 a share includes a Y0.5 payment to commemorate its 85th anniversary. It is being paid from net earnings per share of Y10.49, down from Y17.14 last time when the payout was Y4.5.</p>

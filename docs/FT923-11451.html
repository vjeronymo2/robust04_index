			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Rise in payments to investors The Investors Compensation Scheme, the industry-backed compensation fund for investors in retail financial products, paid Pounds 12.5m to more than 1,500 investors in 1991-92, up sharply from Pounds 1.8m the year before. In explaining the sharp increase in both the volume and value of claims, Mr Denis Child, chairman, said there had been a surge of complaints relating to alleged negligence. He also noted that claims had become increasingly complex. These claims largely are concerned with the sales of home-equity plans - plans which encourage individuals to mortgage their home and invest the proceeds in a bond which may earn an insufficient return.</p>

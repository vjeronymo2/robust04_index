			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sony studies interest in Columbia Pictures Sony, the Japanese electronics company which owns Columbia Pictures, confirmed yesterday there had been approaches by several parties interested in buying a stake in its US film studio. However, it stressed it had not yet made a decision about any sale. 'We are not soliciting such approaches, but we are open to those that we do receive,' Mr Tsutomu Sugiyama, assistant general manager of corporate communications in Tokyo, said yesterday. Sony, which bought the Hollywood film studio for Dollars 3.4bn in 1989, has been burdened by the huge amount of debt it took on to fund the Columbia acquisition. Added to this, Sony's film business has been hit by the failure of the movie Last Action Hero, which is believed to have made a huge loss. However, Mr Sugiyama said video and other income was still expected from the film, which features Arnold Schwarzenegger. Therefore, it was 'premature to discuss such figures'. Industry analysts believe it would make commercial sense for Sony to link with an outside partner, particularly a cable-TV or telephone company in the US which could provide it with an entry into the multimedia business. A partnership involving the sale of a stake in Columbia would relieve Sony of some of its nearly Dollars 10bn debt. It could also have other advantages. Such a deal could provide Sony with cable-TV network operating expertise, an expanded outlet for its software assets and, eventually, a head start in the Japanese cable-TV and multimedia market, says S. G. Warburg, the securities company. Sony's share price rose Y160 to Y6,300 in Tokyo yesterday. Although its overall performance has shown a slight pick-up, Sony is predicting that consolidated net income in the year to March 31, will fall 45 per cent to Y20bn (Dollars 190m), compared with an earlier forecast of Y30bn.</p>

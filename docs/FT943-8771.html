			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Companies House to cut charges after EU court ruling Companies House is to reduce by half the fees it charges for registering British companies and for the annual submission of returns to avoid a legal battle following a recent judgment in the European Court of Justice. The decision, which will take effect on October 1, is expected to wipe out the annual contribution made by Companies House - the official repository for corporate financial information in England, Wales and Scotland - to the Department of Trade and Industry, which last year stood at Pounds 17m. Nearly 1m limited liability companies are registered with Companies House, and last year 115,000 new companies were incorporated for the first time. The move to cut the charges was taken by the DTI - for which Companies House operates as an executive agency. It follows a European Court ruling, involving an Italian company, which interpreted a 1969 Brussels directive to mean that fees for registering a company must be restricted to administration costs involved. Search fees and fines levied on companies for filing their returns after the due dates will not be affected by the changes. The halving in Companies House fees - Pounds 50 for incorporation and Pounds 32 for filing annual returns - coincides with a review of its activities by consultants appointed by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, came up with a list of options for privatisation last year and is submitting a follow-up study to examine proposals in more detail by the autumn. It is set to begin canvassing public views over the next few weeks. Mr Heseltine is keen to contract out most Companies House services, although he has indicated that responsibility for the registrar's functions and ownership of the register will remain with the DTI. The option under Mr Heseltine's partial privatisation plans which seems most likely to be favoured involves paying private sector contractors a management fee akin to the way Companies House now operates, with an annual target for reduction in costs. Officials have also been considering paying contractors on the basis of net running costs, in proportion to the workload handled each year. The reduction in income brought about by halving fees in the wake of the European Court ruling was anticipated in the run-up to commissioning the privatisation studies and is considered unlikely to scupper Mr Heseltine's plans. The department said that the fees charged by Companies House have never been tested legally but the DTI had decided not to challenge the European Court ruling to avoid the possibility of a protracted legal action. A DTI spokeswoman claimed that fees charged by Companies House were among the lowest in Europe.</p>

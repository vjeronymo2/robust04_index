			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE -- PREGNANCY SERVES AS TEST  </P> <P> I have a hunch that Dianne Klein's article ("One Woman's Choice: Pregnancy as a  Test of Faith," Nov. 19) may have generated a fair amount of "hate-type" mail  from pro-life, anti-abortion advocates. And I also have a hunch that her  article in today's (Dec. 3) Times may generate a fair amount of "hate-type"  mail from pro-choice, pro-abortion advocates. I hope that I am wrong. I fear  that I am right.  </P> <P> I am writing to thank her for writing both articles. I was deeply touched by  her article in today's paper; I found it compelling, moving and helpful in my  own pastoral work. But I recognize that there is more of the story to tell. On  Nov. 7, the Catholic Bishops of the United States issued a resolution on  abortion that contains these words: "We recognize, as we rightfully engage in  this debate, that we must hear the issues, the struggles and the anguish of  women who face issues in a way that we never will." I thank you for assisting  all in this effort to listen.  </P> <P> THE REV. GARY M. KINZER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Observer: DIY mission International airports are designated by a three-figure code which you can always spot on baggage tags. The code for Heathrow, for example, is LHR, Hong Kong HKG, and Singapore is SIN, although Bangkok would probably be more appropriate. Ironically, the code for Diyarbakir airport in southern Turkey near the Iraqi border, where flights carrying food and clothes for Kurdish refugees have been landing, is DIY. Last Friday, a British Airways Boeing 757 with volunteers and 21 tonnes of supplies for the refugees landed at Diyarbakir. There was confusion at the airport where several other aircraft were already sitting on the tarmac waiting to be unloaded. The BA crew indulged in a little DIY by unloading the aircraft themselves.</p>

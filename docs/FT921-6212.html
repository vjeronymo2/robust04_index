			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Mongolia plans to free most fixed prices MONGOLIA said it planned to free nearly all fixed prices next month, an important step towards a market-style economy that could lead to sharply higher prices, AP reports from Ulan Bator. Mr D. Ganbold, deputy prime minister, made the announcement at a meeting of Mongolia's main donors. The decision will take effect on March 1. 'The prices of rationed goods could rise three, four or five times,' he said. Meat, milk, petroleum, cooking oil, rice and sugar are among the products affected. The prices of flour and some breads will remain controlled until the autumn harvest is reaped, Mr Ganbold said. The price liberalisation, the third since January 1991, is likely to add to inflation, already running at more than 100 per cent a year, according to central bank calculations. Representatives of seven donor nations (China, Germany, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the UK and the US), the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Development Program heard Mr Ganbold's announcement. They were in Ulan Bator for a meeting on Mongolia's growing economic crisis. The Ministry of Trade and Industry asked the donors for an additional Dollars 450m (Pounds 257.5m) this year to cover critical imports. The country is already to receive Dollars 168m of aid in imported goods this year but is expected to deplete those by June. Analysts said Dollars 450m was far more than the country needs. The National Development Ministry estimated in its presentation that Mongolia's import shortfall would total only about Dollars 87m. The donor representatives asked Mongolian officials to prepare a more detailed list of priority imports. No new aid was pledged.</p>

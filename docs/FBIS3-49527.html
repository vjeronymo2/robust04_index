			<p>Language: <F P=105> Macedonian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by P.Dz.: "Are `Liquidation Groups' Being </F> Formed?"]    [Text] Within the framework of the Tetovo PDP [Party for  Democratic Prosperity] branch, 55 out of the total number of 70  subbranches are asking for an urgent assembly of the branch.  According to information from sources close to the Congress  Preparatory Committee, these subbranches have submitted  officially signed requests.    That can signify that the leader of the so-called PDP "hard  line," Menduh Taci, is losing support in the most powerful  branch of the party. An assembly of the branch is expected to  take place this week and it is possible that Taci will not get  enough votes to be president of the branch, member of the PDP  Central Assembly, or delegate. Such an outcome could imply that  Taci would not be able to participate in the PDP Congress  scheduled for 15 January. It looks as if the field actions of  the group of delegates and ministers have started producing  results, and the group is winning over Taci and his adherents.    In Tetovo, like Gostivar, half of the subbranches are asking  for the assembly, and that speaks much about the fact that the  "hard line" is losing support in the Polog region, where Taci  initially received great support.    However, will Taci and his group quietly accept losing their  positions? Some political circles in Tetovo claim that it is  possible that Taci will use force to try to stop the assembly  and the congress. He gave a statement in that spirit to Radio  Kumanovo. There are also rumors in Tetovo that so-called "groups  for the liquidation" of outstanding PDP leaders are being  formed. If this is true, it means that the PDP division is  entering a new and very dangerous phase.  <H5>  [Box, p 4] </H5> <H5>  The Holding of the Congress Wary </H5>   An early PDP Congress has been announced for 15 and 16  January in Tetovo, officially signed and sealed in Macedonia.  On the occasion of the announcement, we visited the PDP  headquarters in Macedonia in order to find out the details about  the preparations and the agenda of the mentioned Congress.  There, we met a number of PDP members, including Mahi Nesimi,  who is in charge of the Information Service and a member of the  Congress Preparatory Committee.    "The PDP Congress will be held in Tetovo when the necessary  conditions are provided and when it is convened by the Congress  Preparatory Committee," Mahi Nesimi told us. We did not get an  answer to when the twice postponed news conference, announced by  PDP President Nevzat Halili, will be held.    --J.B.</p>

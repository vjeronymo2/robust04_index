			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: Personnel directors should raise profile to reflect reality Sir, Wellcome's demotion of its personnel director (Letters, November 3) is unusual. We have recently completed a comparator of directors' earnings in very large groups for the remuneration committee of a major plc. This shows that while most executive directors on the main board are the chairmen or CEOs of subsidiaries or divisions, of the functional directors on the main board, personnel ranked second only to finance. However the Institute of Personnel Management, which has a large public sector and academic membership, has not done enough to raise the profile of its senior private sector members and I am not surprised at the investment analysts' response to Wellcome's action. As I pointed out at the IPM's recent conference, the institute has submitted no evidence to Cadbury stage 1 or 2, plays no part in helping members achieve non-executive appointments and is hardly heard in the debate on main board remuneration. This is a pity as there are major issues of principle as well as practical politics involved in the current director pay round. There is more to leadership in the board remuneration area than doing 'what the other fellow does' to justify an inflationary upper quartile salary spiral. Remuneration committees need independent advice and institutional support as they assess the right response to slimmer profits and collapsing executive bonus schemes.

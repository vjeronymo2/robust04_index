			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Former President Giscard d'Estaing leader of the centre-right UDF party The Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing who is the leader of the centre-right UDF party. MR Giscard d'Estaing is the government's main hope for roping in pro-Maastricht votes from supporters of the right-wing opposition. His party is also divided over Maastricht, though less so than the Gaullists. However, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, 65, a veteran in European Community politics, has never hidden his pro-treaty views and is accepted as the most authoritative French protagonist of the treaty outside the government. He has done more than anybody in the Yes camp to try to soothe the fears of Maastricht opponents that the treaty offers the European Commission an open ended opportunity to legislate on matters of purely national interest. He has proposed that EC member states should, after the ratification of the treaty, draw up a list of where the Community can and cannot intervene, so as to settle the argument over subsidiarity. His critics suggest that this idea looks very like a renegotiation, even though Mr Giscard d'Estaing has stressed that it is not politically feasible to rewrite the Maastricht plan. He is ill at ease campaigning alongside Mr Chirac since they are the main rivals for the opposition's future presidential candidacy.</p>

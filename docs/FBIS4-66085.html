			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 25 (CTK) -- Slovak Defense Minister  Pavol Kanis, who represents Slovakia at the current North  Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), today handed the  presentation document to the Partnership for Peace plan to NATO  Under-Secretary-General Sergio Balanzin.    The document contains proposals for concrete forms of  cooperation with NATO. It stresses the need for the Slovak Army  to attain such a degree of "compatibility and inter-operability"  which is necessary for smooth cooperation and for Slovakia's  later integration into the NATO military structures.    Slovakia is interested in cooperation particularly in the  areas of defense planning, legislation, command and management,  human resources management and crisis management, deployment of  armed forces for humanitarian assistance and in the case of  nature disasters, communications and information systems, in  logistics and in military science and research.    Slovakia has been the sixth country to submit its  presentation document in Brussels and the first former communist  country to publish the document in full and to give it to  journalists.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (11): 'The coffee machine may undermine Chinese walls' - The accountants, when do interests conflict? Pressure is growing for reform of the rules governing conflicts of interest in corporate finance, as accountants muscle in on management buy-outs. Increasing numbers of accountants recognise the tensions in acting for a range of different parties in a transaction. Yet so far, few of these concerns are reflected in any professional guidelines. Mr Howard Leigh, managing director of Cavendish Corporate Finance, says: 'Whoever is retained to sell a business should not be advising on buyers, and those who want to keep the audit of both should not advise either.' He points out that, if the auditors are asked to conduct due diligence, they will end up investigating their own files, which throws up a clear conflict of interest. If they are advising the company on whether to accept an MBO and at what price, while also advising the MBO team and knowing how much money they will be willing to accept, then they are in a conflict. The larger accountants traditionally brush off such criticism. They argue that such commentary is self-interest on the part of smaller firms and boutiques that are missing out on work going to the larger firms. Certainly, Mr Andrew Pollock, of Rees Pollock, a London-based firm, admits that there is still prejudice by potential clients in favour of using the Big Six accounting firms on the basis of their reputation. 'There is conservatism; the IBM factor is going to rule for ever. Clients go for safety,' he says. The big firms talk about Chinese walls, the use of different partners or different offices to conduct the different assignments, and other safeguards to prevent any conflict. 'We have a rule that if we do due diligence and the audit, we will use entirely separate teams,' says Mr Neil Lerner, head of corporate finance at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'Where both parties are clear about our role, we are happy to act on both sides. The most important thing for the finance houses is to ensure a steady flow of deals.' However, Mr Leigh says: 'The partners meet and talk at the coffee machine. You should not advise in a situation where you end up face to face with yourselves.' He says concern over potential profit-sharing, or the risks of litigation if things go wrong, acts as an incentive for partners - who are all equity-holders in the same firm - to share information, too. These are not purely theoretical concerns. 'Everyone denies it happens, but it does,' says Mr Leigh. He highlights the case of a deal with six parties, each represented by a partner from the same firm. 'They knew there was a problem, but they wouldn't stand down. Things had gone too far.' Some of the larger firms are also changing. Mr Ian Krieger, head of buy-outs at Arthur Andersen, says: 'We have a policy that, if advising management, we won't do the due diligence. We don't feel comfortable otherwise. But we're in a minority. I think there is a need for new rules. Until that happens, people are going to work on both sides of transactions.' A second concern is the growth in contingency fees. 'There is a lot of ambiguity,' says Mr Leigh. 'People huff and puff about bonuses or premiums on the audit fee.' He says there should not be any discount or contingency element in the audit fee or investigation work. That issue is reflected in current ethical rules for accountants, which outlaw contingency fees on activities where a professional opinion on financial information is required. Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the chartered accountants' joint ethics committee, says there are also plans to introduce draft new rules early next year. These would recommend greater transparency in fee structures, and outlaw any contingency element linked to the audit or other professional opinion on financial information. But he says there are no plans yet for any wider rules that would limit the potential conflicts of an accountant acting on both - or several - sides in an MBO transaction. Meanwhile, there seems to be plenty of money available for MBOs, but a frustrating lack of deals. Howard Leigh says: 'Staff in venture capital houses have been doing less, because deals have collapsed and they are now subjecting them to more scrutiny. But they want to get the deals out before the end of the year.' Ian Krieger says: 'There's a lot of equity money around. The funds are plentiful, but there are not an awful lot of deals around. But business is pretty good. In the last year, we've been quite lucky and our deals have come to fruition. It's the luck of the draw.' And Neil Lerner adds: 'I think everybody who is honest would admit that 1993 has been difficult. We have had a buoyant year in privatisation and mergers and acquisitions. The only disappointing area has been MBOs.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------                     LEADING ACCOUNTANTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------                                        Number                                      of deals  --------------------------------------------------------------- KPMG Peat Marwick                         145 Coopers &amp; Lybrand                          85 Price Waterhouse                           63 Touche Ross                                52 Ernst &amp; Young                              45 Arthur Andersen                            38 Others, none, not known   (duplication)                            (3) Total                                     425  --------------------------------------------------------------- Qualification: acted in Pounds 10m-plus deals Source: KPMG Corporate Finance  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

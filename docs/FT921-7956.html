			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / World Trade News: US, EC set deadline in Airbus subsidy row talks US AND EC negotiators yesterday began a second day's talks to resolve their long-running differences over Airbus Industrie subsidies with one point already agreed: the issue must be settled by March 31, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. Failure, after years of transatlantic bickering over Airbus, could mean unilateral action by US companies under Section 301 of 1988 US trade law; a complaint under the countervailing duty statute is considered most likely. The US trade representative last year brought two cases to Gatt and won one. A dispute settlement panel condemned German exchange-rate support for Deutsche Airbus, the German partner in the four-nation consortium. An EC proposal submitted last October to return to bilateral negotiations was accepted after Christmas. 'The open question for any industry thinking about filing a (domestic) case is when do you reach a point that that option is preferable to letting events continue on the point that they are now on?' said Mr Bob Robeson Jr, vice-president for civil aviation of the Aerospace Industries Association. He would not confirm the industry's intention, but McDonnell Douglas has been losing ground to Airbus competition and has turned to Taiwan for a partnership and new capital. The industry, Mr Robeson said, 'prefers a negotiated settlement with effective disciplines and a deal acceptable to both sides.' The focus in the talks has been on the level of subsidies to be allowed for aircraft development. The EC has offered to cap such subsidies at 45 per cent. The US has sought 25 per cent. But further complications remained, Mr Robeson said. " The US industry is insisting that terms and conditions of repayment represent as closely as possible the commercial markets. The EC wants a royalty-based scheme, the US either a normal repayment stream or uniform stream of royalty repayments with guarantee of repayment at the end. Transparency has become a great 'sticking point', Mr Robeson said. The US wants to know enough about deals to ensure that the EC is meeting its commitments. EC officials argue too much transparency would release commercially sensitive information.</p>

In his message to its participants and all  virgin land developers, Boris Yeltsin emphasized in particular  that the experience of the development of the virgin lands was a  convincing testimony of the fact that if efforts are united,  success is guaranteed in even the most difficult of  undertakings. This experience, Yeltsin thinks, is especially  valuable at present. It is only by acting together and closely  interacting and cooperating in all spheres that the crisis can  be surmounted faster and the difficult problems of the  Commonwealth countries resolved, notes the president.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] On 11 June a water leak was discovered at the  Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine. The water was  leaking from the holding reservoir of the power generating unit  No. 2. The reservoir is used to store cassettes with worked-out  fuel. A shift leader at the Chernobyl nuclear power station,  Aleksandr Yelchishchev, said the leak had not led to changes in  background radiation levels in the nearby premises. Let me  remind you that in accordance with the existing schedule, power  generating unit No. 2 is currently undergoing decommissioning.</p>

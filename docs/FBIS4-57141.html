			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Ex-Minister of the Economy Gustavo Saberbein, after  participating in an event organized by the APRA [American  Popular Revolutionary Alliance] party in Arequipa, told the  press that the neoliberal policies of the Fujimori government  have led to the impoverishment of most Peruvians.    Saberbein said that the government cannot escape its  responsibility in this regard, because it is the government's  policies that have caused the number of Peruvians who live in  conditions of acute poverty to increase from 7 million in July  1990 to 12 million at present.    The ex-minister said that after three and a half years of  the  current government, production continues depressed, unemployment  is overwhelming, and wages are extremely low, as a result of  which Peru recently was declared by the FAO [UN Food and  Agricultural Organization] one of the worst fed countries in the  world, along with Haiti, Afghanistan, Burundi, and other  extremely poor African countries.    Saberbein claimed that today in Peru, people are eating  less,  working less, and producing less than during the two previous  democratic administrations. The social costs paid so far to  reduce inflation, he said, are much greater than necessary, due  to defects in the government's policies.    He said that farmers and peasants have been abandoned by the  government, with the reduction in agricultural credit, the lack  of technical assistance and massive imports of foodstuffs.  Agricultural workers today are earning 50 percent less than in  mid-1990, he added, saying that this is why they voted "no" so  overwhelmingly.    Saberbein said that the government's policies have also  placed industry at a disadvantage in competing with foreign  producers, due to serious delays in foreign exchange  transactions, lack of credit, the high cost of energy, and  payment of antitechnological taxes.    He said that the government is wrong to think that foreign  investment can replace domestic investment and take charge of  our development. He maintained that no country has developed by  following that principle, as development in all countries has  been essentially the result of domestic investment.    Saberbein stated that, to strengthen the fight against  inflation and increase domestic investment, current economic  policy must be corrected so as to create favorable conditions  for producers and workers, which would make possible better  wages and more jobs through export promotion and sustained  growth in production for the domestic market.    He said that the government's extremely liberal policies are  not the solution that Peru needs. There are other alternatives  that will correct yesterday's and today's mistakes. This is why,  Saberbein said, the APRA has been working intensively to develop  its program, to be able to offer the country before long a  better alternative to the current government.    Saberbein explained that, as part of this activity, during  the past 60 days the APRA has conducted five regional Program  Sessions, one of which was that held this weekend in Arequipa,  with the participation of leaders and activists from the  departments and provinces in the southern part of the country.  The event was opened by Engineer Javier Tantalean, president of  the National Planning Commission of the PAP [Aprista Party of  Peru], and was adjourned by ex-Deputy Carlos Roca, deputy  secretary general of the APRA.</p>

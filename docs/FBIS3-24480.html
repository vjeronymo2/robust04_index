			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.V. Yakshin, O.M. Vilkova, N.A. Tsarenko, N.G. </F> Zhukova, and B.N. Laskorin, academician, All-Russia Scientific  Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Moscow; UDC  66.081:541.64:546.59]    [Abstract] Methods of extracting, concentrating, and  purifying gold continue to receive a great deal of attention. As  part of the continuing attempt to create new extractive reagents  and sorbents that are more effective and selective than their  existing counterparts, an attempt has been made to develop  size-selective reagents containing two- and three-dimensional  macrocyclic compounds (crown ethers and cryptands) as their  active grouping. The distribution of gold in sorption systems  containing polymeric crown ethers was studied by way of the  example of model sulfuric acid solutions with a concentration of  0.5 to 9 mol/l HCl. Each model solution contained 1 x  10[.sup]-3[/] percent of each of 25 elements: Al, Au, B, Ba,  Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, In, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sb,  Sn, Sr, Ti, Zn, and Zr. Crown esters produced in the form of  granulated spherical particles with a grain size of 0.3 to 0.6  mm were studied. Both macroporous and gel-type crown ethers were  used. During the experiments, 0.1 g of polymeric crown ether was  placed in contact with 10 ml of a model solution at a  temperature of 23 +/- 1C for 48 hours. The element content  of each solution before and after sorption was determined on  AESP-1 and ISAR-61 atomic emission spectrometers by using a  specially developed method capable of detecting gold in  concentrations as low as 0.04 ml/l with an error not exceeding  10 percent. As was initially hypothesized, the overwhelming  majority of the elements included in the model sulfuric acid  solutions behaved as in processes of extraction by monomeric  crown ethers of analogous structure under comparable conditions.  The gold, however, behaved quite differently in the sorption  systems than it does during an extraction process. During the  sorption process there was a virtually quantitative extraction  of gold throughout the entire acidity range from 0.5 to 9 mol/l  HCl. Sorption of the gold peaked in the range from 1 to 3 mol/l  HCl, where the highest gold distribution coefficient  [D[.sup]Au[/]] values were observed for all of the crown  ethers tested. The gel-type crown ethers did not extract gold or  any of the other elements and were thus eliminated from further  consideration. The porous-type sorbents extracted trace  quantities of gold effectively; however, the value of  D[.sup]Au[/] was significantly dependent on both the sizes of  the macrocycle in the polymeric crown ether and the type of  attachment of the macrocycle to the polymer matrix. When the  size of the macrocycle and number of oxygen atoms was increased  in the series 18-crown-6, 21-crown-7, 24-crown-8 for one and the  same type of polymeric crown ether,  D[.sup]Au[/][.sup]max[/] decreased from 2686 for the crown  ether PDB18K6 to 2289 for PDB21K7 and 1190 for PBD24K8. All of  the specified crown ethers had nearly identical amounts of  active groupings within the confines of 2.0-2.1 mgEq/g, which  indicated that crown ethers containing derivatives of the  macrocycle 18-crown-6 as active groupings are the most effective  sorbents of gold. The selectivity of the polymeric crown ethers  tested was found to depend on both the dimensions of the  functional macrocycle and the method used to fix it in the  polymer matrix. Greater effectiveness in extracting gold (higher  values of D[.sup]Au[/]) were accompanied by decreased process  selectivity. The polycondensation-type sorbents, i.e., PDB21K7  and PDB24K8 produced by reacting crown ethers and formaldehyde,  were found to offer the best compromise between effectiveness of  extraction and selectivity in processes of sorption of gold from  0.5- to 2-mol/l solutions of HCl.

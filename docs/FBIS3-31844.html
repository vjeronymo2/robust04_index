			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique of the Press Bureau of the Romanian Intelligence </F> Service on Virgil Magureanu's presence at miners rally in Targu  Jiu released in Bucharest on 21 February; published under the  headline: "The Great Rally of the Miners in Targu Jiu. `Who Is  There? My Good People!' -- As Far As We Know, the Applause Was  Actually Booing"]    [Text] In connection with mass-media allegations about the  presence of Mr. Virgil Magureanu, director of the Romanian  Intelligence Service [SRI] in Targu Jiu -- some of which are  purely tendentious and slanderous -- the SRI Press Bureau is  authorized to release the following:    1. The SRI director's presence in Targu Jiu on the afternoon  of 18 February was exclusively linked to the activity of the  respective SRI county branch in 1993.    There is no political connotation to the meeting between the  SRI director and Mr. Miron Cosma [leader of the Mining Trade  Union Confederation of Romania]. The purpose of the meeting,  which took place at the SRI headquarters in Targu Jiu at the  latter's express request, was to brief our institution on the  actual situation in the field.    2. The SRI director's gesture of addressing himself to the  crowd of miners gathered in front of the Lignitul [Brown Coal]  Public Corporation headquarters in the town -- which many  considered "spectacular" -- was solely motivated by the desire  to diffuse the still explosive state of spirit prevalent among  many of the miners there and to assure them that the relevant  institutions will be given a correct briefing on the situation.    3. Consequently, we can see no justification to the  allegations about an so-called intervention in a labor conflict  or to those implying that one thus stood to gain some political  advantage to the detriment of others.    No promises were made aside from passing the correct  information to the relevant state authorities.    To back our position, we herewith publish the text of the  speech made by the SRI director on that occasion:    "My good people,    "I did not come here to earn some cheap popularity points.  Please listen to me, rather than applaud.    "Therefore, I beg you to listen to what I have to say,  rather  than applaud me, since, with all your problems here, one hardly  feels the need for applause.    "Second, the last thing this country needs is for people to  die and fight. This country needs honest work and the defense  of all rights, primarily yours.    "There is no need for you to fight or die to defend your  leader. Nobody is threatening him.    "We took note of the fact that there are many irregularities  pointed out by your delegation.    "We also know that a miners' delegation is now in Bucharest  explaining the situation to the people there.    "I assure you that I will report what I saw and heard here  to  the appropriate authorities, up to the highest level.    "It is never to late to do justice, if this is what the  people want.    "Nobody stands to gain anything if they are trying to obtain  by force what they can very well obtain through legal means.    "You have sent your leaders to talk to us and to all those  with a say in resolving the situation. Now, you must be patient  for two or three days.    "One needs these few days of respite, if we are to establish  the guilt and responsibility of various people. Nothing can be  done overnight."    The SRI Press Bureau can make the video recording of the  speech available to any interested party.    The SRI Press Bureau.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lou Wanghao (2869 2598 4110): "Without Unity </F> There Cannot Be Economic Development"]    [Text] While deliberating a government work report at the  second plenary session of the eighth Xinjiang Autonomous Region  people's congress, Uighur and Hasake national minority  representatives who came from northwest of Tianshan discussed  the matter of unity which is of concern to people of each  national minority. They said there is no econmic development  without unity. There is no stability without unity. Unity is  the top concern of each of our national minorities.    The Uighur people's congress representative, mayor of Kashen  City Ablat Mehmetjou, said that Xinjiang's development is  inexplicably tied to the assistance of the Han nationality and  other national minorities. The facts of Kashen's economic and  cultural development fully prove the veracity of "two  inseparables." Without the help of the Han nationality, there  could not have been Kashen's present prosperity and flourishing  state. From a historical perspective, the development of  national minorities is inseparable from the help of the Han  nationality; we especially need the aid of the Han in science  and technology. Today in economic development work, we need the  Han nationality's help even more. We hope and welcome even more  Han comrades to come and work in Kashen.    Representatives of the Hasake nationality, Hadir, deputy  secretary of the Aqintai area, and Kabul, chairman of the  agriculture and animal husbandry committee of the Xinjiang  autonomous region people's congress standing committee, should  love and protect unity just as they love and protect their  sight. Our national minorities' economic and cultural  development can only be promoted if there is unity. For many  years now the Aqintai area consistently has put unity work in  first place. Our six counties and one city have become advanced  model units of national minority unity, thus the entire area's  economy and culture have swiftly developed and the people's  livelihood has been rather greatly improved.    Maizuremu Yusupu [6314 4371 3583 2606 3768 4790 3940],  people's congress representative of the Uzbek nationality, and  Kamil Kurmaif, people's congress representative of the Tatar  nationality, said that the key to improving the quality of the  national minorities lies in improving their cultural education  work. Considering our minorities, we fully appreciate cultural  education. Many Uzbek and Tatar national minorities hope to  engage in education work and thus the proportion of college  students exceeds that of other minorities. We hope the  government will energetically stress national minority general  education work. Xinjiang's economic growth will have a solid  foundation only if Xinjiang's various minorities are well  educated.    Imam Haiguoen [3189 0948 1869], of Dayou village, Jimusaer  [0679 2606 5646 1422] county mosque, a Muslim people's congress  representative, said religious people must take the lead in  being models of national minority unity. They should actively  coordinate with the Party and the government to do a good job of  nationality unity. Unity is a large framework that none can  destroy. National minorities can truly attain development only  in unity. I believe that Imam played an important role in  national minority unity work.</p>

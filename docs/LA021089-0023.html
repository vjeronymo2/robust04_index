			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEAGUE TOURNAMENTS TO SETTLE OUTCOME OF RACES IN WRESTLING  </P> <P> The regular season winds down for Valley-area wrestling teams in the Southern  Section on Saturday when the Marmonte, San Fernando Valley, Frontier, Del Rey  and Channel leagues hold their league tournaments.  </P> <P> The league championships are decided by a combination of tournament results,  which account for half, and league dual meet standings.  </P> <P> A league-by-league analysis:  </P> <P> MARMONTE LEAGUE  </P> <P> Westlake High clinched the league title with a victory over Camarillo on  Wednesday and will be the favorite in the tournament at Camarillo.  </P> <P> Billy Hunter and Neil Mason, a transfer from Agoura, lead the Warriors in the  175- and 145-pound classes, respectively.  </P> <P> Farzin Daneshnia (112), Brad Miya (119), Shawn Valance (138), Darrell Valance  (165) and Dave Schumm (191) also could contend for league titles.  </P> <P> Newbury Park is the only league team to beat Westlake.  </P> <P> The Panthers boast Chris Kilbane, the defending 4-A Division champion at 145  pounds who is 34-0 at 154 pounds this season. Kevin Mabry (105) and Jeff Jay  (heavyweight) also will be forces.  </P> <P> Perennial power Channel Islands has a team that offers such contenders as T. R.  Merickel (98), Val Barajas (105), Chris Corpuz (112), M. T. Merickel (132) and  Chris Whitmore (191).  </P> <P> Others who could make an impact include Robin Song (105), William Cardinos  (126), Bryan Ha (138) and Charlie Verhoven (154) of Simi Valley; Jim James  (119) and Zach Achen (165) of Camarillo; and Sean Toner (165) of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "Westlake has the best chance," Newbury Park Coach Marty Maciel said. "They  have a real good tournament team."  </P> <P> SAN FERNANDO VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Harvard finished 4-0 in league dual meets and will be the team to beat Saturday  at Chaminade.  </P> <P> "We have at least one good wrestler in every weight class," Harvard Coach Lew  Roberts said. "I'd like to see a lot of champions, but I feel it will be very  close."  </P> <P> At 126 pounds for the Saracens, senior John Lee was undefeated in league  matches and 21-3 overall. Robert Rhodes (18-0 at 154), Kevin Newman (28-3 at  175) and Rick Farrell (15-6 at 191) are keys to Harvard's title hopes.  </P> <P> Rhodes and Newman probably will face Chaminade wrestlers who have beaten them  in the past. Justin Stark beat Newman last season and Felix Goodson twice  defeated Rhodes last year.  </P> <P> Alemany features Marc Brazo (145) and defending league champions Chris Carmona  (119) and Adam Wardlow (132).  </P> <P> FRONTIER LEAGUE  </P> <P> In one year, Fillmore went from a winless league season to a dual-meet league  championship. The likes of Jaime Valdez (heavyweight) and Jeremy Hernandez  (112) make the Flashes a good bet to also win the tournament, which will be at  Santa Paula.  </P> <P> Paul Gutierrez (126) leads Moorpark, and Steve Baer (105), Mike Matthes  (heavyweight), Brian Bengelsdorf (138) and Adam Kuklin (126) could make  contenders of a young Agoura team.  </P> <P> CHANNEL LEAGUE  </P> <P> Rio Mesa has perhaps its best shot ever at dethroning Dos Pueblos, which has  won or shared 13 consecutive league championships.  </P> <P> Robby Cook (132), Wyatt Anderson (145) and Tony Flores (191) are among the  Spartans' outstanding wrestlers.  </P> <P> DEL REY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Fourth-place Crespi hopes to upset Bishop Amat, which was undefeated in league  dual meets.  </P></p>

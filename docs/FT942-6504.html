			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Bringing China into the Gatt By ending the link between China's human rights behaviour and its receipt of most-favoured nation trading status, President Clinton has opened the way for a more fruitful relationship between Washington and Beijing, as well as between the west and Asia. With the MFN ritual now apparently abandoned, all sides must work to make China a full, open and fair player in world affairs. The framework for this participation will be set by the terms of its entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Mr Clinton's decision was correct. It is not that trade sanctions are necessarily inappropriate for human rights abuses. On the contrary, it is reasonable to appraise the use to which countries are putting trade privileges, as well as considerable flows of foreign money in export proceeds, loans and investments. But each case is different. For China, the influx of foreign capital and ideas is a force for good. Helping to support reforms which have brought greater prosperity and economic choice to most Chinese, it is their best hope for obtaining wider freedom by orderly means. Isolation of China through MFN withdrawal would have been a severe blow to reform. Those are the principles. But of course pragmatism also played a large role in Mr Clinton's embarrassing climbdown from the human rights conditions which he set a year ago for MFN renewal. The threat was too blunt and too self-damaging a weapon to be effective, imposing as it did a timetable that was not likely to win the co-operation of those in Beijing who were supposed to meet it. Economic dynamism Had MFN been withdrawn, American companies would have lost out to their international competitors in terms of investments, markets and broad strategies in the region. The resulting deterioration of Sino-American relations would also have weakened US efforts to forge greater trans-Pacific co-operation, since most of Asia would have sided with China. Rather than creating friction, the aim must be to build relationships which recognise the extraordinary economic dynamism of Asia, and to do whatever is possible to ensure that it develops in partnership with, rather than in opposition to, the west. The west needs China to play a full role in international affairs, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council with an influential role among developing countries. With its economy and trade growing so fast, China must also be an open and fair trader. Fragile relationship So the initial foundation of China's enhanced role in the world will be the protocol covering its accession into Gatt or the successor World Trade Organisation. Gatt entry will serve another important purpose, since China's participation in the world economy will be based on a contract with all trading partners. The excessive burden currently placed on an evidently fragile Sino-American relationship will be reduced. It will be a tall order to agree China's accession to Gatt this year, before the WTO takes over. Though investigations have been under way for seven years, the Gatt working party is still concerned to understand exactly how the Chinese economy works. Negotiators need to be sure that China's trade policies are fair and uniform - difficult when there are so many special zones offering different incentives - and that the operation of state-owned enterprises is open, particularly the subsidies which they receive. These issues will form the basis for other countries' ability to compete with China. China's entry needs to be treated with urgency, but not rushed through. Gatt membership leaves countries free to take action against objectionable practices such as the export of prison-produced goods. In this area in particular, governments - hitherto excessively relaxed - should stiffen their efforts to curb China's abuses. Pressure over human rights issues must form an important part of the full and broad engagement with Beijing which should follow Mr Clinton's decision. It may be more effective than a threat which has achieved the release of a few dissidents before each deadline. If the opportunities afforded by the change of US policy are seized, it will be to the benefit of the west as well as of the Chinese people as a whole.</p>

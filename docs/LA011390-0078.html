			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FERTILE IMAGINATION IS ONE THING, PICKING THE RAMS IS ANOTHER  </P> <P> All you media experts who chastised the Rams for the Eric Dickerson trade were  right on when you convinced us what a horrible deal it was. Consider:  </P> <P>  -- The Rams, without Dickerson the whiner, are in the playoffs. Again.  </P> <P>  -- The Colts, with Dickerson, are watching on the tube like the rest of us.  Again. And Eric is whining true to form once again. Football ain't so much fun  when you never get past the regular season, huh guy?  </P> <P>  -- With the exception of Gaston Green, everyone involved in the deal has  greatly contributed to the Rams' continued success and should play a big part  in their program for years to come.  </P> <P> It was a horrible deal all right. Just ask Indianapolis.  </P> <P> BRADLEY FOOS, Corona  </P></p>

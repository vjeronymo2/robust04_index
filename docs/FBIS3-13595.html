			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tunis, 16 Mar (MENA)--MENA's Tunis correspondent has  learned that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has turned down  a U.S. proposal to meet Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  in Cairo or Alexandria before the UN Security Council issues a  resolution about the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and Israel  declares that it will implement it, especially in connection  with providing security for the Palestinians in the occupied  territories and dismantling the settlements.    'Arafat also turned down a proposal by Dennis Ross, the U.S.  coordinator for the Middle East peace process, for a meeting  between Rabin [as received] and PLO Executive Committee member  Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] or another Palestinian official.  'Arafat said the PLO cannot return to the negotiations unless  its demands pertaining to international protection and the  settlements are met.    'Arafat asked Ross to provide a mechanism to implement the  Security Council resolution if it is adopted but Ross told him  Israel would never accept anything like that. 'Arafat also  requested international forces in Hebron alongside a Palestinian  force. He also demanded that the settlements in the city be  dismantled.    A senior Palestinian source revealed that Ross brought no  new U.S. proposals to his two meetings with 'Arafat in Tunis two  days ago and that he asked 'Arafat to accept the proposals  included in Warren Christopher's message dated last Thursday in  which Christopher suggested that the PLO should return to the  negotiating table with Israel so that a Security Council  resolution could be issued.    Ross insisted that 'Arafat should issue a signed acceptance  of Christopher's message so that the United States could agree  to submit the draft Security Council resolution to a vote and  not veto it. 'Arafat turned down this demand, which was viewed  as part of the U.S. pressure on the PLO.    Christopher suggested in his letter that the negotiations  between the PLO and Israel be resumed according to a timetable  beginning last Monday [14 March] with a meeting between  Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], head of the PLO Economic Department,  and Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry,  to be followed by a meeting in Washington between Abu-Mazin  [Mahmud 'Abbas] and Shim'on Peres, and finally a meeting between  'Arafat and Rabin in Cairo.    The Palestinian leadership expressed dismay at the  threatening content of Christopher's message to 'Arafat, the  call to return to the negotiating table in Washington in  response to President Clinton's invitation, and Christopher's  insistence that the PLO should make a declaration about resuming  the negotiations with Israel before a Security Council  resolution is adopted.    The Palestinian leadership also expressed dismay at  Christopher's request to 'Arafat not to make any new demands  during the negotiations and not to allow any other party,  "meaning Russia," to intervene in the peace process either by  making proposals or submitting new initiatives.    The Palestinian leadership described the U.S. attitude as  "totally biased" toward Israel, even worse than the Israeli  attitude.    'Arafat told Ross that the negotiations could not be resumed  because of the widespread popular anger in the occupied  territories unless a Security Council resolution was adopted  providing protection for the Palestinians living under  occupation, disarming the settlers, and supplying U.S. and  Israeli guarantees for this purpose.    The Israeli delegation that met 'Arafat and included Rabin's  adviser Jacques Neriya; Uri Savir, the Israeli Foreign  Ministry's director general; and Uzi Dayan, director of planning  at the Israeli Defense Ministry submitted no new proposals or  positions.    The delegation members told 'Arafat that they were not  authorized to adopt any stance or make any proposal and that  their mission was only to listen to him and to the views of the  Palestinian leadership on how to resume the peace process.    The delegation informed 'Arafat of the Israeli Government's  decision to outlaw the extremist Kakh and Kahana Hay movements  and to disarm some settlers in settlements where extremists are  found. They also informed him of Israel's acceptance of the  deployment of unarmed international observers outside Gaza and  Jericho and its decision to expedite its withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho.    A senior Palestinian source revealed that had it not been  for  the Hebron massacre, 'Arafat and Rabin would have signed the  final agreement on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli  Declaration of Principles in Cairo on 10 March.    The source added that the Cairo and Taba negotiations on the  crossing points, the Palestinian police, and the autonomy  administration were already over and drafts of the final  agreement had been drawn up. The massacre ruined everything and  made even the Declaration of Principles subject to total failure.</p>

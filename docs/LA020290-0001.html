			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> USING HORSE SENSE;  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S MOUNTED POSSE FACTORS IN FUN WHILE PATROLLING SANTA CLARITA VALLEY  </P> <P> There's a lot of horsing around when Bob Warford, Chuck Powell and Bob Harris  get together for monthly gatherings with friends in the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> It's not that the meetings don't involve serious work. But fun is a big factor  when the group rides horseback, patrolling streets in east Newhall, keeping  motorcyclists off private ranches or ensuring that big community events don't  get out of hand.  </P> <P> They are among the 38 members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's  Mounted Posse in the Santa Clarita Valley -- one of 14 sheriff's posses in the  county. Riding their own horses, members of the posse combine a love for horses  with law enforcement. And they do it for free, said Warford, the group's  coordinator for the last 11 years.  </P> <P> "We're just a bunch of cowboys at heart," said Powell, who is a Los Angeles  County firefighter at the Sand Canyon station. "It's nice to get away from the  rat race, to go out on the horse and take it easy."  </P> <P> They go on training rides at least once a month and are called out for special  assignments an average of five or six times a year, Warford said. More than  anything else, the posse provides a highly visible law-enforcement presence  when large groups of people gather at parks and on streets for special events,  he said.  </P> <P> Half of the posse's riders are Los Angeles police officers who own horses and  live in the area, Warford said. For them, volunteering for the posse is a  refreshing break from filling out crime reports, checking for gang activity or  making drug busts. It's also an alternative to joining the Los Angeles Police  Department's own Mounted Unit, which recently stopped accepting part-time and  volunteer riders to become a full-time, professional detail.  </P> <P> Though they sometimes get grim assignments, such as looking for the remains of  lost hikers or searching for missing children, members say that most of the  time they are living it up while putting down crime from the saddle.  </P> <P> "I enjoy doing this. My other job is work," said Harris, a detective in the  Police Department's robbery and homicide division at Parker Center in downtown  Los Angeles. "It pretty much started out as a hobby with everybody. We just all  enjoy it."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Officer Jean Posner, a horse lover since she was 3, said she  thought about joining her department's Mounted Unit but was concerned that she  might not qualify because of on-the-job injuries she suffered several years  ago. So she joined the sheriff's posse, which she said is not only easier on  her but also is better for her horse.  </P> <P> "Sometimes in riots in L.A., my friends have had horses slashed by razor blades  or hit in the head with bottles," said Posner, who patrols low-income housing  projects in the Police Department's northeast valley Foothill Division. In the  Santa Clarita Valley, she said, "the heavy-duty stuff is only in Newhall, off  Market Street and San Fernando Road, with people drinking in public."  </P> <P> Of those posse members who aren't Los Angeles police officers, most are Level 2  sheriff's reservists, meaning they have had 13 weeks of Police Academy training  and are permitted to carry a service revolver on patrol, as long as they are  under the direct supervision of a full-time deputy, Warford said. All posse  members must complete a 40-hour horseback training course before joining the  unit.  </P> <P> Among the posse's assignments last year was the search in March for 7-year-old  Sara Nan Hodges, a Newhall girl whose body was later found in the bedroom of a  14-year-old neighbor, who has pleaded guilty to her murder. They also helped  authorities try to determine the location from which three horses escaped and  ran onto the Golden State Freeway in April, killing a 19-year-old motorist and  injuring another man when they collided with cars.  </P> <P> Reservist Rita Vanatter, a school nurse for the Westside Union School District  in the Antelope Valley, said the most gratifying part of being on the posse is  the attention the horses get from children.  </P> <P> "They just want to touch your horse," she said. "It's like the highlight of  their lives."  </P> <P> Indeed, many posse members say, enforcing the law from the back of a horse is  kinder and gentler than doing it from a black-and-white patrol car or a  motorcycle.  </P> <P> When two park rangers were surrounded by a group of angry, intoxicated men last  year at the Castaic Lake State Recreation Area, the presence of mounted  deputies had an instant calming effect when the men saw their children's  fascination with the horses, a posse member said.  </P> <P> "The kids see the horses, and the parents see the kids are happy," he said. "It  calms everybody down."  </P> <P> As far as major crime goes, posse members don't see much of that, and neither  do they really want to, Warford said.  </P> <P> "We really haven't had exciting shoot-'em-up type things," he said. "It seems  routine, but it's a chance to get out into the open and ride our horses."  </P></p>

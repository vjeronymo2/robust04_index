			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Split in right eases threat of S Africa poll boycott: Popular Afrikaner leader to head moderate party The threat of a widespread boycott of April's all-race elections in South Africa was significantly lessened at the weekend after a split in the rightwing Freedom Alliance. The split was provoked by the crisis in the black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana, where a Pretoria-appointed administrator yesterday took over from ousted President Lucas Mangope. General Constand Viljoen, probably the most popular leader of right-wing Afrikaners, said at the weekend he was resigning from the umbrella right-wing group, the Afrikaner Volksfront, to lead a new moderate Afrikaner party into the poll. The party, the Freedom Front, will field candidates including members of the moderate wing of the divided ultra-right Conservative party. Mr Ferdie Hartzenberg, CP leader, and hardline Conservative members of the old white parliament still support a boycott. Gen Viljoen's move marked a split with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), whose members were involved in gun battles on Friday in the streets of Bophuthatswana's twin capitals, Mmabatho and Mafikeng, in which several blacks and right wing whites were killed. There was some confusion last night over whether Gen Viljoen might yet back out of participating in the election. But the split with the AWB appeared to be permanent. As a result the paramilitary movement is isolated. Gen Viljoen's powerful ally in the Freedom Alliance, the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, said at the weekend it would not participate in elections. However Inkatha's chief negotiator, Mr Frank Mdlalose, appeared to leave a door open to participation when he said international mediation - the subject of talks with the African National Congress, likely winner of the election - might yield a positive result. Gen Viljoen was due to meet Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha leader, today for discussions. Although Inkatha failed to register a list of candidates by the deadline last Friday, technically disqualifying it from participating in the April poll, officials of the ANC said they would remove such obstacles to Inkatha's participation provided a settlement of the country's constitutional disputes was reached. The third member of the Freedom Alliance, the government of Bophuthatswana, in effect ceased to exist at the weekend when a South African administrator, Mr Tjaart van der Walt, took over from Mr Mangope, who was ousted by a combination of popular protest, a civil servants' strike, a security force mutiny and the intervention of South African troops on Friday night. Four people died in fighting near Durban yesterday after thousands of Inkatha supporters blocked ANC rivals from holding a rally, state-run radio reported. Shocked, shaken but surviving, Page 14</p>

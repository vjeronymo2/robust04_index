			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Letter: Gains may be costs Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, January 28) suggests an exercise for to 'some economic modeller (not for the busy executive)'. As a not-so-busy student at the London School of Economics, I believe his question should be re-phrased. He suggests weighing up the gains from the boost to output provided by a larger budget deficit in a recession and the costs of a higher debt burden to future generations. But what if the gains are in fact costs? The unprecedented slide from fiscal virtue to fiscal debauchery of about 6 per cent of GDP in two years has been accompanied by prolonged recession and high long-term interest rates (which cripple the investment needed for future growth). In contrast, the fiscal tightening of a similar size in 1981 produced rapid growth and falling interest rates. Mr Brittan seems harnessed to the failed pseudo-Keynesian ideas of the past. Britain can only gain from cuts in profligate current expenditure which is undermining confidence and hampering present and future growth. Philippe Legrain, 88 Lansdowne Road, London W11 2LS</p>

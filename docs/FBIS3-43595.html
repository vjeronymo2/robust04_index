			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The deliberations of the National Convention of  Forces of Change [CNFC]'s general assembly, which began  yesterday morning, ended at the Institute for Social, Economic,  and Civil Training in Cotonou. Participants adopted two reports:  one on the organization of the next elections and the other on  the moralization of public life. The general assembly made a  series of recommendations concerning these elections in order to  ensure their openness and democratic character. It urged  political parties to thoroughly examine the possibility of  creating a national and independent electoral commission. This  commission will be charged with organizing, handling, and  controlling the elections. The general assembly also proposed  that the maximum number of voters for each polling station be  500 in order to facilitate the counting of votes on the spot  with immediate exhibition of the results under the supervision  of the local electoral commissions.    As for the moralization of public life, the convention  deplored the fact many commissions have been set up - one after  the other - to almost no avail since the period preceding the  national conference up to now. According to the parties of the  convention, the moralization should be carried out at various  levels, first of all in the public finance sector which needs  reorganization, openness, and control. The second level is the  ruling class, whose will to serve should prevail over the spirit  of enjoyment. As for civil servants, a change in their daily  behavior is imperative, and it is a duty for businessmen to  clear their debt with the banks. The moralization at the level  of the mass media means that an end should be put to the use of  the state media houses for the cult of personality, as is the  case at the national television now, the convention stressed.    In his closing speech, Idelphonse Lemon, current chairman of  the convention, was obviously satisfied with the general  assembly's recommendations. This satisfaction made him say that  the guards of the democracy temple in Benin have gathered within  the CNFC, which is good for the Republic. Let us listen to him:    [Begin Lemon recording] The Republic will always survive,  but in an improved environment, where on the authorities' side,  the will to serve will prevail over the spirit of enjoyment,  where the fruit of growth will be fairly distributed, where the  zone of poverty will be gradually cleared, and where the birds  of darkness will be prevented from flying. Long live the  Republic! Long live the opposition! [end recording]</p>

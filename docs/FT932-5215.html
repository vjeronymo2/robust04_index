			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities fall in wake of rising gold prices Wall Street US STOCKS fell in subdued trading yesterday in the wake of a rally in gold prices and some disappointing news on the jobs market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.58 at 3,544.87. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.10 lower at 452.75, while the Amex composite finished up 0.94 at 440.91, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.36 at 706.22. Trading volume on the NYSE was 280m shares. Rising gold prices took their toll on equities right from the opening. The price of August gold contracts jumped Dollars 5.40 to Dollars 376.30, an indication that some investors continue to fear a revival in inflation. Concern about the employment situation also hurt stocks after the Labor department reported that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance rose 5,000 last week, to 344,000. The figures indicate that today's May employment report could reveal that the labour market remains depressed, in spite of the growing economy. Wall Street analysts are predicting that today's report will show a rise of about 50,000 in non-farm payrolls, and national unemployment still stuck at 7 per cent. One of the more eye-catching of new issues in recent months - the sale by Sears, Roebuck of 20 per cent of its stake in Allstate, the insurance company - was in strong demand. In the largest ever initial public offering by a US company, 78.5m shares in AllState were issued at Dollars 27 a share on Wednesday night. By the close yesterday, the stock was trading at Dollars 29 3/8 in volume of 26m shares. Federal Express fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 after broking house Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette lowered its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'moderately attractive' in the wake of recent managerial resignations. Computer stocks were mixed. While Hewlett-Packard gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 86 3/4 and Compaq put on Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 61 1/8 , Digital Equipment fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 7/8 and Tandem Computer slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 13. Both Digital and Tandem were hit by ratings downgrades by securities house Salomon Brothers. Fieldcrest Cannon climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 5/8 on the news that it is selling its carpet and rug operations to Mohawk Industries in a deal valued at Dollars 140m. Canada TORONTO closed higher in busy trading, as a surge in world gold prices sent gold-related stocks higher and helped boost the overall market. The TSE 300 composite index rose 15.19 points, or 0.39%, to close at 3875.01. Consumer products posted the day's biggest decline, off 1.6%, as Seagram, the group's biggest stock, fell 1 1/4 to 34 1/8 . The company yesterday reported a small improvement in first-quarter earnings, but said interest expenses for its recent investment in Time-Warner Inc. would eat into cash flow.</p>

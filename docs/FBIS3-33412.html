			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning from Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] On Tuesday at the cathedral of San Cristobal de las  Casas, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and members of  the Zapatist National Liberation Front [EZLN] continued their  negotiations behind closed doors. The dialogue is moving forward  and the prospects for resolving the conflict are good.    At a news conference, San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz  announced the EZLN had presented its list of demands to the  federal government's representative, who in turn provided broad  answers. Ruiz, however, did not disclose any of the EZLN's  specific requests.    Meanwhile, Subcommander Marcos explained the reasons for his  struggle. He criticized society for having forgotten the Indian  community and asked society to remain at the EZLN's side.    When his turn came to speak, Commissioner Camacho said the  only way to resolve Chiapas' problems is by strengthening the  Republic's institutions. He pointed out that a peaceful solution  for Chiapas will be found in new answers for the state, not only  for the EZLN but for society as a whole.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Several sources close to Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa have disclosed that the prime minister, who has just  returned from his visit to the United States, decided on 13  February to embark on a reshuffle of his cabinet as early as  immediately after the government draft for the fiscal year 1994  budget is decided upon on 15 February, to enable his cabinet to  steer through the regular Diet session, and to deal with the  pending deliberations on the revenue sources to cover the income  tax cut, and other issues. It is said that the prime minister  is thinking of replacing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura (head of Sakigake [Harbinger]), and State Minister for  Political Reform Sadao Yamahana and other Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] cabinet members, while maintaining the  existing framework of the ruling coalition parties. He will now  have to obtain the consent of the ruling coalition parties.    The main reason for the prime minister's decision to  reshuffle the cabinet is his belief that differences of views  within the cabinet have become an obstacle to the management of  the administration, as seen in the decision-making process  leading to the announcement of the "national welfare tax"  scheme, wherein criticisms from the people made Hosokawa unable  to decide on revenue sources to cover the 6-trillion-yen income  tax cut, thus forcing him to leave the issue to further  discussions by the ruling coalition parties. The opposition  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is certain to pursue this point  during Diet deliberations on the third supplementary budget  beginning on 16 February. Hosokawa thus came to the conclusion  that a reorganization of the cabinet would be indispensable.    Furthermore, Hosokawa seems to believe that in view of the  tasks facing the administration, such as early formulation of  measures to reduce the trade surplus -- which he pledged at the  Japan-U.S. summit talks -- and the delineation of new electoral  districts with the introduction of the new electoral system  incorporating both single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation, and since these issues bear directly on the  realignment of the political world -- which has become highly  probable with the passage of the political reform laws -- it is  necessary to shake up his administration in preparation for  political realignment.    Due to such thinking on the part of the prime minister, the  focus of the reshuffle is likely to be on what will happen to  Takemura, who has been reported to be in conflict with Ichiro  Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. It  seems that either he will be given a different portfolio in the  cabinet, or another Sakigake member will be chosen to replace  him.    It is also believed that since policy differences with the  SDPJ have been complicating the decisionmaking process among the  ruling coalition parties -- for instance, the SDPJ's dissent  during the deliberations on tax reforms -- Yamahana and the five  other SDPJ cabinet members may be replaced with other SDPJ  members to strengthen support for the Hosokawa administration.    However, it is highly possible that Sakigake and the SDPJ's  left wing will come out strongly against the prime minister's  reshuffle plan. It is still somehow uncertain whether the prime  minister will be able to carry out the reshuffle as planned.</p>

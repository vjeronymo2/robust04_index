			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Markets Report: German rate gloom Pessimism over the outlook for German interest rates dominated markets again yesterday following further cautionary comments from the Bundesbank, writes Philip Gawith. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, was quoted as saying in Helsinki: 'We are not following a step-by-step cut in interest rates for the time being.' This followed various comments last week suggesting a slowing in the pace of German monetary easing. The December euromark contract finished yesterday at 94.68, 21 basis points below the Friday close, and 44 basis points down over the last two trading days. The trend in the futures market was at odds with the cash market, where call money rates still favour a substantial lowering of the repo rate. This led some observers to speculate that the Bundesbank might slow the pace of monetary easing by announcing a fixed rate repo, possibly as early as today. Trading on the foreign exchanges was generally fairly quiet, with most European markets closed for a holiday. The D-Mark was stronger against the yen and the Italian lira. The Bank of Israel said it would raise short term rates by 0.5 per cent on Thursday, with the rate on the daily monetary tender rising to a minimum 10.8 per cent. The bearish tone to futures markets forced some market participants to reconsider their view that the market had turned a corner last week, and entered a more bullish phase. But analysts said the market had overreacted to Mr Tietmeyer's comments, which were seen as no more than a repetition of what he had said last week. Business was fairly quiet until his comments provoked a flurry of activity, with the December contract ending up trading more than 69,000 lots. Euromark futures are currently pricing in a rise in interest rates by June and September. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO, described these rates as 'completely crazy'. He said he was 'not prepared to see this as a fundamental move.' Although economists have been revising up their forecasts for German growth, Mr Norfield said these remained modest and were not an argument against further interest rate cuts. The sharp movement in the futures market has not been mirrored in the cash markets, with overnight money currently trading at 5.0/5.12 per cent. This creates a policy dilemma for the Bundesbank, because these rates are well below the current repo rate, of 5.23 per cent, and this would normally favour another substantial fall in the repo rate. Were this to happen, however, the Bundesbank could be forced to lower official rates again quite soon, contrary to what Mr Tietmeyer has been saying. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, argues that the solution to this conundrum may lie in the Bundesbank returning to fixed rate repos as a method of slowing the fall in interest rates. Gloom in the euromark contracts spilled over into short sterling, where the December future lost 8 basis points to close at 93.99. Volumes were light. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England supplied late assistance of Pounds 125m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 750m. Earlier it had provided Pounds 616m of liquidity to the system. Overnight rates moved from 4 to 5 3/4 per cent. Sterling showed little response to the better than expected April non-EU trade deficit. It closed at DM2.4789 against the D-Mark, from DM2.4856. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5064 from Dollars 1.5098. The dollar had another uneasy day, with Mr Tietmeyer's comments doing no favours for the US currency. It closed in London at DM1.6456, from DM1.6463, against the D-Mark, and Y104.400 against the yen, from Y103.910. Mr Tim Yetman, head of proprietary trading at Natwest Markets, said the dollar continued to trade very softly. 'If this is a rally, it is not very impressive,' he noted. With investors increasingly wary about the outlook for US asset markets, Mr Yetman said it was difficult to see why people would buy more dollars. The dollar could weaken further today if the German April M3 number is a poor one. This would bolster arguments for a slower pace of easing, and lend support to the D-Mark. The D-Mark continued its recent rally against the yen, closing at Y63.45 compared to Y62 on May 18. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said the markets seemed to be responding to the threat of another election in Japan, and the possibility of a trade agreement with the US. He said investors were fearful to sell the yen against the dollar, but were positive about the outlook for the D-Mark, with German interest rates seen to be close to the bottom. The lira also slipped yesterday, to close at L966.1 from L959.4 on Friday. Analysts said the poor performance recently of the bond and equity markets had encouraged investors to take profits.</p>

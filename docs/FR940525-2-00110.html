			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed extension of time for preparing and forwarding NSARC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting minutes would not affect safe operation of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Significant safety concerns or unreviewed safety questions would still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be brought to the attention of the Senior Vice President without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiting for the release of the NSARC meeting minutes. The change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not impede in any manner prompt communication of significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns to the Senior Vice President.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operated and do not change any facility design feature or equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes involve administrative or programmatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements or merely involve editorial changes, corrections, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifications. Since there is no change to the facility or operating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, there is no effect upon the probability or consequences of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any accident previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50.92(c)(2)) because they do not affect the manner by which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is operated and do not change any facility design feature or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment which affects the operational characteristics of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. The proposed changes involve administrative or programmatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements or merely involve editorial changes, corrections, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed changes do not affect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manner by which the facility is operated or involve equipment or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> features which affect the operational characteristics of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Exeter Public Library, 47 Front  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Street, Exeter, New Hampshire 03833.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas Dignan, Esquire, Ropes &amp; Gray, One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110&hyph;2624.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NRC Project Director:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> John F. Stolz.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Northeast Nuclear Energy Company, et al., Docket No. 50&hyph;423, Millstone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 3, New London County, Connecticut  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Date of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> February 10, 1992, as supplemented April 14,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of amendment request:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed amendment would remove two tables from the Technical Specifications (TS) which list reactor trip system (RTS) instrumentation response times and engineered safety features actuation system (ESFAS) instrumentation response times. These tables will be placed in the Millstone 3 Technical Requirements Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes would not: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes to remove the RTS and ESFAS response times from the Technical Specifications will not affect the operation of the RTS and ESFAS. Operability and surveillance requirements are still maintained in the Technical Specifications and the response times will be included and maintained in the plant operating procedures. A safety evaluation and PORC [Plant Operations Review Committee] review will be required for the limits to be changed. Since the systems will not be affected by the proposed changes, there is no impact on the performance of these systems or the consequences of an accident previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

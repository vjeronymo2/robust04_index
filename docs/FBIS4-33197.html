			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Paid Publicity" by the Permanent Commissions of </F> Representatives of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico (Comisiones  Permanentes de Representatives de Refugiados Guatemaltecos en  Mexico--CCPP) issued in May 1994 in Guatemala City]    [Text] The CCPP, in view of the government's  noncompliance with the agreements signed on 8 October 1992,  which permit the voluntary and dignified return of our brothers,  would like to inform national and international public opinion:    First:    That we announce the return of our brother refugees from  Mexico to the farm La Quetzal, La Libertad Muncipality, Peten  Department, will take place on 27 June, according to the  government and CCPP agreement.    In view of the government's lack of respect and  irresponsibility in connection with the signed agreements, we  hold the government responsible for any attack or incident  against the personal safety of those returning as well as  against those who offer their solidarity by accompanying them.    Second:    That the CCPP, always respecting what has been agreed,  presented to the CEAR [Special Commission for Assistance to  Repatriated People] on 14 April a plan of operation for the  return of the refugees, thus complying with the agreements in  which it is stated the refugees may return 60 days after the  plan is presented, meaning in our case the return to Guatemala  can legally take place after 15 June.    Third:    That one of the seven agreements dated 8 October establishes  that the refugees may decide how, when, and where they will  return. We have decided to return to El Peten, specifically to  the farm "La Quetzal," which is private property, and an  agreement has already been reached for its purchase from current  owners.    To this avail CONAP [National Council for Publicity] has  issued an opinion that at least 20 percent of this farm may be  used for settling. Nevertheless, afterward, and to block our  return, CONAP contradicted itself and has said it is illegal to  settle in "El Quetzal," because it is a part of the Maya  Environ. CONAP has always opposed our return, despite the fact  they and several institutions have made studies indicating only  80 percent of the farm lies within the environ and the number of  families that will settle will not endanger forest conservation  or the environment.    Fourth:    We call on the national and international community to speak  up regarding this situation and demand the Guatemalan Government  comply with the agreements signed on 8 October 1992, without  further delays or pretexts.    Fifth:    We ask the verification board to issue the report requested  on 24 March 1994.    Sixth:    Last, we summon the accompanying forum [foro de  acompanamiento] to establish a permanent assembly to accompany  the movement's return to El Peten, which, we repeat, will take  place on 27 June.    [Issued] Guatemala City    [Dated] May 1994.    The return is a right of all Guatemalans, and it is  essential  to the national process of reconciliation.    Return is struggle, not resignation    Permanent Commissions of Representatives of Guatemalan  Refugees in Mexico, CCPP</p>

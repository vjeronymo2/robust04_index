			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Derivative products help to cap gold price rises - The impact of an ever widening range of derivative products on the global market AN EVER widening range of derivative products brought an estimated 86 tonnes of gold on to the market last year, the Financial Times World Gold Conference in Istanbul was told yesterday. While not a huge amount, this was sufficient to cap any price rallies, especially in the short term, said Ms Jessica Jacks, an economist with RTZ. The figure would have been much higher if new business from options and other derivatives had not been offset by a reduction of almost 115 tonnes in outstanding gold loans. At the end of last year the total amount of gold associated with outstanding producer derivatives was 1,215 tonnes, up from 1,130 tonnes in 1991, Ms Jacks estimated. Options increased from 203.5 tonnes in 1991 to 282.4 tonnes last year, while other derivatives increased by 156 tonnes in the same period. At the same time forward sales fell from just over 280 tonnes to 244.9 tonnes. Average realised prices hedged for this year were Dollars 385 a troy ounce for Australian producers and Dollars 370 for North American producers. 'Bear in mind that at the end of 1991, the average weighted hedged prices well exceeded Dollars 400 in both Australia and North America,' Ms Jacks said. 'Throughout 1992, therefore, the producers accepted lower and lower hedged prices.' If the gold price were to rally and stabilise around Dollars 420, 'a number of mining companies could begin to feel a little less than happy with their hedged positions,' said Ms Jacks. A survey of mining companies showed that for a large majority the percentage of their production already hedged and their planned output were the main determinants in their decision making. 'The dollar price and local price of gold surprisingly ranked only third,' she said. Most mining companies said they would be prepared to buy back their forward sales, although most did not consider they were over-hedged. Many had been offered exotic options, but relatively few made use of them because they did not fully understand the principles and pricing mechanisms of the instruments. She said creators of exotic options should be wary of over-complicating the product or the way it was presented. The past 18 months had also seen the emergence of between 10 and 20 central banks as option granters, Ms Jacks said. By writing call options, they earned a premium, giving some return on their gold reserves. About 466 tonnes of gold was thought to be involved. It was impossible to predict what sort of 'weird and wonderful' instruments would emerge in the future, Ms Jacks said. 'For each price profile, thrre is considerable latitude for highly complex products, each with a specific application and target market. Declining prices or sharply increasing prices lend themselves to a derivative of some description.' Mr Ian MacDonald, precious metals marketing manager at Credit Suisse, told the conference the availability of over-the-counter options and derivatives had revolutionised the gold market. A typical trader would no longer say his biggest client was a central bank or mining house - but the options department of his own company. He described the main effects of the derivatives on the gold market as: The prolongation of existing market trends, or the acceleration of new trends. Increased trading in gold, rather than holding it as a long term asset. Increased sophistication of market operators - including banks, mines, central banks, investors, institutions and hedge funds. The setting up of hedging and speculative positions for small capital outlay. Turning to the recent gold rally, Mr MacDonald said the markets had a habit of going after volume. The largest volume in the option book had been the Dollars 400 and Dollars 450 strikes, he said. 'Therefore it is highly likely that at some point a move over Dollars 400 is to be expected because of the sheer volume of calls that have been written.' Mr Frank Veneroso, a partner in Omega Advisors, suggested that the widening gap between supply and demand could force the price sharply perhaps to Dollars 1,000 a troy ounce in the next five years. The supply over five years from world mines and scrap might be expected to expand by 10 per cent to perhaps 3,000 tonnes a year. But demand excluding Western investment would grow by 6 to 7 per cent each year to almost 5,000 tonnes a year. Such a gap would lead to a real price of Dollars 700 at 1992 prices - or Dollars 850 after inflation of around 3 to 4 per cent a year. Market equilibrium would then take it through to 1,000 a troy ounce, he suggested.</p>

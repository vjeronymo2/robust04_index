			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paris correspondent Reali Junior] </F>   [Text] Brazil is the newest OECD member. Joining the OECD  enables Brazil to move closer to the organization that groups  together the 24 most-industrialized countries in the world. The  exchange of letters formalizing Brazil's joining of the OECD  will take place on either 16 or 17 March during the meeting to  be held between Itamaraty Secretary General Roberto Abdenur and  OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye at the Hotel de La  Muette.    Brazilian Ambassador to France Carlos Alberto Leite Barbosa  has been furthering Brazil's rapprochement with the OECD for two  years. The organization has no members from Latin America except  for Mexico, which will become the 25th member of OECD as of June  under the aegis of the United States and Canada. The first  stage to be completed in order to achieve full-member status is  to sit on the Development Assistance Committee. Brazil will sit  there next to countries like Argentina and the ROK.    The OECD is a sort of exclusive club, whose members are the  richest countries in the world, that promotes greater  cooperation and a broad exchange of information on economic and  development matters. The center was created by an OECD council  decision. Its mission is to embark on research on international  economic relations, suggest solutions to overcome problems  identified in research, and establish a dialogue with developed  countries. Members are Germany, Australia, Austria, Belgium,  Canada, Denmark, Spain, the United States, Finland, France,  Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands, Iceland, Ireland, Italy,  Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden,  Switzerland, and Turkey.  <H5>  Seminar </H5>   The first consequence of Brazilian participation will be the  OECD's organization of an international seminar on privatization  at the Hotel Mofarrej in Sao Paulo during April. The most  important members, with some experience in privatizations, will  attend the seminar. At the same time, Ambassador Rubens Barbosa  is coordinating a seminar on the privatization process in Brazil  in London next week with the participation of Brazilian  economists, Persio Arida among them.</p>

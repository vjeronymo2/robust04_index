			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Letter: Competition in the CD market Sir, The letters you published on May 10 uniformly attacked the idea of an inquiry into CD pricing. As a consumer who would willingly buy more CDs if the prices were lower, I was surprised at the lack of objectivity in the arguments. The price of a top-class classical CD is now Pounds 14.99 in the UK, having risen in the last few years from the price quoted by Mr Perry of Pounds 11.99. Perhaps he is not a fan of Nigel Kennedy or Herbert van Karajan. The US price for the exact same items, which I verified through a computer on-line shopping mall offering these items in the US, was Dollars 13.99, which equates to about Pounds 9.15. This is, contrary to Mr Deacon's comment, 40 per cent lower, not 10 to 15 per cent. Finally, Ms Gordon's fears of illicit imports and inconsistencies in different markets would create no new problems than already exist for other imported goods. There may indeed be problems for the distributors if changes occur but the discrepancies in pricing compared with the US are there for all to see, and without legally created barriers to import competition I doubt that these market imperfections could survive.

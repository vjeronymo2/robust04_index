			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: 'Knockout blow' by Carsberg welcomed SIR Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, has delivered 'a knockout blow for the consumer', the Consumers' Association said yesterday. Accountants and advisers agreed that the disclosure of surrender values in the late years of policies, and the use of company charges in illustrations, would greatly help consumers. Surrender values in the first five years of a life policy are usually lower than the amount of premiums paid because administration and sales costs are extracted at the start of the policy. However, figures in the table provided by the OFT show that values on offer after 20 years on a 25-year policy are on average 57 per cent lower than if the policy were held until maturity - although 80 per cent of the premiums have already been paid. The OFT figures, which show the best and worst results for the 20 largest UK life companies, show that this reduction varies from 47.1 per cent to 70.3 per cent. The report's proposals on charges and illustrations have also been welcomed. Under the present regime, companies must publish their 'reduction in yield' (RIY), showing the number of percentage points knocked off a given projected investment yield for charges, but cannot use it as a basis for projections. Instead they use a standard figure set by Lautro. Figures produced by Money Management, a Financial Times publication, show that, assuming monthly premiums of Pounds 200 into a 25-year personal pension and an annual return of 13 per cent, the impact of charges on the projected final fund would vary from 8.5 per cent for the best company to 42.6 per cent (Pounds 169,989) for the worst.</p>

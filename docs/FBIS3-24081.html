			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Popov, senior instructor of the Technical </F> University, candidate for City Assembly deputy: "You Fail,  Gentlemen!"]    [Text] The mayoralty could not find anything better to do  than to read on the radio to the entire city the data on each  candidate to the City Assembly. There are a lot of  candidates--750, and not much air time. So they give us less  than a minute to get acquainted with each candidate.    Can the broadcasting network made available by the radio and  television company be used more effectively? Of course it can.  And the solution is right there, on the surface. It would  suffice to broadcast in each rayon of the city only the  information on candidates going on the ballot from this rayon.  Then in Kalininskiy Rayon, for instance, you would only need to  provide information about five electoral districts rather than  50, and in Oktyabrskiy Rayon--only one. This way, air time would  be used 10 times more effectively in Kalininskiy Rayon and 50  times more effectively in Oktyabrskiy Rayon!    Is there, though, the technical capability to simultaneously  broadcast different programs in different rayons of St.  Petersburg? Yes, there is. In a number of rayons such  "rayon-wide" broadcasting has been the practice once or twice a  week for quite a while. And nothing prevented the mayoralty from  organizing such rayon-targeted election broadcasts.    I think that in this rather simple matter the mayoralty uses  the resources made available by the radio and television company  (that is, in the final analysis, the taxpayers money) with a  utilization coefficient of between 2 and 10 percent.    In any case, I usually fail my students who show this sort  of  productivity.</p>

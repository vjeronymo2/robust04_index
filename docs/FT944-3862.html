			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Arts: Prima donna past her prime What do we do with the ageing prima donna? Do we allow fond memories of her heyday to cushion her decline - or do we politely suggest she moves on to less demanding roles where her experience can be put to advantage? Those questions are posed by the new production of Richard Strauss's Die Frau ohne Schatten at the Zurich Opera House, in which Gwyneth Jones sings the Dyer's Wife. This is a part she has sung to justified acclaim in the past - including one historic occasion in Zurich nine years ago when she sang the Dyer's Wife and the Empress in the same performance. Time has marched on, but not all of us are wiser. Dame Gwyneth still likes to sing the part, to bask in the limelight it brings. She clearly needs that kind of ego-boosting, adrenalin-pumping experience. The hit-or-miss intonation, which was always her trademark, has become more distracting. The beat in the voice is heavier. In the past, such flaws had to be set against her charismatic stage presence, her ability to communicate 150 per cent. But the flaws loom bigger now. She no longer looks the part, despite a flattering brown wig. Gestures which were once an appealing part of her stage make-up - such as that helpless look of put-upon innocence - have become mannerisms. The Zurich audience indulged her, cheered her to the roof. But Dame Gwyneth is living off her reputation. She is a crumbling vision of her former self. Now look at another soprano in the same cast - Anja Silja, whose voice was long considered close to burn-out. Silja is older than Gwyneth Jones, but has aged with dignity. She has graduated to roles which suit her, roles which do not require pristine vocal quality - such as Herodias in Salome, Emilia Marty in The Makropoulos Case (both of which she will sing in Britain next year) and now the Nurse in Die Frau ohne Schatten. Silja dominated the stage without appearing to try. Tall and shrewish, she moved with the stealth of a predator, and once rejected, bore the crestfallen look of someone mortally wounded: a classic portrayal. The rest of the cast were comparative youngsters. Gosta Winbergh made a cautious but convincing debut as the Emperor. Gabriele Lechner was a gracious Empress, with a gleaming array of top notes. Alfred Muff was the poetic Barak. All benefited from Christoph von Dohnanyi's conducting: the orchestra has never sounded better. Cesare Lievi's production was little more illuminating than the previous instalments of his Strauss series in Zurich. His approach was deliberately naive, barely suggesting the mystery or symbolism of the tale. David Pizzigoni's postmodern sets, adorned with oriental motifs, had as much atmosphere as an architect's model, but his costumes looked pretty.</p>

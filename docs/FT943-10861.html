			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Parties plan Delhi boycott Indian opposition parties said yesterday they would boycott the present parliamentary session in protest at the government's handling of the 1992 Bombay securities scandal. Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress (I) party and the opposition are in dispute over the government's 'Action Taken Report' on the scandal inquiry. Opposition groups allege Mr Rao used the report to shield senior ministers from criticism by a joint parliamentary committee. Opposition leaders said they had taken the decision with 'reluctant and heavy hearts', but were responding to the government's 'negative attitude' to what they termed a 'sabotage of parliament'. The present session ends in the last week of this month. The government yesterday offered to table a supplementary report, making the offending 'Action Taken' report an interim one. But opposition leaders who had earlier suggested this move said it was 'too late' to accept it now. The joint parliamentary committee submitted its report on the Bombay stock scandal after 18 months of much-publicised deliberations. The report held Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, responsible for the scandal, and implicated several other ministers, bureaucrats and foreign and domestic banks in its report. The government said a 'systems failure' it had inherited, not created, had been responsible. Mr Singh was staunchly defended, and the only tangible action taken by the government was a decision by the Reserve Bank, India's central bank, to penalise 35 foreign and domestic banks said to have been involved. The walk-out by the entire Opposition, except two small groups which support Congress (I), and their further decision to resign from parliamentary committees will cripple most proceedings.</p>

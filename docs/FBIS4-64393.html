			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The cooperation agreed between Lufthansa  and United Airlines, the second-largest U.S. airline, in both  Europe and America has finally been settled.    Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann informed the press in  Bonn on Friday [29 April] that the U.S. Administration has  agreed to this strategic alliance of the two airlines. The  first flight based on the so-called code-sharing agreement is to  take place at the beginning of June.    The alliance is based on the aviation agreement that was  concluded by Bonn and Washington in mid-March. The two airlines  will be able to offer joint flights in the future. Wissmann  said he expects that this will enable Lufthansa to win back  market shares on the hotly contested North Atlantic route and to  operate more profitably in the future. He did not rule out that  the company's currently negative balance sheet could improve by  amounts in the three-digit million mark range over the next few  years. On the development of prices he said that if Lufthansa  can achieve a higher degree of utilization and work at lower  costs, there is a chance of this trend being passed on to  customers.    As advantages of this cooperation he mainly lists more  flexible flight offers, a better utilization of joint  installations and worldwide attending to customers. Wissmann  said that the breakthrough in the difficult German-U.S. aviation  negotiations was achieved when other American airlines were also  given the right to cooperate with companies in Central and East  Europe. In return, Lufthansa can now cooperate with domestic  airlines on flights between the United States and the Caribbean  or South America.</p>

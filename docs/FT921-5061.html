			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / US keeps Hanoi trade embargo THE US yesterday agreed to provide humanitarian aid to Vietnam in exchange for help in finding the remains of American soldiers missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam War, but refused to lift its trade embargo. Mr Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state, agreed to provide a minimum of Dollars 3m of government humanitarian aid, on top of around Dollars 6m of non-governmental help now provided by US charities. But Mr Le Mai, Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, said he was disappointed that the US had not lifted its trade embargo. 'I must be very frank in saying that the response from the US government remains very modest,' he said. Mr Solomon, however, said that the US was still in the first phase of a four-phase 'road-map' towards normalising relations with Vietnam. This first phase includes only the discussion of normalisation, and will focus on resolving US preoccupations about prisoners of war and servicemen listed as missing in action in Vietnam. The US envisages a partial lifting of the embargo in phase two, which is linked to the establishment of the UN peace-keeping force in neighbouring Cambodia. A complete end to the embargo would not come until phase three, at least six months after the UN has arrived and after the last Vietnamese soldier has left Cambodia. Vietnam publicly withdrew most of its troops from Cambodia in 1989, although it left behind hundreds of soldiers, including advisers. US policy remains fixated by the fate of the MIAs. Polls show that more than 80 per cent of US veterans of the Vietnam War believe some of their comrades are still held prisoner. The war is still a raw issue for many Americans, and it is thought extremely unlikely that President George Bush would take the possibly controversial step of normalising relations with Vietnam before November's election.</p>

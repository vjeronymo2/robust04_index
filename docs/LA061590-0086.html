			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OAK VIEW;  </P> <P> 8 ARRESTED, DRUGS, GUNS SEIZED IN RAIDS  </P> <P> Ventura police have arrested eight people this week in a narcotics sweep that  netted small amounts of the stimulant methamphetamine and 23 firearms at  several locations in Ventura and Oak View.  </P> <P> George Curtis, 45, of Oak View was arrested on suspicion of possessing a  sawed-off shotgun, said Ventura Police Sgt. Steve Bowman.  </P> <P> Curtis, who was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail, was a  target of the investigation which led to a search Tuesday of his house at 100  Watkins Way, Bowman said.  </P> <P> During the search, police found firearms and a small amount of methamphetamine,  Bowman said.  </P> <P> They also seized a bomb that Bowman described as similar to those used by the  military in aerial target practice. The bomb squad of the Ventura County  Sheriff's Department dismantled the bomb and found that it was inert, he said.  </P> <P> Delia Coonrod, 35, of Ventura was also arrested at the house for possession of  methamphetamine.  </P> <P> Ronny Archer, 24, of Ventura and Robert Blymer, 44, of Ojai came to the house  while the search was under way. Blymer was arrested on suspicion of being under  the influence, possession of drug paraphernalia and driving without a license.  Archer was arrested on a warrant for violating probation.  </P> <P> The search of the house led police to three storage areas in the 5700 block of  Ventura Avenue, where they found chemicals used in the manufacture of  methamphetamines, Bowman said.  </P> <P> Walton Peacock, 40, and Rosalee Jones, 32, both of Ventura, were stopped by  officers after they left the storage area. Police said Peacock had two loaded  handguns concealed in his car and about a half-ounce of methamphetamine.  </P> <P> He was arrested on suspicion of possession of methamphetamine for sale,  carrying a concealed weapon, having a loaded gun in public and possessing a  controlled substance while armed, Bowman said. Peacock was out on bail from a  1989 arrest by the Ventura Police Department for possession for sale of  methamphetamine.  </P> <P> Jones was arrested on an outstanding traffic warrant and on suspicion of being  under the influence of a controlled substance.  </P> <P> Christina Hope, 37, of Ventura was arrested at the storage area on an  outstanding traffic warrant. She was being held in the Ventura County Jail in  lieu of $5,000 bail. James Paul Urban, 24, of Ventura also was arrested at the  storage area on warrants for grand theft, violation of probation and a traffic  violation.  </P> <P> He was being held in lieu of $6,819 bail in the County Jail.  </P> <P> Coonrod, Peacock, Jones, Blymer and Archer were booked into the County Jail and  subsequently released, either on their own recognizance or after posting bail,  a jail spokesman said.

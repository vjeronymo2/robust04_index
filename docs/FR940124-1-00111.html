This subpart describes the rules and procedures that govern the State Postsecondary Review Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department invited individuals and representatives of groups involved in student financial assistance programs to the four regional meetings. At each meeting, the Department provided for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information regarding the implementation of subpart 1 by providing participants with an issue paper that raised issues and questions with regard to the statutory provisions included in subpart 1. The following is a summary of the information provided to the Department by participants at the regional meetings. The section of the proposed regulations that is the subject of the information is provided as a reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time requirement for development of State review standards_&sect;667.3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants in the regional meetings discussed whether the Secretary should require States to develop review standards within a specified time. The participants agreed that the Secretary should specify a time period but disagreed on what that time period should be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allotment formula_&sect;667.11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed how Federal funds should be divided among the States that have entered into an agreement with the Secretary and suggested a funding scheme under which each participating State would receive (1) an allotment sufficient to carry out minimum SPRE activities, and (2) a supplemental allotment based on the number of institutions in the State, the total Title IV, HEA program funds made available to students attending institutions in the State, or the number institutions referred to the State by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Allowable costs and activities_&sect;667.14.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed the extent to which a State should be reimbursed for the costs of performing reviews and other activities and suggested that the Secretary reimburse the State for the direct and indirect costs of SPRE review activities, including salaries and fringe benefits, travel and other review costs, costs for developing State review standards and complaint procedures, and litigation costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consultation with institutions_&sect;667.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed whether the Secretary should establish procedures that a State must use to consult with institutions in its State in the development of State review standards. They recommended that the Secretary suggest, but not establish, consultation procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal minimum review standards_&sect;667.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed whether the Secretary should establish Federal minimum standards and whether a State could establish standards that are weaker than comparable standards that govern an institution's eligibility and participation in the Title IV, HEA programs. The participants were divided on the first issue; the majority argued that Federal minimums would not be appropriate because they could not be developed in a manner that would adequately account for the mission and diversity of all postsecondary institutions. With respect to the second issue, some participants felt that a State should have the flexibility to develop weaker standards, while others felt that no distinction should be made between a ``weaker'' standard or a ``different'' standard. Those participants felt that a State should be able to develop different standards for different types of institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quantifiable standards_&sect;667.21.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed whether a State should quantify review standards and suggested that, to the extent that standards could be quantified, they should be quantified. However, most participants felt that the State should have the flexibility to establish the level at which an institution would be considered to be in violation of the quantified standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPRE review findings_&sect;667.23.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed whether a SPRE should be required to determine that an institution should no longer participate in the Title IV, HEA programs based on the institution's failure to satisfy a particular State standard. Most participants felt that a SPRE could, but should not be required to, make that determination. The participants suggested that, based on the nature and severity of an institution's violations, the SPRE should have the latitude to take an adverse action against the institution or to require the institution to take actions to bring itself into compliance with the State's standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disapproval of State review standards_&sect;667.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants discussed the basis under which the Secretary should disapprove a State's review standards. Most participants felt that the Secretary should disapprove a State's standards only if those standards did not adequately address the statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=3 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1460 Filed 1&hyph;21&hyph;94; 10:00 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=3 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

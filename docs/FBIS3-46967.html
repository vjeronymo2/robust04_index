			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- Korean-French arms dealer  Jean-Rene Fuan and his Seoul agent, Chu Kwang-yong, conspired to  cheat the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) out of 6.7 million U.S.  dollars between 1991 and last year, the joint  military-prosecution team investigating the fraud announced  Friday, winding up its two-week probe. The team will shortly  ask the Korean Embassy in Paris to file a formal accusation of  fraud against Fuan with the French Government but will suspend  the filing of formal charges against Chu as he went abroad just  before the case surfaced in mid-December.    For their negligence, which resulted in no action in spite  of  the non-arrival of 90mm recoilless rifle ammunition one year and  seven months after payment was made and in no steps to prevent  Chu's flight from the country, disciplinary action will be taken  against former and incumbent DLA directors, the announcement  said.    Four DLA officials involved in the scam have been arrested  on  charges of neglect of duty, forgery of documents and taking  bribes. They are Army Col. Yun Sam-song, Navy Capt. To  Chong-il, and civilian employees Hong Kol-hui and Yi Myong-ku.    Yang Kyu-sok, operating officer of United Shipping Co., was  arrested for having forged a bill of lading for Chu and Fuan to  withdraw the payment for the non-existent shells from the Korea  Exchange Bank's Paris Branch.    Of the 6.7 million dollars they swindled out of the DLA,  just  630,000 dollars was found in Chu's bank accounts in Seoul, the  announcement said.    As the investigation is complete, the Defense Ministry will  reform the defense procurement system by the end of June to  strengthen the function of foreign procurement and transfer as  many domestic procurements as possible to the office of supply.    In addition, the Ministry will lay legal grounds for  strictly  punishing arms dealers who break a contract.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Fears of delay to BR sell-off spread to DoT FEARS THAT the privatisation of British Rail may be delayed have spread to the Department of Transport. Some people in the department believe the bill may not be published until February. That would mean it would almost certainly not receive final parliamentary approval until next October or November. The setback has been caused by the postponement of debate on legislation already before parliament, paving the way for privatisation of British Rail and British Coal. The paving legislation would allow the two organisations to prepare for being sold, for example by appointing advisers. Until recently Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, maintained that he intended to publish the rail privatisation bill this month in the hope of winning royal assent next summer. The sale of British Rail's freight operations would have started soon afterwards and the franchising of passenger services was intended to start in April 1994. The rail and coal paving bill was due to be discussed in detail by the House of Lords last month, but was put on hold because of the row over pit closures. Even if it is brought back to the Lords before Christmas, it is unlikely to be passed by parliament until late January. The privatisation bill itself cannot be introduced until the paving bill has been approved. British Rail would welcome a delay to privatisation. Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, told the cross-party Commons transport committee earlier this month that 'major questions' needed to be resolved before the plans went ahead. Mr Robert Adley, Tory chairman of the committee, has urged postponement of the legislation to allow his committee time to study the government's proposals. One of the biggest uncertainties concerns the introduction of a system of charging train operators for the use of railway tracks. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants advising the government, have yet to produce its report on the track access regime. Many private-sector companies interested in running trains have said that they cannot decide whether privatisation will prove attractive until they have seen the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report.

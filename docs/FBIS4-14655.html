			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Approximately 7,000 Russian </F> Soldiers Remain in Latvia"]    [Text] Riga, 24 Mar -- According to the Bureau for Russian  Army Withdrawal Control, there are currently some 7,000 military  personnel, grouped into 190 military units, still stationed in  Latvia. The units are located at 242 sites and facilities.  There are 827 trucks belonging to the Northwestern Army Group,  which are currently assigned to economic enterprises. At the  ammunition depots in Cekule, there are 60 freight cars filled  with explosives, in Garkalne -- 300.    In reply to a question from DIENA at a press conference held  by the Democratic Party on Wednesday [23 March], Ilgonis  Upmalis, chief of the Bureau for Army Withdrawal Control,  expressed his anxiety over Russia having not yet submitted a  timetable for full withdrawal of its troops, which makes it  impossible to establish commissions to assume control over  military facilities. Moreover, the agreement, which was  initialed last week, foresees that the timetable should be  confirmed by both sides. I. Upmalis stated that the commander  of the Northwestern Army Group has been asked many times to at  least show the Latvians the mentioned timetable, but each time  the answer is negative. As DIENA has already reported, Russian  Ambassador to Latvia Aleksandr Rannih had affirmed to Latvian  Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs that the timetable is  ready, but cannot be supplied before the agreement is signed.    I. Upmalis reported that approximately 60 freight cars are  being withdrawn each month from the ammunition depot at  Garkalne, so now is the latest time possible for the agreement  to be implemented, for otherwise it will be impossible to remove  300 freight cars full of ammunition by 31 August 1994.    The Bureau for Army Withdrawal Control has calculated that  Russian Army units still stationed in Latvia owe a combined debt  of 9,865,031 lats for unpaid taxes and services already rendered.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SENATORS URGE BUSH TO ACT ON GLOBAL WARMING  </P> <P> Senators from both parties pressed President Bush on Tuesday to reverse the  Administration's decision not to seek an international convention to deal with  the threat of global warming.  </P> <P> "It is not too late to act," Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) said in a letter  urging Bush to issue new instructions to U.S. delegates to an intergovernmental  group scheduled to meet in Geneva today. Chafee is the ranking Republican on  the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.  </P> <P> Chafee said the convention proposal, which is supported by the Environmental  Protection Agency and the State Department, is one of the "bold, new  initiatives" that can "bolster your reputation as an environmental President."  </P> <P> A separate letter, circulated by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) and signed by  12 Democrats and one Republican, Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, called the  meeting a "unique opportunity" to demonstrate leadership on environmental  issues and urged the Administration to join other Western economic powers in  supporting a convention on global warming.  </P> <P> A White House spokesman said he had not seen the Chafee letter. On Monday, a  spokesman confirmed that the Office of Management and Budget had altered a top  National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientist's congressional  testimony on the so-called greenhouse effect, weakening its conclusion that  enough is known about the phenomenon to warrant immediate action.  </P> <P> The White House defended the editing as an effort to avoid the appearance of  policy disagreements in the Administration. The scientist, James E. Hansen,  director of the Goddard Institute of Space Studies, said the changes amounted  to altering scientific conclusions.  </P> <P> The episode is the latest stumble for an Administration already under fire for  a policy-making style that critics say relies on reaction instead of direction.  In the case of global warming, it also involves an issue that candidate Bush  chose to distinguish himself from his predecessor. "As President," he said  during the campaign, "I intend to do something about it."  </P> <P> The central problem, according to Administration officials, is that there is no  consensus on what to do. The dissension surfaced last week, when White House  officials rejected proposals from the EPA and State Department to use this  week's meeting in Geneva as a steppingstone to an international convention.  </P> <P> EPA and State Department officials envisioned a process similar to the one that  led to an international protocol to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons,  chemicals that scientists say are destroying stratospheric ozone.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite the progress made thus far this year  compared to 1993, the amount of precursors confiscated during  the first four months of 1994 accounts for only 3.5 percent of  the total amount used by drug traffickers to process cocaine  paste and cocaine.    Drug enforcement personnel have already confiscated 37,646  kg  of chemical precursors from several trafficking organizations in  just four months this year. By contrast, Interior Ministry  figures show that during 1993, only 74,200 kg of chemicals --  including sulphuric acid, acetone, hydrochloric acid, sodium  carbonate, potassium permanganate, and ether -- were confiscated.    Drug analysts and DEA experts noted that 13 clandestine  airfields have been destroyed in the Upper Huallaga region, as  well as a 2,000-meter strip in Quempiri (near Satipo) and  another near Tarapoto.    They have also destroyed 10 pits and 11 maceration labs that  were equipped with microwave ovens and other sophisticated  equipment.    Intelligence agents have concluded that the geographical  location of the Apurimac-Ene basin is the reason why it has  become in recent months the main route for chemicals for the  Peruvian-Colombian mafia organization laboratories.    Drug enforcement forces have noted, however, that no major  seizures have been made yet owing to the complicity of the local  residents and coca growers, who in some cases have been forced  by former Shining Path members -- who now work for the drug  mafia -- to remain silent to protect the traffickers.    The analysts believe the traffickers have conscripted  residents and peasants in the jungle of Satipo, Oxapampa, Ciudad  Constitucion, Puerto Bermudez, Icozaxin, Huanta, La Mar, San  Francisco, Palmapampa, Santa Rosa, La Convencion, and Palestina  in the illegal drug trade.    A few weeks ago, police confiscated chemical supplies in the  townships of San Pedro (Villa Rica-Oxapampa) and Palestina,  where a CB-1420 aircraft crashed and its passengers managed to  escape with the help of local residents.    The chemicals are also being transported in small boats  along  the Pichis, Palcazu, Ene, Perene, and Apurimac rivers.    The township of Palmapampa (La Mar-Ayacucho), which is on  the  Apurimac River, continues to be the transaction center for the  "firms," which are guarded by mercenaries armed with modern  weapons.    The commander of drug enforcement operations is reinforcing  his personnel with specialized personnel in the region, where  until recently there were just 12 policemen and a small Air  Force base, which tried to detect the small planes used by  traffickers.    Some of those "firms" have moved their operations toward the  Tambopata basin where, protected by the intricate wilderness,  they set up laboratories to produce the drugs that are sent to  Brazil.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Business Law: US privatisation advances at federal level Before heading home for the Thanksgiving holiday last November, the United States Congress completed the arduous process of hammering out the Inter-Modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. President Bush is expected promptly to sign the Dollars 151bn public works measure. This legislation redirects federal spending towards regional transportation, bridges, roads and tunnels in co-operation with the private sector. It represents a signficant change from the focus on big, new inter-state highways which has prevailed since the Eisenhower administration. Under the Act, more money will be spent in the next six years than in any previous infrastructure programme. In many respects, the legislation, in a new manner, harnesses the private sector in the task of re-building America's infrastructure. Underlying the legislation is the recognition that America is in the midst of an infrastructure crisis and that private participation is necessary for recovery. Over the last 20 years, non-military investment in infrastructure  -principally bridges, roads and tunnels - as a fraction of gross national product has been only 65 per cent of America's average level during the preceding two decades. This is a decline from 3.7 per cent to 2.4 per cent of GNP. When depreciation is taken into account, the rate of non-military investment in infrastructure and public works in the 1980s has been only half that of the 1970s and just one quarter that of the 1950s and 1960s. In a recent study, the economist David Aschauer demonstrates that the fall in investment in infrastructure over the past quarter century has been an important cause of the US economy's poor performance since 1970. More than half of the decline in US productivity in that period can be explained by lower infrastructure spending. Mr Aschauer calls the shortfall between the current stock of infrastructure and the present need for infrastructure capital America's Third Deficit - as distinct from the other two: the internal and external deficits. Mr Aschauer concludes that a 1 per cent increase in the current level of core US physical infrastructure (defined as roads, bridges and mass transit) would increase GNP by nearly a quarter of 1 per cent. He is not the only economist who has noticed this relationship. In the most recent Economic Report of the President, Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, asserts that 'inadequate government infrastructure can impede improvements in productivity growth' and that 'taking advantage of productive opportunities to maintain and improve infrastructure is an important part of federal, state, and local government policies to raise economic growth'. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Dollars 800bn is needed in additional spending on infrastructure to 2000. Economists generally agree that more money needs to be invested in America's infrastructure. But the likely size of next year's federal deficit makes it unrealistic to expect that the federal government will spend the requisite amount. Some money will have to come from state and local governments, but their budgets are also strained. Most state and local governments are in a terrible financial condition. They have poor credit ratings and are up against debt ceilings. Accordingly, a significant portion of the cost of infrastructure improvement will have to come from other sources. In the past, it has not been the policy of the federal government and the states to encourage private-sector financing of infrastructure development. As a result, Americans have been in the anomalous position of spending billions of dollars of private capital to build foreign infrastructure, while ignoring their own. The Bill is a significant step towards federal government encouragement of private involvement in infrastructure improvement. It reflects the recent accelerating trend toward privatisation at the state and municipal levels detailed in my September 19 1991 article in this column - 'Double standards in the US'. The US Department of Transportation issued a report in March 1990 - National Transportation Policy. This outlined the Bush administration's transport goals, called for government at all levels to promote private-sector involvement in transport infrastructure. In its wake, several states - California and Virginia in particular - introduced legislation to develop highway 'privatisation' projects. With the passage of the Inter-Modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, the federal government itself will take the initiative. In the Act, the federal government authorises the imposition of tolls on federally-subsidised bridges, roads and tunnels (other than those on the Interstate system) to finance their construction or rehabilitation. Toll revenues may be set aside to provide a reasonable rate of return to private investors. Previously, tolls have been restricted to only a small number of facilities. More important, for the first time since federal aid to highways began in 1916, the legislation permits bridge, road and tunnel toll projects to be privately-owned and permits substantial federal subsidies to private investors willing to undertake transportation infrastructure investments. A federal subsidy of up to 50 per cent of costs is allowed for private investors willing to build new roads or rehabilitate existing bridges, roads or tunnels. A federal subsidy of up to 80 per cent is allowed to private investors willing to construct new bridges or tunnels or replace existing bridges or tunnels. As an additional incentive, states will be permitted to lend all or part of the federal subsidies rather than transfer them directly to the entities undertaking the projects. The financial community will now be called upon to decide how best to employ these financial arrangements. It will, however, be up to the states to take advantage of this new flexibility. There is no assurance that the states will act. While the provisions of the legislation are not mandatory, given the dimensions of the US infrastructure crisis and the budgetary constraints on the states and municipalities, we can expect this legislation to further accelerate privatisation by states and municipalities. The passing of the Act should provide help for rebuilding dilapidating infrastructure, while providing a unique area for new investment activities in the US.

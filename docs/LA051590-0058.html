			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 MEN FOUND DEAD IN APPARENT MURDER-SUICIDE  </P> <P> Three men were found dead Monday night in the apartment they shared in the 3200  block of South Main Street in Los Angeles. Police said their initial  investigation indicated it was a murder-suicide.  </P> <P> No weapon was found, however, and police declined to say whether the deaths  were shootings or stabbings or which one may have killed the others. All of the  men were partially clothed, two of the bodies were on the floor and another on  a bed, police Lt. Vic Ramirez said.  </P> <P> Neighbors told police that the men -- who were in their 30s -- generally  associated with homosexuals and that two of them often went to bars attired in  women's clothing.  </P> <P> Police said they had determined no motive for the killings but there did not  appear to be any gang connection. Identification of the men was withheld  pending notification of their relatives.  </P></p>

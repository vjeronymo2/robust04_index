			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium falls as output cuts slow - Market Report ALUMINIUM prices were depressed yesterday by a slowing in the production cut bandwagon, following statements by Norway's Elkem and Sweden's Granges. News that France's Pechiney was to temporarily curb production at some stage cushioned the fall, however, and the London Metal Exchange three months delivery price closed Dollars 11.25 off the day's low at Dollars 1,278.25 a tonne, down Dollars 10.50 on balance. The three months LEAD price broke below the Dollars 500-a-tonne level, in a culmination of this week's downtrend, with some sell stops pushing it to Dollars 492 a tonne at one stage. By the close it had steadied to Dollars 498.50 a tonne, down Dollars 4.75 on the day and Dollars 25 since the end of last week. LME NICKEL largely traded in the plus column, with a dip below Dollars 5,800 a tonne for three months delivery reversed by keen buying interest. At the close the price was up Dollars 32.50 on the day at Dollars 5,835 a tonne. Precious metals continued to trade in their established ranges at the London bullion market after New York markets opened largely in line with forecasts. GOLD ended 45 cents higher at Dollars 382.25 a troy ounce, while cash SILVER was unchanged at Dollars 5.30 1/2 an ounce. PLATINUM fared better, widening its premium over gold with a Dollars 2.50 rise to Dollars 392 an ounce. 'The lack of Far East interest overnight didn't help the markets today,' one dealer commented. Borrowing (buying cash and selling forward) against possible production disruptions during the South African all-party elections in April tightened physical platinum's liquidity, dealers said. PALLADIUM, platinum's sister metal, saw continued strong physical interest and some investment fund buying on the futures. Compiled from Reuter</p>

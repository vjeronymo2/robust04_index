			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / TSB vote backs strike action Bifu, the banking and finance union, is to discuss plans for a series of selective strikes after staff at TSB voted narrowly to back industrial action over pay. The union has rejected a 2 per cent imposed pay package that also includes plans for performance-related pay. The union's TSB section council will next week seek the endorsement of the full executive for a series of selective strikes. Members voted by 3,073 to 2,980 to back action in a 41 per cent turnout.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (12): Professionals wrong-footed by the Fed - Bond markets / Many traders erroneously expected the bull run to continue into 1994 The embarrassing admission last month by HSBC, the international banking group which owns Midland Bank, that it lost Pounds 123m on bond and interest rate-related trading in the first half of 1994 shows just how wrong the professionals have been about the direction of bond markets this year. After raking in huge profits during last year's phenomenal bull run, many traders clearly expected their luck to continue into 1994. But they were wrong-footed by the US Federal Reserve's decision in February to nip inflation in the bud by raising short-term interest rates. The Fed has underlined its determination to keep inflation in check by raising interest rates several times since then. By mid-August, the federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight balances, had risen to 4.75 per cent from around 3 per cent at the start of the year. Despite the Fed's pre-emptive strikes, the market still believes that further rate rises are necessary to effectively cap inflation in the US and to bring about the required slowing of economic growth. For example, J P Morgan expects the federal funds' rate to peak at 7 per cent next year, up from a previous forecast of 6 per cent, three percentage points above its projected 4 per cent inflation rate for 1995. Having got the direction of the US market wrong, many investors had hoped to make up for those losses by buying European government bonds in the belief that a further fall in continental interest rates was likely. But the so-called 'decoupling' theory, whereby European interest rates would fall independently of the rise in US rates, has not come true. Although inflation has hit the lowest level for a quarter of a century in several European countries, higher commodity prices and stronger-than-expected economic growth have hampered hopes of a further fall in interest rates this year. As a result, many European government bond markets have failed to live up to the expectations which analysts held at the start of the year. According to the J P Morgan government bond index, the UK government bond market recorded a negative return of 8.7 per cent in local currency terms from January to August, while Germany saw a negative return of 3 per cent. The worst performer was Sweden with a negative return of 9.5 per cent. The depth of the fall in European bond markets this year has been compounded by the severe erosion of the traditionally dominant position of long-term institutional investors by previously-unknown US and off-shore hedge funds - leveraged pools of private money which were highly geared in the futures markets. The hedge funds, along with the proprietary traders at leading banks, bought heavily into European bond markets at the end of last year and the beginning of this year but when it became clear that their bets were going badly wrong, they had no option but to sell their holdings quickly because of their highly-borrowed positions. 'Institutional investors do not have any influence over the direction of bond markets any more, they are dominated by the short-term movements of traders,' said David Shaw, director of strategy at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. The sidelining of the institutions, baffled by the free fall in the markets which appeared to have nothing to do with economic fundamentals, has caused market liquidity to contract sharply. In such trading conditions, even the lightest of sell orders can send prices into a tailspin. August was a particularly gruelling month for European bond markets as the seasonal drop in trading volume further reduced the markets' capacity to cope with nasty surprises. For example, when Sweden and Italy unexpectedly raised their interest rates on August 12, the thin volume in the cash and futures market caused the impact on European markets to be far more severe than was justified. Although the Swedish and Italian central banks' actions were widely interpreted to have been motivated by domestic concerns - primarily to galvanise their governments into tackling their large budget deficits and to defend their respective currencies - they inevitably raised fears that continental interest rates had reached their trough and were now heading upwards. Attention has inevitably turned to Germany, where many analysts had expected the Bundesbank to cut the discount rate at least once more this year. But the plentiful signs that the German economy has been growing strongly in recent months and that the downward trend in inflation is slowing have prompted forecasters to increase their projections. For example, both Deutsche Bank and Swiss Bank Corporation revised their 12-month forecasts upwards on 10-year bund yields, by 30 basis points to 7 per cent and by 50 basis points to 6.25 per cent respectively. Because of the extreme nervousness of the market, the Bundesbank decided not to be precipitate on the interest rate front when it met in August after its four-week summer break. It left leading interest rates alone and extended its fixed rate of 4.85 per cent for the next two repurchase agreements. The market is very sensitive to changes in these so-called repos which they see as indicators of the Bundesbank's intentions towards leading interest rates. But given the heavy issuance programme ahead of the Bundesbank, and the approach of the federal elections in October, it will soon have to come off the fence. One market about which analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic is the UK government bond (gilts) market. As many expected the Bank of England in mid-September raised the base rate by half a percentage point to 5 3/4 per cent, to keep the lid on inflation. However, they still believe that gilts have the ability to outperform their US and German counterparts from now until the end of the year. Simon Briscoe at SG Warburg believes that the recent release of second-quarter GDP numbers, which show no inflation, weaker consumer demand and a shift to exports, are just about the perfect set of data for the market. The better-than-expected inflation and wage data have prompted Kleinwort Benson to cut its end-year 10-year gilt yield projection from 9.25 per cent to 8.5 per cent.</p>

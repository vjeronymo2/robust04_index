			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 9 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces,  pressing a 10-day offensive, have seized a strategic height  overlooking the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, a  UN spokesman said here Saturday.    But Major Rob Annink of the UN Protection Force in former  Yugoslavia told reporters that "we don't think that Gorazde is  under imminent threat of being taken by the Bosnian Serb army"  following Friday's seizure of the highest flank of Mount Gradina.    He said he based his conviction on the fact that "the  (mainly  Moslem) Bosnian army is still strong and that the Serb army does  not want to take the town." [passage omitted]    Despite the breaking of a 24-hour truce declared on Thursday  [7 April], UNPROFOR spokesman Annink said General Rose was  "quite optimistic" he could obtain a ceasefire between the  warring sides on Saturday. [passage omitted]    Annink pointed out here that the Serbs could have bombarded  the city from the positions they had captured in recent days but  had chosen not to do so.    After taking Mount Gradina, the Serbs now hold 7.5 percent  of  the original Moslem pocket. This includes most of the right  bank of the river Drina which the Serbs want to control along  all its course and which follows the route between  Zvornik-Gorazde-Gacko-Trebinje in southeastern Bosnia.    UNPROFOR believes the Serbs are also trying to force the  Bosnian government to sign a ceasefire just as it is notching up  important military successes against Serb forces in northern  Bosnia.    Bosnian government troops have widened the Maglaj enclave it  controls and threaten the Serb-held town of Doboj. Further  north they are exerting pressure the corridor that links  Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia with Serbia proper.    In the northwestern Bosnian town of Prijedor, the Bosnian  Serbs said on Saturday they had arrested several people  suspected of murdering some 20 Moslems at the end of March.    Drago Vukovic, interior ministry spokesman for the  self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Bosnia told AFP that those  thought responsible for the killings were behind bars and that  their names would be published soon.    The killings spread terror among the 6,000 Moslems living in  the region and forced the United Nations into negotiating their  evacuation.</p>

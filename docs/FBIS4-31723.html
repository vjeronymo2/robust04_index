			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, received Sergio de Mello, chief  of the civilian sector of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]  for the former Yugoslavia, and General Michael Rose, commander  of the UNPROFOR forces for Bosnia-Herzegovina, today. During  the meeting they examined the implementation of the Geneva  cease-fire agreement and the agreement on the exchange of  prisoners, and the development of the situation in Gorazde.    We have concluded that the agreement of the countries is  being observed, de Mello said for the B-H PRESS agency after the  talks, even though there have been cases of cease-fire  violations. We hope that in the course of the coming week a new  meeting of the warring sides will take place in order to promote  this agreement and prolong it by at least another month, he  added.    Speaking about the meeting at Sarajevo Airport, where the  fate of prisoners and the missing persons was discussed, de  Mello expressed optimism, emphasizing that the two sides were  interested in making progress in this sphere, too. Regarding  Gorazde, it was agreed which steps must still be undertaken to  allow the residents return to their homes in the areas [words  indistinct] around the town.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz May 28 TASS -- The North Ossetian  Interior Ministry has denied reports about the participation of  North Ossetian citizens in the terroristic act that killed eight  Georgians near the village of Algun on Friday.    On Friday media reports said that "the terroristic group Les  [not further identified] based on the outskirts of the Ossetian  village of Tarskoye where the state of emergency is in effect  killed eight Georgians near the Ingush village of Algun who were  building a road between Ingushetia and Georgia, bypassing North  Ossetia. They said that the bodies of the builders were  allegedly transported to the Sunzhensk district of Ingushetia.    Information obtained by ITAR-TASS from the press service of  the North Ossetian Interior Ministry said that the group Les  does not exist in the republic. The Ingush side made a  statement about the brutal killing of the Georgian workers  without preliminary investigation into the circumstances of the  incident, the press service said.    The press service said that the aim of this disinformation  is  to "aggravate the situation on the eve of the debates on the  extension of the state of emergency in parts of North Ossetia  and Ingushetia, discredit North Ossetian bodies of power, build  up tension and disrupt the negotiation process initiated by  North Ossetia."    The state of emergency in some districts of North Ossetia  has  been extended until May 31. According to reports, the situation  in these districts remains tense mostly because of the  continuing fighting and attacks on civilians, military units and  police patrols and hostage taking.    Sporadic shooting broke out seven times in the Prigorod  District of North Ossetia last night. No casualties were  reported. The situation is under control of Russian  peace-keeping troops and local law enforcement bodies.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PLANE SLAMS INTO BRAZILIAN SLUM; AT LEAST 18 KILLED  </P> <P> A Transbrasil Boeing 707 cargo plane slammed into an apartment house and then  into a crowded shantytown slum today in a crash that officials said killed at  least 18 people and injured up to 200 others.  </P> <P> The plane crashed about one mile from Sao Paulo International Airport, doctors  at the scene said.  </P> <P> They said the plane's crew of three and at least 15 people on the ground were  killed and dozens more injured. Television reports said up to 200 were hurt.  </P> <P> "There was an explosion and a lot of smoke. I could feel the heat in my house  (130 feet) away from the crash," said local resident Maria Idalina.  </P> <P> At the crash scene, the jet's tail was intact. But the rest of the Boeing 707  was just scattered wreckage among the remains of eight houses and many  shantytown shacks.  </P> <P> Rescuers at the scene said they pulled children alive from the wreckage. "But  there are many dead," said one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Child Saved  </P> <P> Television reports said doctors had operated on a pregnant woman killed in the  crash and managed to save her child.  </P> <P> Boxes of television sets, radios and toys, some undamaged, lay on the ground.  The plane had been carrying goods from factories in a manufacturing zone that  the government has set up in the Amazon town of Manaus.  </P> <P> An official of the private Transbrasil airline said the plane had been  regularly serviced with the help of Boeing technicians.  </P> <P> Airport officials said the pilot of the Transbrasil plane on a flight from  Manaus radioed the control tower just before the crash requesting an emergency  landing, but they did not know why.  </P></p>

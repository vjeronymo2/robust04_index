			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> POLICE OFFER DECALS TO FIGHT AUTO THEFT  </P> <P> Beginning Sept. 28, Ventura city residents can register for a free voluntary  decal program designed to fight auto theft.  </P> <P> A bright 4-by-4-inch decal will be affixed to participants' vehicles,  indicating to police that if the car is seen on the streets between 1 and 5  a.m., when most auto thefts occur, police have reasonable suspicion to stop the  car, said Russ Hayes of the crime prevention unit.  </P> <P> "The sticker indicates to us that the owner has given police prior permission  to stop the vehicle during the designated times and make sure that either the  owner or someone with the owner's permission is driving the car," Hayes said.  </P> <P> The program is not limited to the city, and cars with decals can be stopped by  any police agency anywhere in the state, he said. Ventura is the first city in  the county to offer the Combat Auto Theft Program. Officials at the Thousand  Oaks Police Department said they are planning to start the program soon.  </P> <P> About one vehicle a day was stolen in the city of Ventura last year, Hayes  said, and 253 vehicles have been stolen in the city so far this year.  </P> <P> In addition to fighting theft, Hayes said, the program may deter people from  drinking and driving late at night because the possibility of being stopped is  increased. And "moms and dads can tell their kids that they better not stay out  past 1 in the morning because they'll probably get stopped, since the sticker  is on the car," he said.  </P> <P> Interested people can sign permission forms at the Police Department.

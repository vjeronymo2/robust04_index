			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed K.V.: "Brinkman Down, Deetman Up"] </F>   [Excerpt] Things are going well for [Second Chamber  Speaker] Wim Deetman. As things get worse for Elco Brinkman  [Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) leader], the Chamber  speaker's star is shining brighter. Rumors in The Hague suggest  that he may soon become floor leader of the CDA or even end up  as prime minister.    Until recently, Deetman responded to such speculation with  declarations of love for his present job of Chamber speaker.  This has changed two weeks before the elections. Last weekend  he declared that "I will not run away from my responsibilities"  if the party gives him the job of floor leader. In this week's  VRIJ NEDERLAND, he did not even shy away from the high office of  prime minister. As a good CDA man, he said that this would  depend on consultations with the "home front," i.e., his wife  and children. [passage omitted]</p>

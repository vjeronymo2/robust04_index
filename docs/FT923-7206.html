The combined size and strength of Sears and IBM, make Advantis, from its inception, one of the biggest private data networks in the world. It will be able to draw upon Sears' huge network in North America, which includes Dean Witter Reynolds, Allstate Insurance and Coldwell Banker. The venture will also enable the companies to cut costs. Analysts expect it to compete with British Telecommunications and Sprint and General Electric of the US, which also offer voice-and-data communications.

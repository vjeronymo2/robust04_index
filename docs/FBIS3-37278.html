This is due to the postponement of the  parliamentary address of the president of the Russian Federation.    We remind you, that the majority of the deputies to the  upper  chamber of the Federal Assembly, working on a non-permanent  basis, are now in the regions where they are carrying out their  permanent duties. They will gather in Moscow on 24 February, to  hear Boris Yeltsin's message together with the deputies of the  State Duma.</p>

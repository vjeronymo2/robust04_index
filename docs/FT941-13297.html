			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Cadbury in link-up for European expansion Cadbury Schweppes has joined forces with Cott, Canada's largest soft drinks company, to compete in the fast-growing continental European market for private-label beverages sold by supermarkets. The two companies have signed a five-year agreement, under which Cadbury bottling plants will produce drinks for a newly-formed Cott subsidiary in Europe. Cadbury has an option to acquire up to 49 per cent of the subsidiary. As well as marking Cott's entry into Europe, the agreement will enable Cadbury to increase production at its bottling plants, several of which have spare capacity. The company has plants in Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal and Spain. Though the deal is small, some industry observers said yesterday that it could lead to longer-term strains on Cadbury's existing network of relationships with Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the world's largest soft drinks companies. Coke and Pepsi are fighting to check rapid market share increases in the US by private-label colas, of which Cott is the leading producer. Private-label beverages are also gaining ground in British, French and Spanish supermarkets. Coca-Cola bottlers produce some Cadbury soft drinks in the US, and the companies jointly own Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, Brit-ain's biggest soft drinks producer. The UK is excluded from Cadbury's agreement with Cott. Cadbury bottles Pepsi products in southern Spain and France and the companies recently began co-operating to sell soft drinks in eastern Europe, a region which is covered by the Cott agreement. The deal is the latest in a series of recent moves by Cadbury to expand its beverages business internationally.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PIERCE FARM'S FUTURE  </P> <P> Ruth Loring's thoughtful, imaginative letter on the Pierce College Farm (Nov.  12) echoes my sentiments perfectly. I will go a giant step further than her  suggestions and ask why not use the land for a Valley arboretum?  </P> <P> Los Angeles County has arboretums in the San Gabriel Valley and South Coast.  Doesn't the Valley need an arboretum more than additional religious sites or  high-rises?  </P> <P> Having lived 61 of my 62 years in Westlake Village, this summer I discovered  Pierce College Farm.  </P> <P> With hardly any student traffic afoot or in cars, it was easy to explore the  back country of the campus: the country store, the acres of orchards, the  cornfields, the rangeland, the nature trail and horticulture buildings.  </P> <P> What I found appalled me. In this natural setting of potential great beauty and  tranquillity, I found gross neglect and shabbiness.  </P> <P> Hopefully this open space will be preserved for the community college to  develop (or other governmental agencies if necessary) to its highest potential  as a place for all the people to use.  </P> <P> JENNY ERICKSON  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

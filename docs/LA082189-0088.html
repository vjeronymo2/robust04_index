			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN CAMPAIGN MANAGER QUITS, SAYS EX-MAYOR LACKS COMMITMENT  </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein's campaign manager abruptly resigned today, complaining that  the former San Francisco mayor "has been unwilling to commit to a schedule, an  organization and a budget capable of electing her governor."  </P> <P> Feinstein responded to Clinton Reilly's announcement with a sharply worded  written statement: "I regret that he would announce his resignation to the  media without first having told me."  </P> <P> "I am confident we shall recruit others equally as capable of carrying out a  winning campaign," Feinstein continued in her written statement. "This in no  way deters my determination to continue my campaign for governor. In fact, it  redoubles my commitment."  </P> <P> Reilly's announcement praised Feinstein's "immense potential" but was unusually  blunt, especially for someone with such a long and close political association  as Reilly had with Feinstein.  </P> <P> Reilly had managed Feinstein's successful 1983 campaign against a recall  attempt and her successful 1984 reelection campaign for mayor as well as her  unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination for vice president in 1984.  </P></p>

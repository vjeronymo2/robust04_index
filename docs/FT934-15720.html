			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Gardening: Harvest home - Country note THE HARVEST mouse is Britain's smallest rodent, a tiny scrap of a thing weighing little more than a 20p coin. It is only about the same size as a pygmy shrew and, like the shrew, it has a high metabolic rate in order to maintain its body temperature. The ratio between its body mass and its surface area is 4.8, very high when compared with, say, a 30gm wood mouse which has a ratio almost half that at 2.5. Because it loses heat so rapidly, the harvest mouse eats a large amount of food, up to 30 per cent of its own body weight daily - almost as much as the wood mouse. Traditionally harvest mice are pictured feeding on the ripe ears of wheat but, while their diet does consist of seeds and fruit at certain times, they also feed extensively on insects, occasionally on birds' eggs and even on each other. The harvest mouse habitat is generally thought of as corn fields and these supposedly scarce mice were reputed to have suffered a further decline when combine harvesters were introduced. In fact, they are distributed widely throughout England with local strongholds in Scotland and Wales. In some locations they are considered common although numbers can fluctuate markedly from year to year. Furthermore in spite of combines, they appear to breed successfully in corn. A safer alternative, however, and one used by many harvest mice, is to live over water. These gingery white-bellied mice have tails with a prehensile tip and, equipped with this safety line, they clamber about happily in grass and reeds, their slight bodies hardly flexing the stems, and so they rarely need to come down to the ground during the summer. They construct their round nests from the living leaves, shredding each into thin strips and then weaving a ball from these. Thus for some time the nest stays the same colour as the plants from which it is built and cannot slip down the stems. In the autumn though, when the population is high, the dying reeds become untenable. As water levels rise they disperse to their underground winter quarters. At this time, harvest mice fall prey to barn owls and other birds. The mice breed rapidly, especially in captivity, and their small size and frequent periods of activity make them most attractive. The progeny of an original pair of harvest mice may be passed on to interested friends to establish colonies.</p>

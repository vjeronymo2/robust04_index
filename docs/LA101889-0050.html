			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Tighter Inspection of Seafood Sought: House Agriculture Committee members  accused the Food and Drug Administration of understating the health threat of  seafood-borne illness and called for a system of mandatory federal inspections  to replace the current voluntary system. White House officials acknowledged  during a hearing that more stringent inspection might be in order, but said the  Bush Administration had not yet decided whether to support any congressional  bill. Agriculture Department Assistant Secretary Jo Ann Smith told the  committee one alternative being considered was to create a mandatory program  funded through fees on the seafood industry.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo says South Africa will  participate in a peace-keeping force formed by the Organization  for African Unity if asked to do so. He was speaking in Cape  Town after signing an agreement with the Angolan foreign  minister for the establishment of full diplomatic relations  between the two countries. Reacting to reports that South  Africa would intervene militarily in Rwanda, Mr. Nzo said the  issue was receiving top attention, and that no firm decision had  been taken.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Leading Article: CBI economics BEHIND the tough talk and smooth delivery, Mr Howard Davies had little new to say to yesterday's session of the Trades Union Congress. As a leader of the Confederation of British Industry, Mr Davies has made an energetic start and it was a constructive move to visit Blackpool yesterday. But his speech revealed that he has not entirely dispensed with the muddled economic ideas which have weakened CBI pronouncements in recent years. His predecessor's mistake was to argue from the general to the particular. Yes, a country can afford to pay itself what it earns in increased productivity. No, this is not a rule of thumb that individual companies should follow. If they try, high productivity companies will merely force up the overall rate of wage inflation, as they did in the late 1980s. Mr Davies has taken the opposite route, from the particular to the general. Yes, few British industrialists and exporters complain about the level of the exchange rate. No, this does not prove that Britain is free of 'a fundamental exchange rate problem', as Mr Davies claimed. One reason exporters tend not to complain about the exchange rate is that they are still in business. But there are too few of them left, as Mr Davies himself pointed out. 'Manufacturing industry is now leaner and fitter than it was a decade ago . . . but there isn't enough of it.' That is why Britain still has a competitiveness problem. British employees, be they workers, managers or directors, have been paying themselves too much for decades. UK productivity growth outstripped the European competition in the 1980s, but so did real wage growth. And British industry remains less productive and less profitable than its competitors . . . as Mr Davies might well have reminded the TUC.</p>

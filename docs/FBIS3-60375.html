They discussed the progress made  so far in the European programme on air quality, emissions,  fuels and engine technologies (EPEFE/Auto/Oil programme).    The programme, carried out in collaboration with  ACEA/Europia, was initiated by the [EC] Commission in the  context of its new approach of a multifaceted, coherent strategy  towards vehicle emission reduction measures for and beyond the  year 2000. This strategy will include the development of air  quality objectives and an assessment of the cost-effectiveness  of the different measures.    All parties acknowledged the important contribution that the  programme will make to providing scientific data for an emission  policy in the European Community for the year 2000, through its  investigation of the effects of fuel specifications and engine  technologies on vehicle exhaust emissions. The Commission  confirmed its commitment to develop air quality objectives and  to assess future trends in air quality for a range of pollutants.    The two industries reiterated the programme's aim of  providing the European Commission with the necessary information  for it to propose emission limit values for passenger cars,  light duty and heavy duty vehicles as well as motor fuel  specifications (both gasoline and diesel) for the year 2000. The  commissioners emphasized the need for the expeditious conclusion  of the tripartite programme in the light of the Commission's  legislative timetable.    The commissioners, speaking also on behalf of Mr Yannis  Paleokrassas [EC Commissioner for Environment, Nuclear Safety,  and Civil Protection], welcomed the industries' concern about  the need to continue to improve the environmental performance of  their products. The three parties each expressed their  appreciation of the degree of trust which has been built up  through the on-going tripartite (Commission/ACEA/Europia)  consultations since autumn 1992.</p>

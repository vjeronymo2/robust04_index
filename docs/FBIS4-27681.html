			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mrs.  Ho The Lan, held a regular international news conference in  Hanoi on 2 June. The conference was attended by a large number  of correspondents from the foreign and local mass media and by  the press attaches of a number of foreign embassies in Vietnam.    In reply to a question raised by an ITAR-TASS correspondent  on the schedule and timing for Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's  visit to the Russian Federation, and another question posed by a  REUTERS correspondent on what republics the prime minister will  visit and on the subjects to be discussed during the visit, Mrs.  Ho The Lan said:    At the invitation of the prime ministers of the Russian  Federation, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  will visit these countries in the near future.    These countries used to have age-old traditional relations  with Vietnam. But following some eventful changes, the  relations between Vietnam and these countries have not lived up  to their potential. Now that these countries and Vietnam wish  to develop their friendly and cooperative relations, a number of  agreements on cooperation have been signed and various bilateral  and international issues have also been discussed between  Vietnam and each of these countries. This will be the first  visit by the Vietnamese prime minister to these countries.    A NIKKEI correspondent asked: According to an ITAR-TASS  dispatch, Senior General Doan Khue will visit the DPRK on 16  June. Is this news accurate?    The Vietnamese spokesperson said: Senior General Doan Khue,  Vietnamese defense minister, will visit the DPRK in the near  future at the invitation of the DPRK defense minister. This  visit is designed to strengthen the relations between the armed  forces and peoples of the two countries.    The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also made  public  a number of important diplomatic activities relating to Vietnam  and many other countries in the world.</p>

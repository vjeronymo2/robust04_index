			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> WAVERLY CONSORT OFFERS TOUR OF ITALIAN WORKS  </P> <P> The idea was simple enough: Present in a single concert a musical tour of  Renaissance Italy that encapsulates two centuries of achievement. That's what  the Waverly Consort apparently had in mind Wednesday night at the Bing Theater  of the County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> But 46 pieces and more than two hours later, one was left with impressions of a  musical diversity well beyond the scope of concise definition. It was a long  way, both temporally and stylistically, from where the concert began, with  Dufay's cerebral "Motet for the Consecration of Santa Maria del Fiore" of 1436,  to where it ended, with Banchieri's "The Animals Improvise Counterpoint" (circa  1600), with its silly bow-wows, meows and cuckoos. Even the hour-long  preconcert lecture and the lavishly illustrated 36-page program booklet could  do little in the way of cohesive summary.  </P> <P> Highlights included that Dufay motet -- its musical architecture a mathematical  mirror of Brunelleschi's dome -- in a simple and elegant performance by six  voices accompanied with handbells. There was Isaac's somber 1492 "Lament on the  death of Lorenzo de' Medici," with the tenors dropping out in the third verse  representing the absence of Lorenzo, a tenor himself. There were madrigals  early and late, from the simple beginnings by Festa and Verdelot to the complex  heights of chromaticism, tone painting and virtuosic display of Marenzio, Wert  and Monteverdi. These were in conspicuous contrast to the broad humor and bawdy  vulgarities of the street music of Venice and Naples that followed.  </P> <P> Throughout the sold-out performance, the Waverly Consort brought unassuming  expertise and expressive ease to all of the music. Though performing in  historically accurate style from scholarly editions on authentic reproductions  of period instruments, the results were anything but stuffy or pedantic. And  even if one couldn't entirely grasp the stunning variety of it all, one could  certainly enjoy the ride. TIMOTHY MANGAN  </P></p>

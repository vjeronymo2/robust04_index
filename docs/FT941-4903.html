			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / The FT Interview: Corporate camps divide and prosper - Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI It is only eight months since Imperial Chemical Industries split itself in two, and already the world seems almost to have forgotten the fact. Two weeks ago, the first full-year figures from the new ICI passed off without fanfare. Last week's results from its sister company Zeneca were equally routine. One of the most drastic upheavals in British corporate history seems to have passed off with scarcely a ripple. This arouses mixed emotions in the breast of Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of both ICI and Zeneca. On the one hand, he argues, silence suggests the demerger was a good thing. If it had shown signs of going wrong by now, 'everybody would have been jumping up and down pointing out what a balls we'd made of it'. So far, the evidence is all the other way. ICI's pre-tax profits last year were up 78 per cent, Zeneca's 42 per cent. More fundamentally, since the demerger was announced in July 1992, the combined value of the two companies has risen by two-thirds, while the stock market has risen only by half. On the other hand, Sir Denys is plainly irked that so little credit has been given for what he calls 'the greatest management story never written'. As he tells it, the main feature of the exercise was the sheer hard slog involved: not just hammering out the basic plan, but then sorting out the legal, fiscal and commercial tangle of splitting up 500 companies and 130,000 people across the world. This prompts an obvious question. Before demerging, ICI reviewed all its strategic options. The one it plumped for was the most risky and time-consuming. Given the drawbacks, what made demerger so very desirable? Sir Denys has the answers off pat. Consider, he says, how the world of the 1990s differs from anything that has gone before. Economic growth is going to be slow and painful. The classical chemical industry has largely run out of ideas. It faces competition from new parts of the world, such as the Asia Pacific region, and is obliged to spend more on the environment than it can readily afford. The collapse of communism has created chaos in the markets of eastern Europe, and has harmed a valuable customer in the form of the defence industry. Fair enough. But still, why was demerger the best answer? The answers here are murkier, since they concern not only external factors but the internal workings of ICI. The truth seems to be that demerger was the only way to address flaws inherent in the ICI culture; and Sir Denys, a company man to his backbone, is not about to criticise ICI if he can help it. To begin with, it is clear that the abortive raid on ICI by the acquisitive conglomerate Hanson in May 1991 was more formative than ICI has previously cared to admit. It caused Sir Denys and his board colleagues to address themselves afresh to two central constituencies: ICI's shareholders, and its managers. The response from both was unsettling. 'We had the naive belief,' Sir Denys says, 'that in the heart of every fund manager was a little bit labelled ICI.' In fact, many of the institutions proved indifferent or hostile. At the same time, the directors sounded out their senior managers. Again, Sir Denys says, the reaction was unexpected. 'They clearly did not wish to have Hanson come in, but equally they were less convinced about the cohesion of ICI and the synergy across the group than we had imagined.' The important point here is that if Hanson were to bid, it would have been on the basis of a break-up. The obvious defence would be that ICI was an indivisible entity. Its managers were no longer sure about that. Nor, on reflection, were the directors. The purpose of a break-up would be to release shareholder value. This was a point on which ICI's directors were becoming increasingly aware of their shortcomings. Historically, Sir Denys says, shareholders had occupied a humble position in the ICI scheme of things. 'A predecessor of mine - no names, no pack drill - said to me, 'Denys, you seem to spend a lot of time worrying about the share price. I'm not bothered about it. I just want to get the technology right'.' Historically, this is unsurprising. The 1950s and 1960s were a period of phenomenal growth for the chemicals industry. 'Even when I joined ICI in 1959,' Sir Denys says, 'we had sales control departments. You could sell every damned thing you could make.' In spite of oil shocks and recessions, traces of this attitude seem to have survived into the 1990s. The chief executives of the individual businesses, Sir Denys says, were slow to accept that shareholder relations, dividends, tax and interest bills at the corporate level were their concern. This, he says, lay at the heart of a further problem: that they were unduly optimistic about what they could achieve. As a result, he says, ICI's investments had not been delivering the goods. The remedy was plain: 'The CEOs needed to understand that there had to be a corporate performance and a corporate relationship with shareholders.' The reaction of these same CEOs to the demerger proposal was thus crucial. Ten days before the demerger was made public, they were summoned to the head office. The message was that the board was unhappy with their results and wanted them to explain themselves. 'They all came in, somewhat apprehensive,' Sir Denys says. 'I started off by saying: 'we aren't happy, that's all true, but there's a little bit more than that'.' On being told of the demerger, he says, 'they were first of all stunned, then their reaction was universally favourable.' Ten days later, at the final briefing, some were showing signs of second thoughts. 'There was a feeling of 'hmm - this is going to carry more exposure with it. With greater responsibility comes greater accountability'.' According to Sir Denys, though, the first reaction proved the right one. The CEOs, he says, have enjoyed a release of energy. 'There is a better interaction with the centre. They have a better opportunity to put across their viewpoint, not just on their individual business but the company as a whole.' One practical instance is that both Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief executive of the demerged ICI, and Mr David Barnes, his opposite number at Zeneca, now have regular monthly meetings with their CEOs. In the old ICI, Sir Denys says, this was not feasible. When I was first a division chairman, I used to go to the quarterly business meetings which the main board would have with the equivalent of the business CEOs. They were pretty useless meetings. Everybody was busy showing what a splendid chap he was and how well his business was doing.' ICI, in short, was suffering from a baronial culture, in which the chiefs were more concerned with competing than with the corporate good. Sir Denys points out, a touch defensively, that in any large corporation there will always be tension between the centre and the individual businesses. But the real snag about the baronial culture, it is clear, was that it made it harder to allocate capital for investment. 'We were too much concerned with fair shares for all,' Sir Denys concedes. As a result, some of ICI's more geriatric businesses - Sir Denys's phrase - were cross-subsidised when they should have been given the bullet. A large part of the argument for demerger is that in the 1990s, speed of response is more essential than ever before. Hence the case for demerger, whereby the suppression of sectoral interests allows faster reaction towards a common purpose. But as Sir Denys freely admits, structural change is only the starting point. 'Be clear on one thing,' he says. 'It will be quite a while before each company proves how it can grow. None of us saw this as a magic wand. It's the opening of a door, and it's saying to each company 'you have a new start, but you've got to get on and deliver'.'</p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Steinkuhler offers to resign in row over insider dealing MR Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's powerful IG Metall engineering workers' union, yesterday offered to resign after accusations that he benefited from insider dealing in the shares of Daimler-Benz. At the same time he appealed for support from his union members to let him stay in office and win back their confidence. In a separate letter to Mr Hilmar Kopper, the chairman of the supervisory board at Daimler, of which he is a member, Mr Steinkuhler said he would not attend any further meetings until an inquiry into insider dealing on the Frankfurt stock exchange reported on his particular case. That means he will not attend the company's annual general meeting tomorrow, at which Mr Steinkuhler's position on the supervisory board is certain to be an issue. His move was seen yesterday not as an admission of defeat by the most powerful union leader in Germany, but as a calculated gamble to maintain his position. In a letter to top officials of the 3.3m-strong union, he admitted that he had made a 'political mistake' in buying and selling the shares of two companies closely linked to Daimler. Although he denies the charge of insider trading in the shares of both Fokker, the Dutch aerospace manufacturer controlled by Daimler, and Mercedes AG Holding, the Daimler holding company, he admitted that it was wrong to have bought and sold them at all as a board member. He promised that all the shares had now been sold, and the profits paid into the solidarity fund for the recent strike by union members in the east German engineering and steel industries. Mr Steinkuhler bought DM1m (Pounds 390m) worth of MAH shares, and earned a profit of at least DM64,000 on the sale of a first tranche, after Daimler decided to dissolve the holding company and exchange its shares for full company shares. 'I am clear today that it was politically wrong for the first chairman of IG Metall to buy the shares of a company to whose supervisory board he belongs, regardless of when it was done,' he said. 'In that sense, I have committed an error which has shaken not only my personal credibility, but has brought our organisation and our common goal into disrepute.' He offered to resign 'if my behaviour proves too great a burden for the union'. His letter will be discussed today at a national executive meeting of IG Metall. However, any final decision on whether his resignation is accepted will almost certainly be left to a meeting of the union's national advisory committee on June 8.</p>

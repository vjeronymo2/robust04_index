			<p>BFN     [Text] Rival Yemeni armies battled for a sixth day today in  a bloody confrontation shredding the volatile state's  three-year-old unity. A Yemeni military spokesman in Sanaa has  said that fierce fighting was under way in the southern  provinces of Aden and Lahij. The spokesman said that the four  brigades of the northern army were advancing on Aden and  predicted the city would fall today. But in a radio broadcast,  the south denied that northern forces had reached the outskirts  of Aden where a general mobilization had been ordered to defend  the city.    Meanwhile, the English language YEMEN TIMES, published in  Sanaa, reported that 12,000 people had been already killed or  wounded in the fighting, but it gave no source.    On the other hand, Western embassies in Sanaa said that they  were planning further evacuations today. About 230 British and  Commonwealth nationals were expected to leave. The United  States, Germany, Italy, and French Embassies had similar plans,  but gave no numbers.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / SDP rejects fresh polls in Nigeria Nigeria's Social Democratic party, the apparent victor in an aborted presidential election last month, has refused to take part in a new poll sought by the military government, writes Paul Adams in Lagos. President Ibrahim Babangida withdrew late on Monday his offer to let the SDP and the rival National Republican Convention form an interim government of unelected civilians and replace his eight-year regime on August 27. Yesterday the government said an interim government would have invited instability. The president used similar reasons to explain annulment of the June election, in which Mr Moshood Abiola, the SDP candidate, was ahead when counting was halted.</p>

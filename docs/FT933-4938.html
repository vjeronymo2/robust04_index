			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Meyer threatens strikes THE head of Germany's union federation, Mr Heinz-Werner Meyer, is threatening strikes if parliament agrees to cut paid sick leave to finance a new healthcare scheme, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. He also threatened to sue the government in the constitutional court, claiming the cut breached wage agreements. Yesterday's threat has come as parliament considers a bill providing for six unpaid sick days a year, to offset extra social insurance charges on employers. The extra charges, also paid by employees, would finance a statutory healthcare scheme for the old and chronically sick. Both unions and employers' associations have strongly opposed the scheme.</p>

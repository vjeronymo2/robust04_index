			<p>BFN     [Text] On behalf of the organization committee of the Alfa  Cartel National Trade Union Confederation, this evening we  received the following communique:    On the pretext of the uncertain nature of the dialogue,  considering that the government team is including fewer people  than the trade union team, the executive rejects a meeting with  the trade union members who have been designated by the assembly  of representatives who are holding a rally in Victoria Square.    The representatives of the government want the number of  trade union members who are included in the team not to exceed  15 people, while the trade unions wish to participate in the  dialogue with a team that includes 40 people.    A psychological war has started in front of the government  headquarters. The first demand voiced at Victoria Palace  [government headquarters] is that the outside yard in front of  the government building should be cleared, or the government  will be compelled to resort to shield bearers. We protest such  methods of intimidation, the more so since the bilateral  dialogue has not even started yet, the communique we received  from the organization committee of the Alfa Cartel National  Trade Union Confederation says.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Responsible security sources have told our  correspondent that Hizballah fired rockets this afternoon, thus  violating the understanding reached in the wake of Operation  Accountability. The sources noted that the firing of rockets  was preceded by an Israeli air raid against a Hizballah base in  the Ba'labakk area, leaving 30 terrorists dead and 60 others  wounded.    The sources said that the base was used for training  Hizballah members. It was also used as a staging point for  carrying out terrorist operations in south Lebanon. The air  raid was effected as part of the continuous war against  Hizballah and as a response to Hizballah's terrorist acts  against the Israeli army, the South Lebanese Army [SLA], and  civilians in the border area.    The sources stressed that the State of Israel cannot remain  silent over rockets being fired at civilian targets. They added  that if Hizballah fails to abide by the understanding, Israel  will be absolved of this understanding. The sources added that  if Hizballah continues to attack the Israeli army, the SLA, and  the defenseless civilians in the border area, the Israeli army  will use all available means to strike with all force at  Hizballah.    The firing of rockets will be met with a violent response  against Hizballah bases and centers as well as those belonging  to the other terrorist organizations. If calm does not prevail  on this side, it will also not prevail on the other side, the  sources added.</p>

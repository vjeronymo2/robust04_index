			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIDETRACKED BY 'BOAT PEOPLE' EPISODE;  </P> <P> BALIAN LOOKS BACK AT WRECKAGE OF A CAREER  </P> <P> Capt. Alexander G. Balian thought he was "headed for good things" in the Navy  after 26 years that had brought him a Purple Heart, two Bronze stars and a  stack of glowing evaluations. Not too many months ago, promotion to rear  admiral seemed to be in sight.  </P> <P> But on Friday, Balian, 48, found himself trying to explain what appeared to be  the end of the line for advancement in his Navy career. The culprits, he said,  are the Navy legal system in general and a young prosecutor in particular,  along with unidentified Navy officials and an incompetent crew on his ship.  </P> <P> "I don't like failure," Balian told reporters. "And this is failure."  </P> <P> A court-martial had just found Balian guilty of dereliction of duty for failing  to give adequate assistance last June to a group of Vietnamese refugees adrift  in the South China Sea. He provided them with food, water and directions to the  nearest land but decided not to take them aboard his ship, the amphibious  transport Dubuque.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drifted Another 19 Days  </P> <P> The refugees drifted for another 19 days before they were rescued by Philippine  fishermen. Only 52 of the original 110 survived the harrowing 37-day voyage.  They said they resorted to cannibalism to keep from starving.  </P> <P> The six Navy captains who heard the case ordered that Balian be given a letter  of reprimand, the mildest punishment. Still, the conviction itself is enough to  derail a Navy career, and Balian was angry.  </P> <P> Shortly after the penalty was announced, Balian entered a room crowded with  reporters and talked for more than half an hour before stopping to take  questions.  </P> <P> With his wife and daughter sitting behind him, Balian talked about his love of  commanding ships, and how this had kept him in the Navy. Now, he said: "I never  go back to command of anything. I sit at a desk somewhere, now that I'm allowed  to stay in the Navy. I'm a seagoing sailor. This is not success."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Railroaded off' His Ship  </P> <P> At the top of his list of targets was the legal procedure that led to his  court-martial, which he said would "make you sick." He said he was "railroaded  off' his ship and that there had been "behind-the-scenes bad business going on"  during the investigation."  </P> <P> "I'm not saying the trial was unfair," Balian said. ". . . But the procedures  leading up to it were really dirty, and I think you should know."  </P> <P> On several occasions, he said, he was denied a lawyer or denied permission to  travel to San Diego to meet with his lawyers to prepare his defense. Of a Navy  legal officer involved in preparing the charges, Balian said, "That man is  unethical and unprofessional." He would not identify the officer.  </P> <P> "I would ask the public to look at the military justice system . . . what goes  on behind the scenes," Balian said.  </P> <P> He said that Lt. Cmdr. Raymond H. Carlson, the prosecutor at his court-martial,  had committed a number of offenses. During the court-martial, Carlson addressed  the captains hearing the case as "gentlemen," Balian complained, adding:  </P> <P> "I submit that's a disgrace. I was embarrassed for the Navy, a lieutenant  commander talking to senior captains."  </P> <P> "What should he have said?" a reporter asked.  </P> <P> "Sirs," Balian responded.  </P> <P> Balian said he was offended that Carlson accused him of not caring about the  welfare of the refugees.  </P> <P> "I want to submit to you publicly and for everybody's notice," he said, "that  that's wrong. I care about the refugees. I care about people in distress.  You've got a guy who's never been to Vietnam, who's never seen boat people, who  wasn't there. . . . That's disgusting, disgraceful, unethical and  unprofessional."  </P> <P> Of his crew on the Dubuque, people he believes gave him incomplete and  erroneous reports about the refugees, he said: "I also feel that the personnel  that didn't perform adequately, causing me to make the decision I made, should  be held accountable." Yet, he said, "I'm not trying to take anybody down."  </P> <P> Balian had no kind words for his superiors in Washington. He said they had made  him a scapegoat because the refugee incident was "politically messy for the  Navy; the Navy was embarrassed."  </P> <P> Balian, who has been living in Sasebo, Japan, where the Dubuque is based, will  move to Washington and become assistant chief of staff for the Naval  Telecommunications Command.  </P> <P> He said he will appeal his conviction and press the Navy to hold others  accountable.  </P> <P> "It's not over," Balian said. "Nobody in the public should expect it to be  over."  </P></p>

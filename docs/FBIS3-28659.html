Yesterday, Vanuatu Council of Trade  Unions held a 24-hour stoppage in support of a 10-week old  strike by public servants over a pay claim.    The council's secretary, Ephraim Kalsakav, says the general  strike was successful with most schools closing and government  services disrupted. The airport was closed for several hours,  delaying domestic and international travel. Scruffles broke out  on picket lines with several people taken to hospital for minor  injuries.    Mr. Kalsakav said the strike would continue indefinetly  until  the government reopens negotiations with public servants.</p>

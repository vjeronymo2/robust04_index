			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (10): Daimlers in Poona - The View from Germany A project to build 20,000 executive class Mercedes cars annually in Poona speaks volumes for the Daimler-Benz group's expectations for Indian prosperity. It also underscores sharpened German interest in investment in India in the wake of economic and regulatory reforms instituted since 1991, writes Christopher Parkes. Encouraged by new regulations allowing foreign investors to take majority stakes in joint ventures, and thereby exercise greater control over their investments' destiny, Daimler and its long-standing partner, Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco), have set up a 51:49 per cent operation to be known as Mercedes-Benz India. Production of the cars will start this year, while the factory will also be kitted out to produce 50,000 diesel and petrol engines a year, starting in 1995. The total investment of DM250m is modest in relation to the scale of the Daimler group, but huge when compared with the Dollars 25m invested in the sub-continent by the whole of German industry in 1992, the last year for which figures are available. On the one hand, the move marks a further stage in the company's globalisation policy, summed up by Mr Helmut Werner, chairman, as a switch from a 'made in Germany' to 'made by Mercedes'. On the other, and on the basis of the popular credo that 'what's good for Daimler is good for Germany', it is likely to be seen as a positive signal for other investors to follow. Even though deep-seated doubts remain in Germany about the wisdom of investing in India, the reform programme has already had a clear impact on intentions. Results of a poll published by the respected Munich-based Ifo institute last November rounded up 32 companies (from a selection of 174 which were already direct investors or involved in joint ventures) which said they were planning new investments in India. While there were doubtless others which escaped the samplers' net, the most significant finding was that 18 of the 32 said they would not even have considered moving in if the reform programme had not been instituted. The survey also discovered that in a reversal of previous practices, and as in the Mercedes case, a considerable majority of the projects were to be majority-controlled by the German companies. The possibility of real control was selected by the surveyed companies as a 'very important' result of the reform programme so far. Also in this category were the convertibility of the rupee, reduced restrictions on imports of capital goods, semi-finished products and spare parts, eased local content regulations, and a general reduction in bureaucracy. Even so, more detailed questioning turned up considerable lingering reservations even among this experienced group. Asked to name continuing obstacles, 90 per cent of the direct investors plumped for the inefficiency of the public administration. That 76 per cent of the joint venturers also complained of the red tape suggested that having a local partner does not automatically spell escape from its entanglements. Other hindrances attracting significant numbers of mentions included the labour laws, currency restrictions, difficulties in both foreign and internal trade, and lack of legal security. The Ifo study concluded rather dismally that such obstacles meant the stream of German investment would grow only slowly. A pragmatic analysis of the realities of reform and the survey responses suggested considerable scepticism about the prospects for effective change. Further liberalisation, such as the removal of more administrative levies, charges (and corruption) would help, but what was really needed was wholesale reform of the administration, it said. The Ifo analysis indirectly assessed the likelihood of this in the next paragraph, devoted to criticising the frequent, often sudden and retroactive changes in the law at the Union level, which individual states failed to implement. 'Half-hearted' efforts to liberalise the labour market and trade union power 'considerably obstruct the practical application of reform measures', the survey said. There was still much to do to attract investment, and the Indian government was well aware of the shortcomings of its efforts so far, the report concluded: 'But the fact that some of the reforms already in place are political dynamite implies a cautious rather than accelerated continuation along the way to reform.' In the light of such obstacles, and the relative attractions of high-growth, or more accessible investment sites in eastern Asia, Latin America, east Europe and even the US, German direct investment in India may accelerate from its current snail's pace.

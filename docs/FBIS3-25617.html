Most of the  injured had been struck with pangas (machetes) or sticks, they  said.    After its first peaceful night this week, Kigali was  "halfway  back to normal," residents said, as traffic picked up, stores  reopened and people gradually went back to work.    The unrest delayed yet again the swearing-in of a new  transitional government in which former rebels of the largely  Tutsi Patriotic Front are to have portfolios. Several political  parties boycotted the ceremony scheduled for Wednesday,  complaining that President Juvenal Habyarimana had been  arbitrary in his choice of ministers.    Public Works Minister Felicien Gatabazi was gunned down here  on Monday. An angry mob in his home district of Butare in the  south lynched fellow Hutu Martin Bucyana the next day, blaming  the hardline politician's movement for the minister's  assassination.</p>

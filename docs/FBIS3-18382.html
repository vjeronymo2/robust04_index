The "German Humanitarian Aid" office -- with its  seat in Irbil -- is supposed to coordinate relief operations and  to establish contacts with local authorities. After his  departure from the Greens, Walde worked for the Caritas  organization, the Workers' Samaritan League, and other  organizations in the Kurdish areas of Iraq. The Foreign  Ministry appointed him to his new position, which he will take  up at the beginning of March. Walde was the federal manager of  the Greens until the party left the Bundestag in 1990. At that  time he was counted among the party's left wing.    On behalf of the International Association for Human Rights  in Kurdistan, Lower Saxony's Justice Minister Alm-Merk (Social  Democratic Party of Germany) called on the Federal Government on  Wednesday [23 February] not to supply Turkey with weapons from  the stocks of the former National People's Army (NVA) any more.  The Federal Government must also make a contribution to having  the Turkish authorities investigate human rights violations  against the Kurds. A statement by the Association recalls that  UN bodies have accused the Turkish Government of deliberate and  systematic torture of Kurds. In 1993, too, the Kurdish press  was the target of "state repression." There were a total of 626  "extrajudicial executions," 392 villages were destroyed, and  almost 380 magazines and newspapers were impounded.    The human rights organization also criticized the acts of  violence committed by the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK). The  PKK must stick to its "basic principles, which have been set  down internationally." The statement calls on the United  States, Germany, France, and Great Britain to condemn the  violations of human rights in Turkey and to make political,  military, and economic aid to Turkey dependent on the  observation of human rights.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gateway suppliers complain SOME SUPPLIERS to the Gateway grocery chain yesterday claimed they had not been paid for deliveries in recent days although the company attributed the problem to a temporary 'glitch' caused by the installation of a new computer and stressed it had surplus cash in the bank. It is not uncommon for some retailers deliberately to delay payments - especially when they wish to conserve cash in the business near the end of a reporting period. Isosceles' cashflow has also been stretched recently as a result of the delay in disposing of Wellworth, its Northern Irish grocery chain.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / People (Names in the News): 'Hopeless romantic' for Seagram Edgar Bronfman Jr epitomises both the benefits and the drawbacks of being born into a rich and powerful business family, writes Bernard Simon. Without his lineage, it is doubtful whether Bronfman could have rocketed from being a New York high-school drop-out set on a career in film-making and song-writing, to chief executive of one of the world's biggest beverage companies at the age of 39. Bronfman replaced his father, Edgar Sr, as ceo of The Seagram Company last week. But having reached the top, he now faces the tough task of proving that he deserves to be there. Outsiders can be forgiven for wondering whether show business remains Bronfman's first love. Several of his closest friends are from the entertainment world, as was his first wife. 'Beneath a veneer of reserve, Edgar Bronfman Jr is a hopeless romantic,' observed a recent profile in New Yorker magazine. The depth of Bronfman's attachment to Hollywood has become relevant since he spearheaded Seagram's purchase over the past 16 months of a 14.9 per cent stake in Time Warner, the entertainment and communications conglomerate. He asserted last week that 'the reason for Seagram's interest in Time Warner had nothing whatsoever to do with my personal ambitions beyond my role as a steward for Seagram's shareholders'. Seagram insists that it has no plans to raise its Time Warner stake beyond 15 per cent. 'There is nothing wrong, in my view, with anyone being interested in what is clearly the fastest-growing, most global industry in North America,' Bronfman said. Seagram has been a Bronfman family business since 1928. Edgar Bronfman Sr, who turns 65 later this month, remains chairman and his brother Charles co-chairmen. Edgar Jr's elder brother Sam heads Seagram's US wine division. But the new ceo is also expected to lean heavily on a number of non-family members in Seagram's upper ranks. The most influential is Stephen Banner, a New York lawyer hired three years ago as Seagram's senior executive vice-president.</p>

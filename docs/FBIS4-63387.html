			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Alexey Kuznetsov] </F>   [Text] New Delhi May 21 TASS -- A visit to India by Viktor  Samoilov, managing director of Rosvooruzhenie, a state  export-import company on weapons and combat materiel, ended on  Saturday with signing several contracts on the construction in  the republic of missile boats, frigates and escort ships.    He was received by Indian Minister of State for Defence M.  Mallikarjun, had meetings with commanders of land, air and naval  forces and visited shipyards in Bombay and Goa.    "The visit confirmed that Russian-Indian cooperation in the  military and military-technical spheres has a long-term  prospect," Samoilov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. "We  mapped out cooperation programmes for land, air and naval forces.    "A long-term plan has been drafted to build warships at  Indian shipyards with Russian participation: over ten missile  boats and some ten frigates and escort ships. One of them will  be launched for running tests late this year."    Russia will supply all the main units, component parts and  arms for these ships, he stressed. This means that new jobs  will be created at Russian munitions factories.    Speaking about a Russian visit by Indian Premier P.V.  Narasimha Rao and his talks with the Russian leaders, Samoilov  said that the sides would discuss, among other things, military  cooperation.</p>

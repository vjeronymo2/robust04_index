			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: PPP to launchlife subsidiary PRIVATE PATIENTS Plan, the second largest UK medical insurer behind Bupa, is planning to launch a life insurancecompany, PPP Lifetime, in 1992, in a bid to increase its share of the market for private medical insurance and long-term care. Six million people - about 12 per cent of the population  - are currently covered by private health careschemes. With 885,000 subscribers (or policyholders) PPP provides cover for 1.8m people. The high cost of medical insurance premiums is one of the factors holding up the market's growth. The fact that subscribers must pay higher premiums as they get older has been a particular disincentive. PPP's life subsidiary will offer schemes designed to confront this difficulty by funding theincreased cost of future premiums, smoothing the cost of medical insurance overan individual's life. Mr Roy Forman, chief executive of PPP, also hopes to offer means of funding possibly expensive long-term residential and nursing care in later life. PPP announced the new development when reporting that its premium income had grown by 19 per cent during 1990 to reach Pounds 355m, yielding a surplus of Pounds 16m, 63 per cent more than in 1989. The underwriting surplus amounted to Pounds 5.8m. Operating expenses rose by only 4 per cent per subscriber. Although reserves were hit by the fall in equity markets, they remained at Pounds 173m, a drop of 4 per cent, allowing the solvency margin to remain strong at 52 per cent.</p>

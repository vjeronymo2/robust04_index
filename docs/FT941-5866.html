			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Lloyds gives way on cheque clearing Lloyds yesterday became the last of the big four clearing banks to say that it would cut from three days to two the amount of time before it pays interest on a cheque paid into a personal account. The move follows a high-profile and effective campaign from the consumer lobby and the Labour party against the longer clearing cycle previously used by three of the four. Midland and National Westminster announced changes in their practices last month. Barclays was already operating a shorter clearing period, and has recently capitalised on that fact while the other banks have been under pressure. Lloyds said yesterday that from June customers paying in a cheque on a Monday would be entitled to interest on the Wednesday and have access to the money from the Thursday instead of the Friday. As a further change, a Lloyds customer paying cash into any of the bank's branches will be entitled to interest on it on the same day. The changes are estimated to cost Lloyds some Pounds 20m in lost income over a year. The other three big clearers were reluctant at first to adopt Barclays' practice. They argued that the interest gained by placing the money on the international markets for the extra day contributed to the Pounds 4.5bn costs of running the clearing system. They also said customers would not receive any significant benefit from crediting interest a day earlier. But the publicity attracted by the clearing cycle turned the time-lag into a customer issue, so the banks yielded. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, is now turning his attention to the clearing cycle operated by building societies.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of East Kent (5): Progress is being made - Thanet Bright new signs at the London end of the M2 and M20 motorways into Kent signal the way to Ramsgate. It is a small indication, but an important one, of the determination of Thanet to put itself much more prominently on the map. It has certainly needed to, for Thanet is among the most run-down parts of the south-east and is in desperate need of funds to improve its infrastructure in order to attract more inward investment, writes Richard Evans. 'The problem is that too many people don't know where Thanet is. We have had to set about putting that right,' says a local authority official. The increased prominence being given to Ramsgate is one success achieved. Previously, Dover was by far the most prominently advertised channel destination on the routes out of London, followed by Folkestone, and with Ramsgate scarcely getting a look in, despite its flourishing cross-channel ferry and jetfoil services. It was all part of a pattern, with the Isle of Thanet as it is officially known, separated from the rest of Kent by the river Stour. The divide is now more psychological than physical but the area, which includes the resorts of Margate, Broadstairs and Birchington as well as the port of Ramsgate, is still seen as somewhat isolated and peripheral. All this could be about to change with the successful application by Thanet for development funds, both UK and European Union sourced. Thanet is now the only assisted area with full development area status in the south-east, an indication both of the effective battle fought on its behalf and of the severity of the economic problems it faces. The area has suffered steady economic decline over the last two decades and has a unemployment rate of 16.8 per cent, the sixth highest in the UK and comparable with the worst blackspots in the industrial north. The weak economy is due to the decline in tourism and manufacturing, poor communications and its remoteness from the rest of the country. There is therefore an urgent need to diversify and enhance Thanet's economy on a broad front. The problems remain substantial but progress is being made and the potential is there. Mr Ian Gill, former chief executive of Thanet district council and recently appointed chief executive of the East Kent Initiative, says: 'The big achievement has been to gain recognition for the problems of Thanet. We must now build on this success by helping existing businesses and by unlocking funds to create the right basis for inward investment.' Development area status means that Thanet will have access not only to substantial UK government funds but also to European regional development funds available for both infrastructure and training projects. Infrastructure projects are already under way or programmed in order to end the area's relative isolation. These include upgrading to dual carriageway for its entire length the Thanet Way, the tortuous link with the M2, improving access to Ramsgate port, and improving the road from Thanet to Ashford with its projected channel rail link passenger station. Great importance is placed on developing the Kent International Business Park adjacent to the joint civil and military airport at Manston in the centre of Thanet. Thanet's biggest difficulty has been that even if inward investors show interest, there are too few sites available for immediate occupancy. But the potential at Manston is considerable, and top priority is being given to improving the infrastructure with UK and EU funds so that more businesses can be attracted. Thanet hopes to get Pounds 12m in European regional funds for the site and Pounds 20m from other sources so that work can be completed quickly. The Manston site would then provide low cost development land, immediate access to the airport with its long runway and new Pounds 2m terminal building, and easy access to the port of Ramsgate three miles away. Mr David Ralls, ex-Army officer and helicopter pilot and Thanet's new chief executive, is optimistic - 'Manston's location so close to Europe and the easy availability of air and sea transport should make it an unbeatable combination.'</p>

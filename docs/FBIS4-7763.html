			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "How and Why Lech Walesa Made a </F> 360-Degree Turnaround"]    [Text] In recent weeks, President Lech Walesa has launched  an all-out attack on the postcommunists. The Belweder has  opened attacks on many fronts. The most painful blow was the  rejection of the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati to the post of  deputy prime minister. Equally painful was the veto of the new  Popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] Law. The victim of  the skirmishes with the Belweder turned out to be Zbigniew  Siemiatkowski, for whom the door to the Ministry of National  Defense was once again closed. The president also said that he  had a "Wunderwaffe" [secret weapon] up his sleeve: He may or may  not sign the budget. He is not concealing the fact that the  reasons for making such a decision will be purely political.  Walesa's reservations concern not really the budget itself but  those who have passed it.    For the first time since the presidential campaign in 1990  and the first stage of his presidency, groupings coming from the  Polish People's Republic have once again become Walesa's main  enemy. As he delivered a blow to the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD], the president unfurled the anticommunist banners, which  had gathered dust and lain in the Belweder completely forgotten.  Walesa's statements started to include increasingly more of the  anticommunist rhetoric that had been forgotten. He returned to  the ideas of file-checking and decommunization, even though  quite recently he has declared that he would not allow the  political struggle to mean a series of revenge acts.    Most of the actors and observers of the political scene are  close to expressing the opinion that the recent activities of  Lech Walesa were the preliminary stage of his presidential  campaign. One can suppose that, through this anti-SLD impetus,  Walesa is hoping to kill two birds with one stone. First, he  wants to clean the foreground in the race for the presidency: He  is trying to weaken his most serious rival for this post. In  line with the results of opinion polls, this rival is SLD  Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski. Second, he wants to build a  camp supporting him, which would lead him to the presidency for  the second time. Here the calculations are simple: Walesa  thinks very highly of his personal prestige; however, he would  like to back it with the support of the divided--but still quite  strong--Solidarity camp. It so happens that the Solidarity  parties are seeking a presidential candidate, even though they  are not looking in the direction of the former Solidarity  leader. Therefore, Walesa has decided to take part in the  bidding, and he is presenting his assets before he has been  officially requested to do so.    On the first issue, Walesa achieved definite, though  unexpected, success. The attack on Kwasniewski, which was  carried out with the tacit support of Waldemar Pawlak (because  Kwasniewski is also his rival in both the coalition and the  future presidential campaign) yielded results. Even though the  SLD survived the onslaught, the nerves of its leader were too  weak. First, Kwasniewski, who was probably in despair, stated  that he is ready to publicly renounce his presidential  ambitions. Next, he blurred his image of a serious and open  politician through his escapade with the help of a ladder. That  ladder will probably be one of the greatest arguments in any  negative campaign aimed at Kwasniewski, especially a television  campaign because the escape of the SLD leader was recorded on  magnetic tape.    Now one should perhaps expect a change in the direction of  the presidential onslaught. If Walesa decides that Kwasniewski  has ceased to be a serious countercandidate in the race for the  presidency, he will deal with another politician from the list  of his rivals. This politician is Waldemar Pawlak. If there is  not a "clandestine agreement" between the president and the  prime minister, the harmonious cooperation between them may turn  into a ruthless fight. The beginning of this may be the  president's veto of the budget. It would be a blow, first of  all, to the head of government.    Even though Walesa is fairly successful in "cleaning the  foreground," he has not had any success in building a political  camp supporting him. The president can see that the main  Solidarity circles do not really trust him. He can also see,  however, that their support may prove to be very beneficial for  him. After he called them "screwups," he started trying to win  the favors of those groups: On one day, the right-wing coalition  severely criticizes the new "popiwek"; on the next, the  president vetoes this law.    During his term of office, the president performed a  complete  360-degree turnaround, and today he is close to the position he  was in back in 1990. His supporters of that time will probably  not forget what came after that year. It will be difficult to  say that Adam Michnik was wrong when he wrote the article  entitled "Why I Will Not Vote for Lech Walesa"; he warned that  this person was totally unpredictable.    Walesa may become the victim of his own style of wielding  presidential power. He employed the strategy of weakening every  political camp whose strength grew during his presidency. In  the charged world of politics, the Belweder was a considerable  force--disproportionately greater than its true power. The  position of Walesa and the realm of his power were safe.    The first "victims" of Walesa proved to be his supporters,  with whom he soon started to fight, supporting the so-called  left pillar. The Suchocka government also had problems with the  Belweder. However, at a certain moment, these tactics proved  false: The SLD and the Polish Peasant Party became very  powerful. At this time, it has turned out that the president,  with few supporters, may prove too weak. He needs a political  camp, which he has himself dismantled and which he will have  difficulty putting together.    His chances are very slim. His roads and the roads of the  right wing have diverged too much. He will definitely not  enchant the liberal camp by transferring political disputes to  the economy. The Democratic Union will certainly not like his  ideas concerning decommunization. Such arguments might only win  over the most radical electorate: the supporters of Marian  Krzaklewski, Antoni Macierewicz, and Jan Parys. However, they,  in turn, feel the most intense hatred for the present head of  state.    Walesa can count on only one thing--that the "post-August  Poland" will not manage to find a candidate for the president  and, not wanting any postcommunist politician in that post, it  will support Walesa in an act of despair. In such a case,  Walesa would once again prove strong because the others are weak.</p>

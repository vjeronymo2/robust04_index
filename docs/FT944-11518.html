			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up despite currency concerns Concern over volatile currency movements prevailed but the Nikkei index gained on arbitrage buying and index-linked purchases by investment trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 60.91 to 19,811.56 after a high of 19,872.87 and a low of 19,768.95, barely changed on the week. Most investors remained absent after the dollar's plunge to a new record low against the yen in New York on Thursday. Volume was 204m shares against 251m. The Topix index of first section stocks gained 1.12 to 1,569.80 while the Nikkei 300 edged up 0.24 to 287.25. Gains led losses by 501 to 464 with 214 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.10 to 1,289.32. Some traders expected institutional investors to remain inactive until the yen-dollar exchange rate stabilised. Others saw a halt in the yen's appreciation and in the implicit rise in the value of Japanese stock holdings - triggering profit-taking by overseas investors. Individual investors traded small capital stocks. Nakabayashi, an office equipment maker, jumped Y65 to Y970 in active trading due to increased interest in its pachinko, or Japanese pinball, related business. Some high-technology stocks were higher in spite of the yen's fluctuations. NEC rose Y10 to Y1,220 and Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y10 to Y1,600. Steel stocks were traded actively: Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, remained unchanged at Y398 and Sumitomo Metal Industries lost Y5 to Y358. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 14.56 to 21,962.31 in volume of 17.7m shares. Roundup HG Asia (Singapore) recommended investors to increase weightings for Singapore and South Korea, but to trim allocations in Hong Kong and go underweight in Malaysia, Indonesia, India and the Philippines. HONG KONG had a switchback ride as early gains, which followed the signing of the financing agreement for the new airport, were pared before prices recovered once again. The Hang Seng index finished 38.44 higher at 9,530.40, for a 1.6 per cent rise on the week. HG Asia's Hong Kong reservations came in spite of the broker's forecast that the Hang Seng index will rise to 12,000 by March, fuelled by a surge in prices in the residential property market. SEOUL finished at a record high although profit-taking erased most of the gains made in early trading. The composite index ended 1.79 higher at 1,119.52, 2.0 per cent higher on the week after an intraday high of 1,129.99. Some primary blue chips such as Samsung Electronics and Posco stayed under pressure, Samsung going limit down Won3,000 to Won132,000 and Posco losing Won1,700 to Won72,000. SHANGHAI's A share index ended another volatile week with a 7.3 per cent fall. Losing 53.95 to 681.63, the index was 2.9 per cent lower on the week and 60 per cent down since the end of September. KUALA LUMPUR stayed uncertain, a rebound cut back as investors cut their losses. The composite index closed up 7.95 at 1,074.41, 4.1 per cent lower over the week. TAIPEI saw late buying in electronics and plastics push up the weighted index up 1 per cent to 6,369.11 for a week's loss of 3.5 per cent. In electronics, sold recently, Acer rose by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 90.50. MANILA was encouraged by a decline in the inflation data for October, which helped the composite index to a rise of 41.59 to 3,096.583, up 1 per cent on the week. SYDNEY squared positions ahead of the weekend. The All Ordinaries index lost 9.3 to 1,999.8 in turnover of ADollars 400m, down 1 per cent this week.</p>

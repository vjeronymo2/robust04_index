			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea spokesman on </F> 19 February; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] 1. Hanoi communist Vietnamese Foreign Minister  Nguyen Manh Cam was in Phnom Penh from 16 to 18 February. On  that occasion, he announced that it was necessary to set up a  commission to negotiate the border problem and the issue of  sending Vietnamese nationals to Cambodia.    This was a very base and perfidious maneuver to enable the  communist Vietnamese to legalize their annexation of Cambodia's  land, seas, and islands by the tens of thousands of square  kilometers and to legitimize the nearly four million Vietnamese  nationals who have immigrated into Cambodia since 1979.    2. The party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] denounces and  condemns with the utmost severity and indignation this savage  and treacherous maneuver of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese,  which is part of the concrete implementation of the late Ho Chi  Minh's strategy of swallowing up Cambodia.    The question of Cambodia's territorial integrity and  sovereignty is not negotiable. The communist Vietnamese must  respect and abide by the pre-1970 Cambodia-Vietnam joint  declaration and subsequent international agreements, especially  the 23 October 1991 Paris agreement concerning Cambodia's  territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence and the  inviolability of Cambodia's borders.    If the communist Vietnamese want good relations with  neighboring countries and desire regional peace and stability,  they must respect Cambodia's territorial integrity within its  land and sea borders, which was internationally recognized  between 1963 and 1969 in accordance with the UN Charter and  other international laws.    As far as the nearly four million Vietnamese nationals sent  to Cambodia since 1979 are concerned, their true nature is that  of an aggressive force trying to annex Cambodia. In the past,  they served as an abundant source of auxiliary force for the  communist Vietnamese aggressive troops. At present, they are  the instrument of the Hanoi communist Vietnamese in implementing  their strategy of swallowing up Cambodian territory and  exterminating the Cambodian race through demographic warfare.  In this capacity, all types of Vietnamese aggressive forces  must be totally pulled out of Cambodia. The Cambodian nation,  people, and national resistance forces should not be held  responsible for anything that might happen to these communist  Vietnamese forces of aggression. All nations, peoples, and  countries will always rise up and fight foreign forces of  aggression in order to defend themselves, protect their own  right to live, and oppose external aggression and interference,  which constitutes the most elementary principle of the universal  declaration on human rights.    3. The Cambodian nation and people and the national  resistance forces of Democratic Kampuchea are closely monitoring  to see whether the two-headed government is being taken in by  the base and perfidious legalization maneuver of the Hanoi  communist Vietnamese.    Issuing the joint communique with the communist Vietnamese  accepting negotiations on the question of Cambodia's territorial  integrity and border is tantamount to giving the communist  Vietnamese a free hand to legalize their annnexation of  Cambodian territory grabbed since 1979. Any party or individual  who is taken in by the communist Vietnamese maneuver allowing  them to swallow Cambodian territories and send their nationals  to turn Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom must be held  responsible before the nation, the people, and the history of  Cambodia.    [Dated] 19 February 1994    [Signed] The spokesman of the PDK</p>

Speaking to journalists  from his home he said he wanted to think of his future in  politics before making a decision or commenting on it.    Mr Cronje, who also holds the ministerial portfolios of  state  affairs and civil aviation, said that he had spoken to South  African Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha on Saturday night  regarding Mr Mangope's removal from power.    He also spoke to Mr Mangope who "told me what had happened  --  without comment. I think he has accepted what has happened," Mr  Cronje said.    He said he did not think he would take part in the April  elections, adding "for what party?" But Mr Mangope was "fairly  keen" to participate as part of the registered party, the  North-Western Democrats. "The president has enhanced this  country in a very short time with development, infrastructure,  leadership and services -- which is remarkable for Africa and  all this will stand to his credit," he said.    One of the reasons for the collapse of order in  Bophuthatswana was due to agitation from outside. "There were  statements from the ANC's [African National Congress] premier  designate for the North-Western area, Mr Popo Molefe and from Mr  Carl Niehaus of the ANC threatening rolling mass action. There  have been a lot of foreign cars and a lot of strange faces on  the streets since Wednesday," he said.    Mr Cronje said the Freedom Alliance [FA] was a negotiating  alliance and not a political one, and the FA had managed to  negotiate constitutional decisions by a group that differed  politically. "We managed to get more powers for the provinces  and this was to be able to give more power to the provincial  public service to ensure more jobs for civil servants and to  allow them to have work close to home, Mr Cronje said.    He was not able to confirm talk of any collusion between the  BDF [Bophuthatswana Defense Force] and the massive group of  right-wing insurgents that infiltrated the capital of the  fragmented homeland on Friday. What there was evidence of was  that the BDF, one of the top defence forces in Africa, had  rounded them up and kept them contained at the air force  airfield on Friday.    He also could not confirm reports of officers siding with  the  rightists fleeing the homeland. Mr Cronje added that there were  a number of officers in the BDF who had been seconded from the  SADF [South African Defense Force].    He added that the government pensions fund had been audited  by a firm of British actuaries whose finding was that it was the  "soundest pension fund in Africa". He also said the fund did  not even run to the R2 billion [rand] that was allegedly  siphoned off from it.    He also denied any possibility of house arrest for Mr  Mangope  who was being secured by SA Government personnel. "All  governments have a responsibility for all heads of state and  former heads of state for life. If you go to a country place in  George, you will find security around former State President P W  Botha. He is not under house arrest."</p>

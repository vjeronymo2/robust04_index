			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Is Caesar's aide's girlfriend behaving?: Jurek Martin wonders if Washington's pursuit of ethical standards has gone too far The resignation of Mr Mike Espy as US agriculture secretary has set Washington and national tongues clucking again, in a number of unexpected ways. Naturally, the fact that he was accused of taking favours from the agribusiness interests he was supposed to regulate has left the door open for those inclined to the high moral road. Under the direction of Mr Howell Raines in the past two years, editorial comment in the notionally liberal New York Times have torn into the Clinton administration's ethical standards with a savagery that has often rendered conservative commentary superfluous. It said Mr Espy's behaviour 'gave, at the very least, the appearance of conflict of interest. It was also colossally stupid.' It also damned his department, which the newspaper's reporters had found guilty of excessive payments for disaster relief, as 'too close to food producers and farmers'. The Wall Street Journal's editorial column usually blames everything on President Bill Clinton. The Espy affair, it wrote, was consistent with 'the larger story now of people in our politics who are unable to recognise any line between the realms of private and public life'. Much speculation turned, inevitably, on who would be next to go from the cabinet, with Mr Henry Cisneros, the housing secretary, top of most lists. He stands accused of not telling the FBI the full story about his financial arrangements with a former lover when it was conducting background checks before his appointment. He was forced to say he would not resign, but that turned attention to support he was getting from the White House, which has a reputation for giving way under fire. But if all this was easy to predict, others have begun to wonder if the manic pursuit of purity in Washington office-holders is not going too far. A tart editorial in the Baltimore Sun found it hard to believe that a corporation, Tyson Foods of Arkansas, whose lawyer had helped Mrs Hillary Clinton earn Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 63,000) in commodities trading, would bother with a Dollars 1,200 scholarship to Mr Espy's companion, which, indeed, seems to have been the straw that broke his back. 'But,' it added derisively, 'that's what it has come to in Washington. Caesar's assistant's girlfriend has to be above suspicion?' Mr Peter Jennings, the ABC television anchorman, also had his reservations in a radio commentary. Nothing the agriculture secretary may have done would have been illegal while he was a congressman. Mr Jennings told the story of another current cabinet member who, returning from a trip with his wife, took a government car from the airport - but sent his wife home by taxi so as not to infringe any ethical code. The head of the Government Services Agency's chief is the latest on the block for having allegedly transgressed the rules. These standards, tightened by the Clinton administration, are indeed strict. For example, no journalist may buy a civil servant meals worth more than Dollars 20 a session or Dollars 50 a year, which does not buy much in Washington these days. A Washington Post editorial, while concluding that Mr Espy was 'right to resign', wondered at the hypocrisy of a Congress so wedded to special interests that it has killed campaign finance reform and may do the same to lobbying reform. 'Perhaps the people who kill this bill, if they manage to do that, will have the grace to step down too.' There was also something of a rallying to Mr Espy not merely from his fellow blacks but also from both sides of the farming fence, where he was seen as both knowledgeable about the industry and sensitive to consumer interests. But performance on the job - or qualifications for it - matter much less these days. Men and women have been drummed out of town or not let into it for technical breaches of immigration and tax laws concerning domestic help mostly honoured only in the breach. Or, as in the case of Ms Ricki Tigert, only this week confirmed to run the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation after an eight-month delay, agencies have been left headless because of the heinous sin of a presumed friendship with the First Lady. It may be true that the Clinton administration, by raising the ethical banner, left itself open to criticism when its members fell short. Republican exploitation of such shortcomings may also be just standard politics. But when elected office can be bought merely by spending a lot of money, it can seem rough justice when the receipt of just a little means the end of a Washington career.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / South Korean jailed for bribery Mr Ahn Byong-hwa, a former South Korean state utility chairman, was sentenced yesterday to three years in prison for receiving bribes in connection with a multi-billion dollar nuclear power project. The heads of three conglomerates involved in the 1990 project were also found guilty of giving bribes to Mr Ahn and received a suspended 10-month prison sentence each. A three-judge court said the business leaders were given lenient sentences in consideration of their contribution to the nation's economic development. Mr Ahn, who served as president of the state-run Korea Electric Power in 1989-92, was charged with receiving Dollars 1.1m in bribes in connection with a Dollars 2bn nuclear power project. The three business leaders involved are Mr Kim Woo-joong of the Daewoo group, Mr Choi Won-suk of the Mr Dong Ah group and Mr Park Ki-suk of Samsung Construction a construction arm of the giant Samsung group. The outcome came as a surprise in a country where businessmen usually maintain close ties with the government. Few business leaders have been punished in the past although some have been found involved in corruption and other scandals.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: Sterling resilience helps gilts advance strongly UK GOVERNMENT bonds gained up to half a point yesterday, boosted by sterling's resilience and some switching out of the German and French bond markets into gilts. The market started strongly and rose further on news that the Bank of England will issue Pounds 550m in tap stocks for sale today. The long end of the gilt-edged market appears to have benefited from Monday's wage settlement in Germany: market participants feel the Bundesbank will be forced to keep German interest rates high for some time, following the German steelworkers' 6.4 per cent pay increase, thereby reducing the scope for a cut in the UK base rate. 'The high wage settlement in Germany is good for inflation in the UK, so people are switching out of short-dated gilts into longer-dated issues,' said one dealer yesterday. The long end of the market gained up to half a percentage point, with the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rising from 115 13/16 to 116 9/32 by late afternoon. The Liffe gilt futures contract rose from 97.13 to a high of 98.00 before ending at around 97.26. News of the tap issues was well received in the market. The Bank of England is issuing Pounds 150m of the 9 1/2 per cent Treasury loan due 1999, Pounds 150m of the 12 1/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1999 and Pounds 250m of 9 1/2 per cent Conversion stock due 2005. Traders said that demand for the gilts due 1999 was likely to be good as the market is short of these issues. GERMAN government bond prices picked up yesterday, helped by the US Treasury bond market's lead, but closed only slightly higher, having failed to break through an important resistance level. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.83 and traded up to 87.95, but was unable to break through the 88.00 resistance level. JAPANESE government bonds closed lower yesterday following an increase in some short-term interest rates and weakness in the US Treasury bond market on Monday. The yield on the benchmark No 129 moved from its opening level of 5.395 per cent to close at 5.455 in Tokyo, although traders noted that European buying helped to push up prices in London trading with the No 129's yield reaching 5.44 per cent. Three-month certificate of deposit rates continued to rise, trading up to 5.19 per cent yesterday from Monday's level of 5.15 per cent. US TREASURIES followed overseas markets higher yesterday, but trading was thin ahead of today's refunding announcement. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond regained most of Monday's losses, adding to 102 23/32 and yielding 7.76 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities, which fell less dramatically the previous day, posted more modest gains of about  1/8 in late trading. The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange overnight matched sales when Fed funds were trading at 3 7/8 per cent. There was no policy meaning attached to the move, which drains reserves from the banking system. The market initially lost ground after Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, indicated a fur ther easing of monetary policy was unlikely. However, the market later took some of its strength from comments by Mr Greenspan which left the door open for a further easing if economic conditions warrant.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Pressure mounts on Irish coalition: Labour says beef probe has 'serious implications' for partnership Pressure on Ireland's coalition government continues to mount after comments by the chairman of the junior coalition partner that there are 'serious implications for the coalition' in the findings of an inquiry into irregularities in the Irish beef industry. The remarks by Mr Jim Kemmy, the Labour chairman, have frustrated attempts by Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Labour party, to play down the importance of the report. Mr Reynolds, who leads the Fianna Fail half of the coalition, is criticised in the report for his handling of the granting of IPounds 100m (Pounds 99m) of export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq six years ago. Much of the cover went to the Goodman Group, Ireland's biggest beef processor. The question of Labour remaining in coalition will be discussed this month at a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, said Mr Kemmy. The Labour chairman added that the assertion by Mr Reynolds that he had been 'totally vindicated' by the report 'insulted the intelligence of the public'. The inquiry found that Mr Reynolds had the right to grant the credits if he believed it was in the national interest, but also pointed out that 'the national interest would also appear to require that before exposing the state to a potential liability in excess of IPounds 100m, a more detailed investigation or analysis of the benefits to the economy of such decisions . . . should have been carried out.' Such an investigation might have found that much of the beef which was to be exported under the credit insurance was either not Irish or came from European Union intervention stocks, according to the report. 'The benefits to the Irish economy arriving from such exports were illusory rather than real,' concluded the chairman of the inquiry, Mr Justice Liam Hamilton. However, Mr Justice Hamilton concluded there was no evidence that the export credit insurance was granted because of political favouritism. 'There is no evidence to suggest that either the Taoiseach (prime minister, Mr Charles Haughey) at the time or the minister for industry and commerce (Mr Reynolds) was personally close to Mr Larry Goodman, chairman of the Goodman Group, or that Mr Goodman had any political association with either of them or the party they represented.' Mr Spring has adopted a conciliatory approach after at first issuing a response that implicitly criticised Mr Reynolds. Mr Spring called the whole export credit insurance affair 'a major failure of public policy'. But he subsequently identified 'the government of the day' as being responsible rather than singling out Mr Reynolds, who was minister for industry and commerce at the time and approved the granting of the export credit insurance. Mr Spring also denied that his criticism of Mr Reynolds would damage the coalition and said that the coalition 'has a serious agenda of work . . . .' Mr Reynolds said he accepted the findings of the inquiry and looked forward enthusiastically to dealing with them when the Irish parliament was recalled at the end of the month, specifically to discuss the report. But publication of the report comes at a time when the Labour party is still licking its wounds after a poor showing in the European elections and in opinion polls and many Labour MPs who gained seats in the wave of anti-Fianna Fail sentiments in the 1991 elections are increasingly uncomfortable. The party is also being attacked for supporting the hard line being taken by the management of Team Aer Lingus, the state-owned aircraft maintenance company, with its unions. Last month, the coalition was embarrassed by revelations that Irish passports were granted to the family of a Palestinian businessman who invested Pounds 1m in Mr Reynolds' family business. The next real test of the coalition's cohesion will be its handling of attempts by the Goodman group to avail of a tax amnesty to settle liabilities uncovered during the tribunal investigations. In the course of the inquiry it was discovered that the Goodman group made tax repayments of more than IPounds 8.5m to its employees between 1983 and 1990. The company is now trying to settle the liability under a general tax amnesty announced in 1993. The government has chosen to leave it to the revenue commissioners to decide if Goodman qualifies for the amnesty but there is growing public and political pressure on Labour to oppose the granting of the amnesty. It will not be forgotten that the setting up of the inquiry in 1991 followed the collapse into examinership (administration) of the Goodman Group, when allegations of irregularities by Goodman companies were made in the media and the Irish parliament, including by Mr Spring.</p>

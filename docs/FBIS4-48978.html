			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y. C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 27 (CNA) -- Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng will represent Taiwan at the fifth  working party meeting on Taiwan's accession to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) scheduled for May 17-19 in  Geneva.    Sheu said Wednesday [27 April] that he will travel to Geneva  from Washington, D.C., where he will meet with US officials on  tariff issues May 9-10.    During the forthcoming GATT working party meeting, he noted,  he will also hold bilateral consultations with Canada, Mexico,  and the European Union.    The fifth working party meeting will be the first such  meeting this year. The fourth meeting was held last October.    So far, 21 countries have asked for bilateral tariff  negotiations with Taiwan, of which 14 have made tariff reduction  requests, he said. Japan and the European Union, two of  Taiwan's major trading partners, have not yet submitted their  reduction requests, he added.    Taiwan has held tariff reduction talks with the United  States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Africa, and  Hungary.    Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu of the Board of Foreign  Trade (BOFT) is currently heading a delegation to the  Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand for similar talks, while  BOFT Director- General Huang Yen-chao is now in Tokyo for  informal tariff talks with Japanese officials.    Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are  expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth entry into the  Geneva-based world trade regulating body.    Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September  1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Court trims EC anti-cartel fines A European court yesterday reduced EC fines on some chemical companies accused of operating a cartel in polypropylene, writes David Buchan in Brussels. The Court of First Instance reduced the fines on Shell from Ecu9m (Pounds 6.39m) to Ecu8.1m, on ICI from Ecu10m to 9m, and on Huls of Germany from Ecu2.7m to 2.3m, because it said these companies were not part of the cartel for as long as the Commission had claimed.</p>

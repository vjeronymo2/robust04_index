The Naval Forces Are Being Replenished With New  Cadres'"]    [Text] The latest round of negotiations of government  delegations from Ukraine and Russia, headed by Yukhin  Zvyahinskyy and Viktor Chornomyrdinyy, on the fate of the Black  Sea Fleet have concluded in Moscow.    As in Sevastopol during the meeting of the ministers of  defense of Ukraine and Russia, a final and mutually acceptable  solution was still not able to be reached, but the negotiations  will be continued in a few days.    The military delegation of Ukraine at the meeting in  Moscow was Deputy Minister of Defense of Ukraine Colonel-General  Ivan Bizhan, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Navy [VMSU]  Vice-Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy and the VMSU Operations  Directorate Chief Rear-Admiral Viktor Fomin.    Vice-Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy answered the  questions of our correspondents immediately after his return to  Sevastopol.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Volodymyr Herasymovych, the latest  round of negotiations pertaining to the Black Sea Fleet have  unfortunately ended with their postponement. But doesn't there  have to be some resolution?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] Yes, there has to be a resolution, and  there will be. There is still no conceptual framework, however,  that would satisfy both Ukraine and Russia. But there is much, I  am confident, that will be accomplished by the delegations over  the time until the next round, and our positions will move even  closer together. I want to emphasize that the negotiations on  the fate of the Black Sea Fleet are proceeding in constructive  fashion for the first time, even though there are plenty of  mutual claims.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] What were the initial positions of  the parties to the negotiations?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The Moscow Resolution of the presidents  of Ukraine and Russia regarding the division of the Black Sea  Fleet and the gradual split of the forces was made inherent in  them. The data worked out by the military delegations in  Sevastopol have become the base data on the vessel inventory.  Our figures and the Russian ones, true, differed when they were  put forward. The reason is that we did not have time to confirm  the lists of ships in Sevastopol. The April negotiations, you  may recall, were broken off suddenly. The military experts of  the Black Sea Fleet that are part of the Russian delegation have  now advanced new data with regard to the numerical composition  of the ships in the fleet. We will return to this question and  continue to coordinate it.    The aircraft and shore troops of the Black Sea Fleet will  also be divided "fifty--fifty" in accordance with the Yalta  agreement.    The most problematical issue in the negotiations is the  basing of the fleets and the use of the infrastructure. It is  too early to comment on that; it has not been worked out.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Volodymyr Herasymovych, you may  recall that the Minister of Defense of Russia, General of the  Army Grachev, stated in Sevastopol that the negotiations on the  Black Sea Fleet could last into eternity with the Ukrainian  approach to them. How would you comment on that statement?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The Moscow meeting proved that the work  of both the Russian and the Ukrainian parties is being conducted  in the required channels. Ukraine has a mutually accepted  formula that permits the preservation of all constitutional  provisions connected with the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of the state. An enormous number of legal and economic  aspects must be taken into account.    I have said earlier, and will emphasize again, that we are  discussing deeply the details at the negotiations on the fate of  the Black Sea Fleet for the first time. Because any political  problem that is resolved from above but has not been worked out  at the technical level will always be declarative, as it was  before. The fact that we are working on each object in the fleet  that is subject to division in profound and concrete fashion is  a cause for optimism today.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] What, in your opinion, is the  difference between the negotiations in Sevastopol and Moscow?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The difference is that the Russian  delegation has taken a clear-cut position for the first time in  Moscow. They have been discussing the questions that came up in  Sevastopol for the first time. It is felt from everything that  the delegation has the aim of resolving the problem of the Black  Sea Fleet.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The Minister of Defense of  Ukraine,  General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy, stated in  Sevastopol that the servicemen of the Ukrainian Navy would be  receiving the same pay as the sailors of the Black Sea Fleet. At  what stage of resolution is that question?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] That question has been coordinated with  the government of Ukraine. It remains only to resolve the  problem of the Black Sea Fleet. I think that the signing of an  agreement on the fleet and an increase in pay for our sailors  will coincide.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Draftees are coming into the Black  Sea Fleet today only from Russia. How do you regard that fact on  the eve of the division of the fleet?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] I feel that it should be regarded just  as it is.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The negotiations in Moscow on the  fate of the Black Sea Fleet coincided with the well-known  decision of the Crimean parliament and the unprecedented state  of mind that is being fanned by the mass media...    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The literally explosive situation on  the  peninsula has been created by those forces for which it is  advantageous. Even Minister of Defense of Russia General of the  Army Pavel Grachev has been drawn into the swirl of  disinformation. I met with journalists from Ostankino. Even  those people, with their particular approach to covering the  situation in the Crimea, were struck by the unbridled nature of  the sources of information, or rather disinformation.    The situation in the Crimea is calm, and is being monitored.  There is no objective data regarding a worsened situation.  Everyone needs to calm down and stop "making waves." I have to  say on this account that several days ago there was scarcely any  explosive situation in Izmayil. It was done by the hand of one  person alone.    The commander of a brigade of river vessels of the Black Sea  Fleet, very "relaxed," started issuing commands for which  epaulets were removed during the times of the USSR. Sounding the  alarm, he shifted the formation to heightened readiness. He did,  in short, wholly intolerable things that even his subordinates  did not accept, and they were forced to calm down their furious  commander.    It seems to me that this occurred owing to the aggravation  of  the situation in the Crimea. Remember the television and  newspaper "canards" about thousands of Ukrainian special-forces  troops that had landed on the peninsula? This was funny and sad  at the same time. This information, if I can call it that, after  all, had a very strong impact on the nerves. The figure of  60,000 special-forces troops was bandied about in the press. But  what were these special forces? They were a specific subunit,  very small in size. The number of these specialists in any  nation is tens or, at a maximum, hundreds of people, or in any  case not more than a thousand. You would only get 60,000 people  if you added up the numbers of the Black Sea Fleet, the armed  forces of Ukraine, the police and National Guard in Crimea  anyway. So there was nothing for the Crimeans to be worried  about.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] Volodymyr Herasymovych, let us  return to the affairs of the Ukrainian Navy. What were the  results of the winter training period?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] We recently summarized the results. A  commission of the General Staff was working on it. The  evaluations that we assigned to the formations, units and ships  were confirmed. I personally regard the fulfillment of the plan  for the winter period as successful. This was thanks to the fact  that the staffs prepared the aircraft and shore troops well, we  were supplied with fuel and the ships went out to sea.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The shipbuilding program has been  lost to view under all of the political events. What ships will  be joining the navy in the near future?    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] The missile cruiser Ukrayina and an  air-cushion assault ship will be joining the force composition  this year. A small hydrofoil ASW ship is virtually finished.    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] The idea is circulating that the  Ukrainian Navy does not need the Ukrayina, and it could be  bought by Russia.    [V.H. Bezkorovaynyy] If we had a considerable selection of  ships, then we certainly could talk about that. But since we do  not have such a selection today, we can make use of this  cruiser. As for "buying" it, I feel that Russia is not able to  do that. It has not found either the forces or the funds to  finish the aircraft carrier Varyag that is at Mykolayiv. The  cost of finishing off the Varyag is equivalent to the cost of  the cruiser Ukrayina.    The Varyag has been abandoned, so the question of finishing  it (I speak as an expert) has passed forever, even though some  political figures of Russia, visiting Sevastopol, have announced  that they are ready to buy the whole Black Sea Fleet, Sevastopol  and a portion of Crimea all together right now. If they are that  rich, why can't they buy an unfinished ship? Why can't they  finish the repairs of ASW ships at our yards? Why are they not  able to pay for the overhaul of ships in Bulgaria and pay others  for the repair of a single ship? The question of finances is  just as difficult for Russia as for us. The Varyag will most  likely go for scrap, while the Ukrayina will "float."    [Kondratyev, Shcherbakov] We also hope that the Ukrainian  Navy will soon become a mighty force, able to defend the  interests of the state at sea.</p>

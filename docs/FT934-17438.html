			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: S Korea finds two sides to high yen THE RISE of the yen is proving to be a double-edged sword for South Korea, illustrating the complexity of its economic relations with Japan. On the one hand, South Korea is enjoying an export boom and taking business from Japanese competitors as its price competitiveness improves with the won's 18 per cent fall against the yen this year. On the other, Korean companies are having to pay more for the vital Japanese machinery and components on which their industries are highly dependent. On the plus side, Korean shipyards expect to receive a record number of orders in 1993 and surpass Japan as the world's biggest shipbuilder. Car manufacturers predict that shipments could match the export peak of 576,000 vehicles reached in 1988. The country's three main electronics companies reported that their exports of semiconductors and consumer products rose 52 per cent during the first half of 1993. Analysts predict that Korea's trade balance could record a slight surplus in 1993 after four years of deficits. Particularly encouraging is the growing number of industrial orders from Japan, which has maintained a persistent trade surplus with Korea since it established diplomatic ties with its former colony in 1965. Japanese companies are buying more steel products, petrochemicals, vehicle parts and ships from Korea. But this does not mean that Korea's trade deficit with Japan will shrink. 'As Korea's exports increase, the more industrial parts it needs to import from Japan,' says Mr Stephen Marvin, head of research at Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul. He predicts that Korea's trade deficit with Japan will increase slightly to Dollars 8bn in 1993 from last year's Dollars 7.9bn. The import of Japanese machinery and components heavily outweighs Korea's trade surplus in agricultural and consumer goods to Japan. The trade deficit with Japan would be even larger if Korea had not virtually banned more than 250 Japanese products, including cars and consumer electronics, during the last two decades as part of an 'import diversification policy'. The rising cost of Japanese industrial equipment is also causing problems for the Seoul government as it tries to revive the ailing economy. It planned that industrial investments would be the main engine for boosting domestic demand and increasing gross national product growth above last year's 4.8 per cent, the slowest since 1980. But Korean companies are reluctant to expand their facilities when the cost of Japanese equipment is so high. Korea imports 35 per cent of its machinery from Japan and 40 per cent of its electronic components. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy recently estimated that the trade deficit with Japan would grow to Dollars 9.8bn by 1998, although its ratio to the Korean GNP would decline from 2.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The reason for the persistent gap is that during Korea's rush to industrialise in the 1960s and 1970s, it neglected to develop an adequate network of subcontractors to supply components to the country's big conglomerates. In addition, Korean businessmen acknowledge that Japanese production equipment is of superior quality and cost efficient. The government has partly succeed in reducing dependence on Japanese technology by promoting the local production of some capital goods. State financing of Won588bn (Dollars 726m) in soft loans will be provided in the next five years to small and medium-sized businesses for the development of 3,500 machinery items and components now imported from Japan. Tax breaks are also being offered to Korean companies that buy domestic production equipment. Seoul believes the long-term solution to the trade problem is the transfer of Japanese technology to South Korea. But Japan fears that supplying advanced technology to Korea would only enable it to become a more formidable competitor. Mitsubishi, for example, was dropped from the recent competition to build Korea's high-speed train because it refused to accept Seoul's demands for technology transfers. Although Japan has been the biggest foreign investor in Korea, it now prefers to invest in south-east Asia and China because Korean wages are the highest on the Asian mainland. However, Tokyo last year agreed to help establish a Dollars 20m foundation that would funnel technology from Japanese to Korean companies. The action was seen as an attempt to defuse mounting criticism against Japan for its use of Korean women as military prostitutes, or 'comfort girls', during the second world war. In return, Seoul agreed to allow Japanese trading houses to expand their operations in Korea, although limiting their role to exporting Korean products. It banned them from import activity. It also plans to halve the number of Japanese products on the import ban list from the current 258 items by 1998. Japan will also be given the same intellectual property protection that Korea has granted to the EC.</p>

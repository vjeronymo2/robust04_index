			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed and untitled introduction to series of </F> articles]    [Text] Our time is truly unpredictable for  long-suffering Russia. Each new day reveals new hotbeds of  social tension. Miners, oil-field workers and gas-field workers  are striking. A pre-strike state has been declared by textile  and light industry workers and those of a number of other  sectors. VUZ [higher educational institution] teachers and  students have been pushed to the limit. What can be said about  those who, through the actions of the stepfathers of reform,  have long since found themselves to be in dire poverty? And they  amount to no less than a third of the population!    So what now -- a global wave of protest capable, just  like a tsunami, of destroying, once and for all, the foundations  of stability and burying forever the hopes for economic and  social revitalization?    "No!" declare commodity producers from a number of  Russia's central and northwestern oblasts. A strike is not the  way out of the situation. It just aggravates the situation.    Having combined their own efforts with the trade unions  and drawn up a number of common urgent demands, they are  proposing as the last civilized step a constructive dialog with  the government and the president on steering the reforms into a  creative channel.    And so -- the regions have spoken!    The government must respond by acting!</p>

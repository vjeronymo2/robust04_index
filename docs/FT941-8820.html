			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Ukraine shies from continuing squeeze The Ukrainian government is coming close to abandoning a tight three-month credit squeeze and is slowly bending to political pressure to issue a flood of new credits worth nearly 10 per cent of the country's gross domestic product. Not even the presence in Kiev this week of an International Monetary Fund team, offering a Dollars 700m (Pounds 474m) loan in support of tighter monetary policies, appears to have softened demands for new growth in the money supply. So far, the credit squeeze has been left to function without any accompanying fiscal support. 'Strict monetary policy without reform is empty,' Mr Victor Yushchenko, national bank chairman, told the FT. 'It's plain cruelty when someone hasn't received his salary in five months. The only way is to issue new money.' Eighty days ago Ukraine began its first crude attempt to combat hyperinflation by a sudden clampdown on the money supply. Annual inflation was over 9,000 per cent in 1993. In December, with the squeeze in effect, inflation slowed to 190 per cent. However, the squeeze hit all enterprises, solvent and failing. Many workers have not been paid. Others have been sent home on unpaid leave and enterprises have been unable to pay bills. But after this brief adventure with a tough anti-inflationary policy, the government is on the retreat. Mr Leonid Kuchma, former prime minister and an active campaigner in next month's parliamentary elections, has reportedly vowed to bring the government down if credits are not released to enterprises.</p>

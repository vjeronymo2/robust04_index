			<p>BFN     [Text] Newly appointed Foreign Minister Antonio Martino  will meet his colleagues of the European Union [EU] in Brussels  tomorrow. This will be his first public engagement. Today he  summoned the Italian ambassadors in Europe to a meeting in the  Belgian capital. Francesco Mattioli reports:    [Begin Mattioli recording] Is there an Italian problem for  our European partners?    [Martino] I would not call it an Italian problem. However,  there is no doubt that we must immediately tell our European  partners -- and also the U.S. -- that our foreign policy will  not change much. [end recording]    [Mattioli] Antonio Martino -- as his first public engagement  as the newly-appointed foreign minister -- has decided to take  this message to Brussels. He will meet Jacques Delors and the  EU foreign ministers tomorrow. This afternoon he met the  Italian ambassadors based in countries of the European Union.  The problem of the Italian eastern borders does not exist,  Martino said. It is not on the agenda. However, at a time of  important changes, there is a need to explain the changes to the  European family.    [Begin Martion recording] The governments of the various  European countries always exchange information about domestic  politics and on foreign policy strategies. Of course such a  need is even greater now that the Italian political scene is  changing so much. This is why I decided to rush here without  even waiting for the confidence vote.    [Mattioli] So you want to reassure that there will be no  changes, in spite of statements made by some people?    [Martino] Absolutely. Of course I am absolutely not saying  that nothing will change. What I am saying is that the main  points of the Italian foreign policy will remain the same as in  the past. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck names new stores chief SEARS, ROEBUCK, the large US retailing and financial services group, yesterday announced that it was appointing Mr Arthur Martinez to take charge of its troubled stores division. Mr Martinez was formerly with Saks Fifth Avenue, where he was a vice-chairman with responsibility for the company's administrative functions. Prior to that, he was in charge of the extensive retail interests which Britain's BAT Industries owned in the US until they were sold off in 1990. Mr Martinez's appointment comes in the wake of considerable investor unhappiness over the performance of Sears's retail operations. Although the division is one of the biggest retail businesses in the US with sales of Dollars 31.4bn in 1991 and 362,400 employees, it has been dogged by an uncompetitive cost base, a loss-making catalogue operation and stagnating sales. In 1991, Sears's domestic retail operations (excluding the credit business) made profits of just Dollars 90m. In August 1990, Mr Edward Brennan, Sears's chairman, resumed direct responsibility for the retail division, and large cost-cutting moves have followed. However, with little sign of significant sales improvements, shareholder agitation has continued. At the annual meeting in May, five dissident motions gained stronger-than-expected support, although none were passed. Yesterday, Sears said that Mr Martinez would be responsible for all retail, catalogue and direct marketing, credit, product services and international operations of the Sears Merchandise Group, with effect from September 1. He will also be a member of the Sears, Roebuck corporate management committee, which also includes the heads of Sears's financial services subsidiaries. Mr Martinez became a vice-chairman at Saks, when the department store chain was bought by Investcorp, a Middle East-backed investment company, from Britain's BAT Industries in 1990. He had previously been group chief executive for the retail division of Batus, BAT's holding company in the US. Here, he was responsible for four sizeable stores chains - Marshall Field's, J. B. Ivey, Breuner's, as well as Saks - all of which were sold by BAT in the wake of Sir James Goldsmith's bid for the group in 1989.</p>

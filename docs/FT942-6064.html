			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: TT&amp;T is valued at Dollars 3.4bn on first day Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, the consortium installing 1m new telephone lines in Thailand's provinces, was valued at Dollars 3.4bn when its shares were traded on the local stock exchange for the first time yesterday. After opening at Bt190, compared with an initial public offering price of Bt145, the shares fell along with the rest of the market and closed lower at Bt171. TT&amp;T is the fourth-largest company by capitalisation on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, after TelecomAsia (which is installing 2m new lines in the capital) Bangkok Bank and Siam Cement. After years of inadequate investment by state telephone companies, the work being carried out by TT&amp;T will more than double the number of provincial telephone lines, and the company is expected to benefit from rapid economic growth outside Bangkok during its 25-year concession. A survey by Sofrecom of France showed there were on average only 1.33 lines per 100 people in the provinces, compared with 16.13 in Bangkok. TT&amp;T has to pay 43.1 per cent of its gross revenue from the new lines to the state Telephone Organisation of Thailand, whereas TelecomAsia pays only 16 per cent. But higher total revenues per line in the provinces should give TT&amp;T a bigger net income per line than TelecomAsia by 1998, according to a recent report by Peregrine Nithi Finance and Securities. Net profit is forecast to rise from a negligible Bt31m (Dollars 1.2m) this year to Bt1.28bn next year and Bt2.49bn in 1996.</p>

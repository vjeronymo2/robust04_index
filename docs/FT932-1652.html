			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Rebel warlord keeps up pressure ONLY A DAY after a rebel military leader announced he was ready to step into Azerbaijan's political vacuum and assume power, several of his men have entered the capital of Baku. Fresh negotiations have been launched to try to end his revolt but it is becoming clear that the republic's acting leader, Mr Gaidar Aliyev, is losing control. The rebel warlord, Mr Surat Husseinov, has a 50-man band dug in on Baku's southern outskirts, with three tanks pointed towards the capital. Several of his men were seen inside the capital yesterday afternoon but their motives were unclear. The capital seemed peaceful and there was no apparent tension despite Mr Husseinov's warning on Monday that he might decide to take power. The parliamentary chairman, Mr Aliyev, who has served as the republic's de facto leader since the elected president, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, fled and secretly took refuge in his home village last week, said yesterday that he was still discussing Mr Husseinov's demands. Privately, Mr Aliyev told foreign diplomats on Monday that Mr Husseinov was demanding to be made president or prime minister. He also wanted to be given effective control over the important ministries of defence, interior and state security, or KGB.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' has declared that the Arab League Council adopted a  resolution calling on the international community to put  pressure on Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  and place its nuclear weapons under international inspection.  This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states'  demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons.    In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab  League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council  had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to  renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may  not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons  of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and,  therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests.    On the Arab position toward France following its recent  agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel,  al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable  consolidation of French-Israeli ties recently and following the  Israeli massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time  when we are discussing the peace process and despite the fact  that Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons  and is occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that  the matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab  League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one  that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms  Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance.    The Syrian foreign minister noted that it had been agreed  within the Arab League Council not to debate the issue of the  Arab boycott of Israel during the current session. He stressed  that the boycott cannot be lifted without Israel's withdrawal  from the occupied Arab territories. He added: The boycott is a  law, and the law is indivisible. Besides, there is no Arab  decision to lift the boycott, and if some states have made  unilateral decisions in this regard, this has nothing to do with  the Arab League.    Discussing peace, al-Shar' said Syria rejects the  step-by-step policy and seeks to achieve a comprehensive and  just peace that will secure the Arabs' legitimate rights. He  noted that Syria's stand stipulates that Jerusalem is part of  the occupied Arab territories and Syria demands a complete  Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for a comprehensive  peace.    He said Israel has not yet agreed to this measure and he  affirmed that, as long as the peace is not comprehensive, it  will not lead to security and stability in the region.    He pointed out that the Arab League Council discussed the  water issue and expressed its support for the Syrian stance on  the Tigris an Euphrates Rivers, two international rivers to  which international laws and norms apply. He said the council  asked Syria to present legal and political studies on this  problem because water security is vital to the Arab countries.    He added that the Arab League Council reviewed numerous  problems facing the Arab countries, such as Iraq, Libya, Sudan,  Yemen, Algeria, and Somalia. He noted that such discussion is a  positive factor in openness among the Arabs to push things in  the direction of Arab reconciliation. He said the Arab nation  should not pause at the Gulf crisis and that it must work to  remedy the current serious disorder.</p>

			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers Oddbins has followed up its successful policy of selling small lots of cask-strength malt whiskies. The latest are a Scapa 1983, from the least well-known of Orkney's two working distilleries (Pounds 19.99); Brora 1972, from a now-closed distillery in the Highlands (Pounds 29.99); Springbank 1973, from Campbeltown (Pounds 29.99); and Ardbeg 1978 from Islay (Pounds 29.99). The Scapa is predictably light; the Brora exceptional; the Springbank marred slightly by a too-obvious Bourbon cask note; and the Ardbeg, with its peaty Islay reek, very worthy. Oddbins, incidentally, has pulled off a considerable coup in introducing Islay spring water (79p for 75cls) to its range. This authentically brown, peaty Islay water provides an authentic counterpoint to your best malts. The sherry house of Gonzalez Byass has released two sherries known previously only on the Spanish market. These are their ManzaniIIa El Rociol (cPounds 6.49) and their super-sweet Pedro Ximenez dessert wine Noe (cPounds 18.59). The former is a fine Manzanilla - essentially, a dry fino aged by the sea to give it a salty tang. The 25-year-old Noe', with 450 grams of unfermented sugar per litre, is said to be wonderful with ice cream. For stockists, call 071-491-0623.</p>

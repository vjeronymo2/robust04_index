			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HALLOWEEN TRICKS CAN LEAD TO COURT  </P> <P> Stories of pins in apples and other hazards are common to Halloween, but there  is a lesser-known concern for parents on the annual fright night: getting sued.  </P> <P> Mischief -- from the vandalism of breaking windows to causing a traffic  accident by throwing eggs at cars -- can result in a parent going to court.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, children like to get into trouble on Halloween and that can  come back to haunt (their parents)," said Vaughn de Kirby, a personal injury  attorney in San Diego.  </P> <P> In California, parents are not usually liable for their children's actions  unless there is a specific law pertaining to that action, but there are four  major exceptions and each is applicable to Halloween mischief.  </P> <P> Parents may be held liable if they know their child is likely to cause trouble  but take no precautions; if the child deliberately does something he or she  knows is wrong; if the child has access to firearms; and if the child causes  damage and injury while driving the family vehicle.  </P> <P> Courts have ruled that a parent is not liable -- unless negligence is involved  -- for their children's "friendly play" that results in injury or damage. But  when children purposefully do something wrong, their parents are liable for up  to $10,000 for each person injured or for damaged property.  </P> <P> De Kirby mentioned a case in which a 5-year-old child pushed and injured his  baby-sitter on Halloween. The parents never told the baby-sitter about the  child's behavior problems and thus were liable for the baby-sitter's injuries,  he said.  </P> <P> "It can be anything from throwing eggs and water balloons to typical Halloween  mischief that turns into vandalism," de Kirby said. "I've found that a lot of  parents are simply not aware of their liability under the law, and the chances  for something like this happening are greatly increased on Halloween."  </P> <P> Halloween also is a prime night for teen-agers to go celebrating in cars,  creating an especially dangerous situation with so many costumed children  trick-or-treating, de Kirby added.  </P> <P> Under California law, parents are liable for their children's negligence,  wrongful acts or omissions when operating the family vehicle, even if the child  does not get the parents' permission to take the car. Damages are limited to  $15,000 for injury or death of one person and $30,000 for more than one person.  Property damages are limited to $5,000 per accident. No one is liable for  punitive damages.  </P> <P> For the types of dangers more typically associated with Halloween, a few  hospitals in the San Diego area continue to offer free X-rays of candy and  other goodies on Halloween, but many hospitals have dropped the service, saying  it is ineffective.  </P> <P> X-rays do not detect many foreign objects, poisons and other contaminants in  fruit, candy and other edible treats, said Children's Hospital spokesman Mark  Morelli.  </P> <P> "It lulls parents into a false sense of security. A better precaution is good  common sense," including parental supervision of their children while  trick-or-treating and inspection of all goodies, Morelli said.  </P> <P> While there have been no confirmed incidents of children being injured by  tainted candy in San Diego in recent years, each Halloween a few children are  struck by vehicles or suffer other injuries due to masks that hinder their  vision or costumes that restrict movements, officials said.  </P> <P> "That's very important -- a mask that doesn't block a child's view," Morelli  said. "There are usually a couple of traffic accidents where the child is all  excited and runs into the street and doesn't see the car (because of the  mask)."  </P> <P> An alternative to masks are cosmetics, which allow greater creativity than a  mask and will not block a child's vision, officials said.  </P> <P> Because Halloween safety concerns are emphasized in school, many children  already know to use common sense when trick-or-treating, said Eileen Callahan,  spokeswoman for the UC San Diego Medical Center. The San Diego Regional Poison  Center, a unit of the medical center, sends staffers into schools to educate  children on the dangers of Halloween.  </P> <P> Halloween safety tips include:  </P> <P> * Young children should trick-or-treat before dark and always be accompanied by  an adult.  </P> <P> * Costumes should be light-colored, fitted to prevent tripping, have reflective  tape if worn after nightfall and be flame resistant. (Remember this means the  material can catch fire but will resist burning.)  </P> <P> * Children should carry a flashlight and stay in their neighborhoods, visit  only the homes of people they know and avoid houses with no lights on.  </P> <P> * No unwrapped candy should be accepted and goodies should not be eaten until  examined by an adult.  </P> <P> * Discard any candy not in its original wrapper or in a wrapper that might have  been tampered with.  </P> <P> * Children should observe basic safety precautions and be especially cautious  when crossing the street.  </P> <P> * Motorists should be on the alert for trick-or-treaters.  </P> <P> * Those expecting trick-or-treaters should remove objects from their yards that  are a hazard to children, such as sprinklers and garden tools.  </P> <P> * Dogs should be kept in the house or otherwise restrained.  </P> <P> * Alternative treats include nuts, raisins, sugar-free candy, stickers, finger  puppets and other inexpensive novelty items.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Andrey Sitov]    [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- Present-day Sino-Russian  cooperation should also cover military technology, Sergey  Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Defence, told  ITAR-TASS.    "All basic types of Chinese armaments are virtiually the  same  which the Soviet Army relied upon. China, it seems, is  interested in our weapons by virtue of the established  conditions. I do not see any reasons that would preclude at  least the maintenance of the level which has been achieved in  this respect," Yushenkov said.    "The United States has renounced a ban on the granting of  the  most-favoured-nation trading status to China. Why should Russia  keep aloof? If the United States has granted such a status, it  has serious grounds to draw conclusions on the state of affairs  in China. One can cast doubt on the conclusions, of course.  But this, to my mind, would cost a pretty penny," the  parliamentarian recalled.</p>

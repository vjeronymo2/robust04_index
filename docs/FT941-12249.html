			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Government ignored warnings on pensions The government ignored warnings by pensions specialists nearly 10 years ago about the dangers of allowing personal pensions to be sold by a self-regulated life insurance industry, it has emerged. Documents from the National Association of Pension Funds, the occupational pensions industry group, show that senior figures in the industry told the government in 1984 and 1985 that strict controls had to be placed on sales agents to prevent abuse. Personal pensions legislation was then under consideration by the Department of Health and Social Security headed by Sir Norman Fowler. Government incentives to encourage personal pensions took effect in July 1988. The documents have come to light as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, is preparing an investigation into up to 500,000 cases of people who were persuaded to transfer out of their employers' schemes into less attractive personal pensions. A pilot study by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, published at the end of last year, showed that in 90 per cent of files examined, sales agents collected too little information to be able properly to advise their clients. Mr Colin Lever, of consulting actuaries Bacon and Woodrow who was chairman of the NAPF in 1984, said the association's warnings were dismissed by some government officials and by the life insurance industry as 'self interest'. 'Everyone is acting so surprised now. But what we were saying was that people need protection,' he added. The association's warnings were given in response to a government green paper on social security reforms in September 1985. The association wrote: 'Stringent investor protection is essential if the proposals for personal pensions are to gain any semblance of public acceptability.' It added that the plans then under way for self regulation in the life insurance industry were inadequate. The response echoed warnings issued a year earlier by the association to a government panel. Among the specific protections it recommended were several which government officials now believe are necessary to protect buyers of life insurance and pensions. These include full disclosure by life insurance companies of fees and charges - including sales agents' commissions - and disclosure of penalties for early surrender of policies. The NAPF feared that employers' schemes would lose younger members to personal pensions plans and pensions for older workers would become more expensive for employers. MGN pension deal, Page 20</p>

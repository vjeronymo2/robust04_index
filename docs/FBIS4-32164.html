			<p>BFN     [Text] Wroclaw, June 18 -- President Lech Walesa on  Saturday told a news conference in Wroclaw that defence is the  pillar of the state while last four years have not been fully  used by politicians to build a strong and effective defence  system in Poland. He vowed that acting on advice of the General  Staff he will veto the 1995 Budget Law if it does not allocate  more funds for the Defence Ministry.    Earlier in the day, the president who is also the superior  of  the armed forces attended a ceremony of promoting the graduates  of Wroclaw's Tadeusz Kosciuszko Officers' College to the rank of  second lieutenant. The promotion was carried out by chief of  the army's General Staff General Tadeusz Wilecki.    Congratulating the newly-promoted 241 graduates, Walesa said  the homeland will never dissapoint them and added he will do his  best to improve the army's bad financial situation, claiming  that one mustn't "economize on the army."    Asked by journalists about the forthcoming visit of the U.S.  President to Poland, Walesa vowed to tell Bill Clinton that  Poland wants to rapidly and strongly integrate economically and  militarily with Europe. He said he will stress that it is in  the the United States's interest that Europe is included within  one security system.    Walesa touched upon the 1995 presidential elections and told  newsmen that he will conduct his next presidential campaign in a  way that is different from what journalists and politicians  "imagine and contrive." The president stated he wants to be  re-elected because he has not completed his work and built  democracy in Poland. The promotion ceremonies were also held in  Poznan, Deblin, Koszalin, Jelenia Gora, Zegrze and Torun, with  the presidential chancellery ministers attending.    Also on Saturday, head of the National Security Bureau  Henryk  Goryszewski handed a banner to the elite airborne troops of the  Krakow military district. Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk  attended the ceremony. A similar event was held in Bydgoszcz  where a banner was given to an air defence unit by secretary of  state at the presidential chancellery, minister Mieczyslaw  Wachowski. A mass was later said by the Polish Army's Field  Bishop Leszek Slawoj Glodz.</p>

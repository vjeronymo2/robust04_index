			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: General Electric to enter credit card market GENERAL ELECTRIC, the US conglomerate, yesterday unveiled plans to enter the highly competitive US credit card market. GE Capital, the group's financial subsidiary, said it was launching a credit card, linked to the MasterCard system, that would also offer discounts to consumers through a partnership with a broad range of leading US retailers, hotels and airlines. While the card will have all the features of MasterCard, including acceptance at 10m locations around the world, GE Capital said its distinction lay in offering annual savings of up to Dollars 1,000. The GE Rewards MasterCard, as it is being called, offers Dollars 10 of vouchers for every Dollars 500 of purchases. In addition, participating retailers will offer savings certificates good for a Dollars 10 discount every three months. Cardholders are also to be offered rebates if they use the GE card to sign up for services, such as the Sprint long-distance telephone network or cable television services such as HBO and Cinemax. Discounts will also be available if the card is used to buy GE appliances. GE, whose activities cover the manufacturing, financial services, media and technology sectors, may have picked an awkward moment to launch its new card, which will carry an annual Dollars 25 fee. Consumer spending has been depressed for many months and credit card delinquencies have been running at high levels. Mr Gary Wendt, chairman of GE Capital, said the card was designed to address the US consumer's shift 'from conspicuous consumption to prudent purchasing'. Mr David Nissen, chairman of GE Capital's consumer financial services division, added that 'this is a huge market and we believe our card is unique as a value-backed product'. GE Capital's activities in the credit card market to date involve the company's handling of marketing, issuing on behalf of third parties, collections and customer services. The company says it services 65m cardholder accounts in the US, Canada and Britain. See Technology</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS POMONA COUNCIL;  </P> <P> WOULD-BE SUCCESSORS TO POLITICAL MAVERICK BRYANT TREAD SOFTLY  </P> <P> Until he was recalled in June, C. L. (Clay) Bryant was the City Council's  maverick: bold and blunt, outgoing, outspoken and outrageous.  </P> <P> His would-be successors describe themselves as stable, solid and practical.  They pause before they speak and choose their words carefully.  </P> <P> After a time of turbulence in city government, "people are looking for somebody  with stability and common sense," candidate Boyd Bredenkamp said.  </P> <P> Bob Dahms and Nancy Lopez, who are competing with Bredenkamp in the Sept. 18  special election to fill the unexpired portion of Bryant's term, said they  admired Bryant for his compassionate nature and his ambition to improve the  city, but not for his style.  </P> <P> "You don't need to make a public ordeal of your problems," Dahms said.  </P> <P> Lopez said Bryant put too much energy into political battles. "Why waste time  getting even, when there is so much to do?" she asked.  </P> <P> Still, even though the candidates have been cautious in their remarks, the  campaign has been heating up. A Bredenkamp supporter has filed a complaint with  the city clerk accusing Dahms of lying about his address when he registered to  vote. And the mayor and council members have harshly attacked each other over  their involvement in the campaigns.  </P> <P> By a 2-1 margin, voters in June recalled Bryant after a yearlong campaign in  which he was accused of browbeating employees, catering to special interests  and making racist remarks. Bryant denied the charges, insisting that he was  under attack because he sided with the downtrodden against powerful business  and civic leaders.  </P> <P> Bredenkamp helped start the drive to recall Bryant. Lopez circulated recall  petitions.  </P> <P> Bredenkamp, in an effort to link Dahms to the ousted councilman, said Dahms had  an anti-recall sign in his business window and was allied with Bryant. Dahms  said he supported some things Bryant did and opposed others. As for the recall  sign in his window, Dahms said he always allows all political candidates to  post signs on his property.  </P> <P> The winner will complete a term that runs until 1993.  </P> <P> Bredenkamp, 49, grew up in Nebraska and was a truck driver for 10 years before  coming to Pomona in 1974 to buy a doughnut shop on Mission Boulevard that he  still operates.  </P> <P> He has been active in a number of youth and business groups and also serves on  the Planning Commission. He and his wife, Judy, have two children, 16 and 20.  </P> <P> Bredenkamp is running with the backing of unions representing city  firefighters, police officers and general city employees, the first time all  three employee groups have united behind a candidate since 1960. He also has  the backing of Mayor Donna Smith.  </P> <P> On the Planning Commission, he has consistently voted against new housing  developments because they would increase the population, adding to school  overcrowding. Bredenkamp said he has been trying to send a message to the  council that it should work with the school board to relieve overcrowding. "You  can't have a quality city without quality schools," he said.  </P> <P> The most serious problem facing the city, he said, is crime. Bredenkamp said  the Police Department needs more officers and equipment.  </P> <P> Dahms, 33, said he too believes that crime is "at an intolerable level."  </P> <P> "We need to provide a better, more efficient Police Department," he said. "I'd  like to take a look at the upper management and make sure we are running it as  efficiently as we can within the resources the department has."  </P> <P> Dahms said the city must step up efforts to combat gangs. "We need to create  the stigma that belonging to gangs is no longer cool," he said.  </P> <P> Dahms came to Pomona from Chicago 12 years ago, establishing a business  involved in electronic security systems and military and aerospace work. Dahms  said he has attended several colleges, but does not have a degree. He is a  member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.  </P> <P> He is president of the Central Business District, which is working to revive  downtown Pomona, and also sits on several other boards of civic organizations.  He has been so successful in business, Dahms said, that he can now devote most  of his time to community service.  </P> <P> Lopez, 52, who was born in Pomona and has lived here nearly all of her life, is  campaigning with the promise of becoming a full-time council member.  </P> <P> But, unlike Bryant, who prided himself on being the people's watchdog on duty  every day at City Hall, Lopez said she would not be looking over the shoulders  of employees and would leave them alone to do their jobs.  </P> <P> Married 33 years and the mother of four children, Lopez has a long record of  volunteering in community efforts. A founder of the Hispanic Youth Task Force  to deal with gang problems, she conducts career weeks at Pomona schools and  stages fiestas at the Civic Center on Mexican holidays in May and September.  </P> <P> Lopez said she would bring to the council a strong understanding of the  community and its needs.  </P> <P> Of the three candidates on the ballot, Lopez is by far the most outspoken.  "People in the community know me as very bossy, very forward, very direct," she  said.  </P> <P> She was the only candidate to run against Bryant last year at the regular  municipal election, before he joined with two other council members to fire the  city administrator and became a recall target. She lost, 4,110 to 3,230.  </P> <P> Although 30% of Pomona's population is Latino, Lopez said her Latino heritage  may work against her in the election. "There is a lot of support for me out in  the community," she said, "but people are saying that we already have two  Hispanics on the City Council." The council has five members, including the  mayor, although a ballot measure approved in June will expand the council to  seven members next spring.  </P> <P> Lopez said she is asking voters to "judge me on the basis of who I am and what  I have done, not who I represent."  </P> <P> Councilman Tomas Ursua said he thinks the big obstacle for Lopez is not that  she would join Nell Soto and himself as the council's third Latino but that she  is under-qualified. "People are looking for a higher-trained elected official  these days," he said. He dismissed Lopez as a community volunteer with links to  the Establishment. "She's the kind of person who doesn't question the system,"  he said.  </P> <P> However, Lopez claims that the Police Department has not hired enough Latino  officers and attacks council members for allegedly putting their political  ambitions ahead of community service. "Everybody on that (council) right now  has his own self-interest," she said. "They are not interested or concerned for  the community."  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Lopez is the only candidate on the ballot who is not being  backed by an incumbent.  </P> <P> Mayor Smith has endorsed Bredenkamp, and Ursua has endorsed Dahms. Soto on  Tuesday announced she is endorsing Dahms. Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer said he  will remain neutral.  </P> <P> The endorsements carry some political weight, but also some extra baggage.  Dahms and Lopez claim that Bredenkamp would be under the thumb of Smith.  </P> <P> Lopez said Smith is "looking for a puppet . . . someone she can manipulate and  get some of the power she wants."  </P> <P> Bredenkamp said his family and Smith's have been friends for years through  youth sports organizations in which they both participated, starting with  Little League.  </P> <P> "The reason we are friends," he said, "is that our basic philosophies are the  same. Whenever we've gotten involved in any project, Little League or whatever,  we've always worked for the good of the organization."  </P> <P> He said that he would vote with Smith most of the time on the council because  they think alike but that he has differences with her too. "I can think for  myself," he said.  </P> <P> Bob Mulligan, who heads the Pomona City Employees Assn., said his group and  associations representing police officers and firefighters interviewed the  three candidates and concluded that Bredenkamp was the most knowledgeable and  experienced. Mulligan said the associations will provide volunteer labor and  contribute money as well.  </P> <P> Bredenkamp has raised the most money, according to campaign reporting  statements filed by the candidates for the period ending Sept. 1. Bredenkamp  had amassed $10,999. Dahms had raised $8,569, including $1,250 from labor  unions and $1,350 of his own money. Lopez reported $1,899 in contributions,  including $1,110 from her husband.  </P> <P> In addition to the three candidates on the ballot, George Bosy, a motel  operator who has clashed with the city over efforts to aid the homeless, took  out papers to file as a write-in candidate, but failed to submit them by the  filing deadline.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A LOOK AT THE POMONA CITY COUNCIL CANDIDATES  </P> <P> Boyd Bredenkamp  </P> <P> Age: 49  </P> <P> Occupation: Owner-operator of a doughnut shop.  </P> <P> Background: Six years on Planning Commission.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Lonely Danes watch and wait - Copenhagen THE Irish vote confirmed Denmark's isolation from its EC partners following the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by Danish voters this month. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, said the Irish result made it more likely than ever that the other 11 member states would complete their ratification of the treaty. This would force Denmark to work out the best way of co-operating with the other 11. He said Denmark had no interest in a divided Europe or that the process of European co-operation should be halted. The government's strategy is to await completion of the ratification process. Only then will Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on January 1, take any initiative.</p>

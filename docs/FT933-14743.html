			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / People: Emmott shops down south at Sainsbury The mystery over the destination of Bob Emmott, who resigned last week as joint deputy managing director of Wm Morrison, the Bradford-based superstore chain, was solved yesterday when J Sainsbury announced his appointment as managing director, specialist businesses. Sainsbury admits the appointment of an outsider to such a position is unusual, but observes that Morrisons is a 'highly-respected' regional superstore operator and Emmott has broad experience. Emmott, 49, will have full profit responsibility for Sainsbury's petrol stations, in-store bakeries and restaurants. It is the first time these businesses, currently the responsibility of different directors, have been brought together under one manager. Emmott also gets a seat on the board at Savacentre, Sainsbury's hypermarket chain. He will report to David Clapham, a member of Sainsbury's main board. Moving to Sainsbury may be something of a culture shock, but Emmott's 23 years with Morrisons - during which time he has had responsibility for trading, marketing, store operations, planning and formats, and distribution and factories - should equip him well.</p>

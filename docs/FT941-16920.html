			<p>940107 FT  07 JAN 94 / Hebrides quarry inquiry ordered Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, yesterday ordered a public inquiry into a plan by the construction group Redland to open a large coastal quarry on the island of Harris in the Outer Hebrides. The move will please environmental organisations which have been campaigning against the project. Western Isles council decided last June by 24 votes to three to give Redland Aggregates, Redland's construction materials subsidiary, permission to open the quarry. The Pounds 50m project would involve extracting 600m tonnes of anorthosite, a white rock used in road building, from the headland of Lingerabay in South Harris. The quarrying, lasting about 60 years, would cover a square mile. Lingerabay would disappear and a new sea loch would be created. The rock would be taken away by sea. Mr Lang said the proposal raised important national issues. The inquiry will cover only the Lingerabay project, but is likely to be seen as a pointer to decisions on other projects for coastal quarries in the Highlands. Supporters of the project argue that it would create employment and benefit the economy of South Harris, whose population is in decline. Environmental organisations argue that it would destroy unspoilt landscape and cause sea pollution. A leading objector was Scottish Natural Heritage, the government's environmental agency.</p>

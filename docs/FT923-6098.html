			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Push for Canada vote MOMENTUM is building in Canada for a national referendum to approve the constitutional reform package agreed last weekend, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Mr Joe Clark, the federal constitutional affairs minister, said on Monday night he favoured 'a quick process' to speed full acceptance across Canada. The premiers of Manitoba and New Brunswick provinces also back a national referendum and Mr Donald Getty, the Alberta premier, is ready to scrap a provincial referendum if a national vote is held. Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's premier, is ready to delay the province's referendum on sovereignty, promised in October, for a national referendum. Mr Clark and others fear that the year required for normal ratification by the federal parliament and the 10 provincial legislatures might risk unravelling the constitutional deal, repeating the 1990 failure of the Meech Lake accord. The premiers meet Prime Minister Brian Mulroney tomorrow to approve the legal draft of the agreement and to discuss the ratification.</p>

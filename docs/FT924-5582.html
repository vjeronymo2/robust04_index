			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Clinton aide mulls options for activism: Michael Prowse profiles a key member of the president-elect industrial team LAURA D'Andrea Tyson is one of those 'cautious activists' who surround Bill Clinton. If there is a more aggressive US industrial policy under the new president, much of it will be put down to her. 'I have always walked a tightrope,' says Ms Tyson, a professor of economics at the University of California's Berkeley campus and one of the few women likely to exert an important influence on the Clinton administration's economic policy. She performs something of a balancing act within the US economics profession. She is far more sceptical of free market theories than many colleagues. She was one of the few US academics willing to defend the 1986 semiconductor trade deal between the US and Japan under which Tokyo agreed to assist foreign companies in achieving a 20 per cent share of the Japanese market. Many theorists regard such 'managed trade' agreements as covert protection. Yet she is anxious not to be typecast as a believer in crude government intervention. 'I was defending a particular form of managed trade in special circumstances,' she says. Ms Tyson is a senior member of President-elect Bill Clinton's economic transition team and is likely to get an important economic post in the new administration, probably in a revamped commerce department or the proposed new Economic Security Council. Over the next month her main task is to prepare policy options for Mr Clinton in high-technology and manufacturing industry. In other words, she will be mulling the options for a more aggressive US industrial policy. 'Cautious activist' is Ms Tyson's self description. It is a phrase that accurately describes most of Mr Clinton's advisers, including his economic czar, Mr Robert Reich of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Mr Reich - who has hinted he wishes to return to Harvard after the transition - has argued for a bigger government role, especially in education, training and infrastructure. Mr Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank and another leading economic transition team member, is a cautious activist too. He has long supported tax incentives to spur industrial investment and at the World Bank has directed a project analysing east Asian industrial development, which stressed the role of government more than has been fashionable in the US. However, main economic innovations in the Clinton administration are likely to occur in industrial and technology policy - Ms Tyson's field. She sets out her thinking at length in a new book, Who's Bashing Whom: Trade Conflict in High-Technology Industries, published last week by the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. This focuses on trade conflicts in areas such as semiconductors and commercial aircraft as a platform for articulating a new activist agenda. The message is that the US must react domestically to competitors' policies: 'Flawed domestic choices, not unfair trade practices, are the main cause of the nation's long run economic slowdown,' she writes. Trade policies 'cannot compensate for domestic programmes that remain fiscally and intellectually impoverished'. As part of a strategic response to the end of the cold war, she wants the US to 'develop an institutional capability for assessing competitive and technological trends in high-technology industries and begin to shift its R&amp;D (research and development) moneys from military to civilian programmes'. Such an agency, possibly within the Commerce Department, could provide 'industry-specific information' to formulate domestic strategies for winning back market share. To improve US competitiveness she favours more generous tax incentives for corporate R&amp;D, heavy federal investment in civilian R&amp;D and targeted subsidies for strategic industries, such as semiconductors and supercomputers. She says the wisest response to subsidies abroad is often to introduce subsidies at home. The scope for action is large: US industrial subsidies are worth only 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 1 per cent in Japan and 3 per cent in Europe. On trade, she believes the US should continue to promote a multilateral rule-based system. But the rules should be modified to permit domestic subsidies. She believes the European Community was justified in subsidising Airbus. What Ms Tyson regards as cautious activism, however, may be seen abroad as threatening behaviour. If her thinking proves a good guide to the Clinton administration's approach, other countries will have to come to terms with a US which pursues its own interests far more nakedly than in the past.</p>

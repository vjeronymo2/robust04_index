			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies' Foreign Affairs  Committee, meeting today under the chairmanship of Amin al-Hafiz  with the participation of 18 deputies and Foreign Minister Faris  Buwayz, discussed the theft of Lebanese water resources and  Lebanon's complaints to the UN Security Council over recent  Israeli assaults. [passage omitted]    Minister Buwayz pointed out that Israel uses its military  forces to carry out assaults to make the resistance feel that it  is dependent on the protection of the Lebanese and Syrian  Armies. Consequently, it will seek to attain self-reliance by  acquiring more weapons, and this will result in confrontation  between the Army and the resistance.    The deputies then debated the issue, and Minister Buwayz  explained that the Israeli assaults have a larger purpose than  just influencing the negotiations. He said Lebanon's  participation in the peace negotiations was approved by several  successive Lebanese governments and was also an inter-Arab and  regional decision. He explained that if Lebanon abandons the  negotiations, it will find itself isolated. Buwayz noted that  Israel might be seeking to make Lebanon withdraw from the  negotiations.    Concerning the complaints that Lebanon has lodged with the  UN  Security Council, Buwayz pointed out that a negative atmosphere  prevails in that body. He said: The Americans asked us to  lodge only a complaint. We are not deceived by UN advice. U.S.  views on this issue must be altered. No one understands our  issues, and Middle East issues in general, like we do.</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Lumber producers at loggerheads over Nafta US timber producers have threatened to undermine one of the most innovative parts of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) by challenging the legality of the pact's dispute settlement mechanism. The lumber industry has brought an action in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seeking to reverse a string of setbacks in its long campaign against tree-cutting fees levied by Canadian provinces. The US producers allege that these 'stumpage' fees are so low that they constitute an unfair subsidy on Canadian softwood lumber exports. Several panels set up under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement, on which Nafta's dispute-settlement provisions are based, have dismissed the US complaints. The lumber producers appeared to have exhausted all avenues last month when a three-judge 'extraordinary challenge committee' split along national lines in Canada's favour. Canadian exporters have now called on Washington to refund about USDollars 600m in interim countervailing duties which they have paid pending the outcome of the dispute. The dispute settlement mechanism has been widely regarded as one of Nafta's most successful innovations. Binational panels have so far reviewed about 62 cases relating to findings by US and Canadian administrative tribunals on subsidies, anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties. The panels' decisions are usually binding. However, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, representing US forestry companies, maintains that the panel system violates the US constitution by diminishing the authority of the judiciary in favour of other branches of government. The coalition also contends that the panels are unconstitutional because while they administer US law, the Canadian members have not been elected or appointed by the US. It alleges that some Canadian panellists who have heard the lumber cases failed to disclose conflicts of interest. Mr John Ragosta, a lawyer for the coalition, said the constitutionality of the dispute-settlement provisions were not challenged earlier as 'we didn't have standing until we lost. You have to show you're an aggrieved party.' However, Canadian lumber exporters have accused the Americans of being bad losers. The Canadian Forest Industries Council said: 'The coalition filed this lawsuit only because it lost the countervailing duty case on its merits and, rather than admit defeat, it decided to take on the entire free trade process.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ru Tao (3067 3447) and Hao Run (3185 3387): "A </F> Breakthrough in the `Six Skills' Training of Staff Officers"]    [Text] Staff officers manual participation in planning,  strategy devising, and command with a map, a pen, and a compass  will end soon. The automation system for headquarters command  of field operations produced by the ground forces staff academy  was put into use for teaching in early May.    The six vocational skills of reading, taking notes,  calculation, writing, drawing, and transmission done by hand by  staff officers of headquarters for many years have become the  "bottleneck" affecting and restricting headquarters' command  efficiency due to the low speed and efficiency. Organizing  personnel to tackle key difficulties for more than two years,  the ground forces staff academy produced an automation system  for headquarters' command of field operations, thus realizing  automatic handling of staff work. Applying this system, staff  officers, merely by pressing keys, can analyze roads, river  systems, bridges, and many other essential elements of  topography without maps, compasses, measuring rules, and other  tools. The system can display the three-dimensional pictures of  the topography of battlefields from various angles and  altitudes, automatically measure and judge the distance, area,  and the general view, and, in line with the tactical background,  automatically produce special pictures of parachute landing,  cross-country, and other operations. Its data base stores  accurate and reliable materials on several hundred thousand  characters and symbols, several hundred sets of pictures and  figures, and more than a hundred thousand data, which can be  consulted at will and classified for display. This system is  able not only to "calculate" the mobility, command, and battle  capacity of troops through the computer but also to incorporate  the latest achievements of foreign army to replace the  traditional and simple comparisons of persons and weapons with a  more scientific comparison of combat capacity. Based on the  quantity and quality of the military strength and weapons of the  enemies and ourselves, this system may take into consideration  the environment, operations, behaviors, and other factors in an  all-around manner to predict who is to win and advance, who is  to lose and retreat, thus making command and policy making more  scientific. Through the system, man can talk to machines to  have various combat orders, instructions, and plans  automatically worked out. What is more significant, the system  has bravely reformed the traditional command process and made it  possible to have combat orders worked out at the moment when the  commander is making a decision and have orders issued  immediately after the decision is made. Applying this system, a  military mark can be made in one minute and is easy to use and  revise. This system also makes automatic adding of cipher and  instantaneous transmission of words and pictures possible and  can be connected with the current telecommunications equipment  of the Army. It is convenient to carry and convenient for field  operations.</p>

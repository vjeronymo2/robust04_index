			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad buying 29.5% investment in Betacom AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics group, is taking a 29.5 per cent stake in Betacom, which designs and distributes telephones, as an investment. Amstrad will acquire 26.5 per cent from Cannon Street Investments and 3 per cent from Mr Alan Sugar, its chairman. The price is 18p per share; Mr Sugar bought his stake last year for 21p. Telecommunications is an area in which Amstrad is becoming increasingly interested and the investment provided benefits for both companies, particularly with respect to product innovation and marketing, Amstrad said. It has already announced a joint project with GEC Marconi to develop reasonably priced video telephones for the consumer market. The group did not, however, rule out the possibility that it may market Betacom's telephones 'in some regions'. Betacom, which has marketing strength in Germany, could in turn sell Amstrad's fax machines'We look upon Amstrad as being a stronger holder of our shares (than Cannon Street Investments),' said Mr Roger Roland, Betacom chairman.</p>

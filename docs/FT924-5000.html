			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Skiing: Turkish delights for skiers HOW DOES the thought of soaking in an ancient and genuine Turkish bath, followed by a vigorous rub-down, appeal as an alternative form of apres ski? No? Well, there are other things you can do after skiing; and for those who connect Turkey automatically with silk carpets, bazaars and long, sandy beaches, it might be time to discover the country's hidden face: its winter attractions. The delights of Mount Olympus, as it was known in mythology, have long been enjoyed by Turkey's rich and privileged, even though appearances tend to outshine performance. For those in the know, a few runs on the slopes, with a quick break for shish kebab, Turkish coffee and a soak in the sun, have been a popular pastime since Kemal Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey, decided that his country should join the International Ski Federation. With its surprisingly good snow record and eclectic culture, Turkey is an intriguing ski destination but, until fairly recently, it has failed to make much impact on anyone but the natives (although most of them can only dream of affording the money or the time to indulge in winter sports). Then, just as British tour operators started to flirt with the idea of skiing in Turkey, the Gulf war broke out and Turkish slopes seemed suddenly to be rather vulnerable. Now, their star seems to be rising. After all, how can you overlook a mountain range with 89 peaks, all over 10,000 ft and within driving distance of Istanbul, one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities? The fascinating mixture of mosques and ski slopes is appealing and, for those who want more than just snow and gluhwein from their holidays, Turkey provides adventures of a different kind. Uludag - 'God's Mountain' - is the highest peak in western Anatolia and, at 8,476 ft, is the largest and most developed of Turkey's eight commercial ski centres. The picturesque village is purpose-built, set in national parkland surrounded by an ancient forest inhabited by bears and wolves. The dramatic setting, combined with skiing from your doorstep and a distinct lack of lift queues, gives it many advantages over other resorts. Thirty pistes, served by seven chair-lifts and six T-bars, provide plenty of scope for beginners and intermediates and there is some quite testing skiing off-piste, too. More experienced skiers could find Uludag rather limiting, but there is a challenging mogul field and the more adventurous can hire a helicopter to get to the summit of Mount Zivre (8,340 ft) where there is virgin snow in abundance. One of the main obstacles facing travel companies moving into the Turkish ski market was the problem of lifts, and it is easy to see why. Most drag lifts belong to different owners. Music blares from loudspeakers attached to the lift pylons. You can take your pick between the likes of Vanilla Ice's hit single 'Ice Ice Baby' at full volume, or traditional Turkish music, to inspire you before you launch yourself down a challenging run. Uludag is about 140 miles south-east of Istanbul and was virtually unknown outside Turkey until 1987 when Ski Turkey became the sole agent in Britain for the resort. Even now, the slopes are practically deserted during the week when locals are at their desks trying to earn enough for the next weekend's skiing. The resort offers lively, affordable apres ski including swimming pools, an ice skating rink and a casino. There are plenty of bars and nightclubs where Turkish staff are welcoming and generous with the glasses of raki. At the foot of the mountain is Bursa, once the Ottoman capital and famous for its thermal baths, green mausoleum and bazaar. Most people get there by road but there is a cable car which offers breathtaking views over Mount Olympus, the Sea of Marmara, and the minarets and mosques of the ancient city which has some of the holiest sites in Islam. One of the main attractions of Turkey as a ski destination is the chance to visit Istanbul's palaces, bridges, mosques and museums. The Grand Bazaar, with its maze of streets and 4,000 shops, never fails to fascinate, even when the strictly-observed Ramadan fast is in full swing in March. Allegedly, many Turks put on weight indulging in midnight snacks during Ramadan, by day the hungry look in the eyes of the Turks can make you feel so guilty that you want to swallow your baklava whole. Ski Turkey is at 316 Reigate Road, Bromley, Kent BR1 5JN. Tel: 071-495-4168.</p>

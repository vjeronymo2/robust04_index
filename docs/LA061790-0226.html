			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY DIRECTOR IS HONORED  </P> <P> Carl St. Clair, the newly appointed director of the Pacific Symphony Orchestra  of Orange County, received a prestigious national honor Saturday for promising  young conductors on the threshold of major careers.  </P> <P> St. Clair and Kenneth Jean, music director of the Florida Symphony Orchestra,  were jointly given the 1990 Seavers/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors  Award during a luncheon of the American Symphony Orchestra League in  Washington. Each will receive a $75,000 grant, one of the largest conducting  awards offered in the world today.  </P> <P> "It really took me aback, and my heart started pounding," St. Clair said from  Washington, describing his reaction as the award was announced. "It's the  perfect segue into another part of my life. It gives me a whole new outlook --  like a booster rocket with another stage in it."  </P> <P> St. Clair, who will take over the Pacific Symphony on Oct. 1, is assistant  conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and music director of both the Ann  Arbor Symphony in Michigan and the Cayuga Chamber Orchestra of Ithaca, N.Y.  </P> <P> Jean, in addition to his post with the Florida Symphony Orchestra, is associate  conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and principal guest conductor of  the Hong Kong Philharmonic.  </P> <P> The Seavers/NEA award, established in June, 1985, is offered every two years to  help promising U.S. conductors ages 28 to 42. The award is presented jointly by  the National Endowment for the Arts and the Seavers Institute, a Los Angeles  foundation that provides grants to science, education and the arts.  </P> <P> Jean and St. Clair were selected from 50 candidates recommended for the award  by about 200 U.S. music professionals. The awards process can take two years as  the judges dissect the careers and potential of some of the most talented  conductors in the country.  </P> <P> The honor bestows upon recipients financial aid, artistic and professional  guidance and institutional support. It also offers them the chance to consult  with a distinguished panel of advisers and with leading orchestra  professionals.  </P> <P> St. Clair said the award will make possible several projects, including  language studies that could help him pursue plans to conduct more operas. He  said the grant will also make it possible for him to travel to important  performances given by the world's premier classical artists.  </P> <P> "I just think it's great that the private sector through the Seavers Institute  would join in with the public sector, the NEA, and give this amount of money,"  St. Clair said. "It is a profound honor for me."  </P> <P> St. Clair, 37, was the youngest of nine candidates when he was picked as music  director of the Pacific Symphony. Under terms of his three-year contract with  the orchestra, he will oversee the orchestra's artistic development and  planning and conduct six pairs of classical concerts each season at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center. In addition, he will conduct two concerts each  summer season at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> His appointment ended a search that began in February, 1988, with the  resignation of founding music director Keith Clark after a bitter power  struggle with the orchestra's board of directors.  </P></p>

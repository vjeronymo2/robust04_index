			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just received a report by an ITAR-TASS  correspondent which has just been brought into the studio.  Russian Head of Government Viktor Chernomyrdin did not agree  today with the demands by several deputies to dismiss Viktor  Yerin, the minister of internal affairs. The correspondent  learned this from participants in the closed sitting of the  State Duma which is debating the circumstances and consequences  of the murder of the deputy Ayzderdzis.    An interval in the sitting has now been announced. The  journalists managed to find out that Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke  at the sitting, reading out a message by the Russian president  to the Duma in connection with the deputy's murder, and also  answering questions from those present. In particular, reacting  to the demand for Viktor Yerin's dismissal, the head of the  cabinet said that he was not in favor of shuffling the cards.    During the interval, the factions will discuss a draft  decision of the Duma on yesterday's crime. For the time being  it is hard to predict how events will develop. In the view of  Vladimir Lysenko, a representative of the Yabloko faction, in  addition to the fate of the minister of internal affairs, the  issue of the prospects for the signing of the treaty on public  accord will inevitably come up during the debate. The deputy  believes that under the present circumstances, the treaty has  little chance of being signed. As reported, the signing was  planned for tomorrow.</p>

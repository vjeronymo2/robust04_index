			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> SAVING THE OFFICE OF FAMILY PLANNING WOULD SAVE MONEY IN LONG RUN  </P> <P> Marie G. is 31. She has seven children and she is poor. I met her at a Planned  Parenthood clinic where she is a patient. Like the rest of us, rich, poor and  middle income, she has plans for her life, dreams that she hopes will lead her  to better circumstances.  </P> <P> Becoming pregnant again isn't part of that plan, and yet the agencies that she  has used to provide her with birth control face futures as uncertain as she  faces. That's because Gov. George Deukmejian in January proposed eliminating  the state Office of Family Planning in order to trim the budget to meet the  then-projected deficit. OFP is the only source of public funds for more clinics  that treat the poor who are seeking family planning assistance. Using $78 of  OFP funds, our clinic can give Marie a gynecological exam, cancer screening and  a year's worth of birth control supplies.  </P> <P> The first half of 1989 has been tumultuous for reproductive rights. The OFP cut  was announced as the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in Webster vs.  Reproductive Health Services, an abortion test case that could change the laws  regarding legalized abortion.  </P> <P> Marie doesn't know much about the Webster case. To her, abortion is not the  primary issue. "I don't want an abortion," she told me. "I just don't want to  get pregnant." For women coping with the harsh realities of poverty, birth  control is essential, which means the Office of Family Planning is essential.  </P> <P> Marie's perspective on the fate of OFP reduces the issue to its essential  element: debate over abortion is moot if pregnancy is prevented. Because people  are demonstrably unwilling to give up the physical act that leads to pregnancy,  abstinence from sexual activity is not a viable plan for prevention. That  leaves birth control as the only practical method for attempting to prevent  unwanted pregnancies and the host of medical, social and moral issues that  surround these unhappy events.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, there are the politicians in Sacramento who are grappling with the  question of reinstating the OFP budget. They are less interested in social and  moral dilemmas than they are in dollars -- taxpayers' dollars, in fact. After  all, it's not the job of elected officials to worry about individuals like  Marie. Their charter is to see to it that the decisions made bring the greatest  good to the most people.  </P> <P> Fair enough. Ignore the 500,000 Maries of this state who utilized OFP-funded  programs last year. Set aside the emotional arguments about reproductive  rights. Look, instead, at the economics of the issue.  </P> <P> Are the taxpayers of California getting a decent return for the money that's  being invested in the Office of Family Planning? The answer is yes. For every  dollar spent on family planning, $11.20 is saved in future medical and welfare  costs, according to a study released in April by the Institute for Health  Policy Studies at UC San Francisco. You see, OFP dollars are not limited to  birth control methods and exams, but include other family planning services  such as counseling, education and sterilizations.  </P> <P> So, spend one dollar today on preventing a pregnancy and you won't spend $11.20  on social costs that begin with the delivery of an unwanted child. Delivering  the baby is the least of the items on this list. Poor mothers don't have access  to adequate prenatal care, and their babies run higher risks than non-poverty  children of having medical problems at birth. That $11.20 includes the ongoing  cost of care for babies born ill and with birth defects. That money also  includes such tax-funded programs as day care, foster care, and welfare. It  does not include the cost of dealing with abused children because at present  there are no statistical links between unwanted pregnancies and child abuse.  </P> <P> With or without a deficit, it's an obvious choice for money-conscious  legislators and the governor as well. Spending the proposed $34.6 million on  family planning services this year will save at least $400 million in future  costs. Our officials have the option of saving their successors the pain of  trying to rectify a major fiscal mistake.  </P> <P> But this issue is not that clear cut. From January's projected budget deficit,  we have now moved into this month's projected budget surplus of about $1  billion. Under the circumstances, it should be a simple matter for the people  in power in Sacramento to reinstate funding and even add dollars to the OFP  budget. However, Proposition 98, approved by voters last November, says that  40% of all unbudgeted surplus funds must go to education. There are indications  that Proposition 98 could provide a smoke screen for indecisive politicians --  both in the governor's mansion and in the Capitol -- to hide behind. This is  the group of politicians that doesn't want to become caught up in the issue of  reproductive rights by advocating retention of the OFP budget. Instead, they  might choose to declare that the matter has been taken from their hands by the  dictates of Proposition 98, thereby letting the proposed cut stand.  </P> <P> That would be wrong. Proposition 98 allows them not only to reinstate the $34.6  million, but to increase it. Given the UC San Francisco study, it's the  smartest money they could spend.  </P> <P> Just ask Marie. She'd agree.  </P></p>

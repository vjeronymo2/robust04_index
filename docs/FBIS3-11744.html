			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de  las Casas, today attended a social medicine congress in  Guadalajara and discussed the situation in Chiapas.    The military conflict in Chiapas has not ended. The fact  that a cease-fire was achieved and a first round of talks has  started does not mean the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] will lay down its weapons. They expect the agreements  will be signed, it was stated in Guadalajara by Msgr. Ruiz, who  added that the war is still on.    [Begin Ruiz recording] Perhaps it is believed the war has  ended so it is not visualized. There is a war, there is a  cease-fire, and there was a mutual determination -- although not  in writing yet -- to gather forces where they are right now,  without subsequent mobilization. A dialogue has started but no  peace accords have been signed yet. However, this has been  forgotten in the country. [end recording]    He said the Chiapas conflict is the shortest war in the  world  and the one which resulted in a dialogue the fastest. Msgr.  Samuel Ruiz arrived in Guadalajara for the Sixth Latin American  Congress on Social Medicine, during which he questioned the  health aid given to socialist countries like Cuba.</p>

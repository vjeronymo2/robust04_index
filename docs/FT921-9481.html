			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Arts: La Boheme - Royal College of Music This is a greatly appealing student production. Its attractive qualities start with the youthfulness of the cast - professional performers of La Boheme (like those of Eugene Onegin) seldom manage to combine vocal aptitude and visual verisimilitude. But the pleasures don't stop there: the production by Mike Ashman proposes a fresh statement about the piece, and the singers, orchestral players and conductor (Michael Rosewell) invite us to respond to it with equal freshness. Ashman, an erratic and sometimes wilful opera director for the bigger British companies, has done some of his best work in the RCM's wonderfully intimate Britten Theatre - I remember his Paul Bunyan and Onegin with particular affection. He and the designer Bernard Culshaw have here found a method of updating that comes across as a quickened imaginative response to the musical and verbal text, not a lazy-minded gimmick. The stage design is abstract, the dress modern, the narrative unfolding elliptical; quick switches of lighting (by John Bishop) underscore the emotional patterns. This is a production devised to make young performers (including a splendidly controlled mixture of Christmas Eve revellers, adult and children) feel at home, which sets up vital lines of connection between past and present, Puccini's day and our own. Of the first-night cast (there are three alternating sets of principals for the six performances) the stand-out figure was the Rodolfo of an astonishingly gifted young Chinese tenor, Ya-Lin Zhang. He needs to improve further his Italian diction (which stood out the more because of the impressively natural delivery around him), and to master much greater flexibility of stage presence; his steady, supple tones, beautifully unforced and romantic-sounding, hint at a remarkably bright future. The Marcello, Richard Croft, shows himself a born singer-actor, alert in his instincts, a natural point of focus on stage; the Musetta, Elizabeth Davidson, shares the same quality. Other cast-members prove less noteworthy, though no-one lets down the prevailing high standard. It's sometimes difficult to know how to 'rate' enjoyable student opera-productions; at least by the side of last autumn's dismal Glyndebourne Touring Boheme, this one seems to me a plain triumph.</p>

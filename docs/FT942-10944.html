			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Fashion: Re-make re-model - Lucia van der Post suggests there is no need to spend at all this summer If, like me, you have been priced out of the designer label market, take heart. There are bargains to be had on the secondhand front (see Avril Groom, above) and I can add another suggestion - take the clothes you already own and wear them differently. For instance, it is perfectly possible to buy all of the items in the accompanying photographs - but that is not the point of this article. The point of the pictures is to show that this summer there is very little need to buy anything at all. The chap who is so artfully photographed here, by the Marks and Spencer men's fashion team, is simply wearing a white shirt, a black waistcoat and some black cotton trousers. The trick that updates the look, and gives it a designer air, is that the shirt is made of linen, the neck is grandad-style, it is over-sized and worn outside his jeans. The waistcoat (high-necked is best) is, of course, this year's really important accessory for men and women. A careful look through any of the current fashion magazines will reveal that most of this year's look can be achieved for minimal outlay. For summer, a V-necked T-shirt (remember those years when nothing but simple round-necked would do?) can be had from M&amp;S for Pounds 9.99, and could join the over-sized linen shirt in the wardrobe. T-shirts are also worn loose and outside the trousers. Men who want to freshen their off-duty wardrobe should swap their docksiders for Puma suedes (Pounds 49.99 from most good shoe shops) and that will do more for their image than a fancy label shirt or trousers. Sun-glasses are smaller, oval-shaped with thin metal rims and the denim jacket has been replaced by a lightweight bomber jacket with a hood (anyone visiting New York will find that Brooks Bros has a classic model). Layer the clothes you already have and they will look absolutely brand-new - shirts should hang out, shortish sweaters can be worn over them, waistcoats can be worn loose and unbuttoned under jackets and the tout ensemble will look as if it has just stepped off the catwalk. Much the same message applies to women. Most probably already own at least one big loose shirt - the trick this summer is to wear it outside, with the cuffs undone, and either a small high-necked waistcoat or your smallest sweater over it. Put away your boxy jackets and blazers for another year and swap your stiff handbags for something soft and pouchy. Wear silky soft cardigans, softened even further by long drifty scarves. If you buy nothing else this spring get some raised-sole trainers (Russell &amp; Bromley has excellent No-Name versions in several colours at Pounds 35 a pair) which, coupled with a loose, high-necked waistcoat, will up-date last year's flared trousers quickly and cheaply. Trade in your heavy-rimmed tortoise-shell sunglasses for little granny shaped ones with fine metal rims. Finally, this summer, faces are being worn Calvin Klein-style - that is to say the pale, luminous, minimalist look is in. The art lies in looking as if you are wearing almost no make-up while in reality goodly portions of it have been most artfully applied. This is far from easy and some of us are inclined to emerge looking wan and ill so if you can afford it possibly the best investment this summer is an hour or two at a good cosmetics counter or make-up artist.</p>

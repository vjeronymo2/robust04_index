			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN BACKS AIR PLAN  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian said he supports a sweeping, 20-year plan to reduce smog  in the Los Angeles Basin if the business community is involved in implementing  it. Developed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the plan was  approved Aug. 15 by the state Air Resources Board. Although the state board's  members are appointed by the governor, his attitude about the plan was brought  into question when Jananne Sharpless, the board chairwoman, said she was not  sure Deukmejian was "totally comfortable" with the program. Deukmejian, winding  up a series of meetings in New York with bankers and financiers, told a  reporter that "as long as the regulators will involve the business community as  they go forward and implement the program, we don't have any problem with it."  In approving the plan last week, the state board said local air quality  officials had promised to involve business in the rule making.  </P></p>

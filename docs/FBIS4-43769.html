			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The President Received"] </F>   [Text] For Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd  al-Majid the result of the Austrian referendum on European Union  [EU] membership is "a massive boost for Austria's role and  importance in the world." During a meeting with President  Thomas Klestil in Vienna's Hofburg Palace, he said that by  clearly saying yes to a larger Europe Austria "has regained  that central position which the country had assumed for  centuries." The Arab and the Islamic world is pleased about the  result of the Austrian EU referendum also because it knows that  it now has one more close and trustworthy friend in the EU.  President Thomas Klestil, who a few hours before had received  the OPEC ministers who are meeting in Vienna, expressed his  conviction that Austria's opinion and advice in the EU will be  in particularly high demand in the future when the cooperation  of the EU with East Europe, but also with the Middle East, will  be the issue. Since the time of [former Austrian Chancellor]  Bruno Kreisky, Austria's special closeness with the Arab world  has been known and appreciated. In the meeting with the Arab  League secretary general President Klestil discussed, among  other things, current developments in Bosnia, the Middle East  peace process, and political and social development in Africa.  'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, who is in Vienna to visit the UN  organizations, was accompanied by Arab League Deputy Secretary  General Ahmed Adel and Arab League representative in Austria  Samir Hezzah [preceding two Arab names spelling as published].</p>

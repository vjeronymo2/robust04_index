			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Double about-turn at auction - Richard Garnier picks his way through the sales and the different sectors of the market YOU might be forgiven for thinking a watch is a watch is a . . . until you come to buy, or sell, or collect them at auction, that is. For the market divides several ways into decorative, early and precision for pocket watches, which have recently been joined by wristwatches. The most serious section of the market is decorative - watches, mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, whose chief attraction is the style and decoration of the case and dial. These are to be distinguished from early watches, that is those from before the 1680s. Early watches were always abysmal timekeepers and should not have been altered to improve performance. They were created as expensive toys for courtiers; as a result, they have some of the most sumptuously decorated cases ever made. Precision watches are the youngest sector of the pocket watch market. They include complicated watches with multitudinous features, such as minute-repeating, perpetual calendar work allowing for leap years and double or triple split second-hands for timing two or three runners in tandem, as well as those which are just very accurate timekeepers. Decorative watches had been the staple of sales until the 1970s, when early watches shot to prominence, soon followed by precision. In the early to mid-1980s, however, wristwatches came into play, and the term 'estate watches' was coined to cover quality wristwatches from the 1950s to 1970s which were not strictly vintage. It was all so easy, as long as you stuck to the six big names of Patek Philippe, Vacheron and Constantin, Rolex, Audemars Piguet, Cartier, and Breguet. It is a story that has parallels in the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art market. The signs were all there in a recent April sale at Christie's in London. The sale was 66 per cent sold overall, but that was held up by the 90 per cent success rate in the clocks section of the sale. Christie's Tim Bourne admits that estimates will have to be revised downwards next time. A similar trend was evident at Phillips' Bond Street sale earlier this month, where wristwatches took a severe knocking and accounted for the majority of unsolds. Rachel Cameron at Phillips cites estimates that were very reasonable in terms of past market levels, yet which failed to excite much interest. This was particularly true of Patek but less so with Rolex, which has a more rugged appeal. Early Rolexes in octagonal or cushion cases, many in 9 carat, held up quite well at Phillips, but these are less significant, being down market. More upbeat models, including the Rolex Submariner (still in production), are in very short supply, being all the rage for Italians as beachwear. With the majority of other marques it is hit and miss, so the reorientation of the market may not have completely run its course. However, it is not all gloom in the wristwatch sector. Tina Millar of Sotheby's points out that an octagonal arrow-dial wristwatch made Dollars 209,000 this February in New York, in the middle of the Gulf crisis. It is, of course, a very rare watch and a similarly dialled pocket watch commonly sells for around Dollars 10,000 at auction. Similarly, at Christie's in Geneva, Ruth Zandberg has hopes for a 1924 Audemars Piguet square dialled wristwatch in a white gold case. In itself, that would not be exceptional, but its minute repeating facility makes the difference - and also explains the bullish pre-sale estimate. Patek Philippe watches are generally not so rare, whether perpetual calendar or less complicated examples. Gone are the days when the prices realised in one auction established the benchmark for the low estimates in the next sale, which was then left far behind. The market has changed from those halcyon days of 1989, when Habsburg held their themed sale of Pateks. Habsburg repeated the formula with the House of Breguet in mid-April. Projected to total FFr15m (Pounds 1.49m), the final result of some FFr12.34m was only partially satisfactory as nearly 25 per cent of lots remained unsold. Nevertheless, the sold total shows that those that did sell performed well, particularly when mechanically interesting or associated with a good historical prominence. For instance, a watch picked up at a Phillips London sale in 1989 for a song at Pounds 1,500 or so as an unrecognised Breguet, once reunited with its English Royal prominence, was resold at the theme sale for FFr36,000. Christie's gets in on the act with a theme sale of Swatch watches in 178 lots on June 15, preceded by a talk by Ernest Thomke, president of S. M. H, the manufacturers. This Swatch classics sale is an attempt to follow the 100 per cent sell-out success of Sotheby's similar sale in Milan of September last year. The June sale includes such low number production models as the chronographs (stopwatches) and the Mimmo Paladino, estimated at SFr40,000 plus and made in a limited edition of 120. The Mimmo Paladino was given as a prize in the 1989 'Draw Your Swatch' competition, and presented to leading figures in politics, finance, sport, the arts and show business. Meanwhile, Crott of Germany have offered 144 lots by the German precision makers Lange &amp; Sohne of Dresden, ranging from published literature, through wristwatches, to grande complication and tourbillon pocket watches. The Crott sale was dominated by pocket watches, which seems to be the healthiest sector of the market at the moment. Lange is principally a German (and to a lesser extent American) market, but both they and other superb precision watches had performed well against the general run of pocket watches over the last five or six years. Most other pocket watches have been so lacklustre since the mid-1980s that not only had many become less valuable in market terms since then but were even making less in real terms. That was until this spring. The first signs were evident last summer. To start with, the number of unsold decorative pocket watches at auction fell. Now a definite price advance is in progress. Rachel Cameron at Phillips is delighted by the prices achieved for enamel watches in its sale - many with damage. One such, dating from the early 19th century, seemingly correctly estimated at Pounds 400 to Pounds 600, realised Pounds 1,700: another similarly estimated made Pounds 1,150. The exception in this sale was Patek, which followed its own house form, as Gondolo models were down to about half their previous level of around Pounds 2,000. Tina Millar's May 30 sale at Sotheby's London includes an 1857 hallmarked Parkinson &amp; Frodsham watch in a diamond set gold case attractively enamelled with portraits of unidentified sitters. There must be a premium for the buyer who can solve their identity on a pre-sale estimate of Pounds 3,500-Pounds 5,000. A stunning ladies pendant watch by Cartier set with rubies and with a black enamelled mosaic pattern (Pounds 5,000-Pounds 7,000 estimate) is also included. If this bears out the delight Tina Millar expresses for it, along with a Dittisheim Chronometre de Bord watch (for surveying purposes, estimate Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000), it should mean the heart is back in watches for collecting, to be appreciated for what they are, rather than to be used as an adjunct to a social trend. Genuine collectors must always be best for the market. Richard Garnier is Head of the Antique Clock Department at Garrard</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: On the Street corner Even after last week's gyrations, the US equity market appears deceptively sanguine. The Dow is sitting neatly between its recent peak and its level at the start of the year. But overall it has risen by a mere 4 per cent. Broader indices, notably the S&amp;P 500, have been flatter. Last week's cancellation of the GPA flotation suggests that investors are becoming more sensitive to risk after a flood of new issues. The forthcoming election is adding to the uncertain outlook. Since late last year the equity market has been underpinned by retail investors switching out of money market funds in response to exceptionally low short-term interest rates. That process cannot go on for ever, though the Federal Reserve would be reluctant to raise rates ahead of the election, and the economy has also been slow to respond to monetary ease. If anything, recent indicators have tended to weaken the view that recovery is gathering speed. The Fed could conceivably cut short-term rates again, which would help Mr Bush's re-election chances. But any cut will be small. Once a sustained recovery is evident, short-term rates will inevitably rise again, tempting retail investors back into cash. Those who remain bullish on equities on the grounds that corporate earnings are expected to rise strongly cannot have it both ways. On the one hand the argument assumes slow growth and low inflation will continue to justify easy money. On the other, the economy will have to grow rather more robustly if the market multiple of 14 for next year is correct. In that case, presumably short-term interest rates will be rising again. That does not give much incentive for further buying of US equities.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Israel to devalue ISRAEL yesterday said it would devalue the shekel by more than 10 per cent over the next year and announced a package of tax cuts as part of the Labour government's efforts to encourage export growth and investment, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. An immediate 3 per cent rise in the shekel's target, or median, rate against a basket of currencies to 2.9250 will be followed by a further 8 per cent rise over the next 12 months. This continues a policy of a pre-announced diagonal devaluation schedule intended to cut out speculative currency flows and give exporters stable exchange rates.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Trafalgar rights fear Volume in international conglomerate Trafalgar House rose to a hefty 12m, making it the day's most heavily traded stock and the shares gave up 4 to 106p as fears that the company would soon be calling on investors for more cash swept through the market. Speculation of a rights issue was fuelled by reports in the weekend press and by the close of business yesterday a feeling that a cash call was inevitable had grown. One analyst said: 'The balance sheet is still stretched and I just cannot see how they can avoid one.' However, Mr Geoff Allum at NatWest Securities said: 'It will be difficult for them to get a rights issue away. I think it is more likely that Trafalgar will attempt disposals.' Such a move would be the third time in less than two years that Trafalgar had called on the market, having raised Pounds 204m in February this year through a sterling issue and Pounds 310m through a rights issue in July 1991.</p>

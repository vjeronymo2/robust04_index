			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (1): Chances are slipping away - India is not moving fast enough to implement much-needed economic reforms. The Bombay stock market scandal and a poor monsoon this year will add to its problems of inflation and the balance of payments THE RADICAL reforms announced last year by Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao's new Congress administration made many friends of India feel that the country - which has been a slow runner among Asian nations - could be poised for a period of rapid change. But the government is now in danger of letting these opportunities slip away. Mr Rao, the prime minister, has a clear sense of the path that India must take in the wake of the collapse of two historic cornerstones of Indian economic and foreign policy - Jawaharlal Nehru's concept of economic self-sufficiency, which ran aground last year when India came close to defaulting on its international debt payments, and friendship with the Soviet Union, which fell apart with the disintegration of the Communist empire. The prime minister is committed to making the Indian economy more internationally competitive and to achieving growth through higher exports. He sees the need for closer ties with the US, both to mobilise aid and investment and as now the only superpower with the leverage to exert pressure on India's adversary, Pakistan. Mr Rao has his eyes on a comprehensive settlement with Pakistan that would cover the disputed issues of borders, Kashmir and nuclear rivalry  - and which could pave the way for arms reductions on both sides. He also recognises that market economics require a far larger devolution of power to the states than was palatable to most members of the Nehru family. This programme of internal and external restructuring marks a substantial change of direction for a country that ploughed the same furrow for too long. But between knowing where he wants to go and getting there, the prime minister has lost his nerve. Over recent months, he has begun to flounder politically. Uncharacteristically, he was knocked off balance by allegations that he had a hand in the cover-up of commission payments to Bofors, the Swedish arms manufacturer. Then, he made a serious tactical blunder in treating an internal election to the Congress party's main policymaking organisation as a challenge to his power. His short-term difficulties are likely to be exacerbated by two problems that now loom large on the horizon. The Bombay stock market scandal - in which banks and financial institutions stand to lose Rs30bn through fraudulent securities dealings - threatens to paralyse the administration as allegations grow that senior ministers and civil servants were involved. It has already resulted in a drying up of funds in the stock market, the interbank market and even retail trade. The other major problem is the growing danger that after four years of good monsoons, the rains could fail this year - thus pushing up prices beyond the already high 12-13 per cent inflation rate. If the drought, already widespread in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, grows worse or spreads, the government could find itself faced with widespread unrest and violence. An elderly, cautious patrician, Mr Rao sprung a surprise last year by the radical response of his government to the threat of debt default - and more surprises could be in store. He then carried through an unexpectedly large 25 per cent devaluation of the rupee and extensive trade and industrial deregulation. Mr Rao followed this up this year with a budget that made the rupee partially convertible, brought down the budget deficit to a projected 5 per cent of GDP for 1992-93 and initiated tax reforms. Over the last year, the prime minister has transformed what had begun as a minority government in the parliament into one that has a de facto majority. By contrast, the Opposition - the Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Janata Dal and the left - have been weakened through their own internal divisions. Yet, Mr Rao's failure as a reformer stems from his reluctance to confront the powerful lobbies that have long resisted change in India. He has postponed promised reductions in the fertiliser subsidy because of opposition from farmers. He has put off reductions in the size of the civil service and the public sector and a halt to inflation-adjusted wage increases because of union opposition. The unions have also held out so far against privatisation and the introduction of more flexible labour practices in industry. Industry itself has successfully resisted tariff cuts that would draw blood through the competition of foreign imports. Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, announced in the budget that the maximum tariff would be reduced to 110 per cent and that tariffs would come down over the next three years to levels comparable with other developing countries. But the effect of tariff cuts so far on industry has been offset by the impact of a sharply depreciating currency. Mr Rao's reason for avoiding confrontation is that a country that is socially as fragile as India cannot afford further division and secondly that change requires a consensus. But with the government dithering, the momentum of reforms has been lost and opposition lobbies have been able to entrench themselves more deeply. The delays are trying the patience of the IMF and the World Bank, and of bilateral donors to whom India is looking for a further Dollars 3bn in exceptional balance of payments financing this year. They are one of the reasons why the sharp increase in foreign investment approvals - indicating a growing interest in gaining a foothold in India - have not been followed up by substantial inward equity flows. But most of all, the slow pace of adjustment will mean a slower growth for the economy over the longer run. Already, India is piling up future bottlenecks by postponing urgently needed decisions over telecommunications, power and other infrastructure projects. The budget, equally, reflected a shortsighted tactic of sacrificing future growth to avoid present pain. The cuts in the deficit were achieved more from reducing capital investment than current spending. But the major constraint on future growth is the potential shortage of foreign exchange needed to finance imports - hence technological change and higher productivity. With an outstanding foreign debt of Dollars 74bn, India no longer has the access to the international commercial markets it had in the 1980s and foreign investment is still relatively small. Its foreign exchange requirements will thus have to come from an expansion of manufacturing exports, which reflects a major restructuring of industry and a reduction in its cost levels. With exports still growing slowly, there are not as yet the signs of a change of the magnitude required. India is already experiencing its second year of low growth. Real GDP this year, as last, is likely to increase by only 2-3 per cent - or by not much more than the growth in population. The surest way to prepare the ground for a return to the caste, communal and ethnic violence India witnessed 18 months ago would be a prolonged period of slow or average growth. The same caution that Mr Rao has brought to economic reform he has applied to his handling of India's foreign relations. The two overlap since he feels that, until he is more comfortable at home, he cannot take risks abroad. Mr Rao quickly recognised that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, India needed US support to exert pressure on Pakistan and to obtain substantial funding through the World Bank and the IMF. President Sadat looked to the US in a similar way to enlist its support against Israel. India has made some modest steps towards drawing closer to the US - including the diplomatic recognition of Israel and joint Indo-US naval exercises. Mr Rao's task has not been made any easier by the clumsiness of US diplomacy in handling disputes with India over trade, missile technology and nuclear proliferation. Within the country, there is also a growing recognition that India - no more than Pakistan - can indefinitely defy world concern over the risks of nuclear rivalry. India is thus showing more readiness to pursue confidence-building measures with Pakistan and to accept US observation of missile tests. There is also a recognition that any agreement with Pakistan over the nuclear issue would have to be part of a broader settlement. India is now signalling that it is ready for border adjustments, an open frontier and the resumption of normal trade. A peace treaty allowing both sides to make substantial reductions in defence spending and which would have been unthinkable a few years ago is at least imaginable now. The real issue is whether the governments in Delhi and Islamabad will have the strength to overcome the lobbies in their own countries that are hostile to such detente. With Mr Rao, the hesitations have the upper hand. So far, the government has sidestepped the issue of devolution of power to the states. But the states themselves are becoming increasingly exasperated with a central government whose overriding powers they resent and which cannot meet their demand for resources. States are beginning to compete among themselves for private sector, foreign investment and aid funds. The disintegration of the Soviet Union and the resurgence of ethnic and regional movements have opened their eyes and ambitions. In India there is a reluctance to face up to problems until action proves unavoidable. Myopia over macro-economic management brought India close to defaulting on its international debt last year. The external support now being provided by the World Bank, the IMF and the donor nations provides India with a breathing space in which to carry out much needed structural change. The risk of not doing so is that India will drift into another crisis.</p>

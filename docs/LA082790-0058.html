			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MACHINE TOOL ORDERS SLIDE  </P> <P> Machine tool orders tumbled in July because of weak domestic demand, the Assn.  for Manufacturing Technology said today.  </P> <P> Orders were at $233.75 million in July -- usually a month of weakness -- down  11.9% from June. Compared to July, 1989, however, they were up 22.5%.  </P> <P> "Machine tool orders are hanging tough, considering that July is usually a slow  month, as many manufacturing plants have summer shutdowns and the auto industry  is normally in the process of model changeovers," said Albert W. Moore,  president of the trade association.  </P> <P> July shipments were $233.40 million last month, down 33.4% from June.  </P></p>

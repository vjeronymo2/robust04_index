			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Fisk: "Palestine the Deal Revealed"] </F>   [Text] Yasir 'Arafat's chief negotiator to the PLO-lsraeli  peace talks, Nabil Sha'th, is used to receiving unusual  visitors. But the group of blue-suited, middle-aged men who  walked into the second-floor office of the PLO's grubby  apartment block in Cairo's Mudiriyat al-Tahrir Street on  Thursday night was unique. For the first time a joint US  Defence and State Department delegation was paying an official  visit to the PLO to assess the amount of military assistance  Washington could provide for 'Arafat's fledgling "Palestine"  police force.    The talks were as friendly as they were unprecedented. Over  bananas and sweet tea, the Americans agreed to provide the PLO's  police commander, General 'Abd-al Razzaq al-Yahya, with almost  200 military vehicles, from pick-up trucks to 2.5 ton "Blazer"  jeeps, which the PLO will use on joint patrols with Israeli  troops in the Gaza Strip. Already, the PLO has arranged to  purchase several dozen Russian armoured vehicles with which to  control the slivers of "Palestine" ceded to it under the  agreement sealed by that nervous handshake of Yasir 'Arafat and  Yitzhaq Rabin on the White House lawn on 13 September last year.    Yet the Americans found the Palestinian negotiators in a  curious frame of mind -- frustrated and angry rather than  ecstatic at the prospect of entering their "homeland" for the  first time in a quarter of a century. Aware that Palestinians  in the occupied territories are coming to regard them as  traitors rather than liberators, the PLO officials seemed to be  tearful of the future, convinced the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr  Rabin, by postponements and delay, was trying to "crack"  'Arafat, to break him to acceptance of every Israeli demand in  the occupied territories. On the face of it, secret agreements  between the PLO and the Israelis, details of which were given to  the Independent on Sunday last week, are impressive.    1. A Palestinian police force of at least 6,500 men,  equipped  with up to 9,000 Kalashnikov rifles and around 100 machine-guns.  They may bring with them into Gaza and Jericho between 30,000  and 35,000 family members -- the first substantial "return" of  Palestinians since the catastrophe that overwhelmed them in 1948.    2. A system of new "lateral" east-west roads in Gaza,  jointly  patrolled by Israelis and Palestinians, along which settlers may  travel to and from Israel; the elimination of all Israeli fixed  military positions outside Jewish settlements in Gaza; and PLO  control of almost 90 per cent of the Gaza Strip.    3. Four "safe-passage" roads between Jericho and Gaza, for  all Palestinians wishing to travel between the two cities. This  includes freedom of movement for Palestinians on roads through  the State of Israel as well as the occupied West Bank.    4. Provision for up to 80,000 Palestinians exiled after the  1967 Arab-lsraeli war to return to Jericho and Gaza, each  applicant to be vetted by a joint Egyptian-Jordanian  lsraeli-Palestinian committee.    5. Rules of engagement and conduct for PLO and Israeli  security forces in Gaza and Jericho, governed by written  instructions on the use of firearms, and agreements to prevent  PLO and Israeli forces firing at each other.    6. An interim one-week "joint deployment" operation, during  which PLO forces will take over from the Israelis, the two sides  spending seven days alongside each other to avoid a military  vacuum. The PLO police advance guard would arrive seven days  before "Z-Day", as the PLO calls it -- the final 'Arafat-Rabin  signature on the "interim phase" of the peace process. The full  deployment of PLO police would be completed within 14 days after  Z-Day.    7. A PLO-lsraeli "Joint Security Committee" with three  coordination offices in Gaza City, the Khan Younis refugee camp  in the Gaza Strip, and in Jericho, which will arrange joint  security force mobile patrols -- usually one PLO and one Israeli  vehicle on "lateral" roads in Gaza and other places of joint use.    Given the complexity of the arrangements, Sha'th's anger at  Israeli delays last week may have been understandable. But  there are deeper reasons for the PLO's depression. In the  corner of Sha'th's Cairo office, for example, there is a  three-foot stack of documents and maps which show just how far  the talks still have to go before the PLO can take over Jericho  and that part of Gaza which the Israelis will allow it to  administer.    By this weekend, for example -- just four days before the  deadline which both sides regarded as sacred last September --  the PLO and Israelis had still not agreed on the exact size of  the Jericho enclave to be controlled by the PLO, nor the number  of Palestinian paramilitary police the Israelis will eventually  permit into Jericho and Gaza. The "safe passage" arrangements  which Palestinians need to travel along the four agreed roads  between Jericho and Gaza remain unclear. So does the legal  jurisdiction of either side over settlers and Palestinians in  each other's territories. And there is still no agreement on  the system of courts which each side must administer, along with  arrangements for the apprehenslon of Palestinians or Israelis  suspected of criminal activity inside or outside the autonomous  areas. For the Palestinians as well as for the Israelis,  however, the greatest bone of contention is the continued  existence of the Israeli settlements in Jericho and Gaza.    "Since we started these talks, we must have spent 80 percent  of our entire time talking about nothing but the Jewish  settlements," one PLO negotiator said last week. "They have been  the single most important peace-breaker."    In retrospect, the talks were never going to be easy. The  imbalance of the two parties -- an economically bankrupt and  militarily impotent PLO versus an all-powerful Israel backed by  the most pro-lsraeli US administration in a generation -- have  been reflected in miniature among the negotiators.    Sha'th is a businessman and small-time publisher whose bald  pate and spectacles make him look more like an impatient  schoolmaster than a crafty statesman. His Israeli counterpart,  Maj Gen Amnon Shahaq, is deputy chief of staff of the Israeli  army. Old General al-Yahya -- the PLO's top military official  at the talks -- has not seen his home town of Haifa since he  fled as a 19-year old in 1948. His opposite number is the dapper  Maj Gen Uzi Dayan, nephew of Israel's most famous soldier.    From the start of the talks at Taba on 13 October last year,  the Israelis bore down on the PLO negotiators, astonishing  Sha'th with territorial demands that would have left 47 per cent  of the newly "autonomous" Gaza Strip still under direct Israeli  military control. The PLO found that the Israelis wanted  separate written agreements on every settlement in the Gaza  Strip, some of them so small that only two dozen families lived  there. "We spent days just negotiating the security of the  settlement of Nezerim," one of the participants recalled last  week. "There are only about 30 families in Nezerim but the  Israelis demanded the right to establish new military positions  on the Gaza beachfront to protect it, an entirely new road  system connecting Nezerim to the Israeli border to the east, a  special Israeli-PLO joint patrol system to protect Nezerim  residents who wanted to play tennis in the settlement of Gush  Katif or attend horse-riding classes there or who wanted to  visit their friends."    The Israelis created, in the words of another PLO official  "a  monstrosity of systems to protect the settlers". Settlements,  it was decided, would be regrouped in two main areas in Gaza:  Gush Katif and another area in the north of the Gaza Strip,  identified on the negotiators' maps as Erez. The Israelis then  decided that the settlers should travel to Israel by three  "lateral" roads (constructed west to east across the Strip) in  order to avoid the highway that runs the length of Gaza.    At one point in these early talks, one of Sha'th's  colleagues  exploded in anger at the Israelis, calling their demands  "utterly ridiculous" and asking why, in an area only 20 miles in  length, settlers could not travel an extra 10 miles to Israel on  the north-south highway rather than constructing three new  roads. To the astonishment of the PLO the Israelis then  proposed an Israeli- controlled zone lkm wide along the border  of the Gaza Strip and a zone 1.2km wide along each of the new  roads, together with five more military bases on these routes  and along the Gaza beachfront, giving Israel 14 military camps  in areas "controlled" by Palestinians outside the settlement  zones.    When the Palestinian negotiators realised that under this  plan, Israel would remain in control of 47 per cent of Gaza,  they suspended the Taba talks. 'Amr Musa, the Egyptian Foreign  Minister, flew to see Rabin in Jerusalem to complain. "Why are  the Palestinians so angry?" Rabin is retorted to have replied.  "This is only our first negotiating move!" Upon which the  Israelis reduced their occupation of Gaza to 10 per cent of the  territory, although the depth of an Israeli cordon sanitaire  along the Gaza- Egyptian border is still being negotiated. PLO  officials are also aware of the tenuous nature of their  authority, something they have been unwilling to emphasise lest  the true nature of Israel's power over the future Palestinian  entity becomes apparent.    They have conceded, for example, that only Palestinians  holding Jordanian or Egyptian identity papers may enter Gaza and  Jericho as PLO policemen. Palestinians resident in Lebanon or  Syria -- the principal focus of opposition to 'Arafat's  agreement with Israel -- will be forbidden entry to the police.    Israel originally insisted that 'Arafat's "capital" of  Jericho. should be only nine square kilometres in size. So  Sha'th and his fellow negotiators slowly added new strips of  land. They first demanded that two neighbouring refugee camps  should come under the PLO's control, then the water resources in  the hills to the west and the agricultural area around them.  Then Sha'th said he wanted the Palestinian hamlet of 'Auja and  its agricultural land, along with a right of passage for  Palestinians to the Dead Sea and to the religious shrine of Nabi  Musa.    The final size of Jericho, between 57 and 58 square  kilometres, is to be decided at the pre-signing meeting of  'Arafat and Rabin. But to their shock the Palestinians  discovered last week that the Israelis have already started  construction on a large new military base on the main road south  of Jericho, scarcely a mile from the position that they will  evacuate when the PLO takes over.    Aware that the Israelis are creating new "facts on the  ground", Sha'th fell back on the argument that the actual size  of Jericho did not matter because, once the PLO's control is  extended into the rest of the West Bank, Jericho will "melt"  into this area.    It is not difficult to see how 'Arafat's ever-growing army  of  opponents in the occupied territories will find fault with these  arrangements. Far more delicate are the arrangements by which  the PLO's police force will "co-ordinate" with the Israeli army.  HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the other radical  Islamic groups opposed to the PLO accord claim that the PLO will  become a branch of Israeli intelligence once the interim  agreement comes into force. And it has indeed been agreed  between the Israelis and the PLO that an intelligence officer  from each side will take part in the weekly meetings of the  Joint Security Committee.    Sha'th insists that their role will be purely "functional" -  intended to keep the security role of the Israelis and PLO  separate rather than united, with the Israeli Shin Beth officer  and the PLO mukhabarat (intelligence) agent sitting down  together, but operating independently of each other.    "This will be `non-friction' co-ordination," one of the PLO  negotiators said. "It is to make sure that the two armies don't  shoot at each other." But it will be difficult to convince  Palestinians that this rule will be adhered to, especially if  the Israelis are searching for wanted Palestinians. Even the  court systems -- the jurisdiction which each side will have over  its own citizens and the arrangements for dealing with serious  acts of violence by either side -- have not yet been agreed upon.    The PLO's rules of engagement, set out in documents which  have been shown to the Independent on Sunday, appear woefully  inadequate. Armed Palestinian security forces may act, they say,  in response to "an act or incident constituting a danger to body  or property", provided the shooting "is aimed at  preventing/terminating such an act or incident or at  apprehending its perpetrators".    Firearms may not be used except "within the law (sic)" and  "as a last resort" after "warning the perpetrators or shots in  the air" have failed to halt wrongdoers.    So what if the Palestinians are confronted by thousands of  Hamas demonstrators? Or by angry Israeli troops shooting at  Palestinians on the edge of the "autonomous" area? Or if the  Israelis are ambushed near the settlements and want to stage a  military sweep through part of the autonomous area? Or if a  settler is shooting at Palestinians, as Baruch Goldstein did in  Hebron? What if the Israelis' nightmare -- a Katyusha rocket  attack from "PLO" Gaza into Tel Ashqelon -- becomes a reality?    One of the most senior of Sha'th's negotiators claims there  is no point in debating this. "None of what we are doing will  work if it's not an irreversible march towards peace," he says.  "There is only one guarantee against a Katyusha attack --  that's the commitment of the Palestinians themselves that this  peace process is worthwhile. The only way to stop Katyushas is  for every Palestinian to regard anyone who fires a Katyusha as  an enemy of Palestinian independence. What we are doing is  creating conditions that the Israelis would be stupid to  reverse."    Creating those conditions however, is taking far longer than  it should. Given the degree of hostility now facing 'Arafat in  the occupied territories, many of the secret agreements may  already be hostages to fortune. Over the past seven months,  'Arafat has announced his imminent arrival in Jericho on four  separate occasions; but on current progress (or lack thereof)  the PLO chairman is unlikely to keep even his latest promise to  turn up next month. As for Gaza, there are those among his  negotiators who suspect he will need all the military vehicles  he can lay his hands on -- American or Egyptian -- to protect  himself from his own people there.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES  </P> <P> Bo Derek's first film in five years -- "Ghosts Can't Do It" -- recently  materialized in 16 cities across the country, grossing a paltry $25,000 in two  weeks. But the actress professes no anguish, admitting the "little $3-million  movie" could have gone straight to video.  </P> <P> "It's a nice, intimate entertainment," she tells us, "which means it's  difficult for it to compete theatrically."  </P> <P> Produced by Bo with husband John Derek -- who's also the writer, director,  editor and cinematographer -- "Ghosts" is already down to half a dozen  theaters. At present, Triumph Releasing doesn't have an L.A. showing scheduled.  </P> <P> The film is a May-December romance in which screen hubby Anthony Quinn dies and  returns as a ghost in search of a young, virile male body to inhabit. There's  nudity -- Bo's -- and a cameo by Donald Trump.  </P> <P> As for Bo and John's real-life May-December marriage (she's now 33 to his 63):  "Everything's going well. We're working together -- which is what we want."  </P> <P> They're developing more projects, she says, but she's also "having talks" about  working in a "mainstream" movie without him.  </P> <P> "I'm more capable now. I think I could handle it," says the woman who became an  instant celebrity with the 1979 film "10."  </P> <P> Does she think her career's been sliding ever since?  </P> <P> "Not at all. I was so unready for all that happened with '10.' I decided I  wanted to become the master of my own destiny. I've been learning about  producing films these last 10 years. And getting the financing.  </P> <P> "I've broadened my horizons." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

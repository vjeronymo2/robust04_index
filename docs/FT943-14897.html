			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: US funds sellers of BP The oil majors, BP and Shell, were among the worst performers in the FT-SE 100 index, with US institutions said to have been big sellers of the stocks, particularly BP, in the wake of dollar weakness. The underperformance of the big oil issues was all the more surprising given that oil prices were exceptionally strong yesterday afternoon when August Brent was some 40 cents a barrel higher around the Dollars 17.75 level. Some analysts began to worry, however, that the latest upsurge in oil prices, along with other commodities, could begin to unnerve the US authorities and provoke moves to cap rising prices. BP settled 5 off at 380p, on turnover of 6.5m, after some aggressive selling from all the big US investment houses, notably Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers. Shell Transport also underperformed but managed to post a closing gain of 1 at 698p as the market waited for confirmation of the sale of its Billiton metals business in South Africa to Gencor for upwards of Dollars 1bn.</p>

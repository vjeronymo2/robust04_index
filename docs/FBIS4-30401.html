			<p>BFN     [Text] Taku Yamazaki, former director-general of the  Defense Agency, and Yoichi Tani, acting chairman of the  Dietmen's League for Promotion of Friendship between Japan and  North Korea, gave a report on their recent visit to North Korea  at the Japan Press Club in Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo on 21 June.  Both of them are dietmembers from the Liberal Democratic Party.    Following the talks held between former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter and President Kim Il-song, North Korea has made positive  moves towards holding the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks, as  well as South-North summit talks. Touching on these moves in  his report, Yamazaki stated his view that the DPRK is shifting  its political stance to an open-door policy.    However, concerning further nuclear inspections, Dietman  Tani said: "There will possibly be a difference in views between  nuclear and military experts. (When we suggested that they  should accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency,) we got no response. It certainly is not that easy."  Thus, he expressed his view that it will be difficult for the  United States and the DPRK to succeed in talks.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECONOMISTS SPLIT ON WHERE U.S. IS HEADED;  </P> <P> PANEL AGREES DEFICIT IS KEY ISSUE BUT DIVIDES ON CHANCE OF RECESSION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times' panel of distinguished economists reached a standoff  this year, equally divided over whether 1989 will be the year that a recession  finally halts America's longest postwar boom.  </P> <P> But the six members of The Times' Board of Economists who participated in the  year-end survey more or less agreed that three key issues will determine 1989's  economic fate. These are whether the Bush Administration and Congress will  agree on meaningful steps to lower the budget deficit; the reactions of foreign  investors, especially the Japanese, to economic developments here, and whether  American consumers, loaded down with record levels of debt, will nevertheless  continue to spend beyond their means.  </P> <P> As always, the Federal Reserve Board's role in setting interest rates, largely  in response to these issues, also is considered crucial.  </P> <P> The economists' forecasts differ so widely mainly because they hinge on  predictions of human behavior and the outcome of political maneuvering in  Washington, rather than simple number-crunching.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Six Participants  </P> <P> The bright note this year is that the board of economists as a group is  somewhat less pessimistic now than a year ago. Jarred by the October, 1987,  stock market crash, five out of eight board members last year predicted  recession in 1988. But the American economy romped right past the crash,  growing by at least 2.6% last year.  </P> <P> Only six economists participated this year because two have been enlisted in  the service of the Bush Administration. Michael A. Boskin resigned from the  board because he was named chairman of the President's Council of Economic  Advisers. Board member Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and  public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, declined to participate because he  is now serving as an adviser to the President's council.  </P> <P> The three who predict no recession in 1989 are George L. Perry, a senior fellow  at the Brookings Institution in Washington; Paul R. Krugman, a professor of  economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Irwin L. Kellner,  chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York.  </P> <P> But those who predict that the expansion will come to an end in what is now its  seventh year are Robert Lekachman, professor of economics at Lehman College of  the City University of New York and author of "Visions and Nightmares: America  After Reagan"; David M. Gordon, economics professor at the New School for  Social Research in New York, and A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based economic  consultant and author of "The World Has Definitely Changed."  </P> <P> While the budget deficit has been a big concern in past years, this year the  economists agree that it is a pivotal question for the U.S. economy in 1989.  One reason is that the budget deficit, and the related U.S. trade deficit, have  become key determinants for how foreign investors and foreign central bankers  react, driving the dollar down or up, and making foreign capital for investment  here plentiful or scarce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recession Scenario  </P> <P> The two economists who believe that Congress and the new President will be able  to agree promptly on budgetary steps serious enough to impress the jittery  world markets predicted that the economic expansion will continue at least one  more year, although the economy will probably grow at a slower rate. One,  Krugman, predicted no recession even though he doubts that there will be much  progress on the deficit this year.  </P> <P> But the rest, who don't expect agreement this year on spending cuts or a  combination of spending cuts and tax increases predicted a recession.  </P> <P> The recession scenario generally goes like this: A marked failure to do  something about the deficit could cause the dollar to drop dramatically against  major foreign currencies such as the yen and the West German mark as foreign  investors conclude that the U.S. economy isn't such a good investment and  foreign central bankers decide that there is no longer any point to propping up  the dollar. The Fed responds by sharply raising interest rates to attract back  foreign investors (higher interest rates on investments help compensate  investors for a depreciating dollar) and to choke off inflation that may be  caused by more expensive imports.  </P> <P> But a big hike in interest rates could easily end the expansion and would be  particularly dangerous at a time when both individuals and companies are loaded  up with record levels of debt.  </P> <P> Making the situation even more fragile, says Shilling, is that record amounts  of both personal and company debt are now subject to fluctuating, variable-rate  interest payments. This includes variable-rate mortgages, home equity loans and  credit card accounts for individuals, as well as variable-rate borrowing by  companies. As a result, Shilling says, any big hike in interest rates would be  felt almost immediately throughout the economy, triggering bankruptcies and an  abrupt drop-off of consumer spending.  </P> <P> Shilling foresees a recession starting in the first half of 1989, setoff in  part by the Fed raising interest rates to choke off a perceived threat of  renewed inflation and to make up for an expected loss of confidence in the  American economy by foreign investors. "It will be a classic case of the Fed  being forced to raise short-term interest rates to recession-precipitating  levels," he says.  </P> <P> Shilling also sees the first strong signs in some time of fear by industry that  inflation, currently at a relatively low rate of 4.5% annually as measured by  the consumer price index, is about to take off. Companies, he says, are doing  the first hedge-buying of inventory -- stocking up on supplies in expectation  that prices are about to go up -- since the 1970s.  </P> <P> Lekachman, another predictor of recession, owns up to having forecast a  downturn every year for the past four years. But he maintains that "the chances  are about 2 to 1 that by the fourth quarter of 1989, we'll see the recession."  He predicts that the main cause will be Japanese investors and Japan's central  bank, responding to what they view as a weak U.S. President and a political  "mess" in Washington's approach to the deficit. Lekachman notes that the United  States depends on a massive influx of foreign capital and says he detects signs  that the Japanese are increasingly willing to throw their weight around on the  global economic scene.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reprieve Predicted  </P> <P> If the Japanese lose confidence in Bush's ability to reduce the deficit, they  may well reduce their buying at U.S. Treasury auctions, which in turn could  sharply push up U.S. interest rates. "This will be the classic trigger for a  recession," he says.  </P> <P> Gordon foresees a particularly deep recession. "It's going to be pretty nasty  because of the mountainous levels of personal and corporate debt," he says.  </P> <P> But Kellner, a member of The Times' board who last year predicted a recession,  this year thinks the economy will squeak by with another reprieve. Kellner  thinks that despite the political problems, the Bush Administration will win an  agreement this year with legislators on a plan to eliminate the deficit over  four years. This, he maintains, would be enough to satisfy foreign investors  and Japanese and European governments and allow the Fed to ease up on its  current tight-money policy.  </P> <P> In addition, Kellner predicts a slackening of consumer spending sufficient to  keep inflation in check but not severe enough to induce a recession. Of the six  economists, Kellner alone expects consumer spending to slow significantly  without a sharp jolt of higher interest rates first.  </P> <P> Economic forecasters consider consumer spending extremely important to their  calculations since it makes up about two-thirds of the nation's economic  activity. (Slightly under half of this goes for items bought in stores, the  rest goes for rent, health care, transportation and other services.)  </P> <P> Kellner believes that consumers are getting exhausted from years of increased  spending and are about to cut back. With employment high, he says, "There is no  pent-up demand for big ticket items people delayed buying because they were out  of work."  </P> <P> He also notes that prices of expensive consumer items have risen faster than  most peoples' incomes. "Given that the cost of big-ticket items has gone up  faster than incomes, people have bought about all they're going to buy," he  asserts. As evidence, he cites the fact that consumer spending, adjusted for  inflation, was lower this fall than it was two years earlier.  </P> <P> The rest of The Times panel, however, doubts that consumers are likely to begin  acting so rationally. Some say that during the past eight years, encouraged by  the economic boom and the Republican Administration's supply side economics,  the habit of spending much and saving little has become ingrained. "Ronald  Reagan . . . really has gone a long distance to reinforce the American attitude  of spend today, pay tomorrow," says Lekachman.  </P> <P> Shilling, too, sees no signs of consumer spending slowing down. He notes that  the stock market crash didn't shock consumers into spending less. "The consumer  just isn't giving up," he said. "People are way overextended. They're borrowing  to pay their bills. People don't want to give up on the American dream of  ever-increasing purchasing power."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Economy Pretty Healthy'  </P> <P> Early indications that 1988 Christmas buying was relatively strong seem to give  credit to those who see no falloff of consumer spending. One fear is that  continued strong consumer demand will add to inflationary pressures, forcing  the Fed to continue raising interest rates.  </P> <P> But Perry, although he foresees little change in consumer spending levels this  year, says he isn't particularly worried. "I think the economy is pretty  healthy," he states, adding that he thinks a recession in 1989 is unlikely.  "People have predicted it every year, and every year they've been wrong," he  says.  </P> <P> He believes that the economy is slowing a bit and that the gross national  product -- a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy -- will  continue to grow at an acceptably low rate of about 3% in 1989. Perry doubts  that foreigners will become so concerned about the U.S. economic situation that  they will begin dumping dollars. And he said that any substantial improvement  in the budget deficit would be met by a decline in interest rates.  </P> <P> He gives the Fed credit for keeping growth rates and inflation in check. "The  Fed is doing what it traditionally has done, to lean against the wind," Perry  says. "It sees an expansion that is still pretty vigorous, and it's letting  interest rates rise to take a little steam out."  </P> <P> Krugman, while not completely ruling out the possibility of recession in 1989,  sees a greater risk of an overheating economy. "The fundamentals are that we  still have very strong domestic demand and a weak dollar," he says. He believes  that the Fed will continue to nudge up interest rates, even enough to send some  highly leveraged companies into bankruptcy. But because demand is so strong, he  doesn't predict a full-fledged recession. Because with the wave of corporate  takeovers and leveraged buyouts companies are heavily indebted, "what we have  is a strange economy -- you could have a lot of bankrupt companies working at  (full) capacity."  </P></p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Christopher will press Kiev to give up missiles MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, will today arrive in Kiev bearing gifts and reassurances, as part of Washington's new tactic to press Ukraine to relinquish its nuclear arsenal. Since the summer the US has shifted its approach towards Ukraine to conditional economic assistance, encouraging Ukraine's nuclear disarmament through small carrots of financial aid and high-level diplomatic contacts. Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with 176 strategic missiles and 1,656 nuclear weapons. Inherited from the former Soviet Union, this is larger than the arsenal of Great Britain, France and China combined. Though President Leonid Kravchuk has already obliged Ukraine to accede to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1) and become a non-nuclear power according to the 1992 Lisbon protocol, Ukraine has not ratified or implemented these agreements, which would transfer all its nuclear weapons to Russia. Instead Ukraine has been hanging on to them as bargaining chips with the west for economic aid, security guarantees and international attention. Only last week Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine should keep its 46 modern SS-24 missiles because the west is not doing enough to help Ukraine. Kiev is asking for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to dismantle their nuclear arsenal. In addition Ukraine is looking to the west for security guarantees to protect its borders, and membership in Nato. Kiev is wary that Nato might expand into eastern Europe to include former Warsaw Pact neighbours, such as Poland, but leave Ukraine to fend for itself within Russia's sphere of influence. During Mr Christopher's one-day stop in Kiev on the tour of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, he is expected to announce a Dollars 330m aid package of agricultural credits and technical assistance. Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow: On his way to Ukraine, Mr Christopher stopped in Almaty, the capital of Kazakhstan, where he received assurances from President Nursultan Nazarbayev that the republic would stick to commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons.</p>

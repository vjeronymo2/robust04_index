			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" By Teng Wenqi: "A Great Change in S. </F> African Situation"]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April  26-28 elections in South Africa.    The decision was announced by South African President  Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among  himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson  Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in  the poll is of great importance to the current situation in  South Africa.    The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest  political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the  three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in  the elections.    The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of  Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in  South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu  Homeland.    The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or  con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed  the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party  negttiations and adopted by the parliament.    The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later  asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to  submit its candidates for the elections.    Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other  foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt  to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and  IFP, but failed.    Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since  1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The  violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year.  More than 300 people died of violence monthly.    De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of  agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks  in Pretoria.    The memorandum said the three parties "reject violence and  will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and  fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa."    In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their  followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise  maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful  means.    The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will  greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa.    The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the  total South African people, are taking part in the elections.  This means a great change in the elections in South Africa.    Buthelezi said at a press conference today "South Africans  may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of  unimaginable proportions."    Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is "a leap forward"  for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process."    "IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all  leaders and of all those who love South Africa," Mandela stated.</p>

Two days after the attack some Western news agencies began  talking about a horrible scenario in Sudan similar to the  Lebanese civil war and the conflict between the militias in  Somalia.    If we examine the sequence of events over the past three  months, from the mutual expulsion of ambassadors by Khartoum and  London, to the U.S. media campaigns focusing on the violation of  human rights in the south, to the Washington conference to which  the opposition factions were invited with the implicit blessing  of the State Department, we would realize that something is  being hatched for Sudan and its people.    True, there are differences of opinion between some Sudanese  political groups and the present Sudanese regime, especially  over the absence of democracy of the Western parliamentary type  based on direct free elections, but, noticeably, most of the  regimes on which the opposition depends are also lacking in  democracy and freedom of expression. It is perhaps worth noting  that the regimes which support some Sudanese groups in their  legitimate struggle for democracy are the very same regimes  which had plotted against the Sudanese democratic experiment  which flourished after the downfall of President Ja'far  Numayri's regime in an unprecedented popular uprising.    The danger currently threatening Sudan necessitates that  both  government and opposition face it jointly in one trench because  its aim is to tear the country apart and plunge it into  devastating wars that would blow away all the positive  achievements such as food self-sufficiency, freezing of foreign  debts, and elimination of many aspects of corruption. For all  to be able to stand in the same trench, there should be dialogue  and frankness based on loyalty to the homeland and its  territorial integrity, not on the basis of revenge and suspect  foreign links.    The fact that the United States has been hostile to Sudan  and  has added its name to the terrorist list is in itself proof that  there is something positive in Sudan, something not to the  liking of certain Western circles known for not always harboring  good intentions toward the Arabs and Muslims.    Why is the United States antagonistic to Sudan when there  are  no common borders, interests, trade exchange, or oil  transactions between the two? What really disturbs some Western  quarters about Sudan is that in Sudan there is a desire for real  independence, self-sufficiency, a complete Islamic program, and  equality, and an eagerness to open the country to Arab and  Islamic investments and to apply the Islamic Shari'ah. The  American rule is subservience of the regimes to the will of the  White House and the states in its orbit. The exception is  promotion of an Arab Islamic identity outside the framework of  U.S. hegemony. When corruption was the only certainty in Sudan  and when Western intelligence services were acting freely there  under different names such as relief and human rights  organizations, Sudan was at the top of the list of states  satisfactory to both West and East, but when it tried to steer a  different course the picture changed completely.    Is it not worth noting that Eritrea, which had received  every  possible aid and support from Sudan's Islamic regime, is now  complaining about its fundamentalism and denying all the aid the  Sudanese people extended to the Eritrean people until they  achieved independence? Is it not worth noting that former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter was the one who refuted the current U.S.  Administration's allegations about terrorism in Sudan, while  some of the latter's own people are volunteering to confirm  these charges?    It is difficult to claim that everything the Sudanese regime  does is sound and positive. There are, without doubt, some  reservations, particulary about the lack of democracy, but when  the plot goes so far as trying to undermine security, drown the  country in civil wars, and strengthen the secessionists and  supply them with the means to sustain the war of attrition in  the country, then many of the reservations should be set aside,  at least temporarily. Sudan's unity, national independence, and  dignity as a sovereign state must take priority over all other  considerations.</p>

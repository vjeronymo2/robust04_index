			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> MOST IN SURVEY CRITICAL OF TV EVANGELISTS  </P> <P> A new Gallup Poll found that public opinion of television evangelists in  general is at an all-time low. In 1980, when Gallup first started gauging the  public's image of television evangelists, most Americans held positive views of  them as a group. Now, nearly eight in 10 (79%) say television evangelists  cannot be trusted with their supporters' donations. In 1980, less than half as  many (36%) were distrustful of evangelists' handling of funds. Large majorities  now describe TV evangelists as dishonest (70%), insincere (67%), lacking a  special relationship with God (67%), and uncaring (62%). The results are based  on telephone interviews with 1,238 randomly selected adults conducted from  Sept. 7-10. The error rate could be plus or minus 4 percentage points.  </P></p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Delors makes impassioned defence of social system Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday called on Europe to lift its sights towards a 'democratic Utopia', capable of providing minimum social rights for all. He warned that attempts to use recession, Europe's competitiveness problems and the jobs crisis as an excuse to dismantle 'the European model' of social protection would destroy centuries of striving towards 'a balanced society'. However, in an elliptical speech which centred as much on public morality as on policy, Mr Delors was also dismissive of those opposed to any reform of Europe's social and welfare arrangements. 'We have to get away from the battle between those who don't want to change anything simply because of tradition, and those who want to do away with 150 years of social progress,' he said. Mr Delors' unscripted remarks - made to a public seminar before the publication of the Commission's White Paper on the future of EU social policy, expected in July - were expressed with a force not used since before the December 1991 summit which agreed the Maastricht treaty. The Commission president, who ends his turbulent 10-year tenure in Brussels next January, said those who claimed Europe's welfare system was holding back growth had forgotten that the three recessions of the past 20 years could have degenerated into a 1930s-type depression if such protection had not protected minimum incomes and demand. 'Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater,' he said. Neither was protectionism a feasible or defensible way of preserving European standards from lower-wage competitors in Asia and Latin America. 'How would they buy from us?' Mr Delors asked, arguing that: 'Trade is not a one-way street, it is a two-way motorway.' He revived the idea raised after last year's chaos in European currency markets for a UN-style 'security council for the economy', to manage economic and monetary shocks, and even manage cross-border problems like sudden surges in emigration. Mr Delors said Europe was struggling to adapt to technological progress in terms of job creation and organisation of working time. It was failing to get to grips with problems ranging from an ageing population and healthcare costs, to youth unemployment, racism, the disintegration of the family and loneliness. All this, Mr Delors said, was 'a problem of society's soul'. But, he said: 'There is a European model of society.' It had to be developed, more into 'a system balancing obligations and rights'. He implied that some payment of unemployment benefit could be linked to the provision of services which meet public needs. 'We have to rehabilitate the idea of public service,' he said. 'We have to enrich our social system.' Mr Delors insisted: 'It is not by backtracking on social policy that we will resolve our problems. I would call what I am suggesting a democratic Utopia, but it is not unattainable.' Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

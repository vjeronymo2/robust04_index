			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Finnish bank sees deficit reduction KANSALLIS-OSAKE-PANKKI, Finland's leading commercial bank, expects to almost halve losses in 1993 to about FM2bn (Dollars 345m). Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive, said the forecast reflected the sharp drop in Finnish interest rates which was expected to lead to a big reduction in credit losses. Last year, the bank's pre-tax deficit was FM3.7bn. Mr Voutilainen said the bank was expecting a big drop in credit losses related to small and medium-sized companies which last year accounted for FM3bn of total write-offs of FM4.3bn. 'Non-performing loans in this sector are gradually levelling off, which is an indication that we will have fewer problems in the near future,' he stated. The drop in Finnish interest rates, which at 8.5 per cent are half last autumn's 17 per cent level, should lead to a drop in bankruptcies, he added. KOP expects credit losses in the personal sector to increase from last year's FM400m level, because of rising unemployment.</p>

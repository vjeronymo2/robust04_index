			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ARTICLES ON ELECTION RESULTS INSULTING  </P> <P> The articles highlighting the election results from the day before were  extremely insulting.  </P> <P> It is difficult, at best, to get people out to vote.  </P> <P> Why is it necessary to say to those who understand their social obligations,  you have been "duped," your vote was bought?  </P> <P> When I pushed that lever to make my choice, only my hand and my arm made the  mechanism work -- it was my choice. As I looked over my shoulder, I didn't once  see any deep-pocket individual attempting to influence my choice.  </P> <P> Timing is extremely important for issues to strike the fancies of the voters.  With such uncertainty in the economy, including potential unemployment, why  would anyone expect the approval of bond issues over and beyond the bare social  necessities. The public has repeatedly shown their distaste for increases in  taxes in any form.  </P> <P> Again, I resent the inference that I was duped and/or bought by deep-pocket  groups and big business.  </P> <P> R. L. HESTER, Thousand Oaks  </P></p>

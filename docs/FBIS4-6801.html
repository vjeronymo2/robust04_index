			<p>BFN     [Text] In Jakarta today, Indonesian President Suharto  received a National Assembly delegation led by Speaker Sa'di  Mahdi Salih, President Saddam Husayn's envoy. Suharto welcomed  them to Indonesia and said he hoped their contacts with  Indonesian parliamentarians would further boost bilateral ties.  The president noted that during a visit earlier in the week to  Indonesia by Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, the foreign minister  discussed with him recent developments in the UN Security  Council [with regard to Iraq's demand that the sanctions be  lifted]. Suharto told Salih that Indonesia takes a keen  interest in the matter and will pursue it in its capacity as the  current president of the Nonaligned Movement through its  coordination bureau in Jakarta and liaison office in New York.  Indonesia also plans to contact the movement's nations who are  not permanent Security Council members. In case no suitable  solution is worked out to end the hardships the Iraqis are  experiencing from the sanctions, Indonesia, Suharto added, will  explore other avenues. His country also stands ready to extend  humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people, particularly  medicines.    Sa'di Mahdi Salih thanked the Indonesian president for his  time and for the positive approach of the Indonesian leadership  and people to Iraq.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ma Wenrui (7456 2429 3843), president of China </F> Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit: "The Times Need the  Yanan Spirit, People Call for the Yanan Spirit"]    [Text] We all know that it was Comrade Mao Zedong who  cultivated the Yanan spirit and sowed its seeds in the whole  country, turning them into flowers and fruits. Therefore, in  today's time of great change, upholding and developing Mao  Zedong Thought and fostering the Yanan spirit is of extreme  importance to the great undertaking of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    At present, the CPC Central Committee calls on the whole  party to vigorously foster the main melody of our times. What  is the main melody? It is Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, patriotism, collectivism, socialism,  the dedicated spirit of the masses in the process of reform and  modernization, the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation,  and the outstanding revolutionary traditions created by the  communists in the course of revolution and construction,  including, of course, the Yanan spirit. Central leading comrades  have said that grasping this main melody, emphasizing this main  melody, and loudly singing this main melody can better inspire  the people's enthusiasm, enhance the fighting spirit among the  masses, concentrate the strength of the nation, arouse vigor in  society, and push the times forward. We wholeheartedly support  the decision by the CPC Central Committee, respond with all our  strength to its call, and join the choir in singing the main  melody to sing Yanan spirit more loudly, more clearly, and more  forcefully. "We must publicize, restore, and develop the Yanan  spirit (speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping in 1980)," and let the  "Yanan spirit shine forever," (words written by Comrade Jiang  Zemin in 1990), and this is the purpose and goal of the struggle  of the China Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit. Comrade Deng  Xiaoping pointed out in his speech, entitled "Implement the  Principle of Adjustment, Ensure Stability and Unity," which he  delivered on 25 December 1980, that "we must publicize, restore,  and develop the Yanan spirit, the spirit we had shortly after  the liberation, and the spirit with which we overcame  difficulties in the early 1960's. We must first have confidence  ourselves, then we can gather the masses and educate them on  enhancing confidence." Along with reform, opening up, and the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of socialist economic  construction, when we review these words today, we can more  clearly see that situated in the initial stage of socialism, and  at the time of changing the old economic system into a new one,  we must develop the Yanan spirit all the more vigorously.    The theory and practice of building a socialist market  economy is a major breakthrough in the traditional concept and  model, a great development of Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, a  very difficult and arduous undertaking never tried by our  predecessors, and a brand new topic in the history of the  development of our country. It requires us to inherit and  develop the spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth  from facts. The development of a socialist market economy is  for the country's prosperity and affluence. Our country has  limited strength, a weak foundation, and many difficulties, and  this requires us to continue to inherit and develop the  pioneering spirit which is characterized by independence,  self-determination, self-reliance, hard struggle, willingness in  spite of difficulties, diligence, frugality, being uncorrupt and  law abiding, carrying out vigorous efforts in administration,  and selfless dedication.    We should launch activities among young people, and take  this  as the key point of our work, passing on the Yanan spirit from  one generation to the next. According to the CPC Central  Committee's strategic arrangement, our country's national  economic development should reach the third goal of struggle to  basically realize socialist modernization by the middle of the  next century, that is, by the time of the 100th anniversary of  the nation's founding. History determines that the realization  of this grand blueprint and undertaking, which faces the whole  party and the people of various nationalities in the whole  country, rests on the century-spanning youths and their  descendants. With what kind of spirit will they meet this  historical mission? Can they properly take over the job of  upholding the party's basic line unswervingly for 100 years and  ensuring long-term peace and order in the country? Can they  ceaselessly promote the great undertaking of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics and maintain a sustained, rapid,  and healthy development of it? Can they play an exemplary role  and educate their offspring in struggling for the great ideals  of communism in the generations to come? This is a big matter  which has a bearing on the future and fate of our party,  country, and nation. Grasping this strategic duty, we must  coordinate closely with the relevant party and government  departments and with the relevant groups of the masses, to help  the broad masses of young people to gradually build up great  faith and ideals when they carry out the solemn historical  mission, to establish a correct outlook on life and the world,  to inherit and develop the party's excellent traditions, to  change their own subjective world when they change the objective  world, and to grow up as socialism-building successors who have  ideals, morals, culture, and discipline.    We must care for clean government building, oppose  corruption, and vigorously preach the noble Yanan spirit, which  is characterized by being clean, law abiding, and selfless in  dedication. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We have scored quite  a result in economic construction, and the situation is  gratifying, and this is our country's success. But if the  social atmosphere continues to deteriorate, then what is the  point of economic success? A change of nature will take place  in another area and then induce a change of nature in the whole  economy, and such a development will lead to a world of rampant  corruption, theft, robbery, and bribery." He also pointed out:  "We struggle for socialism, not only because socialism has the  conditions for developing the productive forces more rapidly  than capitalism, but also because only socialism can eliminate  the greed, corruption, and unfair phenomena inevitably produced  by capitalism and other systems of exploitation." Indeed, this  is an issue which has a bearing on our offspring, on communist  ideals and faiths, on the inheritance of good traditions from  the party and the nation, on the quality and hopes of the  Chinese nation, on whether achievements made by hundreds of  thousands of revolutionary martyrs can be consolidated and  developed, and on whether socialism can be upheld and developed  under the current world pattern. These sincere words and  earnest wishes of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, a long-tested  proletarian revolutionary of the older generation as well as the  creator and architect of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, merit our deep thinking! Since the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, in the  process of reform and opening up and socialist economic  construction, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again  instructed us to do two kinds of work simultaneously, and  equally firmly. What is the reason for the frequent deviations?  This is a question which merits deep thinking.    Since last summer, the central leadership has made decisions  and clear arrangements to launch the struggle against corruption  and for clean government; it said the struggle would be grasped  for a long time and spiritual civilization construction must  really become solid. The central leadership's determination has  encouraged the whole party and the whole people and has fostered  confidence in anticorruption and clean government. It is  believed that under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee  which has Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, problems will be  solved step by step, and, in fact, some problems are being  solved. In order to solve these problems, the whole party and  people in the whole country will surely make the biggest  efforts. In this area, we should have confidence and view it as  an important duty of our own, we must do various tasks in  society well and propose various constructive ideas, and, under  the party's leadership, enthusiastically serve the purpose of  anticorruption, clean government building, and correction of  party work style. Our party's excellent traditions, especially  the Yanan spirit, can play an active role in combating various  kinds of corrupt phenomena and unhealthy practices.    The three major work styles cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong  and the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation,  that is, linking theory to practice, fostering close ties with  the people, and criticizing and accepting criticisms, are the  three magic weapons ensuring that our party's purpose of  wholeheartedly serving the people can materialize, as well as  the main sign distinguishing our party from any other political  party. The China Society for Studying the Yanan Spirit must  look at how we can develop the party's three major work styles  and overcome various kinds of healthy practices within the  party. When these three major work styles are on the rise, the  party will become prosperous, and this should be the irrefutable  truth.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics has also integrated the universal truth  of Marxism with the actual conditions of our country, followed  our own road, and revealed the true rationale for building  socialism with Chinese characteristics; it is a model for  inheriting and developing Mao Zedong Thought. The theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics will surely lead  the Chinese people to completely cast off poverty and build the  country into a strong, prosperous, and modern nation. The  publishing of Volume Three of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping has provided good conditions for us to profoundly and  systematically learn from and understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory. Only by thoroughly grasping this scientific theory, can  we do a good job in inheriting and developing the Yanan spirit  and make our own contributions to building a socialist  undertaking which has Chinese characteristics.</p>

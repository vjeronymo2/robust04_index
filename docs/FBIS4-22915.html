			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ilona Yegiazarova ``Intelligent dolphins are </F> becoming working class'' under the rubric of ``Bordering on  science fiction'']    [Text] ``We shall not mention the last names,'' I was  immediately warned by my interviewees, scientists from the  Moscow State University, who for a long time have carried out  experiments at a Black Sea naval base.    ``Secrecy?..''    ``No, this is not important. We are talking about a  principally new effort. And in our peer group, it is not  customary to stick your head out until the research findings are  published in specialized publications. Yet the circumstances  obligate us to make this known today. The hard reality is  merciful both towards us and towards the dolphins.''    Yet nevertheless, I decided to start with secrets.  Especially  since the subject is so exciting. The colleagues know: until  recently, journalists weren't allowed anywhere near the dolphin  aquariums related to the Navy in one way or another. And almost  all of them had such a relationship. This engendered numerous  rumors, including some about the dolphins' supernatural  abilities. People use to say seriously that they were being used  as live mines.    ``Even today, you will not be met at the installation with  outstretched arms,'' according to the scientists. But this can  be explained by the secrecy of the installation itself and not  by the experiments with dolphins.`` Yes, they were used by the  military. But certainly not for aggressive purposes. In essence,  dolphins served as ``border guards''--they guarded a certain  water area. Naturally, they do not have any supernatural  abilities, but their intellect is highly developed. This enabled  them to detect invasion by unwanted visitors. And notify us  about it.''    I continued to press: ``I also heard that dolphins were  stuffed with chemical preparations, that electrodes were  embedded into their brain, that dolphins were turned into  obedient robots.''    ``Of course not,'' the scientists respond with a smile. ``In  principle, it is possible to affect the behavior of higher  animals. Yet we were not interested in it. We and the dolphins  are friends. And they are clever and understand everything...''    ``Only that they cannot talk.''    ``Yes, they can, in their own way.''    For many people, all dolphins ``look the same,'' just like  the Chinese look to the Europeans. Yet the experts never mistake  any of their pupils for others. They also state that they are  just as different as you and I. They even have their own  character. Some of them are stubborn, some witty, some gay, some  pensive. Sometimes they want to joke. Take, for example,  beautiful Buran (see figure [not reproduced]); he likes to hide  in a secluded place, and when he sees a human nearby, he will  throw a jellyfish at him. And in so doing, the misbehaving  dolphin tries to hit you straight in the face. His friend Ritm  would sometimes play dead--lie on the swimming pool bottom and  wait until the worried staff dive and look for him, then he  would suddenly ``come back to life'' to everybody's joy.    Yet jokes do not get in the way of business. When the time  comes to get to serious work, dolphins display enviable  diligence. When asked the question ``Where is the 10x12  wrench?'' they will not start arguing like in a well-known joke,  but will quickly bring the tool. And this is how dolphins can be  tremendously useful to humans. To tell the truth, this has not  been fully comprehended by people.    In essence, scientists from the Moscow State University  taught dolphins to find and help to lift any sunken equipment  from the bottom. And people sink a lot of things: when laying  pipelines and during underwater petroleum exploration, and  during various types of repairs. Unfortunately, they are sinking  the most valuable items and, as a rule, ``without any trace.''  They do not even send divers: it is exceedingly difficult to  find the lost items. At times, the diving station is not  working, sometimes it is too deep, the water is turbid, or there  is not enough time. Yet this does not pose difficulty for  dolphins. This has been proven by many years of experiments in  the Black Sea.    ``How do you explain to the dolphins what it is exactly you  are trying to find?'' I asked. With dogs, e.g., you let them  sniff something before sending them to search. And then you say  ``Search!''    ``The details of our relations' with dolphins are our  know-how. But take my word for it: dolphins can generalize what  they can see. They primarily respond to the items which are  distinguished from the natural background. Then they accomplish  more specific tasks.''    ``And can they find lost treasures?''    ``During the time of research using dolphins, we found and  lifted from the bottom more than a ton of silver, amorphous, and  other archeological wonders. You should agree that in addition  to the scientific aspect, it is also very interesting from the  economic viewpoint.    I suddenly got an idea: ``And why haven't we used dolphins  to  look for the Loch Ness monster?'' ''    ``No problem,'' the scientists respond. ``As long as the  monster is there. Dolphins are capable of staying in fresh water  for a certain time without any harm to their health. Let them  search. For certainty, we can also attach television cameras to  them--we have also tried that too.''    ``Of course, these are exotic things. But if you are  serious,  there would be a lot of work for dolphins at oil and gas fields.  And today, there are more and more of them further up North...''    ``I understand. Would the dolphins freeze? No. They can dive  very deep and they are well protected from hypothermia by a fat  layer under their skin. Moreover, it is easy to train northern  dolphins--the belugas.''    Thus, Russian scientists have developed a unique training  program--this is how we can tentatively refer to this process  whereby any wild dolphin is turned in a nine-month period into  an animal devoted to humans and capable of executing the most  complicated tasks to find anything, even drowned persons. Their  loyalty is so strong that when working in the open sea, the  dolphins always return. No matter how they are being lured by  their idol kin. This is a serious accomplishment on a world  level. American forecasters thought that such problems could not  be solved before 2020. There are other plans at the Moscow State  University. They think there, in the form of a hypothesis at  present, that it will be possible to work equally as  successfully with other less ``intelligent'' animals. For  example, with bats. We could certainly use their mastery of  ultrasound. But...    The readers are probably already getting an idea that I will  have to finish this report in a rather uneventful fashion.  Research by the Moscow State University biologists is no longer  being financed--the money has long run out. Both for salaries  and for experiments. And the enthusiasm is running out too. It  seems that no one cares about our lead. And about the fact that  we proposed a method of underwater search which requires almost  no physical expenditures and is environmentally clean and safe.    Dear businessman, you should really help the scientists. And  you, oil and gas field workers, should pay careful attention.  And give more help. And maybe, the government will also take an  interest? It is worth it.    The scientists sigh ``the problem, alas, is not simply in  our  salary or lost profit; we are embarrassed in front of our  dolphin friends. We have no food to give to them...''    In the figure [not reproduced]: Buran is smiling and asking  for food.</p>

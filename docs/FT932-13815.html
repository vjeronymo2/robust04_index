			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Polish industrial output up POLAND'S industrial output is continuing to grow, with first quarter sales up 5.4 per cent on last year, according to the Central Statistical Office. At the same time export earnings are falling, and low rates of return in farming threaten a decline in food output for a second year running. The rise in production was mainly due to increased output in the shipping and motor industries as well as the chemical and textile sectors. Retail prices in the quarter were 39 per cent higher than last year, matching last year's inflation rate. Trade payment figures for the first two months of the year show exports at Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.19bn), down by 17 per cent and imports at Dollars 2.1bn, up by 8 per cent on last year. Net domestic assets have grown by 11 per cent from the beginning of the year to 312,985bn zlotys at the end of March - about the rate prescribed by Poland's agreement with the IMF. The budget deficit after three months stood at 24,000bn zlotys or almost a third of the way to the 82,500bn zloty ceiling imposed by the IMF. The end of March also saw 2.6m people registered as unemployed.</p>

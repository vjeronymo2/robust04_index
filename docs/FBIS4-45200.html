			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina Cruz] </F>   [Text] Upon arresting six presumed drug traffickers at the  international airport in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and at the Oaxaca  State capital airport, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents  confiscated over 5 million pesos' worth of ephedrine,  psychotropic pills, and white heroin. The latter was nearly 100  percent pure, and sufficient to prepare 18,000 doses.    The representative of the Attorney General's Office [PGR] in  Oaxaca, Manuel Figueroa Lange, announced that PJF personnel  under orders from the deputy commissioner, Juan Jose Tafoya  Gonzalez, arrested Erasmo Jesus Cruz Esperon, Jorge Efrain  Garcia Cardoso, and Jose Antonio Varela Fuentes in the residence  at Independencia and Garcia Vigil Streets, in the city of  Oaxaca's first block. They had in their possession 260 grams of  white or Thai heroin, considered by experts as one of the most  toxic drugs on the narcotics market.    According to the report submitted to the PJF's general  director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the accused were closing a  deal for the purchase and sale of the drug, which, based on  laboratory tests, was estimated as sufficient for processing  18,000 doses. The authorities noted that the drug, of unknown  origin, causes immediate addiction among those consuming it:  hence the significance of the confiscation.    It was specified that the heroin was distributed in five  packets, to be sold both in our country and the United States.  The investigations to determine the origin of the narcotic are  being continued.    For its part, the PGR branch office in Jalisco, headed by  Raul Garza Serna, reported that Gabriel Rodriguez Cervantes and  Jesus Herrera Lopez were captured at the Guadalajara  international airport. They were carrying, in four suitcases,  over 50.5 kg of ephedrine and several dozen psychotropic pills.  The drugs were bound for Tijuana, Baja California.    It was added that the aforementioned persons were captured  after the investigative agents had discovered on the inspection  conveyor belts that the four bags contained a white, crystalline  powder resembling cocaine. It proved to be ephedrine, a chemical  precursor used for processing amphetamines and cocaine base.    At the same airport, during another search, Alejandro Ortiz  Torres was arrested. He was carrying over 17 kg of compressed  cocaine in a traveling bag, and was also bound for Tijuana.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Clinton tax plan targets high executive pay President Bill Clinton told business leaders at the White House yesterday that he intends to propose not only increasing taxes on US corporations but also penalising more extravagant executive salaries. It was time, he declared, for 'you to do your part'. The night before Mr Clinton had flown to Detroit on Air Force One (picture above) for his first televised presidential 'town meeting', where he argued that sacrifice had to be shared fairly. The president has often spoken of the need for shared sacrifice to cut the federal budget deficit. He pointed yesterday to 'the enormously increased rate of executive compensation'.

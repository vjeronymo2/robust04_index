			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTIFADA AFTER 3 YEARS: PALESTINIAN UPRISING SHOWS VIOLENT NEW FACE;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE RECENT SHOOTINGS ARE DIRECTED OR  SPONTANEOUS.  </P> <P> Shots in the dark sounded in this middle-class university town last week and  Palestinian observers began suggesting that the wave of Arab violence directed  at Israelis was not a passing fever but a trend.  </P> <P> Analysts disagree on whether the armed violence is directed or spontaneous. But  they concur that the incidents of shooting and knifing are changing the face of  the intifada, or Arab uprising. They fear that the outbreak signals the end of  the "white" intifada, as the uprising is known, the one marked by the limited  violence of hurled stones and efforts at civil disobedience.  </P> <P> What will follow is still at issue, but it is clear that moderate voices of the  uprising have been sidelined in the conflict, which marks its third anniversary  Sunday.  </P> <P> Last week, in a plea for concrete political steps to reduce Israeli-Palestinian  tension, Palestinian political leader Faisal Husseini told an Israeli audience:  "We are living in the jungle. In a year or two, perhaps you will not have me to  talk to but someone else, someone versed in the ways of the jungle."  </P> <P> Husseini, who is considered the voice of the moderates, insisted that armed  violence is still the work of out-of-control individuals. But he warned: "Each  day, the question stands whether this is the way to go."  </P> <P> The Palestine Liberation Organization is leaning toward armed violence, some  observers contend. Daoud Kutab, a nationalist journalist, commented: "There is  pressure within the PLO for the use of arms. Moderates face the problem of  condemning the violence and losing support in the street or going along with it  and losing Israeli and international sympathy."  </P> <P> A leaflet from the pro-PLO underground leaders of the uprising urged  Palestinians this week to use "all means" in battling the Israelis. It was  widely interpreted as a call for the use of guns.  </P> <P> Three nighttime shootings in 24 hours jarred moderate Palestinian activists. In  one, gunmen sprayed an Israeli bus carrying settlers north of Ramallah,  wounding three passengers. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a  Marxist PLO faction, claimed responsibility for the attack.  </P> <P> "It is important to revise Palestinian policies, tactics and practices and to  step up the intifada on the economic and military level and to support it with  fire," a communique from the organization said.  </P> <P> In a second incident, someone fired on an army jeep from the direction of a  mosque in Ramallah. And in the third, a Ramallah pharmacist, Hussein Saed, was  found shot to death in his store.  </P> <P> Saed was not involved in politics and no motive for his killing was evident.  But Palestinian observers took his death to mean that Palestinian frustrations  could soon turn into a form of class warfare as economic hardships worsen.  </P> <P> In any event, at least some Palestinian analysts believe that the PLO is urging  an escalation of violence to ensure that the uprising remains a focus of  attention and is not swallowed up by the global focus on the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "If the intifada cools, it is no good," said a well-informed political analyst  here, who asked that his name not be published.  </P> <P> Until now, almost all Palestinians attributed armed violence to passions  unleashed by the October killings of 20 Palestinians by police at Jerusalem's  Al Aqsa mosque. The bloodshed set off a wave of intercommunal violence between  Jews and Arabs, and the fever has lasted longer than expected.  </P> <P> For most of the past year, the intifada has been on a helter-skelter search for  a new direction without much success. "The mood is grim," said Bernard Sabella,  a Bethlehem University professor.  </P> <P> Early in the year, it appeared that peace talks might get under way through an  American-devised plan and the intifada would have achieved a major goal. That  possibility fell apart when Israel's Labor Party, led by doves, failed to seize  power from the rightist Likud, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who  rejected talks.  </P> <P> Palestinians began to sense that the intifada had reached the limit of its  power to move events and some activists began to look outside for inspiration.  It came in the person of Iraq's Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> In April, Hussein pledged to burn half of Israel with chemical weapons if  attacked and became an instant hero among frustrated Palestinians. With his  invasion of Kuwait, Hussein rose higher in esteem, although certain harsh  realities began to set in. Economically, the Palestinians suffered from  cutbacks in money sent from relatives who work in Kuwait and from a reduction  in financial support from Arab countries opposed to Hussein.  </P> <P> Fatigue has led to fewer mass rallies and mass activities in the uprising.  Small groups carry on the bulk of visible resistance, including the throwing of  stones at Israeli traffic.  </P> <P> Commercial strikes are still called and superficially adhered to but, more and  more, stores stay open through the back door and workers labor in secret. The  notion of civil disobedience -- setting up alternative institutions to Israeli  rule, resistance to Israeli bureaucracy and taxes -- became a dead letter.  Danny Rubenstein, an Israeli reporter who has followed the intifada, wrote:  "This isn't the intifada we knew. Palestinian organizations have gone back to  setting bombs and carrying out armed attacks; civil disobedience has died out."  </P> <P> But if not violence, what will be the next phase of the intifada? Palestinians  say everything is on hold until the gulf crisis ends. "All eyes are on Saddam  Hussein," said political scientist Mahdi Abdul Hadi.  </P> <P> Israel is debating whether the spate of shootings reflects impulse or plan.  Defense Minister Moshe Arens has attributed the spasm to growing Islamic  fundamentalism and enthusiasm aroused by Saddam Hussein. Whatever the cause, he  issued a blunt warning this week: "Israel will shoot back."  </P></p>

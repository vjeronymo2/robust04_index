In his replies to these questions, the interior  minister talked about the phenomenon of violence and sabotage  and said that 90 percent of these acts have now become criminal  acts, and that those behind them want things to stay as they  were. He mentioned in this respect the threats sent to the  inland revenue authorities.    Regarding the number of individuals in the armed groups,  Selim Saadi said that the hardcore of these groups consists of a  few hundred people and that 95 percent of their members are  known to the security services. He added that the others are  carrying out operations under threats -- as was established by  the investigation into the arson attack against the Electronic  Industries complex in Telagh. This investigation led in fact to  the arrest of about 60 people, including a number of workers  from the plant.    In reply to a question on the release of some detainees from  security centers in the south, the interior minister said that  those people were not implicated in serious security cases. He  added that Abdelkader Boukhamkham and Ali Djeddi [members of the  Islamic Salvation Front] were only released after they had  served most of their jail sentences.    Concerning the political aspect of the crisis, Selim Saadi  said that President Liamine Zeroual has defined on several  occasions the framework in which the dialogue must be held, with  the political and social partners who respect the national  values and the constitutional system.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ASCENT THE INVENTION OF MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AND ITS PRACTICE  BY JEREMY BERNSTEIN (TOUCHSTONE: $9.95, ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> The great outdoors has become so commercialized in recent years that it's  difficult to believe that for most of human history, mountains were regarded as  obstacles to travelers that no sane person would climb unless compelled. Jeremy  Bernstein traces the history of the sport of mountaineering from its origins in  the Chamonix region of France in the late 18th Century through the present day.  An enthusiastic climber, Bernstein blends first-person adventures with  historical research and reflection in chapter-length essays that began as  articles for The New Yorker. Entertaining reading for the real or armchair  outdoorsman.  </P></p>

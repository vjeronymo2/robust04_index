			<p>BFN     [Text] Wearied by mounting anti-nuclear sentiment, the lack  of a clear government policy and prohibitive investment costs,  state energy planners are dropping their controversial plan to  build Thailand's first nuclear power plant.    The move is apparent in the new power plant development  project master plan being revised by the Electricity Generating  Authority of Thailand (EGAT), from which the nuclear option has  been deleted along with other problematic schemes.    According to Nopphadon Salitdisuk assistant chief of EGAT's  generation system development planning division, the authority  does not wish to proceed with the plan, which saw the first two  of six 1,000-megawatt nuclear power units being commissioned in  2006.    Mr Nopphadon said yesterday that EGAT will not seek to  undertake the nuclear project at least in the period 1994-2011,  making the possibility of such a project being implemented look  remote.    Other "less socially sensitive" and conventional thermal  power houses, using for instance imported natural gas and coal,  will substitute for the suspended nuclear plant scheme, he said.    He cited the lack of public acceptance of nuclear power  plants as the prime factor behind EGAT's decision to withdraw  the plan.    But he said that the project may not be abandoned entirely,  and EGAT will continue to study various aspects so that "when  the time of public acceptance comes" the project can be  relaunched.    Prathin Phatthanaphon, deputy governor of the Petroleum  Authority of Thailand (PTT), yesterday confirmed EGAT's move.    He said that among other things, the question of safety is  uppermost in the minds of the public, and the extremely high  investment cost of the nuclear facilities make the project  itself financially unviable.    The cost of building a nuclear power plant is some  U.S.$2,000  per kilowatt compared to $1,200 for one using imported coal and  $650 for a combined cycle plant fuelled by natural gas.    Dr Phiyasawat Amranan, deputy secretary general of the  National Energy Policy Office, said the Government does not need  to come to a decision today on whether to proceed with the  nuclear project because there is still insufficient information  with which to make a decision.    "We have 12 years before the planned nuclear power plant is  envisaged. We still have a few more years (to decide)," he said.    But Dr Phiyasawat, a key state energy planner, suggested to  Business Post that nuclear energy is destined to have a lower  priority in the overal] near-term energy plan.    There are energy alternatives which can be made available to  meet the country's fast-growing electricity demand more easily  than nuclear, he said.    "Why don't we first look into imported coal and LNG  (liquefied natural gas)? More natural gas from the Gulf of  Thailand will become available for power plant fuels," he said.  "Furthermore, there is the potential for increasing power supply  to Thailand from hydro- electric projects in Laos, and there is  potential for tapping huge hydro-electric resources in Burma,"  he added.    State energy planners' latest stance on nuclear energy comes  less than three months after Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said  Thailand may have to take the nuclear option in order to arrest  the country's fastgrowing electricity demand.    In his first public remarks on whether Thailand should build  nuclear power plants, the Premier said the Government can  neither overlook nor reject nuclear as a possible source of  power generation.    Alternative energy sources for Thailand have their  limitations, Mr Chuan said, while acknowledging public concern  about the safety risks and the high cost of nuclear power.    Mr Chuan said public sentiment on the issue will be the most  important factor deciding whether nuclear plants should be built  here.    The World Bank has suggested that Thailand drop its nuclear  power plant project, which it sees as more expensive than other  options.    It advises Thailand to turn to natural gas, particularly  imported LNG, and insists that nuclear power be considered only  as a last option.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Meeting of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Political Debating Club; date </F> not given: "Possibility of Accord"]    [Text] The latest meeting of the political debating  club has been held at ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Topical problems of  social development in Russia following the formation of a new  government and the start of work of the Federal Assembly were  examined.    Yuriy Georgiyevich Aleksandrov, doctor of economic  sciences, Academician Aleksey Mikhaylovich Yemelyanov, member of  the State Duma, Aleksey Vasilyevich Kiva, doctor of historical  sciences and political scientist and current affairs writer, and  Viktor Leonidovich Sheynis, doctor of economic sciences and  member of the State Duma, took part in the debate.    The meeting of the club was anchored by Leonid  Petrovich Kravchenko, first deputy chief editor of ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI.  <H5>  Let Us Clarify the Situation </H5>   L. KRAVCHENKO. Esteemed colleagues! We are today  holding the latest meeting of our political debating club. On  the last occasion, as you will recall, we examined the situation  that had taken shape in Russia following the tragic October  events, the Federal Assembly elections, and the adoption at the  referendum of the new Constitution of the Russian Federation. We  concluded at that time that the polarization of political forces  in society had intensified. Against the background of the  intensifying socioeconomic crisis in the country there has been  a loss of confidence among various strata of society in the  policy of economic reforms that has been pursued. This was  reflected also in the election results, when many seats were  unexpectedly won by representatives of the opposition forces.    Unfortunately, the decline in production continues. The rate  of inflation and the price rises remain high. Threats of mass  strikes have arisen once more. Certain forces interested in a  destabilization of the situation are spreading rumors concerning  a possible coup d'etat and the removal of the president from  office. What opportunities do there continue to be under these  conditions for accord and civil peace, for which, incidentally,  both the president and the State Duma are calling? It is this  question that I would like to present for discussion.    A. KIVA. I will express certain general points,  which, it seems to me, elucidate more broadly the situation in  which we find ourselves.    First. I believe that the postcommunist  development of our society is, generally, proceeding in normal  fashion. The failure of the democrats at the elections was  entirely logical following two years of difficult reforms. Nor  does the figure of Zhirinovskiy represent anything out of the  ordinary, although for Russia extreme nationalism or neofascism  are unusual, of course. The president has changed in some  respects. The events of recent months, the October events  particularly, have made their mark and have turned him in the  direction of greater consideration and an inclination toward  compromise and agreements.    I would say that the government is different also. It is  more  independent, more sure of itself than before. In other words, an  evolution, an on-going movement, is under way.    Second. It seems to me that the democrats already  have something to lose. For this reason they should be not only  members of the avant-garde, not only revolutionaries, but also  custodians. There is a constitution, a democratic constitution.  A line has been drawn beneath our Soviet past. Forever, I  believe. And when we hear some facile opinions to the effect  that we have only chaos, only failures, this is to me simply  incomprehensible, therefore.    Third. I am convinced that the economic reforms  still require appreciable correction. And if some people have  yet to recognize that the former system of our financial  stabilization is not working and that there is a very great  danger of economic collapse and the disintegration of the social  sphere, a danger of social explosion, this is distressing.    Fourth. I do not doubt that the democrats also are  at an impasse. Primarily Russia's Choice and its leaders. They  simply cannot, in my view, recover, simply cannot get their  bearings in the new situation, cannot understand realities as  they are. Nor can they accept, in the full meaning of the word,  the rules of the political game according to the laws of  democracy.    Fifth and finally. An active regrouping of  political forces is under way in the Duma, in my view. It is  complete [as published], I believe, but a very strong tilt  toward the center may be observed.    A regrouping of political forces outside of the Duma is  taking place also, evidently. And the strategic question is  this: What alternative awaits us in the immediate future--left  or right?    It seems to me that liberalism is departing from the  political front stage. It will very shortly be departing from  the economy also. I foresee opening up historically as a  replacement for liberalism most likely an alternative course to  that which has been realized in Poland or in Lithuania, that is,  social democratic. And the state, which in the past took shape  as a civil society, will be required to endeavor to assume  social patronage. It should be considered, however, that with us  people, particularly of the older generation, will accept a  policy which aims at social protection of the populace. If such  a policy is implemented, the chances of accord in our society  will be enhanced.  <H5>  Between Scylla and Charybdis </H5>   V. SHEYNIS. The main question concerns the vector  of Russia's historical development. There is with us a real  danger of us becoming enmeshed in bloody chaos. I am talking  about a difficult transitional period, which began several years  ago and which will hardly end any time soon. And there is no  more important task currently than averting this bloody chaos,  lawlessness, and disintegration of the state. It is essential  for this, of course, to undertake a whole number of positive  actions.    Aleksey Vasilyevich Kiva said that Russia is completing the  transition to postcommunism. I believe that this is correct, but  I would posit an even broader historical framework. We are  completing the transition from historical underdevelopment,  which is typical decidedly of all countries, other than the  pioneers--the West European countries--to a developed modern  society. For some time now I have, what is more, been  deliberately avoiding such concepts as socialism and capitalism,  which, in my opinion, are capable more of blurring the heart of  the matter than elucidating it. And so in attempting to reveal  the distinctive aspects of Russia's transition I would highlight  four essential points.    First, as distinct from China and as distinct from  the countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia, we are  switching not from an undeveloped market to a market economy but  from an entirely antimarket system, a virtually ideal model of  the distributive-state economy.    Second, as distinct from, say, the East European  countries, we are having to create from scratch institutions of  the civil society. It was sufficient to pull down the Berlin  Wall, it was sufficient to remove the threat of Soviet troops'  invasion of the East European countries, for all the  institutions of the civil society, which they had had formerly,  to grow there instantly.    Third, the superpower complex. This is a  distinction from many other countries. And this complex had  entirely material outlines also, what is more, namely: a warped  economy, an economy with a tremendous preponderance of military  production, an economy with plant-cities, which it is very  difficult to escape and which we cannot simply up and reform in  a comparatively short space of time.    Fourth. Transition requires political stability.  This we do not have, unfortunately. There are, generally  speaking, two basic ways to achieve stability: either the  decisive victory of one side or the achievement of accord among  the main antagonistic forces. That is, a social compact--formal  or informal--but observed by the opposite sides.    In the last parliament I took part in the formation of a  faction which called itself Accord for Progress. And although we  cannot boast of any appreciable political achievements, I  believe that the faction and its program, expressed in its name,  had nothing to be ashamed of. It pursued a policy which,  perhaps, could not have been realized in that specific situation  but which sowed good seeds.    A particular feature of the situation today is that both  sides into which society is divided are oriented toward victory.  But this orientation is increasingly assuming the cover of  accord. That is, the idea of compromise, the idea of the  achievement of some degree of accord, is present and is being  proclaimed. The only trouble is that we write one thing and hold  on in our minds to something else. Everyone is preparing for the  main political event in Russia of the latter half of the 1990's,  namely, the presidential elections.    In this connection, one further essential point. In the new  constitution the role of parliament has, unfortunately, been  reduced. Structures of the executive headed by the president are  coming to the fore. What kind of Russia will enter the 21st  century and whether it can successfully overcome all the dangers  of the transitional period will depend, therefore, on who is  elected president at the next elections.    Passing between Scylla and Charybdis is a well-known popular  expression. But the vast majority of those who employ this image  misinterpret it. They proceed from the fact that the hero of the  ancient Greek epic poem had an opportunity to somehow slip  through, avoiding both Scylla and Charybdis. But Odysseus did  not have this opportunity, and he had to choose the less  fearsome of the two monsters. And this, truly, is our situation  today. We are choosing not between good and bad but between bad  and very bad.    YU. ALEKSANDROV. Viktor Leonidovich, I have the  impression that the preparation of different political forces  for the struggle for the presidency is under way, as it were, in  the Duma and that the powerful bloc-forming of the opposition  forces in order to begin the antipresidential campaign even now  is taking place simultaneously. Isakov, in particular, has  declared that the president is the main destabilizing factor at  the present time. What do you think?    V. SHEYNIS. Isakov's speech attracted attention,  of course. As distinct from many other representatives of the  implacable opposition, Isakov, who possesses many of the  "virtues" of this political current, is an educated individual.  He is not Anpilov. He is a professional. And when he said that  the constitution affords an opportunity for presidential  elections via parliament, he understood full well that he was  telling an untruth. And do you know why? This was simply a trial  balloon. For the opposition in parliament does not have the  requisite majority even for raising this matter. The approximate  correlation of votes is at the most 200 on one side and around  170 on the other.    A. YEMELYANOV. A few words to add to what Viktor  Leonidovich said. Remember how the speaker of the house was  elected in the State Duma. The opposition rejoiced when Ivan  Petrovich Rybkin's candidacy was successful. Now, it seemed,  they could bar admission to power of anyone from blocs of a  democratic persuasion: both committee chairmen and their  deputies. But look what has happened. The leaders of the blocs  have agreed not to "devour" one another but to share these  committee chairman and deputy positions proportionally. They  proposed Mikhail Mityukov as first deputy speaker, yet they  could have barred him altogether. And, what is most important,  they agreed to a block vote. This means that they proceeded from  common sense, from an understanding that a new alignment of  forces has emerged in parliament.  <H5>  The Barometer Is Common Sense </H5>   A. YEMELYANOV. I would like to distinguish several  aspects of the following nature. See how the recent turnabouts  in economic policy and the personnel shuffles in the government  were interpreted, particularly in the news media. They made a  fuss about the fact that this was essentially a recoil, a return  to the old ways. It is our former delusions that were, I  believe, the basis of such opinions. In this case, monopolism of  the truth.    And although we are fighting this and have condemned it in  theory, it is this that we are encountering even now in the  interpretation of the reforms. We want in practice to reduce an  understanding of the essence of the reforms to the way in which  they were presented and implemented since the start of 1992 by  Yegor Timurovich Gaydar and his team. But you cannot make  provision for everything with such profound reformations.  Mistakes are inevitable, corrections are inevitable, and there  is nothing to be ashamed of if the reformer himself sees this  and changes and improves and does not present matters as a  renunciation of the reforms.    And, then, what have we to be ashamed of? We have, after  all,  achieved a great deal. Let us recall. Two and a half years ago  the very words "enterprise" and "private property" were rejected  in what was then the Union Supreme Soviet by the majority,  Gorbachev included. And even Sobchak, this is a historical  paradox, was the first to protest and "ax" the concept of  ownership of the land. When we deputies proposed this, he said  that both the Black Sea coast and everything else would then be  bought up. This is how ideology prevailed over common sense.  These were the nineties. But now no one any longer disputes, not  even the most conservative figures protest, private ownership or  enterprise. This is a breakthrough in ideology, a breakthrough  in management philosophy.    But the problem lies elsewhere. The reforms should not have  been "spurred." The transition from one society to another, from  one economic and social system to another, is a process of  decades. And what did we do? I will give you just one  characteristic with reference to agriculture. Remember how the  task that was set was reorganization and the liquidation of all  unprofitable kolkhozes and sovkhozes by 1 April 1992. In just  three months. Stalin carried out collectivization this way, but  the timeframe was somewhat longer even then.    It is also bad that the reforms have been implemented  exclusively in accordance with the from-the-top-down principle.  Although it is now generally recognized that the interests of  the individual cannot be disregarded.    YU. ALEKSANDROV. Just one comment concerning  economic policy. There are two extremes here. It seems to me  that if Gaydar's policy is evaluated in the context of the  political conditions of that time, these unpopular measures that  were pursued by Gaydar's team are explained to a large extent  not so much by theoretical views as by the need to give a boost  to the reforms, overcoming the very strong political resistance.  Although, I agree, there were, of course, extremes. But we  should beware that in the process of present-day corrections we  not cross over into another system. We know that it is possible  to build a market economy which proves to be confined, as it  were, to the sector of inefficient works. How, after all, are  they supported currently? Only by the redistribution of some  limited economic resources of society. And we can build an  economic system that has a sector of inefficient works protected  against outside competition that supports the sufficiently high  living standard of those who are associated with it. But we  would be leaving the bulk of society overboard in these sumps of  unproductive occupations.    A. YEMELYANOV. I know all the reformers, they are  almost all graduates of our Moscow State University Economics  Faculty. I admire the talent of Yegor Timurovich and his  colleagues. But on the practical level they did some foolish  things. The general scourge of our economy, for example--the  nonpayments. Tens, hundreds of enterprises are coming to a halt.  This is a multi-aspectual issue. But I believe that the main  obstructions concerning these payments are being created at the  top. The nonpayments are like a clot in a blood vessel. They  have arisen in one or two places, and the entire organism will  be paralyzed.    I shall explain this by the example of the peasants. They  collected the grain, gathered in the harvest, but money has not  been paid the peasants. And this has gone on down the line.  There is no money, they can no longer purchase trucks and  combines. The machinery for the manufacture of trucks and  combines has been halted. All of agricultural machine building  has been paralyzed. Not to mention fertilizer, we are working  the land to exhaustion. And Minister Fedorov was adamant: No, we  will not provide any money. This is a simply a violation of the  elementary requirements of common sense.    YU. ALEKSANDROV. I would like in literally two  words to dwell on the nonpayments problem. This is an  extraordinarily complex problem, all the same. Chernomyrdin is  still holding back money even now. Because there is none. After  all, the nonpayments problem was born in various ways. Take  agriculture, say. Yes, of course the harvest needs to be paid  for. But, Aleksey Mikhaylovich, you will surely recall how the  idea of the government contract arose, when essentially very  high prices for grain were promised. I do not know how this  decision was born politically. But there are, in any case, two  points here. The first is that the state tied itself by its  undertaking to pay unduly high prices. And that the agrarians,  for their part, failed to offer a clear program of the  reorganization of inefficient farms.    A. YEMELYANOV. You are wrong as regards the very  high prices. They are still artificially low even now. But even  this is not the point. It is something else that is of  fundamental importance: If you purchase grain, please be so kind  as to pay, not drag out the payment for many months, when the  money "dries up" before one's eyes. And, in addition, the  present leadership has as a result found itself in a very  difficult situation. After all, it has to pay off the debt to  the peasants and, in addition, allocate credit for the spring  sowing, for the new harvest, which, incidentally, is being done.  And here we have a surge of inflation. Sins that go back to last  year are having to be paid for. This is why the need for  personnel shuffles arose. This is the correct position of both  the prime minister and the president.  <H5>  Struggle for Power as an End in Itself </H5>   L. KRAVCHENKO. Aleksey Mikhaylovich, listening to  you, I came to think that there was something symbolic in these  personnel shuffles. Perhaps we are finally coming to the  conclusion that we can no longer put fate to the test, allowing  politics undivided sway, allowing politics to rape, if you will  excuse the expression, economics. It has long been clear that  priority should be given economics, where everything is dictated  by common sense and precise business calculation--economics free  of political predilections. The more the politicians understand  this truth, there more chances there are that economics will be  given priority, not the struggle for power.    For the sake of salvation of the economy, salvation of the  country, it is, perhaps, time for all political forces to seek  accord and to unite their efforts.    A. YEMELYANOV. I agree. Continuation of the  struggle will bring about self-destruction. I would draw,  conditionally, an analogy with the former Union republics. After  the 1991 putsch they all wanted full sovereignty. But time has  elapsed, and many of them have recognized that you cannot  survive alone. I am afraid to oversimplify this question, but  there are things in common. There is not one political force  that is currently capable of getting the better of the others  independently. A trend toward a certain convergence is probably  inevitable, therefore. These processes, despite all the  difficulties, are occurring here in the Duma also.    V. SHEYNIS. It would be correct to conclude that  the struggle for a new course of the reforms has become  interwoven here with the struggle for power. Struggle for power  as an end in itself. Particular clans, some of which identify  with the democrats, others, with their opponents, have taken  shape, since 1989, at least. And in each case it is not simply  for one clan but for several that power is a value in itself,  and which are struggling to establish their control of power and  property.    YU. ALEKSANDROV. I now have the impression that  the conditions for the achievement of social accord are better.  At the same time, on the other hand, political forces are,  truly, grouping in the struggle for peace, primarily for the  presidency. And quite a wide-ranging bloc of forces opposed to  Russia's Choice in the struggle against the current president  and for early elections is possible here, what is more. This  could inflame the situation.    I see a further danger in the fact that the state is  becoming  bureaucratized very quickly and that its machinery is growing  unchecked. And the state is in this sense once again becoming  divorced from the people and is perched, so to speak, on its own  machinery, on a bureaucratic foundation. This is perceived very  strongly in society and is being reflected onto the democrats,  who are being identified with the state.    The growth of nationalism, which is preventing a  strengthening of accord in society, is very troubling. It is  encouraging, it is true, that there have already been examples  of the successful resolution of most complex contradictions, as  was the case in the elaboration of the treaty with Tatarstan,  and there is now hope of a start on an improvement of relations  with Chechnya.    A. KIVA. I also share the belief that the efforts  to achieve civil peace today are far more auspicious than was  the case earlier. If we recall last year, particularly the  unyielding antagonism that developed into diarchy, the  opposition had at that time a hope of revanche. They only needed  to overthrow President Yeltsin, and they could have expected to  have turned the ship of state in another direction. This is no  longer the case. De jure we are living in accordance with a new  constitution, de facto also, to some extent. The soviets are no  more, and it came as a surprise to us to find that these soviets  were not that deeply rooted. And, besides, a certain balance of  political forces has taken shape. No one has the clear  advantage. There is no temptation to resort to manifestly power  solutions.  <H5>  Evil Disappears With Satiety </H5>   L. KRAVCHENKO. Do you not think that one of the  main prerequisites for the achievement of accord and civil peace  would be the imparting of a socially attractive character to the  economic reforms. It is said that evil disappears with satiety.  I do not wish to oversimplify the problem. No one either in the  present or the past government would have refused to have  channeled more resources into social programs. But there were no  reserves. Nonetheless, monetarist projects are inadequately  oriented toward man and his concerns and needs. After all, the  more poor and destitute people there are, the broader the social  base for the opposition and the greater its chances of election  success. This was clearly understood by the president, I  believe, when, in his report to parliament, he put more emphasis  on social policy and subsequently issued an edict geared to  combating the delays in the payments of wages and pensions.  Instances of enterprises deliberately having kept money in  accounts in order to "rotate" it via the banks have already  become known. The directors are at every step establishing for  themselves wages of several millions, while the workers get  50,000-70,000. This multiple discrepancy in pay is sending  people into a rage.    I would like to emphasize, that is, that despite all the  difficulties there are real opportunities for strengthening the  social content of the economic reforms. Do you agree with this  formulation of the issue?    A. YEMELYANOV. There is no doubt that any reform  should one way or another be passed through the prism of man.  What happened was that we cast aside social regulation, rushed  recklessly into the market, and began to transfer everything  absolutely to a commercial basis. Health care and education and  science and culture.... It is here primarily that an adjustment  is needed lest we conclusively kill off that which is healthy  that has developed and in order that we rectify all this  distortion. Otherwise we democrats will simply lose in the  future: at both the presidential and parliamentary elections.    A. KIVA. I once published an article entitled  "Postcommunist Syndrome." It said, inter alia, that we have a  passion for doing everything other than the way it was done  under the socialist system. Even that which is good that should  have been preserved--the social sphere, medicine, the health and  fitness centers, the recreation centers, children's  establishments--everything has been uprooted. This,  unfortunately, is a trait of our national character, it is  Bolshevism of the first water. We rushed over to one side, and  the pendulum swung to the other.    YU. ALEKSANDROV. There are contentious aspects  here also. What is meant by socially oriented reforms under our  conditions? Production is declining. Everyone is short of money.  There is not one sector that is not in need of credit. If we  halt the landslide in production and if we all start to work  better--everyone without exception--general prosperity will  begin to grow also. Meanwhile, I believe that it may rather be a  question of smoothing over as much as possible the negative  social consequences of all the structural and other  reorganizations.    L. KRAVCHENKO. I would like to touch on one  further topic. Society was recently agitated by the amnesty that  was announced. Many fears have arisen: Khasbulatov, Rutskoy,  Anpilov, Konstantinov, and Makashov have been set free and they  will rush into the fray and will want revanche. All kinds of  inventions have arisen also. The amnesty plays, allegedly, into  the hands of the president, who does not want any investigation  of the tragic White House events. And the amnesty was all but a  result of a compact between the president and the leaders of the  Duma. This, in any event, is what Gavriil Popov has openly  hinted at in his speeches.    A. KIVA. I have not shared the panic fear that has  arisen in the democratic community in connection with the  amnesty. This is an ambiguous event, of course. There are big  minuses here, but there are pluses also. When the smoke had  cleared, for example, it was ascertained via opinion polls that  many of Zhirinovskiy's supporters had gone over to Rutskoy.  Zhirinovskiy had a 6 percent rating, Rutskoy, 5 percent,  apparently. There is much that could still change. This does not  mean that Rutskoy is for the country an acceptable figure as  president, but every cloud has a silver lining, as they say.    And a second point. However paradoxical, this amnesty has,  perhaps, boosted the aspiration to accord and revealed that not  all questions were solved in essence on 3-4 October. We need,  therefore, to be viewing matters in a broader perspective more  than simply thinking about the losses the amnesty caused.    A. YEMELYANOV. If the upsurge of social protest in  society grows, the amnesty could prove to be to the benefit of  the united opposition. The leaders of the radicals were  released, but the question of an assessment of what they did has  remained unexplained. There have on their part been no words of  repentance or, at least, regret. True, the State Duma is as yet  examining certain documents supplementary to the amnesty decree,  intending smoothing over some of its negative consequences.  <H5>  Heed the Advice, Democrats! </H5>   L. KRAVCHENKO. It is evidently time to "round out"  our discussion. I would like in conclusion to ask whether you  have suggestions concerning an increase in the chances for a  strengthening of civil peace and accord. Your personal  suggestions....    V. SHEYNIS. I have specific advice addressed to  the democrats: what they should do first and foremost.    First. Clearly understand the actual  possibilities, content, and limits of so-called accord. Do not  allow yourselves to be carried away by rhetoric. Accord under  the specific conditions means three things, in my view. First,  the renunciation of forcible action and unconstitutional  solutions, whatever the constitution and whatever the attitude  toward it.    Second. Undertake corrections of the economic  course.    Third. Uphold your positions on the criminal and  civil codes, the election system, the Referendum Act, and so  forth.    Fourth. Firmly defend the foundation of the reform  course. Corrections are essential, but let us pay tribute to the  courage of Gaydar and his team, who pushed the ship away from  the shallows. Got it moving and created a new economic  situation. We need to understand here the difference between our  interests, the interests of the people and society, and the  interests of the new nomenklatura, which today calls itself  democratic, but which is deciding its own power and property  interests. It is essential to clearly understand this.    And fifth and finally--patiently build up an  election organization. For parliamentary elections are impending  at the end of 1995 even, then come presidential elections in  1996. It will be necessary to prepare a leader and prepare  organizations. This, in my opinion, is today a most important  task because the two years will fly by extraordinarily quickly.    A. KIVA. I largely agree with Viktor Leonidovich.  The question of the team of reformers and of ways of continuing  the reforms is urgent today. The opposition is demanding the  creation of a coalition government. This is a difficult  question, but we have a coalition government even now. On the  other hand, we cannot oversimplify matters to such an extent as  to conceive of a government with the participation of, say,  Gennadiy Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Gleb Yakunin, and  Yegor Gaydar.    To a considerable extent civil peace and accord are  guaranteed by the president personally. He is required to do so  by the constitution. But I would like to hope that both he and  the government would regularly confer with the people. Seek, if  you wish, their consent to this step or the other that affects  society's living standards. Do not disregard public opinion and  consult with people more often, speaking on television and radio  and in the press. Explain to them your policy, do not conceal  difficulties. Lift this depression and lack of confidence in the  future, when it seems that no light can be seen at the end of  the tunnel. This might then be repaid a hundredfold.</p>

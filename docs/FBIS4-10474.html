			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Torres, Radio Corporacion chief editor, </F> from the CIAV-OAS in Managua -- live or recorded]    [Text] A few minutes ago, Jose Angel Talavera, a.k.a.  Chacal, head of the 380 Northern Front [FN-380], granted an  exclusive interview with Radio Corporacion. He discussed a  report, disseminated by some media, that Honduran troops had  been dispatched to the Nicaraguan border. Chacal denied that  the Honduran troops had been deployed because of the presence of  the FN-380 and explained that the Honduran troops had been  mobilized to check the actions of criminal gangs on Honduran  territory. This movement is unrelated to FN-380 troops.    Talavera also told us that the negotiations initiated this  morning to discuss the problem of land ownership will resume in  a few minutes.    Here are some of Talavera's remarks.    [Begin recording] [Talavera] We have no reports that this  mobilization has anything to do with FN-380. We do know that  troops have been dispatched to the northern border with  Nicaragua to try to counter a crime wave in the area. But this  mobilization has nothing to do with FN-380. The media that  reported on this mobilization have been manipulating the reports.    FN-380 troops are stationed in various places, the location  of which has been negotiated with the government and the Army,  in the area of Quilali and Jicaro. Most of our troops are  gathered on the outskirts of Quilali, Nueva Segovia.    We do not rule out the truth of reports on a crime wave in  Honduras. There are always armed men who infiltrate, but in  this particular instance there are armed bands that do not  belong to FN-380. Consequently, reports in the Nicaraguan media  are not objective and are rather hampering the negotiations, for  which we cannot be held responsible.    Just as there are criminal gangs on the border with  Honduras,  so there are in the center of Nicaragua. They might be either  Nicaraguans or Hondurans. Anyway, these gangs have nothing to  do with our organization. Such activities contravene our  principles. We have always opposed and fought crime. We are  responsible and honest people, intent on helping the Nicaraguan  people and society. Therefore, we reiterate that these actions  have nothing to do with us. [end recording]    Regarding the situation in Jinotega, where the Sandinist  National Liberation Front opposes the Nicaraguan Government's  plan to fill National Police positions with members of the  FN-380, Talavera said the National Assembly's government  commission, headed by Andres Robles, has already solved this  problem and that commisison members will continue to talk during  a meeting set to open in a few minutes.    Talavera also said that the Nicaraguan Government has made  good on its promises on education by appointing a number of  teachers in rural areas of the country's north, where before  there were only few teachers.    In health care, the Nicaraguan Government has also been  complying with the agreements signed by the FN-380 and the  government.    A meeting will open in a few minutes that will end for good  the demobilization of members of the FN-380. Talavera said the  meeting will be attended by CIAV [International Commission for  Support and Verification] Director General Celso Caramagna, as  well as by government, INRA [National Agrarian Reform  Institute], FN-380, Finance Ministry, and National Development  Bank delegates. The latter will be present because the FN-380  seeks financing for the land they are demanding from the  government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Vucinic: "Friends Together Again"] </F>   [Text] The leaders of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS] and  the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] met yesterday in the SRS  headquarters to discuss, as they said, their next move in  resisting the repression by the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS].  Vojislav Seselj and Vuk Draskovic told reporters that a new  meeting was called for Monday [23 May] in the SPO headquarters,  and that it would almost certainly be attended by the leaders of  the Democratic Party [DS] and the Democratic Party of Serbia  [DSS], who had been invited too late for yesterday's meeting.    Vuk Draskovic, who arrived at the SRS headquarters with  Milan  Komnenic, stressed that a purge of the SRS had been under way  for several months, and that the two of them had come to tell  the SRS leaders that they could count on the full support of the  SPO in their defense against the legal and police terror.  Draskovic stressed that it was not only the SRS that was in  danger but parliamentarianism, and that the unified attitude of  the opposition could, as he put it, "discourage the SPS."    Seselj said that he was personally very pleased when he  heard  about the criminal charges as that showed that the regime was  nervous. Commenting on the fact that Seselj would answer to the  same charges he faced last June, Draskovic said that the law put  the police force on a sacrosanct pedestal, and wondered: What  is the police doing in the federal assembly?    Speaking of earlier differences between the two leaders,  Draskovic cited Voltaire, and said that the "SPO will always  defend the right of the SRS to state their opinion," and that  Seselj and he never had any personal differences but only  political ones, with the exaggerations that are so typical of  the Balkan political scene.    The "definite" demands by the parliamentary parties are the  dismissal of Radoman Bozovic and an equal treatment and access  to television. It is not out of the question that even the  extraparliamentary parties could join this, "except those that  have been instrumentalized by the UDBA [State Security  Administration]," Seselj said.    The SRS leader expects that DS leader Zoran Djindjic will  distance himself from Dragoljub Micunovic, who is "the author of  the declaration of the Chamber of Citizens." Milan Komnenic  said that he was sorry that he had voted for the expulsion of  deputy Drasko Markovic from the session, saying that he only did  so out of inertia, because he was misinformed about the nature  of the vote....</p>

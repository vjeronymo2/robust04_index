			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Industrialists back European union THE French industrial establishment yesterday threw its weight behind the European union as the Patronat, which represents France's biggest companies, voiced support for ratifying the Maastricht treaty and warned of the dangers of rejection. Mr Francois Perigot, president of the CNPF, said that European union offered a real opportunity for France, and its fellow member states, to strengthen their political and economic status thereby enabling the European Community to establish itself as a significant presence in the international market place. 'Europe has not yet demonstrated its political power to the rest of the world,' he said. 'It could do so by showing a common political will and by gaining control of a world currency.' Mr Perigot criticised the Maastricht treaty's architects for failing to consult with the business community and for dragging out the path towards monetary union. However, the CNPF warned that a negative result in the September 20 referendum could have dire economic consequences for France, triggering an immediate loss of confidence by inter-national investors, resulting in a lower franc and higher interest rates. French industry is already under pressure because of the comparatively high cost of borrowing Mr Ernst-Antoine Seilliere, economic adviser to the CNPF, said a collapse of international confidence after a 'No' vote would make it even more difficult - and expensive - for French companies to raise capital for investment. In the medium term, he warned that France could become isolated in a Europe in which the monetary system would be dominated by the D-Mark. This isolation, he said, also raised the spectre of international investors diverting funds originally intended for France to other countries, such as Spain or Germany.</p>

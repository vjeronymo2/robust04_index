			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Central Bank of Venezuela will set the official  dollar price according to supply and demand to eliminate the  current auction mechanism. This will also allow the bank to  eliminate distortions in the price of U.S. currency.    A mechanism for foreign currency exchange based on the real  needs of the market will be implemented to replace the auction.  The Central Bank of Venezuela will return to the single and  floating exchange rate system, eliminating the 0.20-bolivar  differential between the purchase and sale price. This new  system is intended to eliminate the parallel market. Here is an  excerpt of statements by Jose Bouza Izquierdo, National Banking  Council president:    [Begin Bouza recording, in progress]...in other words, it  will not be a mechanism like those that have existed so far. It  will be based on real market prices. The dollar will cost what  it must cost to guarantee that those who need dollars to  continue operating can obtain them. The difference is that this  will not be an auction based on average prices; the banks will  make offers based on prices.    Later we will provide official information about the  operational details of this mechanism, which will be worked out  today. [end recording]    Juan Tomas Santana, president of the Banking Association of  Venezuela, insisted that the authorities are trying to perfect  the system of [words indistinct] dollars for the commercial  banks.    [Begin Santana recording] [Words indistinct] that is why  this  is not being implemented. We don't know....[pauses] We want to  implement this as soon as possible, but we cannot set an exact  date. It must be done as soon as possible, because we want to  clear up the market and allay the fears of the production  sector, the general public, and the media about the auction  mechanism. We want to eliminate those doubts, and it must be  done as soon as possible.    If this mechanism proves ineffective, it will be corrected  along the way. There is nothing perfect on this earth. [end  recording]    This new mechanism of granting [word indistinct] to banks is  also aimed at meeting the demand of the country's production  sector, which, according to reports, has been seriously  affected. More details will be given in the next few hours on  this new scheme of foreign currency exchange.</p>

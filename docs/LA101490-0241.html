			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Campaign funds -- A headline in Thursday's San Gabriel Valley section indicated  that Diamond Bar City Councilman Paul Horcher, the Republican nominee in the  52nd Assembly District, had raised substantially more campaign funds than his  Democratic opponent because of loans he had made to himself. Actually, Horcher  raised $104,998 without the loans, and his Democratic opponent, Gary Neely,  raised $22,586.  </P> <P> Also, the article should have stated that Horcher is paying consultant Harvey  Englander $15,000 for his work since the June 5 primary.  </P></p>

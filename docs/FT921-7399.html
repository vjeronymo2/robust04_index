			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exercising a warrant SOME warrants which I hold will shortly reach the date when I shall have the right to subscribe for shares in the company which issues them. The subscription price of the shares is presently considerably below the market price of the shares and I am concerned about the capital gains aspect. Am I right in believing that a capital gain will arise, and that this gain will be the difference between the value of the shares for which I will subscribe at the date of subscription, and the cost of the warrants. No, the exercise of warrants-to-subscribe is not a disposal for CGT purposes. The cost of the warrants should be indexed from the month in which they were purchased up to the month in which they are exercised. That indexed figure is then added to the subscription price to form the base cost of the shares; and that combined base cost then ranks for indexation from the subscription month. If the warrants were purchased before April 6 1982, then indexation starts from March 1982, and their quarter-up value at March 31 1982 will be relevant - it is a pity that you did not say when you acquired them. The rules are to be found in paragraph 15 of schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1985. Although that paragraph does not in fact cover options-to-subscribe (it only covers options-to-purchase, in contrast to the Corresponding rule in paragraph 7 of schedule 13 to the Finance Act 1982), there is an unpublished extrastatutory concession on the point. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital Gains Tax: an introduction). You may also wish to write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Office, Somerset House, Strand, London, asking for formal confirmation of the continued operation of the unpublished concession extending the scope of paragraph 15 of schedule 19 to the 1985 Act to options-to-subscribe. At the same time, you could ask them why they have steadfastly declined to publish this 6 1/2 -year-old concession in the official booklet of Revenue concessions, IRI (with supplements). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Swissair looks at Sabena stake Swissair is discussing a strategic alliance with Sabena which could see it acquire a large minority stake in the Belgian carrier. The Swiss airline yesterday confirmed it was holding talks with Sabena and other European airlines, but declined to comment on a report that it was considering buying a 49.5 per cent stake in the Belgian carrier. A report published today in the Zurich financial magazine Cash says Swissair intends to acquire a 49.5 per cent stake in Sabena by buying Air France's 37.5 per cent holding and a further 12 per cent held by four financial companies controlled by the Belgian government. Swissair said the article was based on a paper prepared by McKinsey, the consultants. 'It is not Swissair policy to comment publicly on any proposals or recommendations which such documents may contain.' Sabena confirmed talks with Swissair, but added it was also holding discussions with American Airlines. Belgian government officials said it would not object to Swissair taking a minority stake in Sabena as long as the state maintained majority control. A significant stake in Sabena would give Swissair an EU base. Swissair's biggest handicap is its lack of free access to the liberalised EU aviation market. It seems to have lost hope of solving this problem through an air transport agreement between the Swiss government and the EU. The Swiss airline indicated it intended to extend its partnerships after the collapse last year of the 'Alcazar' plan to merge with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System and Austrian Airlines. Any eventual deal between Swissair and Sabena will hinge on Air France's willingness to shed its stake in the Belgian carrier. Although Sabena has become unhappy with Air France as a minority shareholder, the financially troubled French carrier may be reluctant to shed its stake, according to airline industry officials. Such a disposal would risk complicating its efforts to win European Commission approval for a proposed FFr20bn (Pounds 2.4bn) capital injection from the French government.</p>

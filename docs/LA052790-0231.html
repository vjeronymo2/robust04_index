			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SPLASH II;  </P> <P> OUR PICKS FOR THE BEST OF THE SUMMER;  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE  </P> <P> The summer begins with a must-hear survey of recent American music at the Ojai  Festival. Following that, though, major companies from Japan, Australia and the  Soviet Union stake strong claims to our attention, amid the usual symphonic  parade at the Hollywood Bowl and two festival gatherings of Southern California  dancers.  </P> <P> The ear-stretching Americana agenda at Ojai comes courtesy of Stephen Mosko,  this year's music director. Elliott Carter is the composer-in-residence and  well-represented on concerts June 2 and 3, including a short but dense program  of his chamber music by the California E.A.R. Unit. The festival begins June 1  with a three-hour marathon enlisting Rachel Rosenthal, Joan La Barbara,  Frederic Rzewski and the E.A.R. Unit.  </P> <P> Wild things of a different sort follow downtown, when the Music Center Opera  stages eight performances of "Where the Wild Things Are" and "Higgelty Piggelty  Pop!" June 7-17. Maurice Sendak designed the sets and costumes for the Oliver  Knussen operas based on his children's books.  </P> <P> At the same time, local dancers of a largely modern bent will be represented by  "Generator Eight," June 7-17 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. Seven L.A.  companies and five soloists, often in collaboration with local composers, share  eight premiere-laden evenings.  </P> <P> Some of the same artists are also participating in the Dance Kaleidoscope  showcase at Cal State L.A. Twenty dancers and companies explore the themes of  People, Places and Dances on two weekends, July 20-22 and 27-29.  </P> <P> The Grand Kabuki from Japan arrives at Segerstrom Hall of the Orange County  Performing Arts Center for two performances, June 30 and July 1. Performing on  his first American tour, the renowned Kichiemon Nakamura II plays the title  hero in "Narukami" (The Thunder God) and the suspicious wife in the marital  comedy "Migawari Zazen" (The Substitute Mediator). At the Japan America Theatre  on July 3 and 4, the venerable company celebrates the Japanese American  Cultural and Community Center 10th anniversary with a special program seen  nowhere else on the tour: the quasi-historical drama "Kanjincho" (The  Subscription List) and the tragic love story of "Osome Hisamatsu."  </P> <P> Balletomanes should start saving gas money now, as they face a commuter future.  The Australian Ballet at Segerstrom Hall (Aug. 7-12) goes head to head with the  mighty Bolshoi at the Shrine Auditorium (Aug. 7-19).  </P> <P> The Soviets bring artistic director Yuri Grigorovich's stagings of "Ivan the  Terrible," "Romeo and Juliet," "Swan Lake" and a mixed bill featuring  "Petrushka." The Aussies dance artistic director Maina Gielgud's "Giselle" and  a mixed bill.  </P> <P> The Hollywood Bowl, with its weekend pops emphasis on fireworks, and Broadway  and film scores, has always been fertile ground for celebrations of American  mythology. Following the traditional Fourth of July concerts and prefatory  Mozart programs, the season opens July 10 and runs through Sept. 15,  highlighted by Simon Rattle's appearance at the Los Angeles Philharmonic helm  Aug. 14 and 16. Sandwiched between Rattle's concerts is a performance by the  American-Soviet Youth Orchestra conducted by Alexander Lazarev. On Aug. 19 that  ensemble combines with the Philharmonic Institute Orchestra under the baton of  Leonard Slatkin.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> MAGIC MISSING IN LIVELY 'NUTCRACKER'  </P> <P> The curtain rises on the Christmas Eve party in the Joffrey Ballet "Nutcracker"  and the stage quickly fills with action. Soon, you see something going on in  virtually every nook and cranny you can find.  </P> <P> The intent may be to feast the eye, but as seen Wednesday, at the beginning of  a five-day run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the production  looked more obsessed with incidents and objects than with touching the heart.  </P> <P> Perhaps this is not the way Robert Joffrey would have left it: Joffrey had  initiated the concept of an American "Nutcracker" set in the 1850s and lived to  see its premiere in 1987, but failing health forced him to rely upon others for  its final execution. George Verdak and Scott Barnard receive credit for the  staging. Gerald Arpino, now the company's artistic director, choreographed the  waltzes of the Snowflakes and the Flowers.  </P> <P> Nostalgic appeal is provided by Oliver Smith's pop-up Christmas card scenery  and the Currier and Ives-inspired costumes by John David Ridge. Television  puppeteer Kermit Love created imaginative designs for the mice and a  not-so-cute giant Mother Ginger figure.  </P> <P> One can admire a certain logic at work. The toys given to the children in Act I  prefigure the dancers in the Act II divertissements. Clara (the dewy Mary  Barton) populates her dream with figures from her life. Her mother (Deborah  Dawn) and father (Douglas Martin) recur as elegant Snow King and Queen; her  brother Fritz (Edward Stierle) as the tirelessly bounding Snow Prince.  </P> <P> Moreover, Fritz's growing anger at the attention paid Clara provides realistic  motivation for grabbing the Nutcracker Doll and hurling it across the floor.  </P> <P> But the pacing is relentlessly allegro con brio. The Mouse Battle proves  equally busy -- and blurred in design. Clara's climatic contribution comes out  of nowhere, and easily can be missed. Arpino's choreography for the snow scene  continues the frantic pace.  </P> <P> Act II merely gets fussy. Drosselmeyer (the authoritative Alexander Grant) does  not disappear as usual but remains to stage-manage everything. It's bad enough  that he brings on each dancer with a distinctive flourish, but to cull music  from Act I to support his gestures is intrusive, insensitive.  </P> <P> On opening night, the company looked eager and willing, as usual, but somehow  nothing magical happened. Tina LeBlanc was a pert, lively Sugar Plum Fairy. Tom  Mossbrucker proved a merely likable, fresh-faced Nephew and a bland Nutcracker  Prince.  </P> <P> Carl Corry executed the thankless, militaristic duties of the Nutcracker Doll  with precision and verve but didn't get much of a chance to dance until he  joined the Russian quartet in Act II.  </P> <P> Beatriz Rodriguez was lithe and vivid as both the Spanish dancer and Columbine  (filling in for an ill Meg Gurin). Valerie Madonia and Douglas Martin deftly  executed the kitschy Arabian dance. Cynthia Giannini and Stierle were the  springy Chinese duo.  </P> <P> But Allan Lewis subjected Tchaikovsky's wonderful score to speedy, pedestrian,  anti-lyrical conducting, and the Pacific Symphony responded with unpolished  sounds. The off-key Crystal Cathedral Boychoir was piped in for the Snow Scene.  </P> <P>  The Joffrey Ballet dances "The Nutcracker" through Sunday at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $11 to $42.  Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P></p>

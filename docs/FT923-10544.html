			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Arts: Bluebeard's Castle - Proms THE THIRD successive concert performance of an opera at the Albert Hall was given by the Budapest Festival Orchestra (making its Proms debut) under Ivan Fischer, the orchestra's co-founder, and with two internationally eminent Hungarian opera singers in the roles of Bluebeard and Judith. This should have guaranteed a degree of idiomatic rightness generally deemed unavailable to non-native Bartok interpreters. Strangely, Tuesday's Bluebeard's Castle did not work out that way. The players had already, earlier in the evening, made us familiar with their corporate characteristics of well-drilled ensemble and forceful attack in their Berlioz Benvenuto Cellini Overture and the Liszt E flat Piano Concerto (with Zoltan Kocsis, the other orchestra co-founder, a percussive-toned and intermittently rather mannered soloist). It was in Bartok that their limitations were most fully demonstrated: in simple terms, and in spite of the natural advantages of spacious resonance offered by the acoustics, the sound qualities of the playing seemed to lack depth, beauty, poetry, pathos. Bartok rigorously ordered the internal relationships of component parts and tempo choices, of each episode relative to the next; Fischer, though an alert, urgent organiser of individual sections, never gave the impression of fully perceiving the crucial importance of those relationships, with the result that the opera's cumulative intensity failed to build up. The bass, Laszlo Polgar, was grave, dignified, eloquent, but not sufficiently grand or free at the top in the perorations of the Fifth Door; the mezzo, Ildiko Komlossi, regularly spoiled the glamorous richness of her timbre with a heavy beat. The performance was by no means a disgrace or a waste of time - how could it be? - but at the end of it I could not conceal a feeling of considerable disappointment.

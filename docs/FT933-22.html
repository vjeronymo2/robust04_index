			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (23): A giant is on the move - Profile, Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corp. of India LIKE India itself, the Industrial Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India is slowly moving out of its shell, writes STEFAN WAGSTYL. Its history reflects the economic history of post-independence India. It was established in the 1950s with capital from private financial institutions in order to channel long-term funds into private industry in the best tradition of a development bank. In the late 1960s and 1970s it drifted into the public sector as its main shareholders were nationalised. In the 1980s, it hesitantly began to look at new ventures, as the government gradually began to encourage greater private initiative. Today, it is hurrying to take advantage of government reforms. 'From a long-term lender, we are emerging into a comprehensive financial services group,' says Mr N Vaghul, the chairman who has led the bank since 1985. Like other energetic business leaders of his generation, Mr Vaghul, who is 56, is in a man in a hurry. He acts as if he has to make up for the time lost when socialist-inclined planners ruled the economy. Mr Vaghul says that the biggest change of the last two years for ICICI is the decline in the state-owned institutions' share of the ownership from 82 per cent to 35 per cent. 'The most important thing is that we have acquired 500,000 shareholders.' At the same time, Mr Vaghul is presiding over a rapid expansion of business activities: ICICI, the core company, is diversifying from long-term loans into leasing, short-term loans and asset-based credit. SCICI, or the Shipping Credit &amp; Investment Corporation of India, an affiliate which was set up to finance shipping and fisheries, is also turning into general purpose finance. The group has moved into investment banking with ICICI Securities and Finance Company - a 60:40 joint venture signed earlier this year with JP Morgan, the US investment bank. ICICI is also launching an asset management company which will manage mutual funds and is planning a stock broking business. It is expanding a venture capital business which started in the late 1980s and next year is launching a commercial bank. ICICI's revenues have been growing at more than 30 per cent a year to Rs14.9bn in the year to the end of March. Pre-tax profits totalled Rs2.3bn, including profits from capital gains. The bulk of revenue comes from lending. The capital reserves total Rs12.06bn, enough to sustain assets of Rs123bn and yet keep a comfortable capital adequacy ratio of 11.7 per cent. Despite the decline in the share of state-owned institutions in the equity capital, Mr Vaghul maintains close links with the government. He says ICICI has 'relative autonomy'. Western bankers might frown at such a cosy relationship. But their colleagues from Japan and other east Asian countries would find ICICI a very familiar animal.</p>

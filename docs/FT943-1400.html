			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Man in the news: Minister in a morality tale - Gerard Longuet Far from being a source of relaxation, Gerard Longuet's Riviera villa is proving his biggest ever political headache. It could even spell the end of a bright career that some observers were projecting could make him prime minister next year. Mr Longuet, minister for trade, industry, posts and telecommunications, is the most powerful politician to be hit so far by a growing wave of allegations concerning official and corporate corruption in France. He is not the only one. In July such allegations led to the resignation of the communications minister. This week there were reports that the sports and youth minister is under investigation for having received money indirectly from pharmaceutical companies when she sat on the health ministry's drug approval committee. Mr Longuet is suspected by a judge, Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, of allowing the building of his holiday house in St Tropez to be subsidised, to the tune of more than FFr1m, by a contractor from Lorraine. The latter has carried out big public contracts in Lorraine, where the minister also happens to be president of the regional council. In a report to the justice ministry leaked this week, the judge suggested that the contractor may be guilty of 'misuse of corporate funds' and Mr Longuet of 'receipt' of such funds. Mr Longuet acknowledges that there may have been a cost over-run, but says the judge has exaggerated it. In any case, he contends that because the allegations do not concern his public responsibilities - in 1989-90 he was neither minister nor president of the Lorraine region  - he has no intention of resigning, even if formally charged. The contractor, for his part, says he miscalculated on a FFr2.5m fixed price contract, and therefore he had to pay the difference. Now, friendly contractors are said to have long had a habit of providing favours for corporate or political notables. But it is a sign of the French public's growing sensitivity to the appearance - not necessarily the fact - of corruption that the Longuet affair has caused such a stir. The more moralistic mood started as a reaction to repeated scandals that helped the Socialists lose power last year. It has been fuelled since by a rash of corporate corruption allegations, some of them involving members of a conservative administration pledged to restoring ethics in government. The Van Ruymbeke report puts Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, the justice minister, on the spot. Under the French system it falls to him to decide whether to have a judge investigate his cabinet colleague. His dilemma is shared even more acutely by the prime minister. Before taking office, Mr Edouard Balladur claimed the advent of a 'liberal' government would help root out corruption by privatising state companies and lessening the links between the state and business. He also said any minister facing formal charges should resign - and this month he set up a commission to report on the ethics of links between politics and business. On the other hand, Mr Longuet is crucial to the RPR Gaullist prime minister's election strategy for the Elysee next spring. To offset the hold that his presidential rival, RPR leader Jacques Chirac, has on the Gaullist machine, Mr Balladur is counting on his coalition partner, the UDF, to back him in preference to its nominal leader, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing. So far the strategy is working well - but mainly thanks to Mr Longuet, whose Republicans, with 109 seats in parliament, are the largest component of the UDF federation. He might be rewarded with the prime ministership next year, if Mr Balladur were to win the presidency. But there might be no Balladur victory if Republican sentiment were to change as a result of Mr Longuet leaving government. Certain new factors dispose today's France towards corruption. One is the trend over the past decade to decentralise more power to the regions, placing more power to award public contracts in the hands of more people. That more corruption cases are hitting the headlines these days may be because a long-servile magistrature is at last doing its job. That, at least, is the contention of Mr Mehaignerie, who yesterday welcomed the fact that businessmen were at last beginning to fear the law. 'Such fear is the beginning of wisdom,' he said. French business's initial reaction to investigations was indignant. Many captains of industry, and Mr Longuet himself, leapt to the defence of Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, head of Schneider, when he was briefly detained in a Brussels prison, without even knowing what the charges against him were. However, two-thirds of the businessmen interviewed in a recent poll said many companies were indulging in illegal practices and favoured an Italian-style 'clean hands' crack-down on corruption. The Patronat employers federation has now followed Mr Balladur's example in setting up its own study of corporate ethics, the legal responsibilities of senior executives and non-executive directors, business links with politics and desirable changes in the French penal procedure. In a somewhat utopian vein, Mr Mehaignerie yesterday voiced the hope of getting corporate money out of French politics altogether. Recent years have seen more regulation and transparency in the funding of French political parties. Before 1988 - just as in the US before the 1972-73 Watergate scandals - corporate donations to political parties were illegal, but widespread. A 1990 law placed limits on what companies could give and on what candidates could spend. This has been enforced. For exceeding the limit in 1993, Mr Jack Lang, the former socialist education and culture minister, lost his parliamentary seat. As a result, 'we have drained some of the money out of politics', says Mr Guy Carcassonne, a Paris law professor who helped the Rocard government design the 1990 law. Long term, therefore, France may be slowly cleaning up its act. But at least in the coming presidential campaign, corruption is likely to be a big theme.</p>

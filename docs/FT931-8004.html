			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Polish interest rate cut reflects new optimism POLAND'S central bank, the NBP, has cut its basic refinancing interest rate by three points to 35 per cent, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. The move reflects optimism about an expected 2 per cent GDP growth in the economy this year and a lower inflation rate, projected at 32 per cent. Mrs Hanna Gronkiewicz Walc, NBP chairman, said she expected Polish banks to reduce their lending rates, which currently range between 40 per cent and 60 per cent. The refinancing rate is used by the NBP to lend money to government-funded investment projects and is regarded as the marker for the banking system. The central bank's rate cut follows recent falls in Treasury bill yields and inter-bank lending rates, which at the end of last week stood at an annual 40 per cent for three-month deposits.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Israelis urged to free Palestinians ISRAELI and Palestinian peacemakers hammered out a comprehensive agenda on security and civilian issues to implement a framework peace agreement yesterday and set up a sub-committee to decide the fate of up to 11,500 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. On the second day of talks at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, the Palestinian delegation, led by Mr Nabil Shaath, pressed the Israelis for the quick release of Palestinian prisoners. The Israelis refused to grant a Palestinian demand for a separate committee or to make an immediate gesture of releasing some prisoners, but agreed to establish a sub-committee dubbed 'confidence-building measures' to deliberate on prisoners, deportees and fugitives. 'We expect decisions on prisoners as soon as possible,' said Mr Ahmed Khalili, a strategic and security expert on the Palestinian delegation. 'We expect gestures as soon as possible. The Israelis understand the urgency of the matter.' Both sides also agreed an agenda for the talks, which resume in Taba next Wednesday, but refused to make it public after the Israelis objected. Among the items which are known to be on the agenda are the smooth transfer of power from the Israeli military administration in the occupied territories to a Palestinian authority; the territorial delimiting of the Jericho area from which Israeli troops will withdraw; rights of passage for Jewish settlers through Palestinian-controlled areas and for Palestinians through Israeli-controlled areas, especially border crossings to Egypt and Jordan; and the timetable for Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza. In a joint statement issued late yesterday by Gen Uzi Dayan, deputy head of the Israeli delegation, both sides stressed the 'positive atmosphere' of the talks. Many observers said the success, so far, of the talks was largely due to the extraordinary relationship established early on between Mr Shaath and Gen Amnon Shahak, the head of the Israeli delegation, and their willingness to quickly smooth over differences and present a unified public front to the press. Both men broke off talks yesterday to stroll along the beach and chat at a picnic table. 'We came here to work and to talk, to get the work done and to get down to business and we have started,' said Gen Dayan. 'We came to make friends and I hope it can show that already we started to be friends and I hope and wish we shall make peace.' Both sides said the two days of talks had been remarkable for getting through a long list of procedural details allowing substantive issues to be worked on from next Wednesday. Under the framework peace agreement both sides must agree a protocol for Israeli military withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza by December 13.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Growth in managers' pay slows INCREASES in total pay for managers slowed last year to an average of less than 10 per cent, according to a pay index from the Noble Lowndes group of management consultants and actuaries. The index includes the value of benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses. It is based on the group's regular pay surveys, and is calculated each quarter for the Financial Times. The latest survey, which covered 5,304 executives in 417 companies in the UK, shows that on January 1 the average for managers of all ranks was Pounds 75,794, 9.3 per cent up on the Pounds 69,345 average at the beginning of 1991. The corresponding increase in 1990-91 was 13.8 per cent. Although the total rose, the bonus element fell slightly last year to Pounds 4,290 compared with Pounds 4,369 in 1990. In general, the 'all-ranks' rises were lowest in companies with sales turnovers of less than Pounds 100m, where they averaged just over 8.5 per cent. The corresponding figures for larger companies were 10.2 per cent for those in the Pounds 101m-Pounds 600m range and 10 per cent for those turnovers of Pounds 600m or more.

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Efta chief faces short contract - A Nordic yes to the EU would spell the association's end 'I cannot exclude the possibility that Efta may end next year,' admitted the incoming secretary-general of the European Free Trade Association, Mr Kjartan Johannsson, on August 31, his first day at work. His last may not be long in coming if Finland, Sweden and Norway follow Austria in voting this autumn to join the European Union. In that case, only a miracle will prevent the Icelandic diplomat and former trade minister, together with his 270 staff in Geneva and Brussels, being out of a job next July. With the loss of four of its seven members Efta will be reduced next January to a rump of one small nation and two tiddlers - Switzerland (population 7m), Iceland (population 260,000) and Liechtenstein (population 28,000). The association's chances of surviving this amputation look slim at best. Iceland has already made plain it too may apply for EU membership if its Nordic partners vote yes. Ironically, Efta, which was established in 1960 to promote free trade in western Europe, has never been busier. The watershed came in 1989 when Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, proposed establishment of what was to become the European Economic Area, a single market of some 370m people linking the EU with six of the seven Efta nations. To satisfy the terms of the EEA accord, which came into force at the beginning of this year, Efta had to set up an Efta court and a surveillance body to oversee implementation of the new trading rules. The association's staff doubled in size. Yet, after just 12 months, those institutions will no longer be needed. Switzerland is not a member of the EEA following the narrow rejection by voters in December 1992. Iceland has decided to open discussions with the EU on preserving the EEA accord as a bilateral deal between Reyjavik and Brussels. Liechtenstein will vote for a second time on EEA membership later this year because of consequent changes in its trading relationship with Switzerland with which it has a customs union. But even if the answer is another yes the principality will be forced along the bilateral route in Iceland's wake. This means there will be no residual role for Efta in supervising its members' compliance with EEA rules. And the association's other main area of concern, trade agreements with third countries, also looks likely to disappear. As of now, Efta has negotiated free trade accords with half a dozen nations in central and eastern Europe, Turkey and Israel. However, in law and in practice these are bilateral agreements applied by Efta's individual members; the association has never aspired to become a customs union with a common external trade policy. From next year the EU entrants will be bound by trade accords negotiated in Brussels. Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein will continue to apply the agreements with third countries and the free trade agreements they have between themselves. But it scarcely seems likely they will want to stump up for a common secretariat to keep an eye on their activities. As late as last year there were hopes that Efta would find a new role as a 'half-way house' for countries of central and eastern Europe aiming at eventual EU membership and thinking of the EEA as a possible stepping stone. Such hopes have been comprehensively disappointed. As Mr Johannsson frankly concedes, these countries have shown no interest in Efta, preferring to aim straight at goal, 'and if the political desire is not there it is not on the agenda'. Hungary and Poland have already filed their applications with Brussels in a bid to join the EU around the turn of the century. It seems that the only thing that will save Efta now is a no vote in one or more of the Nordic nations. Finland, the most likely to say yes, votes on October 16, Sweden on November 13 and Norway, where opposition is greatest, on November 28. In mid-December all seven Efta trade ministers will meet in Geneva to decide what to do next. But already they have given notice that adjustment to the new situation, whatever that may be, will be completed in the first half of next year. Mr Johannsson's present contract, and those of his staff, expire at the end of June 1995. Into the EU's arms, Page 18</p>

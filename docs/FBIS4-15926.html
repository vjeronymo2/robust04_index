			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian Federation Social Security Ministry has  confirmed that from May Day, implementation will be continued of  President Boris Yeltsin's decree on raising the previously fixed  retirement pensions, which started on 1 April. This statement  was distributed today in connection with the appearance in some  mass media of a so-called denial by Russia's Pension Fund  regarding the indexation of pensions on May Day. In short,  pensions will go up -- that is the most important thing.</p>

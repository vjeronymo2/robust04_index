			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ho Xuan Nam, engineer, director of Chemical </F> Engineering Corporation 13, and Thanh Cao]    [Text] For many years now, along with the Z121, Z131, and  Z115 plants, the Z113 Plant has been using the techniques used  by the military to produce explosives to produce industrial  explosives to serve the national economic sectors. This is an  economic commodity for which long-term guidelines have been set.  In this sphere, it can be said that since the end of the 1970s,  when the country encountered difficulties concerning aid, the  national defense industry has been promptly providing a large  quantity of explosives for the coal sector to support  production. To date, the national defense industry has  simultaneously produced everything from fuses and detonators to  explosives. Some plants are turning to producing gelatin  explosives, which is a type of explosive having many advantages  during use. Along with this, the military's control and  protection system has been perfected and consists of scientific  research organizations, separate storehouses, and special means  of transportation. Many of the explosive materials produced by  the national defense plants and Z113 have won gold medals at  international industrial fairs. In recent years, the use of  explosives by the economic sectors has increased greatly. Our  national defense plants have satisfied 50 percent of those  needs. If the state invests a suitable amount, the national  defense industry will be able to satisfy all of the domestic  needs for explosives.    As everyone knows, explosives are a special type of  commodity  that can be used for both military and economic purposes. Thus,  decentralizing control and investing in expanding production  must be examined based on this special nature of explosives. The  method that has been used up to now to decentralize control is  very illogical. Two decades ago, when the country was  concentrating everything for the front lines, the use of  explosives in the economic sphere was concentrated mainly in the  coal sector. Thus, it made sense for the government to make this  sector responsible for controlling the materials. But the war  ended a long time ago. Besides the coal sector, many other  sectors such as the construction and communications sectors also  use explosives. However, because the above decision has not yet  been revised, control and distribution matters must go through  the coal sector, which has given it a monopoly in distribution.  This has created many problems, increased non-production  expenses, and done much damage to both the production  installations and installations that use explosives.    As one of the national defense plants directly involved in  producing industrial explosives, we hope that the state will  soon issue a decision in line with today's realities. This will  enable the national defense plants to manifest their potential  and better support economic construction. At the same time, this  will contribute to promoting domestic production, to effectively  implementing the Politburo's resolution on solidifying and  expanding the national defense industry, and to increasing the  country's defense strength.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Observer: Gloom boom Next to a hole in the head, there's surely nothing the Brits need like the latest sociological yardstick produced by Mori opinion polls - a monthly Misery Index. Alas, the FT can't claim to be free of blame for the development, because the misery measure is calculated from the fear of redundancy index printed in this paper together with the economic optimism index published in The Times. The combined result represents the average numbers of people polled expecting further recession and either potentially or actually out of a job. What it shows is that the national heart is steadily sinking, now up to 33 per cent last month from April's 27 per cent, with all ages and classes as well as both sexes becoming equally steeped in gloom. Indeed, the only exceptions to the uniformly unhappy pattern are the Scots. They're gloomier still.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Taut Strauss and Stravinsky The policy of having a single low price for any seat has certainly lowered the average age at the BBC Symphony Orchestra's concerts. The Strauss and Stravinsky series was not planned with any specific educational aim in mind, but it can hardly have failed to heighten appreciation of 20th-century musical history. The opportunity to contrast two such diverse personalities was nowhere presented in a didactic way. The audiences were left to come to their own conclusions - nudged just a little at Tuesday's concert, the last in the series. How else could one come up with the combination of Stravinsky at his most impersonal in Oedipus Rex and the egocentric Strauss of Ein Heldenleben, proclaiming his loves, his battles, his achievements to be the centre of the musical universe? The Stravinsky opera-oratorio was the largest of the composer's works in the series. It will have left a picture of him at his least endearing. In his treatment of the Oedipus myth Stravinsky's determination to keep personal reaction to a minimum resulted in music that is not just objective but unmemorable. The score calls for cool-headed control, which Andrew Davis exerts impressively over the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Ideally one imagines voices monumental in their own right, which only Felicity Palmer's fearsomely stringent Jocasta could be described as offering. Anthony Rolfe Johnson was the sensitive Oedipus, genuinely moving at the end. Anthony Michaels-Moore did good service as Creon and the Messenger; the BBC Symphony Chorus had been well drilled. The firm grip on the conductor's baton that kept the Stravinsky taut was also brought to bear upon the Strauss. The BBCSO may not have the silken strings, the magniloquent brass, the overall tonal allure of the great Straussian orchestras, but it is heartening to hear its members play as though everybody knows what they are playing and why. Each episode was full of character, except perhaps the one where Strauss mocks his critics, who sounded far too nice a bunch. Davis makes a superb commander-in-chief and delivered one of the best battles I have heard. The love scene was carefully shaped, but not heady, certainly not indulgent. The warm glow, that sense of sinking into one's memories that comes over the final pages, as yet eludes the conductor or the orchestra, possibly both. Not a complete Ein Heldenleben, but an effective one.</p>

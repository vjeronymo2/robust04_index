			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BILL TO SPEED CITYHOOD PASSED BY ASSEMBLY  65-0  </P> <P> In a boost for Malibu cityhood, the state Assembly on Monday approved by a 65-0  vote legislation intended to speed up the community's incorporation. The bill  was sent to the Senate for consideration.  </P> <P> Even though voters in June overwhelmingly approved cityhood for the coastal  community, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors delayed until March the  effective date of incorporation so work on a controversial sewer project could  begin. The board's maneuver would prevent a new Malibu city council from  blocking the project.  </P> <P> In the Legislature, cityhood supporters have been pushing a measure sponsored  by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) that, if passed by the Senate and signed by  Gov. George Deukmejian, would short-circuit the county's plans by allowing the  incorporation to take effect immediately.  </P></p>

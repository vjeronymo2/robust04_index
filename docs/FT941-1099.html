			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Capel to break with past and make markets James Capel, the UK stockbroker, is to make its first foray into equities marketmaking, specialising in the shares of its own smaller corporate clients which complain that their stock cannot be easily traded. The move is a sharp reversal of policy for Capel, which said at the time of the Big Bang deregulation in the City in 1986 that it would not both make markets and also act as a broker for investors because of the potential conflict of interest that this would involve. Its latest decision follows the withdrawal by many UK stockbrokers from marketmaking during the recession after they incurred heavy losses. Marketmakers are professionals who offer to buy and sell companies' shares, even in volatile market conditions. Mr Bob Benton, Capel's managing director, said the firm, a division of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, was responding to the needs of its clients who had seen liquidity in their shares dry up. 'There have been instances where we have had to ask a favour from another marketmaker on behalf of one of our corporate clients,' Mr Benton said. Following the liquidity problems, the London Stock Exchange announced plans last year to close its Unlisted Securities Market where many small company shares are traded. James Capel will only make markets in the shares of companies that are not included in the FT-SE 100 index of largest companies. Moreover, all but about 10 of its 69 corporate clients are too small to be included among the 350 biggest companies traded on the London Stock Exchange, which account for 90 per cent of the total value of all listed companies. Mr Benton said that, for now, James Capel had decided not to extend its marketmaking capacity beyond its own smaller clients. However, the advent of Crest in early 1996, the proposed system for paperless share settlement could prompt the firm to reconsider its stance.</p>

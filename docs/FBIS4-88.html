			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of State, the Liberian National  Transitional Government, has expressed satisfaction over the  clarifications provided it this week by the chairman of ECOWAS  [Economic Community of West African States], President Nicephore  Dieudonne Soglo of the Republic of Benin, relative to the issue  of the allocation of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance,  Justice, and Defense.    In a letter to the chairman of the Council of State,  Professor David Kpomakpor, dated 23 March, Chairman Soglo of  ECOWAS says that he has learned that a letter bearing his  signature has been circulated to the leaders of the former  Liberian factions party to the Cotonou Peace Accord recommending  that two of the four disputed ministries be given to the NPFL  [National Patriotic Front of Liberia]. The ECOWAS chairman  expressed surprise at what he described as an irresponsible act  because the contents of the purported letter differ totally from  his recommendations concerning the allocation of the four  cabinet posts. The ECOWAS chairman reiterated his position that  the decision for the allocation of the four ministries rests  with the Liberian people. Chairman Soglo has, therefore, urged  a prompt settlement of the issue in a spirit of dialogue,  concerted efforts, good judgment, and secrecy.</p>

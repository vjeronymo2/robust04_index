			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Everything flat at MFI As luck would have it, MFI's red herring prospectus coincided yesterday with the May survey from the Confederation of British Industry, confirming that the post-election boomlet in retail spending has indeed fizzled out. According to the survey, furniture sales are down significantly from last year. According to MFI, it is not quite as bad as that: sales growth is merely non-existent, having been strong from Christmas to end-February and weaker in March and April. Plainly, investors in the flotation are going to have to take a good deal on trust. But if they hold shares in the UK retail sector, they are taking a lot on trust already. The average multiple for the sector is 18.4 times historic earnings. Individual prices run from a conservative 14 times for Kingfisher to a dotty 31 times for Next. It appears that however disillusioned investors are with the outlook for consumer spending, they dare not be out of the most obvious recovery sector. MFI on say 18 times earnings might be overvalued, but no more so than the sector as a whole. The case for a sector rating is familiar. On the one hand, MFI's business is inherently volatile. On the other, a business which survived the last three years with a crippling burden of debt can survive anything. There are the usual caveats about a buy-out, such as the extent to which it was starved of investment in the lean years. But it is claimed that capital expenditure in the foreseeable future will not exceed depreciation and will be modest in relation to cash flow. A sector rating would imply a price of 138p and a value for the business of Pounds 800m. That may not quite be attainable. But the flotation has only to make a gross Pounds 564m to repay debt, giving a floor price of 97p on 13 times earnings. Anything beyond that is gravy for the management and its backers, in the form of cash or of retained equity. Even in today's retail climate, that leaves enough room for haggling to get the issue away.</p>

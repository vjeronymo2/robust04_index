			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN: OSCAR'S FICKLE FANCIES  </P> <P> Wondering what to wear Oscar night? Well, wander past the "Hold" rack at Fred  Hayman Beverly Hills for some hints. That's where four of Hollywood's finest  have set aside their tentative selections, Listen hears from Hayman's  spokeswoman Kay Sweet. With the big night less than two weeks away, award  presenters Anjelica Huston, Anne Archer, Jacqueline Bisset and Olivia  Newton-John are still thinking it over. But Sweet, who's helping to coordinate  the show, says she's been advised that the burning issue of what to wear is  always decided at the last minute. "And even people who say, 'I'm going to wear  this,' may show up in something else," Sweet says. Meanwhile, this is a  definite: The sanctified Oscar fragrance will be Hayman's new 273. On the night  of the awards presentation, Hayman will present each female nominee and  presenter with a bottle of his new fragrance.  </P> <P> Having Designs on Towels  </P> <P> The folks at Hermes, the venerable and conservative French leather and fashion  house, were in for a bit of a shocker recently when a "proper, three-piece-suit  type of Japanese businessman" purchased 12 large beach towels at $450 each at  the Rodeo Drive boutique. Manager Francine Bardot said the man told her he  owned the towels in every pattern and design. When she politely inquired why,  he explained that he was a dentist and used the towels instead of paper bibs to  cover his patients. The cheery-looking towels -- which come in fish, bird and  balloon designs, to name a few -- made his patients feel warm and less nervous,  he said.  </P> <P> He's Maxed Out  </P> <P> About those rumors: No, Leon Max is not going out of business, and yes, he is  hooking up with a Tokyo manufacturer for a line of women's clothes, sold only  in Japan. The rest of the story is less encouraging. L.A.'s high-profile  fashion designer says he's cutting his newest and priciest Leon Max label from  the women's-wear line. And, he already abandoned his menswear collection. "It  never quite got out of the gate," he says. "It was a drain on the business."  Add his name to a list of local menswear designers biting the belt. Glenn  Williams says he's slashed his collections from 5 to 2 per year. And Christian  de Castelnau halted production of his fall collection but expects to be back  for the holidays.  </P> <P> A Heartfelt Party  </P> <P> Phil Collins had himself fitted for a Perry Ellis tuxedo this week, on his way  to a party honoring him, Lamont Dozier and their Grammy-winning song "Two  Hearts." Sen. Edward Kennedy's sister Jean Kennedy Smith was at the party too.  She wants to use the tune to promote the International Very Special Arts  Festival for handicapped children in Washington in June.  </P> <P> Grace Under Pressure  </P> <P> It appears that former Vogue editor Grace Mirabella will go to just about any  lengths to make her new namesake fashion magazine, Mirabella, become a hit.  Grace and several members of her staff showed up at a cocktail party for  Geoffrey Beene, wearing T-shirts that sported her photo and were printed with:  "Magazine, thy name is Mirabella." Actually, it was nice to see the usually  painfully chic fashion pack having a little fun with their wardrobes. The first  issue of Mirabella debuts in June.  </P> <P> Talking Back  </P> <P> "Mad as hell and not going to take it anymore" may be a new motto for the  fashion industry. Two magazine articles in April address critics of some of our  most important designers. Elle magazine is running a piece by writer Sarah  Ferguson called "Style Wars," in response to last December's controversial  Newsweek cover story that asked, "Who Would Wear This Stuff?" Details magazine  is debuting a new commentary column with a piece by designer Ronaldus Shamask.  It's a rebuttal to a review of his spring collection that appeared in the New  York Times, stating some of his styles were "obviously inspired by the recent  showings in Paris" and that "echoes of Claude Montana were particularly  strong." Shamask points out that his samples were designed and finished by the  time the Paris shows got under way.  </P></p>

Yesterday in Koblenz Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) appointed him  as successor to Lieutenant General Helmut Hansen. At the same  time, the 3d Corps, which is stationed in Koblenz, was dissolved  after 37 years of existence and put into service as the new Army  Operations Command.    This restructuring is a "milestone" for the German Army,  Ruehe said. At the same time, he stressed that the foreign and  domestic policy challenges for the Bundeswehr have "clearly  increased." Germany must remain a reliable partner in the  international community. The main defense forces can be reduced  in terms of "presence and readiness for action." At the same  time, crisis reaction forces, which "can be deployed and  transferred quickly," must be created. Ruehe paid tribute to  Army Inspector Hansen as a "dedicated advocate of the troop."  He has "essential credit" for restructuring the Army in unified  Germany. Hansen will become the new commander in chief of the  Central Europe NATO forces.    With the Army Operations Command the Army for the first time  has an instrument with which German Army units can be commanded  at a purely national level in operations abroad. In the future,  the Army Operations Command, the Army Office, and the Army  Support Command are subordinate to the Army inspector only as  the supreme commander for troop service. In contrast, the Army  Operations Command plans and commands all Army operations. The  inspector remains responsible for Army planning and remains a  departmental head in the Defense Ministry. The first practical  experience was gathered by the staff of Commanding General Klaus  Reinhardt, who will remain in command as head of the Army  Operations Command, during the mission in Somalia.    The Army Operations Command in Koblenz has the following  responsibilities:     -  Planning and preparation of operations  under national responsibility. These are Bundeswehr operations  for crisis prevention and settlement and also operations for  humanitarian and disaster relief. In most cases, troops of  other nations will also be involved.    -  Establishing readiness for  action of the necessary contingents;    -  Commanding the operations  of German Army units abroad;    -  The preparation and carrying out of  military exercises and maneuvers at national and international  level;    -  Cooperation with German civilian offices for the  "territorial organization" of national defense.</p>

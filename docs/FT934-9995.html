			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Thorp and review intensify nuclear debate (2) Sir, Professors Fells and Lucas (Personal View, 2 November) make a very positive start to the debate concerning the long awaited Nuclear Review. Like them, I am concerned that the terms of reference may not include some of the crucial questions such as: While the dash for gas has introduced healthy competition, surely a strategy which maintains diversity and security is essential? Can we afford to ignore the major contribution made by nuclear power to off-setting the emissions of carbon dioxide and acid rain gases from burning fossil fuels? Are we willing to sacrifice an energy source that will certainly be needed by future generations as other energy sources become depleted and expensive? Can the UK afford to let another major industry disappear? These are real issues - and in our lifetimes we shall see the consequences either of closing our eyes or of prudent action. But what of nuclear economics and the matters rightly raised by Dr Dieter Helm (Letters, November 4)? The facts are that over the past three years both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear have dramatically improved all aspects of performance. Within England and Wales, nuclear now contributes almost 25 per cent of all electricity needs and in Scotland close to 50 per cent with those one-time much berated advanced gas reactors, both north and south of the border, now achieving generation costs of less than 3p per unit. The economics of existing plants is now truly robust and in Scotland our plans to construct dry fuel stores is an example of innovation arising from commercial reality. Dr Helm is correct to assert that the economic profile of new nuclear investment is viewed by the private capital market as less attractive than combined cycle gas turbine plant since the latter enjoy higher rates of return and shorter pay-back periods. In part this is because the environmental costs of nuclear are internalised and those of fossil burn are not; also the City prefers the certainty of short-termism and places little value on strategic issues such as diversity and security. The gas prices of today are known - what will they be tomorrow? The Nuclear Review may spotlight the feasibility of privatisation to see whether it makes sense to complete the process started through the Electricity Act in 1990. However, whether privatisation forms part of the review or not, Scottish Nuclear is committed to continue down the road of commercialisation which means producing private-sector financial structures and disciplines within the framework of state ownership.

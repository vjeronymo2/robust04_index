			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Prison Riots -- The government must act firmly says a page-8  editorial in Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 13 June in its  reaction to the prison strikes. "The bloody uprising and  hostage drama at the Modderbee Prison and the millions of rands'  worth of damage caused by protesting inmates in at least eight  prisons are indications of a very disturbing development." The  spate of violence and vandalism in the latest so-called  "peaceful" protest is "unacceptable and inexcusable under any  circumstances. Such behavior should not be tolerated."  According to the editorial, the organization claiming to  represent the prisoners, the South African Prisoners  Organization for Human Rights, "has this time either overplayed  its hand, or it has no control over its members....The decision  by the government to give all prisoners a six months' remission  is a mistake." It is high time the government sent out a loud  and clear message: "The season of violence and lawlessness is  gone for good."    Help for Africa -- A second editorial on the same page of  the  paper notes: "It is becoming all the clearer that African  countries, especially those south of the Sahara, are waiting  with optimism that South Africa will rescue them from the  economic quagmire in which they find themselves due to  corruption and bad management....Western countries have written  them off. The former Communist Bloc has forgotten about them  and are themselves in economic misery. South Africa must now  jump to their rescue." According to the paper, President Mandela  is handling this sensitive issue "well." At the recent World  Economic Congress in Cape Town he assured African countries that  South Africa did not intend to dominate them, but as a  copartner, wanted to play a role in trying to reconstruct and  develop Africa south of the Sahara. The editorial goes on to  suggest: "If South Africa could help its neighbors in creating  jobs for themselves, for instance, its own problem with illegal  immigrants could be minimized." There must be caution against  too big expectations. "The government's task of upliftment lies  here first of all, and only thereafter can it direct its efforts  elsewhere in Africa. There is little money."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Government Action -- An editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 15 June on page 10 warns that "people are starting to  loose patience" with the slow pace of government action on its  promises. "Most people are reasonable and do not expect the  Reconstruction and Development Programme to take off at once. A  start, however small, has to be made. The important thing is to  place some projects physically on the line. For instance, even  if one area is prepared for housing, the streets tarred and the  infrastructure put in place, people will be mollified. The  trick is to show physically that the intention to make the plans  work is there."</p>

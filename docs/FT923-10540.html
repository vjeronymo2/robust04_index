			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Book Review: Towering failures BRICKS &amp; MORTALS The dream of the 80s and the nightmare of the 90s: the inside story of the property world By Alastair Ross Goobey Century Business, Pounds 25, 218 pages The UK property market is still in the grip of the worst recession that most of its participants have seen. The half-empty, loss-making office blocks and shopping centres that litter the country are monuments to a startling reversal of fortune over the past five years. The industry is paying a heavy price for the delusions of the second half of the 1980s. That was a time when finance was easy and cheap; rents appeared to have no upper limits, buildings changed hands every few months at increasingly inflated prices and developers ignored the scale of the property expansion, convinced of the superiority of their projects. The perpetrators of this self-confidence trick were a motley crew. They ranged from the urbane, such as the old Harrovian Beckwith brothers to down-to-earth, self-made men, such as the Richardson twins, who became the standard bearers for the regeneration of the Black Country in the English Midlands. Some were obsessed by deal-making: Tony Clegg of Mountleigh, who would conduct five meetings at once by portable phone over breakfast, sold most of his development projects before completion. Some, such as Greycoat's Geoffrey Wilson, kept a resolutely low profile, in spite of creating some of the most notable buildings in London, such as Embankment place above Charing Cross station. Others, including the eccentric Godfrey Bradman of Rosehaugh hogged the headlines. Such characters and the ups-and-downs of the property industry is a compelling story, which, surprisingly, has not been told properly since 1967 when Oliver Marriott wrote The Property Boom. This neglect prompted Alastair Ross Goobey, chief investment strategist of James Capel, to fill the gap. Bricks and Mortals is a valuably detailed and accurate chronology with a good section on the changes in building design and architecture in the 1980s. But it is not as entertaining or as comprehensive as The Property Boom. It begins badly, with an overlong and sometimes clumsy account of the structure of the UK property industry such as. Later, it often degenerates into a catalogue of deals. Nor does Bricks and Mortals fully live up to its subtitle: The dream of the '80s and the nightmare of the '90s . . . While it covers the slow recovery of the industry in the 1970s and the heady 1980s in detail, it does not do justice to the drama of the present slump. Overall, Ross Goobey adopts a relatively sanguine attitude to the state of the property market, believing that the decline in rents, one of the principal causes of the current slump, will reverse sooner than most commentators think. At times, the book gives the impression that it has been overtaken by events. It skates over the desperate position of some of the companies it describes: the collapse of Olympia &amp; York and Mountleigh command just a few paragraphs. Ross Goobey's central thesis is that the newcomers of the 1980s made the same mistakes as those who fell in the 1970s crash. Those who survived the earlier crash, such as Lord Sterling of P&amp;O and John Ritbat of British Land, avoided the same mistakes a second time around. The author pins much of the blame for the current crash on the personalities involved. 'It is not too extreme to count the story as a tragedy. Tragedy involves people perhaps with heroic visions but certainly with fatal failings,' he says. In some cases this approach succeeds. For example, he cites an over-ambitious nature as an important factor in Mr Godfrey Bradman's downfall. 'You can lose as much on a small development if it goes wrong as on a major project, but the upside is not nearly as exciting.' In other cases, however, Ross Goobey fails adequately to demonstrate the link between personality and business problems. By casting developers as tragic heroes, he also underplays the contribution of the banks, advisers and government policy to the crash. For example, he skims over the effect of the relaxation of planning controls in fuelling the rapid increase in property developments. The enterprise zones, which delivered millions of square feet of unwanted office space, receive only a cursory discussion. As a former adviser to Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, it is perhaps unsurprising that Ross Goobey makes light work of the Treasury's forecasting and policy mistakes. But if the government's economic mismanagement had not been so pronounced, many of the developers he describes would have ridden through the downturn. While Ross Goobey is right to focus on the poor judgment of the current crop of developers, he may place too much emphasis on the ability to learn from mistakes: plenty of the fallen heroes of the 1980s lived through the crash of the 1970s. But he is doubtless correct when he says that similar errors will be made again. The shortcomings of policy makers, bankers and developers will probably see to that.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Argentaria offer given enthusiastic reception ARGENTARIA, Spain's state-owned banking group, yesterday said the public issue of 25 per cent of its shares to raise Pta120bn (Pounds 687m) had closed heavily oversubscribed. International investors subscribed for 10.6 times the shares on offer. The oversubscription comes as the peseta is under pressure and when potential political instability is forecast in Spain ahead of the June 6 general election. Argentaria is placing only 39 per cent (Pta41.8bn) of the total 25 per cent equity offering outside Spain but international demand for the banking group's paper totalled Pta445bn - slightly less than the Pta476bn at which the offer values the whole group. In Spain, where 61 per cent of the offering will be placed, domestic institutions and retail investors oversubscribed by 4.6 times. Demand in the retail tranche totalled Pta206bn against the Pta55.1bn offered. More than 370,000 small domestic investors applied for paper, which gives Argentaria the biggest share register of any Spanish banking institution. Argentaria shares will start trading in Madrid, New York and London on May 12. Analysts believe that a big proportion of the domestically held equity could eventually end up abroad. The issue has been globally co-ordinated by Morgan Stanley.</p>

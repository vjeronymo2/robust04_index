			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Pro Ned sold off to European headhunting company Pro Ned, the Bank of England-backed organisation which encourages the appointment of corporate non-executive directors, has been sold to a leading European headhunting firm and to its own management. The Bank, which has been the prime sponsor of Pro Ned along with the Confederation of British Industry, the Institutional Shareholders Committee and the London Stock Exchange among others, will no longer be involved in specific projects to improve the governance of UK companies. 'All of those broad areas of corporate governance we still believe in,' a Bank spokesman said. 'Achieving that goal through this particular organisation is less overwhelming than it was 10 or 12 years ago.' Egon Zehnder International, based in Zurich, is to be the new owner of Pro Ned along with the organisation's three managing directors. Sir Adrian Cadbury will remain as chairman for a further year but will not become a partner. Demand for independent non-executive directors on corporate boards has increased since the recommendations of a committee headed by Sir Adrian were released. The report suggested that each board have at least two non-executives independent of management. Last August, the Bank of England is said to have approached several executive search firms about a possible purchase of Pro Ned. Although Pro Ned has a high public profile because it has championed the cause of corporate governance, it has failed to market its search services as do commercial executive search firms. It has also suffered from the image of an inbred organisation. 'It has always been thought of as a 'jobs for the boys' organisation,' said one of its sponsors. The sponsors chose Egon Zehnder because it seemed to have the 'culture and fit' and had pledged to continue to promote a role for non-executive directors of UK and European companies. It will also maintain modest fees for small and medium-sized companies seeking independent non-executives. Observer, Page 19</p>

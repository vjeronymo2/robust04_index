			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Every picture tells a story: The CD-Rom revolution in computing The CD-Rom disc is beginning to transform the home personal computer market in much the way that its cousin, the digital compact disc, has come to dominate the music business. Their vast storage capacity - a CD-Rom disc can store about 650 megabytes of data, equivalent to 450 ordinary 3 1/2 ' floppy discs - makes them ideally suited for multimedia, the combination of digital text, video, still and moving images and sound. And a CD-Rom disc costs just pence to make. Multimedia machines with a CD-Rom drive, high-quality sound card, fast graphics and powerful microprocessors are leading the assault on the consumer market. Tumbling hardware prices have put multimedia PCs within the reach of most home PC buyers. As a result PCs equipped for multimedia have been among the hottest selling items this Christmas. According to IDC, the market research firm, about one in five PC systems in Europe includes a CD-Rom drive and growth is accelerating. 'The CD-Rom market in Europe started exploding in the second half of 1993,' says IDC, which estimates 4.5m CD-Rom drives will have been sold in Europe this year, up from 1.6m in 1993. The surge in CD-Rom drive sales has coincided with an explosion in the range of reference, entertainment and games titles available in CD-Rom format, and a dramatic improvement in software quality. In the early days of CD-Rom much of the software was criticised for being slow and unattractive. But innovations, such as the introduction of faster double-spin speed drives and higher-quality sound cards, have encouraged publishers, including Microsoft and Dorling Kindersley, to be more imaginative. Today there are thousands of discs available with prices ranging from less than Pounds 10 to several hundred pounds - or even thousands. But most software aimed at the home consumer market is priced between Pounds 25 and Pounds 70 - usually a modest premium over print-based equivalents. The encyclopedia is probably the archetypal CD-Rom product - entertaining, informative and helpful with homework. Indeed Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia is the benchmark for other CD-Roms. It includes the full text of a traditional 29-volume print encyclopedia, together with sound, photographs and graphics, interactive videos, animations, maps and an illustrated time line. It is as quick to use as a print encyclopedia and easier to jump from one subject to another. The latest version, Encarta 95, costs about Pounds 85 and was released last month. It has 26,000 articles and has been updated to include information on some of the latest news events - including the ceasefire in Northern Ireland. Despite its US origins, the articles easily meet the homework demands placed on it by most junior and secondary school children in Europe. Other encyclopedias worth considering include the New Grolier Encyclopedia and the new Hutchinson Encyclopedia '95, the only fully British multimedia encyclopedia, containing some 34,000 articles though in less depth and with fewer video and sound clips than Encarta. Red Shift provides 'a planetarium on your desktop' for Pounds 70. This award-winning space simulation includes over 700 photographs and takes the peruser on a voyage of discovery across the solar system. For ease of use and superb presentation, five new titles from Dorling Kindersley, the innovative British book publisher, are hard to beat. Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Science is a top-rated and brilliantly illustrated interactive disc containing 1,700 entries and aimed at children aged 10 and older. Like Encarta, this CD-Rom is good for answering basic homework questions, or simply browsing. Dorling Kindersley's other CD-Roms are also aimed at a younger audience, and include The Way Things Work and Incredible Cross-Sections which provides a fascinating multimedia tour of an 18th century man-of-war ship. The Ultimate Human Body features three-dimensional images, detailed micro-photography, animation and sounds. It includes an interactive journey through the body to discover what every part is called, where it is situated, what it looks like and how it functions. For a younger audience, My First Incredible Amazing Dictionary targets children aged four to seven, including those who cannot yet read or have never used a computer. This CD-Rom presents 1,000 words in context so children can see and hear how they are used in speech and writing. For older wordsmiths The Oxford English Dictionary is impressive on CD-Rom, with over 2.4m illustrative quotations, but it is costly at Pounds 495. For those with smaller wallets, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary is available for Pounds 50. Meanwhile Microsoft's Bookshelf 1994 includes the latest editions of seven - mostly US - reference works including word dictionary, dictionary of quotations, encyclopedia and atlas. Microsoft's rapidly expanding library of home multimedia titles also includes Ancient Lands and Microsoft Dinosaurs, which provides a tour of prehistoric life, as does Prehistoria, originated by Software Toolworks, which was renamed Mindscape after its acquisition this year by the Pearson Group, owner of the Financial Times. Other 'edutainment' CD-Roms for children include Interactive Storytime, also originated by Software Toolworks - three discs of interactive stories for children. In the US the hottest children's CD-Rom this Christmas is probably Disney's recently released Lion King, an interactive animated story-book based on the children's film. And Microsoft's Cinemania 95 is acknowledged as the definitive multimedia film guide. There is a wide range of CD-Rom titles covering the art world, including Cameron's Fine Art, 450 works from leading artists and photographers; Renaissance Masters, a two-disc series with 1,300 images on each title; and Exploring Modern Art, a tour of the Tate Gallery conducted by the senior curator. Serious Music buffs may be interested in CD-Roms covering the lives and works of great composers, which try to make the most of the CD-Rom's multimedia capabilities by combining music extracts with analysis of the works and the composer's life. Among these are Beethoven's 5th, Mozart: The Dissonant Quintet and Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring. For pop fans, Jump provides an insight into David Bowie's weird world while Peter Gabriel has produced an extraordinary CD-Rom featuring his music called Xplora 1. Anyone wanting to improve their chess game should try Chessmaster 4000, one of several sophisticated interactive chess games available on CD-Rom - a Pounds 40 package including superb graphics but which, like even the best CD-Rom package, complements a real board and human opponent, rather than substitutes for either. The audio CD has all but replaced its vinyl predecessor. Will the electronic book, in the form of a CD-Rom, have the same impact on its paper-based rival? Probably not, since text on screen is still much harder to read than print. Yet, as many new multimedia CD-Rom titles demonstrate, the combination of moving and still images, sound and text is a potent mix, particularly for the young. The growing list of publishers jumping aboard the CD-Rom bandwagon shows this is a new market not to be ignored.</p>

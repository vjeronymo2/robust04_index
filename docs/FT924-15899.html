			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / City leaders bemoan lack of clear policy BUSINESS and financial leaders in the UK warned yesterday that the absence of a coherent economic policy and Britain's potential isolation from Europe could damage the country's prospects for economic growth. As the latest tussle between the German and UK authorities simmered, industrialists and financiers urged the government to rid the country of uncertainty by adopting a clear economic strategy.  Some said that it would take a new chancellor of the exchequer to implement it. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, urged the government to make a clear commitment to the Maastricht agreement. One bank chairman, who refused to be named, said 'I am extremely concerned at the absence of an economic policy in the UK.' Mr David Lyon, chief executive of Bowater, the packaging and printing group, which has extensive activities in mainland Europe, said it was essential for the government to re-establish order in its management of exchange-rate policy. 'We want order and certainty. In the absence of that we have huge movements of cash swinging around the world not driven by trade but by people speculating in money. That volatility is hugely damaging,' he said. Mr Geoffrey Shingles, the UK head of Digital Equipment, the largest US minicomputer manufacturer, said he was angered and frustrated by the government's inability to bring down interest rates to a level which would help industry. The problems were a lack of stability and certainty compounded by interest rates which were delaying capital investment.

Mr Ken Schofield, chief executive of MTM, the chemicals group, said: 'The new row between the German and British authorities is the final nail in Mr Lamont's coffin. We need a new face who can make some difficult decisions.' Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, said 'Mr Lamont has to go if the government is to come up with a clear-cut statement on economic policy.' Another fear was that foreign companies could become nervous about investing in a country whose position and influence in Europe was questionable. 'The fact that we are seen to be unstable and isolated cannot help prospects for inward investment and future business links with Europe,' said Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank in London. Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, warned that any uncertainty about Britain's future in the EC would make it much harder to attract investors to the UK. 'Our biggest selling point in east Asia and the US is our position inside the single market of 350m customers,' he said. 'Any doubt about that would weaken our attraction.'</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISLAND REMEMBRANCES  </P> <P> Who is Payne? I turned to the Travel Section and read about two Irishmen  gabbing in the middle of the night on the Isle of Jersey, instead of glancing  at dry facts on the sights and hotel rates. That's what we all dream about when  traveling -- getting close to the locals. And that seldom happens. So keep  Payne at work, leading the life we dream of.  </P> <P> CHARLES AINSWORTH  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

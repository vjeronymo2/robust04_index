			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Women's share of public jobs rises 2% An estimated 40 per cent of appointments to public bodies made by ministers during the past 12 months have gone to women, it was announced yesterday by the Cabinet Office. Mr William Waldegrave, the minister responsible for public services, said the rise was a welcome improvement. 'This . . . demonstrates our continuing efforts to ensure women can play their proper part in our public life,' he said. Women now make up 28.2 per cent or 12,007 of the mainly part-time and unpaid posts on public bodies. The posts include health authorities, industrial and rent assessment tribunals and consumer organisations. This represents a 2 per cent increase since September last year. Mr John Major, the prime minister, wants to see women make up between a third and a half of all public-service appointments. At present about 35 per cent of the 5,000-strong list of people seen as 'suitable for appointments at national and local level' are women. The Cabinet Office also disclosed yesterday that 2.3 per cent of public appointments are held by ethnic minorities - a rise of 0.3 per cent over the previous 12 months. At present an estimated 5 per cent of the economically active population are members of ethnic minorities. The government aims to increase the number of people from ethnic minorities in public-service appointments so that it 'more closely reflects' their contribution to national life.</p>

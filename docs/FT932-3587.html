			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / 'Rattle Pepsi can before sipping' The president of a regional Pepsi bottler urged cola drinkers to rattle their cans before taking a sip after a second can of Diet Pepsi was found to contain a hypodermic needle, touching off a federal criminal probe, Reuter reports from Seattle. Mr Carl Behnke, president of the regional Pepsi bottler Alpac, said that preliminary Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laboratory tests revealed no contamination but urged consumers to inspect soda cans carefully. Mr Behnke said the FDA had not advised it to recall its products, but it had opened a free consumer hotline.</p>

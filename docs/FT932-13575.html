			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Money Markets: Euromarks fall sharply GERMAN interest rate futures fell sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank's latest figures for money supply growth were higher than the market had expected, writes James Blitz. German M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 3.2 per cent in March after contracting by 0.3 per cent in the previous month. The March figure contrasted with economists' expectations of a 1 per cent rise in M3. A particular concern for the market was the growth in German bank lending, which showed a rise of 9 per cent when annualised over the last six months. When the Bundesbank cut its discount rate at its last council meeting in March, the low level for this figure was cited as one of the reasons for easing policy. Yesterday's data served to underline that an easing in the discount rate at today's council meeting was unlikely. There was little reason for dealers to be bullish about rate cuts following the week's money market operations by the German central bank. As expected, repo funds were offered to commercial banks at a minimum rate of 8.09 per cent, 2 basis points down from the previous level. However, an injection of DM5.8bn helped to push call money below the repo rate level, to 8.07 per cent. All this data added up to a downbeat day for German futures contracts. The June contract declined 5 basis points on the day to close at 92.63. The September contract fell even more heavily, finishing 14 basis points down on the day at 93.39. At this level the market is looking for 129 basis points off three-month money in the next five months. French franc interest rates were affected by the German news. One-month French francs rose sharply from 8.62 per cent to 9.25 per cent, and three-month French francs rose from about 8.25 per cent to about 8.7 per cent. Sterling markets were slightly affected by the news from Germany which implied that it might be difficult for the UK to bring down short-term interest rates. The June short sterling contract dipped 3 basis points to close at 93.95. However, three-month sterling cash was unchanged at around 6 per cent. The Bank of England forecast a large shortage of Pounds 1.9bn, which pushed the overnight rate up to a peak of 7.5 per cent at one stage.</p>

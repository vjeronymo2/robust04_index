			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: PROSTATE PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Question: If someone has an enlarged prostate, won't there come a time when he  will have to have an operation? And if that's the case, wouldn't it be better  for that person to have the operation and get it over with, rather than  waiting?  </P> <P> Answer: Surgery for an enlarged prostate may not be inevitable.  </P> <P> The results of one study showed that of more than 100 men who had symptoms of  benign prostatic hyperplasia, only 10 had opted for surgery during the  following five years. Moreover, of those men who did not have an operation  during this period, most felt their symptoms improved.  </P> <P> Q: From talking with other mothers, I've become convinced that most ear  infections in children happen during the winter months. Is there any logical  reason for this? Since the ears are exposed all year-round, what difference  does the time of year make in regard to the possibility of an ear infection?  </P> <P> A: Ear infections in children can and do occur throughout the year; however,  children tend to have more colds and upper respiratory infections during the  winter. According to Dr. Richard Layton, an expert on pediatric allergy, when  children have more colds, the possibility of ear infection increases.  </P> <P> If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184,  Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. He cannot give personal replies but will answer as  many questions as possible in his column.  </P></p>

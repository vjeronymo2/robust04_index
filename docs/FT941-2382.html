			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / World Bond Markets: Decoupling from US yet to take place - Capital &amp; Credit The latest sell-off in the world's bond markets at the end of last week showed plainly that a definitive 'decoupling' of European bonds from the US market has yet to take place. The sharpest falls in European bonds came on Friday as US bond prices tumbled on the news that Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had been summoned to the White House by President Bill Clinton. But European bond markets looked vulnerable even before the latest panic over US interest rate movements. The economic fundamentals still point to further rate cuts in Europe - but the lesson of the last two months has been that economic fundamentals are not enough to drive markets. 'We spent most of the week pushing the market up gently, then it was another classic Thursday and Friday, with no rate cut (from the German Bundesbank) and interest rate uncertainty in the US. The worrying thing is that there is just nothing on the horizon to entice any buyers back into the market,' said the head of trading at one London house. There are, on the other hand, plenty of things to worry about, as the market started churning out rumours - that Mr Greenspan plans to resign; that several large gilt market-makers are unloading large loss-making positions; that Japanese fund managers are poised to dump bonds and buy equities when they return to the market at the start of their new financial year in April. The short-term outlook in the US seems to be for more pain, with many traders now hoping the Fed will raise rates by half a point this week, rather than prolong the agony with small,  1/4 point hikes. In fact, many dealers are now cursing the Fed's failure to act more firmly first time round. 'The Fed is now in a no-win situation: if they don't tighten next Tuesday, people will think the administration is running monetary policy and that there will be a tendency to keep rates low, allowing inflation to rise. And if they hike by  1/4 point, people will say the Fed's move has been moderated by the administration,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International. Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg believes that people would prefer a bigger rate hike: 'That would mean 'that's it for the time being' and would calm inflationary fears.' European monetary authorities also find themselves in rather a tight spot. 'Everyone thought that dollar weakness would eventually help, giving more room to lower rates in Europe whatever happens in the US, but that has not happened.' European markets are also becoming weighed down by supply worries, he says, describing last week's French BTAN (short-dated government bond) auction as disappointing. The German market, which has, it seems, partially decoupled from the US, continues to outperform other markets, despite weakness at the long end. Mr Kokko expects a 'fairly big repo cut of five to 10 basis points' this week. The previous repo rate was set at 5.88 per cent but the call money rate has fallen to 5.75 per cent. The gilts market, meanwhile, has fared particularly poorly, as the UK market is more closely linked to the US - perhaps logically, since the UK is ahead of continental Europe, and therefore closer to follow the US in raising interest rates. The yield spread between 10-year gilts and Bunds has almost doubled, from 62 basis points a month ago to 114 basis points late Friday. However, selling is still concentrated in the futures rather than cash markets. Dealers said that some investors who had sold futures to hedge cash positions several weeks ago had returned to the market to buy back their short position too early, and the market weakness at the end of last week forced further futures selling. 'Conventional fund managers are reducing their overweight positions in bonds into (market) strength,' said Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier's London-based fund management arm. 'We knew that would be a problem for the market on the way up, but it has happened very quickly.' Fund managers are also shortening the duration of their bond holdings, because the short end of the market is generally considered safer, and likely to benefit most from rate cuts when they come. 'We have done a little bit of shortening using structured medium-term notes with embedded swaps,' said Mr Abberley. The notes have a redemption value based on one-year German, French and Italian swap rates. 'We still like the 10-year end of the market but, risk-adjusted, the short end looks better,' Mr Abberley said. While a German rate cut would undoubtedly help get the market moving again, many fund managers now feel that they need to rebalance their portfolios, shifting away from bonds. 'Lots of fund managers are going into their quarterly meetings and deciding that, at least for the moment, cash is king again,' said one trader.</p>

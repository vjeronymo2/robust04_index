			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON DISABLED RIGHTS;  </P> <P> FIVE-INCH MOUNTAIN IN THE CAPITOL;  </P> <P> EVEN IN THE SEAT OF STATE GOVERNMENT, A GUY IN A WHEELCHAIR CAN'T FIND A  PROPERLY EQUIPPED BATHROOM.  </P> <P> My intention was to observe a Sacramento protest demonstration by my fellow  disabled people against the recent Deukmejian budget proposal. I had driven all  night from Los Angeles to keep the heat from further disabling me and my aging  van. I found a blue-curb spot outside the Capitol, dropped the wheelchair lift  and headed for some breakfast in the cafeteria in the cellar.  </P> <P> Officer Israel of the State Police confided to me in the rotunda that the  disabled had demonstrated every week for the last three weeks -- about 40 the  first two weeks and about 80 the week before. "They're all very nice. We just  push their wheelchairs out and they don't resist." He paused, then added,  "Nothing like the farm workers. When they came, they really tore up the place."  </P> <P> Soon I was ready to tear up the place myself.  </P> <P> All a wanted to do was use a toilet. But many years after the passage of access  laws, and after an enormously expensive renovation of the Capitol, the only  thing changed was that the doors were wide enough to get in with a wheelchair.  The pressure needed to open the door was just as vault-like as in the old days,  though regulations had long called for a two-thirds reduction. The mirror,  dispensers, sinks -- and most important, the toilets -- were at traditional  levels. As I transferred from my wheelchair to the toilet seat, I knew I was in  for trouble.  </P> <P> The legal regulations call for handicapped toilets 19 inches high -- level with  most wheelchair seats. Additionally, many of us use heavy, sophisticated  cushions to prevent pressure sores, adding to the wheelchair height. These  Capitol toilet seats were less than 14 inches high. Supercrip Mark Wellman may  climb El Capitan with his arms, but many of us power-wheelchair users do not  have the strength to raise ourselves five inches up and then swing to the side.  I was trapped. I could not get off the toilet seat.  </P> <P> I struggled. I tried every angle, every leverage point. I wanted to tear out  those bars supposedly installed to help the disabled. They hemmed me in and  kept me from getting the angle I needed. They were installed at the standard  height for a high toilet seat. Only a double-jointed hyena could use the bars  to help here.  </P> <P> Finally, dripping with sweat, I began dismantling my wheelchair. I carefully  removed the arm with the power control, laying it on the floor. I removed the  pedals. I removed the heavy cushion and propped it against the wall. I put the  brakes on.  </P> <P> A final effort got one cheek on the seat of the wheelchair. Reassembling the  chair and getting the cushion under me involved another herculean effort.  </P> <P> As I washed my hands, wiping the sweat from the face I could barely see in the  high mirror, I wondered when genuine, material, equal opportunity would arrive  for the millions of disabled people who are manufactured each year in our  factories and on our highways, shot in our slums, overdosed in our suburbs, or  simply invaded by the wrong virus. Here in the Capitol of the state alleged to  be the leader in progress for the disabled, a disabled person still cannot go  to the toilet without contortionist efforts.  </P> <P> Later, as I watched the sweating handful of California's disabled gather to  protest funding cuts proposed by the governor, I couldn't help questioning the  focus of the demonstration leaders. They were trying to save a group of  independent-living centers designed to serve the disabled. As worthy as these  agencies may be -- and their effectiveness is profoundly questioned by many  disabled -- the money at issue is a piddling $5 million out of cuts of  thousands of millions. With such narrow, self-serving leadership, is it any  wonder that the Capitol toilets are still unusable by many disabled people,  decades after regulations requiring access?  </P> <P> Maybe what the disabled need is a militant union and a leader from among them  like Cesar Chavez. I hear that before he came alog, farm workers, too, didn't  have toilets to use when they were out working in the field.  </P> <P> That night, as I headed west in search of a cool place to sleep in the van, I  couldn't help but wonder at how little had changed in California. The governor  and Legislature seem to be once again in the hands of the robber barons. Even  the initiative process introduced by the reformer Hiram Johnson seems to be in  their grasp. And here I was, just trying to find a cool Target or K-Mart  parking lot where the cops wouldn't hassle me for sleeping in a 10-year-old van  with 105,000 miles on it.  </P></p>

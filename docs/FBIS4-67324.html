			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Charles Pasqua: `Crime Spiral </F> Broken'"]    [Text] "France has stopped the increase in the crime rate,  which has been rising almost continually over previous years,"  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua told members of the National  Assembly yesterday as part of the government address on  security. The following are the main points of his speech.  <H5>  Statistics </H5>   According to Mr. Pasqua, from April 1993 to March 1994, the  overall increase in crimes and misdemeanors in metropolitan  France "was a mere 0.47 percent." Mentioning as an example car  thefts and crimes on the public highway, he explained that the  former "fell by 3.1 percent" while the latter "increased by a  modest 1.1 percent." Furthermore, and "this is the first time it  happens in 20 years, violent thefts went down 0.12 percent," he  indicated. Mr. Pasqua said these figures were "encouraging if  one looks at the 34 percent overall increase in crime in the  years 1989-1992, a figure that reaches 54 percent for crime on  the public highway and even 67 percent for armed robberies." In  his view, this means that "the spiral is conclusively broken."  <H5>  Drugs </H5>   Drug trafficking "decreased by four percent" over the last  12  months. To demonstrate "intensive police activity," Charles  Pasqua indicated that 6,070 dealers, 55 percent of whom were  foreigners, and 6,289 users-dealers had been arrested and  subjected to legal proceedings. Last, "for the first time in  France in 10 years, there was a decline in deaths by overdose:  454 compared with 499."</p>

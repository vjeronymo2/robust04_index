			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: GREAT BALLS OF . . . HYPE  </P> <P> Sources tell us that Orion Pictures plans to spend more than $10 million on  "media buys" (TV and print ads), a glitzy PR junket and premiere parties to  launch its Jerry Lee Lewis musical bio, "Great Balls of Fire" (it opens in  1,200 theaters on June 30). That's more than half the amount of the film's  budget.  </P> <P> Charles O. Glenn, exec marketing veep, admitted, "It's a multi-million-dollar  campaign, without question." The "Great Balls" hoopla kicks off June 13, when  Jer Lee gets a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. (Ceremonies are set for  12:30 p.m. at 6631 Hollywood Blvd.) Then:  </P> <P> * A PR junket in Memphis for 300 film and music reporters, June 15-18.  </P> <P> * A June 26 world premiere at NYC's restored 1,300-seat Ziegfeld Theater, with  a post-party at The Ritz. Star Dennis Quaid and The Killer will make the  eight-block journey in a '59 Caddy convertible.  </P> <P> * A glitzy L.A. media/VIP screening on June 29 at the Director's Guild,  followed by a bash at the Hard Rock Cafe. Jer Lee may perform.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the new "Great Balls" single -- by Jer Lee and Quaid -- is getting  airplay and the video has just hit MTV.  </P></p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Donbass coal miners defiant UKRAINIAN government officials failed at the weekend to reach agreement with miners from the Donbass region who have called a general strike for February 25 over demands for higher wages and further subsidies to the coal industry. Resisting the miners' demands is crucial if the Ukrainian government is to fulfil its pledge to bring the budget deficit down from last year's 44 per cent of GNP. However, failing to appease the Russian-dominated region could strengthen separatist tendencies and that may be a political price Kiev is unwilling to pay. Mr Iuri Ioffe, deputy prime minister with responsibility for the energy sector, said on Friday that the government would not bow to pressure from the miners. 'The strike leaders tell the workers that they should put down their tools because the government will always find money for the Donbass,' said Mr Ioffe, a former director of a coal mine. 'But I tell you now, this government has no money left.' Mr Ioffe said that the disturbances were being provoked by the managers of the mines, whose salaries were slashed in December by as much as 90 per cent after a government commission discovered that mine directors were paying themselves up to 100 times the average Ukrainian wage. The confrontation comes at a time when Ukraine is facing a severe energy crisis triggered by Russia's decision to supply oil at only one-third of traditional levels. To help make up the short-fall, Ukraine is pursuing vigorous negotiations with Iran. On a visit to Kiev last week the Iranian energy minister said his country will supply Ukraine with 4m tonnes of oil this year.</p>

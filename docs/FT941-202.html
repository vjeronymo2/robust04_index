			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Hopes rise for agreeing nuclear test ban treaty A comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty (CTBT) could be completed by early 1995, according to Mr Miguel Marin-Bosch, chairman of the United Nations negotiating committee, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. He said yesterday that the negotiations, which began in January, had made faster progress than expected and he hoped for an initial draft treaty text by late spring. A treaty was 'do-able in a relatively short time of 12-18 months', he added, enabling it to be finished just before or just after the April 1995 conference on extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. A number of developing nations have made a CTBT a condition of their agreeing to an indefinite extension of the NPT. Mr Marin-Bosch, Mexico's ambassador to the UN Disarmament Conference in Geneva, said there seemed to be broad agreement for the treaty 'to ban all tests in all environments for all time'. This would include so-called 'peaceful' nuclear explosions as well as nuclear weapons tests, though the possibility of exceptions was being discussed. The treaty would contain extensive verification measures and provisions for economic sanctions against those violating the ban. There was universal support for a CTBT despite 'varying degrees of enthusiasm', Mr Marin-Bosch went on. China, which is still testing atomic weapons despite a moratorium by the other four declared nuclear powers, has said it will not test after 1995. More than 2,000 nuclear tests have been carried out since the second world war, equivalent to one a week, the majority by the US and the former Soviet Union.</p>

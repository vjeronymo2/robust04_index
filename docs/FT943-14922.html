			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / International Company News: Weak prices behind dip in Alcoa of Australia profit Net profit at Alcoa of Australia, the integrated aluminium company, almost halved in the six months to June, reflecting lower sale prices and a stronger Australian currency. The company - part of a merger proposal between its two largest shareholders, Aluminium Company of America and Western Mining Corporation, the Australian mining group - yesterday reported a decline in earnings to ADollars 124.7m (USDollars 91.60m) from ADollars 258.4m. Total revenue fell 7.7 per cent, to ADollars 1.00bn from ADollars 1.09bn. The company reduced its total dividend payout to ADollars 120m from ADollars 180m and its capital expenditure to ADollars 63.2m from ADollars 85.2m in the half-year. Directors said production cuts at the group's smelters caused lower sales of aluminium ingots, and gold sales volumes were hit by lower ore grades. But production costs were lower and sales volumes increased for both alumina and chemicals. The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 63.8m, down from ADollars 100.8m previously, and depreciation of ADollars 76.8m, against ADollars 73.4m last time. The previous year's result included a ADollars 59.7m abnormal tax gain. Meanwhile, Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, saw earnings rise to Dollars 45.4m, or 50 cents a share, in the second quarter as the company gained from cost-cutting and a steady rise in aluminium prices. Earnings amounted to Dollars 35.3m, or 40 cents a share, in the comparable 1993 quarter. The company, which is the world's biggest aluminium group, said sales rose to Dollars 2.5bn in the quarter, up slightly from Dollars 2.4bn a year ago. The revenue increase came despite a slight drop in aluminium shipments, which fell to 661,000 tonnes from 670,000 tonnes in the same 1993 quarter. For the first six months, Alcoa made a net loss of Dollars 62.9m, or 72 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 4.7bn. The company fell heavily into the red in the first quarter when charges relating to production cuts were taken.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> From Overseas: West German film director Wim Wenders will replace American  Francis Coppola as president of the Cannes Film Festival jury May 11-23.  Coppola changed his plans because of "professional commitments." Wenders won  the festival's Golden Palm Award for best film in 1984 for "Paris, Texas." . .  . In Rome, Gina Lollobrigida, Nino Manfredi, Raf Vallone and other Italian  screen stars have launched a campaign to reduce the growing number of foreign  actors used in Italian films. "We have to defend ourselves, they do it in other  countries, why not here?" Lollobrigida said at a meeting of the Union of  Italian Actors. Italian directors often dub actors' voices after the film is  shot, making it easy to use foreign actors. "The difference between a foreign  actor who comes to Italy and the Italian actor who goes abroad is that the  Italian must speak the language of that country," Vallone said. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hoare Govett seeks Pounds 50m for small companies trust HOARE GOVETT is attempting to raise Pounds 50m for an investment trust which will track its smaller companies index. A total of 50m shares at 100p each are available via a combined offer for subscription and placing. Firm commitments to apply for 19.74m shares have already been received. The extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding investment trusts) contained 1,377 companies at the start of 1992 and was capitalised at about Pounds 45bn. The index then included companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 216m or less. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index Investment Trust will own shares in more than 200 companies, with no individual stock likely to comprise more than 2 per cent of its portfolio. It will aim to match the performance of the index in both capital and dividend yield terms. The manager will be Broadgate Investment Management, a subsidiary of Hoare Govett, which will charge an annual fee of 1 per cent. The 'smaller company effect' was widely trumpeted in the 1980s, with Hoare Govett noting that its index had substantially outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index over the period since 1955. However, the recession has hit smaller companies particularly hard and Hoare's index underperformed the All-Share in each of the years from 1989 to 1991 (and to date in 1992). This has been the first time since 1955 in which smaller companies underperformed for three successive calendar years. Expenses of the offer will be 4.6 per cent if the minimum of Pounds 25m is raised and 4.2 per cent at the maximum of Pounds 50m. Applications for a minimum of 1,000 shares must be made by December 7, with dealings expected to start on December 14.</p>

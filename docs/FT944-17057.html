			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Berlusconi to act on report Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italian prime minister, yesterday promised speedy introduction of legislation to prevent a conflict of interest with his ownership of Fininvest, Italy's second largest private business group. A report by three jurists, commissioned by Mr Berlusconi in May, last weekend recommended a special conflict of interest law. Making his first comment since receiving the report, the premier hinted he was not entirely happy with it. 'It seems to me the solution found is tough and inflexible, more inflexible than in other countries,' he said. The jurists said Mr Berlusconi could not to be forced to divest ownership of Fininvest; but he would have to consider either voluntary divestiture or appointment of a trustee while he held office. By committing himself to early legislation, Mr Berlusconi appeared anxious to resolve the issue quickly. Since gaining office five months ago, he has consistently encountered problems created by his inability to distance himself from his ownership of a business empire which spans television, films, publishing, chain stores and financial services. The senate began debating the report yesterday, as government members argued for prior agreement on the legislation to ensure a swift passage through parliament.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 13 May (NOTIMEX) -- A meeting called by the  government to remove the director of the Ecuadoran Social  Security Institute [IESS] turned violent today, sparking street  disturbances that resulted in 18 people being injured and a  minister being detained by workers.    Social Welfare Minister Alberto Cardenas was detained at the  IESS headquarters by angry union leaders and workers who  demanded his resignation. Cardenas presided over the meeting of  IESS officials which culminated at noon with the removal of IESS  Director General Italo Colamarco, accused of corruption and  incompetence.    While the two-hour meeting was being held, hundreds of IESS  employees clashed in the streets of Quito with the police who,  according to reporters, resorted to a "brutal repression." The  clashes occurred in streets near the Zarzuela building in  northern Quito, headquarters of the IESS General Directorate and  Higher Council, which sustained heavy damage.    Despite the presence of a large number of police, a group of  IESS labor leaders and employees entered the building and  reached the meeting room. They interrupted the meeting in which  Jose Maria Aguirre, a close friend of the Ecuadoran president,  was being sworn in as the new IESS director and seized the  social welfare minister. Amid the confusion and the arguments  with the government representatives in the Higher Council, the  leaders demanded that Minister Cardenas submit his resignation.  The minister replied he was willing to resign and "go home" if  the IESS union leadership did the same and resigned immediately.    Meanwhile, the street disturbances continued. The police  used  tear gas to control the demonstrators "with excessive force."  The demonstrators responded by throwing sticks and rocks.  According to reporters and union leaders, the incidents left at  least 18 injured, some from firearms, and many persons under  arrest. The Red Cross reported that the injured included two  local reporters and a cameraman who were hit by rocks and blunt  objects.    The crisis in the IESS leadership intensified this week when  Minister Cardenas and Colamarco accused each other of  incompetence and corruption. The new scandal in the IESS led to  Colamarco's removal. He was the fifth director in 21 months in  the administration of conservative President Sixto Duran-Ballen.  Cardenas, who took office as minister in January, said the  removed official was an obstacle to the modernization and  reorganization of the IESS.    Union leaders say that Cardenas and the government are  undertaking a campaign to discredit the IESS workers to bring  about its bankruptcy and justify its privatization.</p>

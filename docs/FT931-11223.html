			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: No extra money to ease EC reforms THE EUROPEAN Community's new agriculture commissioner, Mr Rene Steichen, warned yesterday there would be no extra money to meet the wish-lists of European farm organisations in the wake of last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Mr Steichen was presenting price proposals for the coming farming year, which were approved by the European Commission yesterday after barely 15 minutes of procedural discussion. This unaccustomed speed was because the prices of the main commodities were predetermined by last year's reform of the CAP, which embodies heavy price cuts over the next three years, for which farmers will be compensated in direct income payments. Most products outside the reform will have their prices rolled over from last year. The CAP will cost some Ecu35.1bn (Pounds 29m) this year, up over Ecus3bn, and Mr Steichen warned that 'room for manoeuvre as far as additional demands are concerned is virtually non-existent'. He cited the cost of financing the reform, and a tighter farm spending ceiling because of lower-than-expected EC growth, as two reasons for fiscal stringency. But he also implicitly blamed EC farm ministers for overriding commission recommendations and retaining the costly 'switchover' mechanism. This gives price increases to most farmers each time an EC currency is devalued, leading to price rises of over 20 per cent in the past six years. After the last six months of currency turbulence, the commission estimates that 'switchover' will cost Ecus1.15bn this year and Ecus1.55bn in 1994. Yesterday's message was particularly unwelcome in Paris. The French government, facing defeat in next month's general assembly elections, was hoping for additional concessions for its farmers to sugar the pill of the CAP reform, and the controversial cuts in subsidised exports the EC will have to make under the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation negotiations if these are concluded this year. Copa, the EC big farm lobby, denounced the price proposals as 'an additional burden on European farmers'. Price cuts under the CAP reform will fall most heavily on cereals, which commission officials say could come down by as much as 22 per cent on this year's market, on their way to a reduction of about a third over three years. This cut is supposed to be distributed more evenly over the three years, but adjustments to the intervention regime and changing standards between different types of grain will reduce prices faster, officials say. The main battleground when farm ministers meet here next week is likely to be the proposed reduction in the milk quota. This should be of 2 per cent spread over 1993-94, but is controversial because Italy, which produces an illicit 2.5m tonnes over its quota, is likely to get an extra 900,000 tonnes provided it reduces the rest.</p>

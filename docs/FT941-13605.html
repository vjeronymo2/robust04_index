			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / People: BZW's new managing director BZW Asset Management (BZWAM), principally known for its index fund management expertise, is hoping to promote another side of its investment activities, through the promotion of 37-year-old Jane Platt, right. In charge of business development for the the whole of BZWAM since 1988, Platt moves into the new position of managing director responsible for equity investment management, looking after and developing funds currently amounting to around Pounds 16bn. BZWAM chief executive Donald Brydon says it has been 'very frustrating' that his group's reputation has been almost exclusively confined to index fund management when Pounds 16bn of a total of Pounds 42bn are managed in an active style. 'We have never classed (active equity management) as a separate business, it has hitherto just been a function,' says Brydon. The other three business areas are fixed income, headed by Celia Cull; quantitative management, with James Woodlock in charge; and property, run by Iain Reid. Brydon adds that since 1986, funds under management at BZWAM have grown to Pounds 42bn from Pounds 6bn. He specifically credits Platt with helping to achieve that rate of expansion, as well as highlighting her contribution to the group's investment business in France and Spain. Platt moved to BZW from Mercury Asset Management. Earlier in her career she had previously also worked for Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management.</p>

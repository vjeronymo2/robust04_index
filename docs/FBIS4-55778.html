			<p>BFN     [Text]) In an open letter published in several dailies of  19 May Ioan Stoica, owner of the Caritas money-spinning scheme,  has announced the closing of the game. Parading self-assurance,  Ioan Stoica says that work is going on "on the overall accounts  of the scheme," which, once completed, will allow him to give  "details on the normal way of shutting it down in all localities  where the company has subsidiaries." Without being overly  explicit about the way how he will pay back the investors'  money, Ioan Stoica says in his letter: "I promise I will do  everything in my power to close this scheme in such a way as to  satisfy every person."    The Caritas owner blames the failure of the scheme on the  press, terming it "that important force that has savagely hit  the Caritas." Caritas was started more than two years ago, in  Brasov, as a limited commercial company, including in its  activities also the pyramid money-spinning scheme which Stoica  calls "financial mutual-aid circuit for charity purposes."  Briefly, the scheme functioned like this: Intensely  advertised, Caritas promised investors they would be able to  collect eightfold the initial deposit after three months.  Cluj-Napoca was the city where Caritas took on unsuspected  proportions soon. The well advertised success of the first  months turned the Caritas into a genuine social phenomenon.  Chain-letter schemes of the kind mushroomed soon all over the  country, with unscrupulous "enterprisers" cheating an impressive  number of investors. Sooner or later, all ended up in courts of  law. The longest-lived has been precisely the one that started  this wide-scale scheme: Caritas. After being forbidden by  court decision to open a subsidiary in Bucharest, the scheme  became undesirable in almost all counties of Romania.    The catastrophic failure of the money-spinning schemes,  finally disclosed as a tremendous nation-wide fraud, also  induced a concrete parliamentary reaction: the promotion of a  bill to ban them.    The Caritas also fuelled fierce political duels between the  Romanian National Unity Party leader Gheorghe Funar and the  Democratic Party/National Salvation Front leader Petre Roman,  each blaming the other for having backed Ioan Stoica's  "initiative." The press assesses that the Caritas' victims  count some four million. It is hard to predict how this big  scandal will end.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting advances 19% - Shares fall 7p as weaker current trading conditions are reported London Forfaiting Company, the specialist trade finance house, yesterday reported profits up 19 per cent to Pounds 21.5m in the year to December 31 1993. The shares dropped 7p to close at 226p following a warning of poorer trading conditions so far this year compared with the same period last year. Mr Jack Wilson, chief executive, said trading for the first few weeks of 1994 had been 'less favourable' than in 1993 but that it was too early to make 'useful comments about the year as a whole'. He refused to say how significant the difference was but explained that the shortfall primarily reflected a bunching of completed deals a year earlier. 'We are very pleased with the results,' said Mr Wilson. A final dividend of 6.1p (5.5p) is recommended, making a total for the year up 10.7 per cent to 9.3p (8.4p). Earnings per share advanced to 16.15p (13.75p). The company said that Mr Ooi Boon Aun, managing director of LFC Far East, who is based in Hong Kong, had joined the main board. It said it had also established London Forfaiting International, a UK subsidiary, during the year to act as holding company for its overseas subsidiaries. It also said it had strengthened its trading team and administrative systems, and created a co-ordination department. 'We are in the process of going from being a large small company to a small large company,' said Mr Wilson. Bank loans more than trebled from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 71.1m during the year, while bank interest payable jumped from Pounds 932,000 to Pounds 2.39m. Interest receivable and income from certificates of deposit dropped from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 1.96m. The warning of a slower start to this year caused the City to shave its forecasts. At best, LFC is likely to produce only a modest increase in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 23m.</p>

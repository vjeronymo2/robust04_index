			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Belgrade, Feb 27 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic expressed fear on Sunday that no  peaceful motives stood behind the pressures on the Bosnian  Moslems and Croats to renew their alliance. In a statement to  the Kragujevac radio, Jovanovic warned that a strategy of  forming an alliance between the two Bosnian peoples against the  third (Bosnian Serbs) would lead to further escalation of the  crisis and the continuation of war.    The Yugoslav foreign minister lent support to any effort  towards narrowing differences between any of two peoples in the  former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, except those  motived by the formation of alliance against a third people.    Jovanovic said he was confident that on the Croat side those  forces interested in peace are stronger than those which would  like to seek their chance in some new war adventure.    At the initiative of Washington, the talks between Croatia,  the Bosnian Croats and Moslems on a common Bosnian Croat-Moslem  state opened on Saturday. [passage omitted]</p>

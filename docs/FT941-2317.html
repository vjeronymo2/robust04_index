			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / India-Pakistan row flares: Consulate general closed in Bombay Pakistan has closed its consulate general in Bombay in a move which is likely to inflame its diplomatic conflict with India. Pakistani officials accused India of making it impossible for the consulate to function by refusing to grant Pakistan the use of Jinnah House - the Bombay home of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's independence leader and first governor-general. The move follows weeks of public argument between the two countries over the troubled north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, part of which is claimed by Pakistan. Pakistan earlier this month failed in a high-profile attempt to persuade the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva to send a fact-finding mission to Kashmir. Pakistan argued that Indian security forces were committing atrocities against the mainly Moslem population of the Kashmir valley but it failed to secure sufficient support from other countries. Diplomats in Delhi are concerned that the decision to close the Bombay consulate general, which opened only in August 1992, may start a series of damaging diplomatic actions by the government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Indian officials, delighted with Pakistan's debacle in Geneva, are keen to prevent the 'internationalisation' of the Kashmir troubles, which Delhi treats primarily as a domestic security problem. But they also want to keep foreign countries informed of India's views on the troubles, notably that Kashmiri Moslem insurgents are supplied with arms and advisers from Pakistan. Indian officials will have an opportunity to present their case to two US officials who are visiting India - Ms Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of state responsible for south Asia, who arrives on a four-day trip tomorrow, and Mr Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary, who is due to visit next month. Mr Talbott will go to Pakistan.</p>

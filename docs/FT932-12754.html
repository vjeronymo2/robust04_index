			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Business and the Law: Insurers search for some cover - The IRA's latest bombing in the City of London may force the government to speed up legislation to insure property against terrorist action The IRA bomb in the City of London at the weekend has underlined the urgency of introducing as swiftly as possible the government-backed scheme for insuring commercial property against terrorist bomb damage. Last December - 10 months after the IRA's first big bomb in the City which caused an estimated Pounds 350m damage - the government agreed to act as 'reinsurer of last resort'. But legislation to bring the scheme into operation has yet to be presented to parliament. Until it is, the insurance industry must continue to rely on Department of Trade and Industry assurances that it will pick up the bill for terrorist-inflicted damage. Pool Re, the mutual reinsurance company set up by the insurance industry to manage the proposed terrorism fund, began collecting monies for the pool in January. But the estimated Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m cost of repairs arising from Saturday's bomb in Bishopsgate will more than exhaust the premium income collected so far, leaving the government and the insurance industry (which has agreed to bear 10 per cent of the excess reinsurance costs) to stump up as much as Pounds 200m. With Pool Re's existing funds likely to be absorbed by claims from the weekend bombing, the government will have to bear the bulk of the cost of any further IRA attacks on mainland Britain this year. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) called at the weekend for the legislation to enact Pool Re to be brought forward from its planned implementation date in mid-May. However, there are still several problems with the scheme itself which remain to be resolved before the enabling legislation can be introduced. Many of the scheme's details remain sketchy. Property owners and insurance purchasers, who welcomed the government's earlier decision to fill the gap created when the insurers own reinsurers withdrew support for terrorism cover last November, have expressed doubts about Pool Re's viability. Under the proposed scheme participating insurance companies and syndicates would all charge the same level of premium for cover against terrorism; premiums would be determined by factors such as the sum insured and the location of the property. The premiums would go into a pool to be managed by Pool Re and would be used to meet all claims up to an amount equal to the reinsurance company's annual premium income; the government would reinsure most claims in excess of that amount. Beyond this little is known about how the scheme would operate. No one, for example, seems sure about the size of the pool. The government expects the pool to attract about Pounds 500m a year in premium income; the ABI is less optimistic, suggesting a pool of Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m. After Saturday's bomb that figure looks woefully inadequate. So how can the size of the fund be increased? Should it be compulsory to purchase additional cover against terrorism possibly through the imposition of a standard levy on all commercial insurance policies? And what would happen to the pool if no claims were made during a particular year. Would companies receive a contributions holiday the following year? If there are no claims who would share in the profits? These questions are typical of the concerns voiced by the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce (AIRMIC). At a recent AIRMIC conference, members (companies which buy their own insurance on the market) raised several serious reservations about the scheme: the heavy cost of administering quotations; the unclear position of captive insurance companies set up offshore by companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries to insure their own businesses; will they be able to buy into Pool Re? doubts about whether the scheme would cover the cost of disruption for businesses; the difficulty of defining terrorist-inflicted losses where companies have not insured against such damage. ambiguity over office blocks with multiple leases. What is the position of tenants who are covered against terrorism while others in the same building are not? Because of the uncertainty over a scheme described by the AIRMIC as vague and impractical some companies are looking for cover elsewhere in the market; they are also becoming increasingly selective in their purchase of terrorism cover, insuring some buildings in high-risk areas such as central London but leaving buildings in lower risk areas uncovered. Before the IRA bombing in Warrington last month such an approach might have been acceptable. Today it constitutes an extremely risky strategy, says the AIRMIC. 'If a company without cover suffers a big hit, it could be ruined. What would its shareholders and bankers say?' an AIRMIC spokesman says. Property owners share most of these concerns but raise one more significant problem which could ultimately prove fatal to the scheme's success. According to Mr David Knight, a property lawyer with City solicitors Lovell White Durrant, one of the most worrying aspects of the scheme from the insured's point of view is that it is the only option available in the market; as all insurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates are likely to offer the same quote, there is no opportunity to shop around. The insured must take what is on offer. That, he says, may have serious implications under EC competition law. Ms Pat Treacy, a competition lawyer with Lovells, believes an agreement or arrangement between the insurance companies and the Lloyd's syndicates participating in the new scheme could contravene EC competition rules. 'Where a number of competing insurance undertakings enter into an arrangement under which they will provide cover only through an agreed mechanism which will enable them to demand uniform higher premiums in such a way as to minimise risk to themselves and to decrease cover for the insured, that arrangement may well fall within the scope of Article 85 of the Rome treaty,' she says. Article 85 prohibits anti-competitive agreements or arrangements which have an effect on trade between member states of the EC. To avoid the risk of the arrangment being declared unlawful and insurance companies incurring fines, the insurers would have to obtain an exemption for the agreement from the European Commission; companies could either seek an individual exemption or a block exemption for agreements in the insurance sector which came into force on April 1. Obtaining an exemption will be difficult. However, privately, the ABI appears to be quietly confident of winning an exemption for the scheme. The ABI says it is aware of the potential competition problems and that it is in contact with Brussels over the issue. The AIRMIC, however, is more dismissive of the competition issue. 'Without Pool Re there would be no cover. Why would any company want to see it struck down?' it says. Lovell's lawyers say property owners are relieved the government has agreed to act as 'reinsurer of last resort' and are anxious not to rock the boat. However, property owners and other interested parties dissatisfied with Pool Re could still lobby the Commission if they oppose the final shape of the scheme. Lovells, which believes the scheme may eventually be accepted by Brussels, says it will be advising its clients that such a course of action would be a legitimate option to enforce change. Whatever the merits of such tactics it is clear that there are still many problems with the Pool Re scheme. Saturday's bomb is a reminder that time is not on the government's side.</p>

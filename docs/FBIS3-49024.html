			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak today met members of  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. According to Prime Minister  Pawlak the results of the economic transformations in Poland are  appreciated by international financial organizations such as the  World Bank, the IMF and the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development.    [Begin Pawlak recording] In 1994 we expect that Polish gross  domestic product to grow by about 4.5 percent, exports to  increase by 6 percent and investment by 6 percent. We envisage  that the annual rate of inflation in this period will decrease,  falling to about 25 percent. The government is continuing the  process of reforms, the foundation of which is formed by a  market economy and the principle of free economic management, as  well as by the demonopolization of foreign economic relations.    The government will also continue the processes of ownership  transformations, although here we want to use the criterion of  efficiency as the primary criterion. We are interested in  creating conditions for a free flow of goods, services, capital  and people. At the same time we need a greater openness of  foreign markets to our goods, as well as increased interest of  foreign entrepreneurs in investment projects in Poland. [end  recording]</p>

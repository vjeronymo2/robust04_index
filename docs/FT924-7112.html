			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Arts: Marks and Sparks drama - Television More and more time on British television is being devoted to what might be called Marks and Spencer drama. ITV and BBC1 now depend on it to such an extent that you can find an example virtually every night serving, in mid-evening, as the keystone in the scheduling arch of one network or the other, sometimes both. Given its popularity and high production standards, it would be supercilious, and in some cases inaccurate, to dismiss the entire genre as middlebrow soap opera. But given its popularity, costs, and growing importance in the ratings, it seems as well to recognise precisely what it is. Then again, perhaps it is easier to say what it is not. For instance one-off plays are scarcely Marks and Spencer drama, because with M and S you need to be able to go back next week and find something virtually indistinguishable from what pleased you this week. Almost all single dramas arise from the consciousness of a single, often idiosyncratic, author. Thus the first in a new BBC2 season of 'Performance' on Saturday, Christopher Hampton's Tales From Hollywood, falls on four counts: it emerged entirely from his mind, was originally written for the theatre, is not a series or serial, and was in large part non-naturalistic. It was splendid to see effort put into the use of studio production for once, and the stylistic tributes to Edward Hopper, Sunset Boulevard and so on were fun, even if the end result was a teeny bit yawn-making. But it was not M and S. Nor is any adaptation, from The Borrowers to Clarissa, because adaptations are, by their very nature, finite and one of the essential characteristics of M and S material is that you should be able to go on dishing it out forever, or at least so long as the public maintains its demand. Thus GBH and The Singing Detective also fall outside the genre. Not only are they finite, they serve the haute couture end of the market: high quality and originality, even a degree of eccentricity. Series such as Civvies may appear at first to be Marks and Sparks material when they are screened in M and S slots and serve the M and S clientele, but these too have to be disqualified on the grounds that they cannot be strung out indefinitely. Perhaps the easiest definition is a list. You can currently see Trainer tonight (BBC1), Rumpole Of The Bailey tomorrow (ITV), Casualty on Saturday (BBC1), The House Of Eliott (BBC1) and London's Burning (ITV) on Sunday, and Kinsey (BBC1) and Boon on Tuesday. Other current or recent examples might include Soldier Soldier, The Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Taggart, though once you start including detective series it is hard to know where to stop. Poirot and Miss Marple should probably be excluded on the grounds that they are adaptations and therefore finite, but what about Inspector Morse? Though the original programmes were taken from books, Morse scripts are now turned out by a team of script writers so in that and other respects Morse would seem to be a prime example of the genre. What do these series have in common? They are nearly always 50 to 60 minutes long or suitable for transmission in 60 minute slots. They are naturalistic, with frequent use of outside locations (the amount varies, less in Casualty, more in Boon) and each episode costs far more than twice as much as a 30-minute episode of a soap opera such as Coronation Street or EastEnders. They constitute the high quality end of mass-production and, of necessity, scripts for practically all of them are commissioned from jobbing writers. A good book may be, as Milton said, 'the precious life blood of a master spirit' and once in a while you will come across a Marks and Sparks drama series which emerges from the mind of a single writer. Rumpole is the obvious example, but because John Mortimer writes all of them there is never more than a handful of Rumpole scripts each year. Mortimer might be appalled at the ease and accuracy with which commissioned writers could turn out Rumpole 'forgeries', but presumably that will not happen while Mortimer is willing to continue. In other series, where 20 or 30 or even 40 scripts a year may be called for, the use of writing teams is unavoidable. The result is drama which, like Marks and Spencer's clothes, benefits from a high level of quality control and is consequently consistent, safe, good value for money, reliable and wholly predictable. Most of the population will feel comfortable with it, and won't mind in the least if mother sees it. We are assured there was a bare breast in this week's Casualty but if there was it would not have shocked Auntie Ethel: amid the efforts of the heroic nursing staff and the laughter and tears of all those fleeting bittersweet moments among the saline drips and kidney bowls, with the prize fighter and the fallen pylon man, some of us missed it altogether. M and S products do not embarrass the customer or present any threat; practically everyone feels comfortable with them. M and S products do not go to extremes, indeed they stick as close as possible to a line through the middle of the market in order that as few people as possible will be put off. M and S products are reassuring and familiar. Above all M and S products are respectable. There is the occasional risque moment in London's Burning, as when the non-drinking driver on the disastrous basketball outing retired with his floozy to the mini-bus this week, but the hurried tucking-in of a shirt was the furthest that anything went. Even within the genre standards do vary, of course. Trainer is an attempt to make an English Dallas with lashings of glamour and rich bastards stabbing one another's backs while the little people are ground down at the bottom. Usually it fails because the English have neither the chutzpah of the Americans nor their flair for off-the-wall craziness. Who could care less about any of the characters in Trainer? Kinsey, on the other hand, does have some interestingly developed characters, yet even they (the sparky secretary, the villainous competing solicitor, the liberal hero Kinsey himself) are remarkably predictable. M and S drama is workmanlike, with plenty of narrative, and nothing to shock you or take you by surprise. No doubt it provides pleasant evenings for lots of people. But is that really all we require from these huge swathes of peak viewing time? Good art, not to mention great art, has always been produced by those who have paid close attention to life. Just as the Modern movement rapidly became tedious because its proponents reacted too often to one another's work rather than the whole of life around them, so M and S drama seems all too often to be produced by people who have been observing not life but merely other television series. Good drama keeps on surprising you by showing human attributes which are fresh and striking yet entirely credible judged against your own experience. Watching a drama by Shakespeare or Michael Frayn you know that the authors have been keeping a sharp eye on their fellow men. Watching Boon or The House Of Eliott you are more likely to think 'I know exactly what's going to happen now because I've seen umpteen other drama episodes like this'. Of course Marks and Spencer suits the British very well, and M and S drama brings the broadcasters the sort of ratings (15m for Casualty, 14m for London's Burning, 10m for House Of Eliott in the current BARB figures) which they could not normally expect from more individual drama. But as we buy our respectable knickers and watch our dependable series we should perhaps remember the sort of frills we are missing.</p>

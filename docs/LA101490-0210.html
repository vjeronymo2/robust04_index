			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: FOLK ART GALLERY BLENDS BLUE-CHIP ARTISTS WITH THE NAIVE UNKNOWNS  </P> <P> Visiting Outside-in, Liz Blackman's gallery of 20th-Century American folk and  "outsider" art, used to take some doing. The gallery was in a converted  townhouse on a residential street in West Hollywood and was open by  appointment.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, Blackman moved to let more of the outside world in: She reopened  her gallery in a storefront on a colorful block of Melrose Avenue, just east of  La Brea.  </P> <P> Blackman is a former reporter who fell in love with folk art during an  assignment and became first a collector, then a dealer. She handles naive,  figurative work by self-taught artists, who developed far from art schools and  the art scene. Within the broad category of folk art, she said, she is less  likely to represent the work of what she termed "memory painters" such as  Grandma Moses. Her penchant is for "outsider art," which she describes as "more  visceral, more eccentric than traditional folk art -- the product of personal  vision rather than experience."  </P> <P> Indeed, Outside-in fairly bristles with personal visions. A wooden  tick-tack-toe set by Constance Roberts, for instance, graphically pits  hand-carved vices against virtues. The vices are represented by a gambler's  hand of cards (complete with one up the sleeve), an expired parking meter, a  passel of french fries and an overdue library book. Arrayed against them are a  bottle of cod liver oil, a bunch of flowers for mom, a box of Quaker Oats and a  signed check for the needy.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, in a piece by R. A. Miller, an American flag painted on corrugated  metal bears the inscription, "You can't burn this flag." Artist Purvis Young  has produced a pair of paintings in black on the footboard and headboard of a  white crib. And in "Batman, Batwoman," Michael Rogers has sculpted a baseball  bat into a totem that is subtly male on one side, female on the other.  </P> <P> "What I'm trying to do is mix some of the blue-chip artists who are very well  known" -- artists such as Mose Tolliver, David Butler and the Rev. Howard  Finster -- "with the work of lesser-known artists whose work is consistent,"  Blackman said.  </P> <P> At this point, relatively few of the artists in Blackman's stable are from Los  Angeles, or even from California. They are more likely to live in isolated  rural areas, where there is less information overload -- and more time to  devote to a personal craft. "In L.A. it's a luxury even to have a hobby,"  Blackman said.  </P> <P> But just opening her more public space has brought several L.A. artists to her  door and to her attention. The signature lizard above Outside-in's entry, for  instance, was executed by Aubrey Selden, a local artist who just wandered by  one day.  </P> <P> "There must be some treasures out there," Blackman said.  </P> <P>  Outside-in, 6909 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 657-6369. Open from 11 a.m.  to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.  </P> <P>  A STICKLER FOR STICKLEY: One of the most intriguing differences between a  museum exhibition and a gallery show -- when both address the same topic -- is  that the gallery material is generally for sale. In other words, you could  conceivably buy it, bring it home, even touch it.  </P> <P> That is part of the appeal of "Arts and Crafts in America" at the Bryce  Bannatyne Gallery in Santa Monica, which complements the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art's recently opened exhibition "American Arts and Crafts: Virtue in  Design."  </P> <P> The Bannatyne show includes less European material than its museum counterpart,  but it is ambitious in its attempt to evoke the arts and crafts movement as "a  whole environment, not just as single pieces of furniture," Bannatyne said.  </P> <P> To that end, the exhibition includes not just significant tables, chairs and  cabinets by Gustav Stickley, Frank Lloyd Wright, Greene &amp; Greene and their  peers. Also on view are ceramics from potteries such as the Grueby Faience Co.,  original lighting fixtures by Greene &amp; Greene and others, as well as  textiles and paintings of the period.  </P> <P> Like the LACMA exhibition -- which is publicized with a photograph of a  handsome ceramic fireplace surround -- the Bannatyne show even includes a tile  fireplace. Made in 1901-02 by the Grueby Faience Co., it once stood in a home  in Duluth, Minn. Bannatyne located it -- disassembled and boxed -- in a New  Jersey basement.  </P> <P> Gone are the days, however, when casual collectors could make such discoveries  at flea markets and buy them for a song. And prices for important signed pieces  in the Bannatyne show can run deep into five figures, even into six. "Over the  last 10 to 12 years, prices have started to escalate and the collector base has  broadened -- we're now even starting to see things go to Europe and the  Orient," Bannatyne said.  </P> <P> But he resists attempts to characterize the new-found popularity of arts and  crafts furniture as fashion or fad.  </P> <P> "I don't see it as trendy. I look at the Santa Fe interior-decorator movement  as trendy, because there's no historical basis for it -- it's primarily style,"  Bannatyne said. "With Stickley and the arts and crafts movement, you're really  dealing with an important movement in history."  </P> <P> He noted that the commanding simplicity of the furniture even tends to have a  strong impact on the lives of the people who choose to live with it today.  </P> <P> "The furniture itself can be very imposing," he said. "But when people really  start to look at it, they have to take a closer look at themselves.  </P> <P> "It just forces you to pare your life down," Bannatyne said.  </P> <P>  "Arts and Crafts in America," through Oct. 25 at the Bryce Bannatyne Gallery,  604 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica. (213) 396-9668. Open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Tuesday through Saturday.  </P> <P>  SCENIC SENDAK: When the Los Angeles Music Center opened its recent production  of Mozart's "Idomeneo" with scenery and costumes designed by Maurice Sendak,  the gallery Every Picture Tells a Story threw a party -- and threw open an  exhibition -- in Sendak's honor.  </P> <P> Sendak, of course, is a near-legendary children's book author and illustrator.  During the past 10 years, he has been crossing over into the adult reaches of  opera design. "Idomeneo," he has said, is his favorite opera by his favorite  composer.  </P> <P> Every Picture Tells a Story is a gallery of original art from children's books.  But one aspect of its approach, too, is "trying to break down the barrier of  what needs to be for children and what for adults," according to Abbie  Phillips, one of the gallery's owners.  </P> <P> Through Oct. 28 the main gallery is festooned with the original set and costume  designs for "Idomeneo," complete with monsters, seascapes and threatening  skies. None of the watercolors or drawings are for sale.  </P> <P> Rounding out the show are children's book illustrations by artists that Sendak  himself admires, Phillips said. Among them are Richard Egielski, William Joyce,  Robert Rayevsky and Laurent de Brunhoff (of Babar fame).  </P> <P> Sendak does not often exhibit his work in a gallery setting; for Every Picture  Tells a Story, the Sendak show is something of a coup. For the gallery's  owners, it also seems to be a personal thrill.  </P> <P> "I grew up with all his images. In a way, he's responsible for my starting this  gallery," Phillips said. "I don't think what he does is all just warm and fuzzy  little bears -- he's showing children in all their complexity. That's related  to what we're trying to do with the gallery."  </P> <P>  "The Original Art of Idomeneo, by Maurice Sendak," through Oct. 28 at Every  Picture Tells a Story, 836 N. La Brea, Los Angeles. (213) 962-5420. Open from  10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> </P></p>

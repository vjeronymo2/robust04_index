			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE TO REPLACE MURDER DEFENSE TEAM BECAUSE OF CONFLICT  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court judge will appoint new attorneys for a Canoga  Park man charged with murdering an 8-year-old Northridge boy. The change is  being made because the public defenders have represented one of the  prosecution's key witnesses.  </P> <P> Judge Steven Z. Perren's decision will set back the trial of Gregory Scott  Smith, 21, for several months, just as it neared the end of a monthlong jury  selection, one attorney said Saturday.  </P> <P> The conflict of interest involved Tracy Ray Prell, 26, of Simi Valley, an  informant serving a two-year jail sentence for misdemeanor battery and  obstructing a peace officer.  </P> <P> Deputy Public Defender Duane Dammeyer said his office has previously  represented Prell.  </P> <P> "We knew we would not be in a position to cross-examine that witness because he  was our client."  </P> <P> Smith is accused of the kidnap and murder of Paul Bailly, who disappeared March  23 after his mother dropped him off at a day-care program at Darby Avenue  School in Canoga Park. Paul's body was found several hours later in a field in  the Santa Susana Knolls area in Simi Valley. Prosecutors have alleged that  Smith abducted Paul, gagged him with duct tape, strangled him and then set fire  to his body.  </P> <P> "It's kind of a letdown to be taken off the case," said Dammeyer, adding that  lawyers were within days of selecting a jury. "But legally there was no other  way."  </P> <P> Dammeyer said he and Deputy Public Defender Richard Holly will turn their work  over to the new attorneys.  </P></p>

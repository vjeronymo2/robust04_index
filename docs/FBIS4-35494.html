			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Deploying Prithvi"] </F>   [Text] True to promise, US Ambassador-designate Frank  Wisner has warned India against deploying the Prithvi missiles  despite his lack of knowledge as to whether the weapon is  configured to carry a nuclear warhead. The easy inference is  that it is neither nuclear capability and a tested delivery  system nor the violation of the arbitrary Missile Technology  Control Regime (MTCR), the norms of which do not cover the  Prithvi, which bothers Washington. What clearly does is India's  demonstrable military superiority over Pakistan. All strategic  experts have averred that the Prithvi does not really threaten  China, for it cannot reach a significant target beyond the  buffer territory of Tibet. So it must be concluded that the  short-range missile may be deployed only to threaten Pakistan.  The warning that Mr Wisner, a Pentagon policy expert, has issued  is transparently aimed at assuring Pakistan whose President, Mr  Farooq Leghari, is in Washington apparently to work out the  details of a Pakistan agreement to cap its nuclear programme.  The queer aspect of the episode is that Mr Wisner is  consciously using the run-up before taking over as ambassador in  New Delhi to create critics rather than friends. He must have  the full assurance of the State Department that he would be none  the worse for the handicap run.    The US opposition against the deployment of the Prithvi,  first articulated by Senator [as published] Lee Hamilton before  Mr Narasimha Rao set out for Washington and now by Mr Wisner  when the Prime Minister is back in India makes it clear that  this short-range missile is at the moment on top of the US  agenda for India. This can create complications for Mr  Narasimha Rao, who pledged in Parliament that the Prithvi would  be user-tested after the few days postponement he ordered not to  cause an irritation before his US visit. The expected date, May  23, has passed off without the test. But the Army, defence  scientists and district officials of Balasore in Orissa are all  waiting in readiness, with the hope that the exercise will take  place before May is out. Mr Rao may go ahead with the trial,  because the Americans have not objected to this (the opposition  is to the Prithvi's deployment). But suspicions about  accommodating America's "friendly persuasions" will continue  unless the Government makes a public announcement that it has  actually deployed the missiles. The postponement of the Prithvi  trial was probably seen by the US as capping the programme.  What it perhaps expects now is a roll-back, which is exactly  the opposite of the weapon's deployment. The Agni, being still  an experiment, is the lesser evil of India's missile programme  that the US wishes to curb. The myth of US arm-twisting will not  be blasted by presenting an Indian arm intact. If there is need  for complete transparency, it is in diplomatic exchanges between  New Delhi and Washington. Even whispers would send out eloquent  messages in a regime of quiet diplomacy.</p>

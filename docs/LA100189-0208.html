			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVEN WITHOUT GRETZKY, KINGS DEFEAT OILERS, 5-3;  </P> <P> STAR SIDELINED AFTER DENTAL WORK, BUT L.A. STILL GETS UP FOR EXHIBITION GAME  </P> <P> Coach Tom Webster of the Kings was saying Saturday night that he planned to  treat today's exhibition game against the Winnipeg Jets in San Diego the same  as a league game, seeing as how it is the last practice run.  </P> <P> But, then, he had to acknowledge that the players on the ice at the Forum  Saturday night had treated the game at hand with seriously, which the Kings  won, 5-3, before 12,075.  </P> <P> "Surprisingly, all of our exhibition games have had that kind of intensity,"  Webster said. "What we have seen is that every team is geared up for us.  They're giving us their best. There will be no easy games for us this year."  </P> <P> The Kings had planned to send their best against the Oilers, but Wayne Gretzky  had to scratch.  </P> <P> News that Gretzky wouldn't play was booed at the Forum.  </P> <P> Gretzky, who spent four hours at his dentist Friday afternoon having caps on  his front teeth removed, having his gums treated and having the caps replaced,  was able to skate with the team Saturday morning but did not feel up to playing  a game.  </P> <P> Mario Gosselin was in goal for the Kings and stopped 31 of the 34 shots he  faced.  </P> <P> The Kings led, 2-1, after the first period. Glenn Anderson gave the Oilers the  early lead, but Steve Duchesne tied with a goal at 12:10 of the first period,  skating through the right circle and beating close-up at the right post.  </P> <P> Jim Fox put the Kings ahead at 14:21, surprising Ranford with a quick shot  through the slot.  </P> <P> John Tonelli stretched the Kings' lead to 3-1 early in the second period,  waiting at the right post to knock in a pass from Bernie Nicholls on the power  play.  </P> <P> Nicholls had left the game with 18 seconds remaining in the second period after  getting a five-minute penalty and for delivering an elbow that injured Martin  Gelinas.  </P> <P> It was during the time left on his penalty at the start of the third period  that Craig Simpson scored the Oilers' power play goal to close the gap to 3-2.  </P> <P> Steve Kasper gave the Kings a two-goal lead with on a pass from Tonelli at  16:07.  </P> <P> But with the Oilers skating with six men to the Kings' four (a two-minute  penalty on Marty McSorley for hooking before the Oilers pulled their goalie)  Esa Tikkanen cut the lead to one.  </P> <P> Phil Sykes scored on the empty net.  </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The last game of the Kings' exhibition season will be played tonight in San  Diego. The game against the Winnipeg Jets will begin at 7:05 and will be  broadcast on KLAC (570). The Kings will go into the game with a preseason  record of 4-4-2. . . . Dave Taylor, who has been out with a pinched nerve in  his neck, skated Saturday morning and said Saturday night that he expected to  be able to play in the season opener Thursday. . . . Barry Beck played one  shift Saturday night before heading for the dressing room with an aggravated  groin injury. . . . The Kings, who reported to training camp in Hull Sept. 7  and returned on Friday were on the road for 22 days.  </P></p>

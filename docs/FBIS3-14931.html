Yeltsin said he was aware of the negative reaction of the  public both to the political amnesty of the people accused of  crimes against the state and to the haste with which the  parliament resolution was fulfilled, as a result of which the  first to be freed were the persons charged with the gravest  crimes against the state. The president said that the  Constitution, the law and the procedural code were violated in  the process.    The president then heard the State Duma chairman's  explanations of the motives behind the house resolution on  amnesty, as well as his assurances that the State Duma would  draw appropriate political lessons and ensure a more balanced  approach to the adoption of resolutions which are likely to  entail serious political and moral consequences.    Yeltsin noted that he understood the concern expressed by  the  public, the press and individuals but refused to share the  excessive evaluations and conclusions concerning the state power  in Russia. "At present I see no real danger for civil accord and  am in full control of the social and political situation," the  president said.    The president said he decided against immediate tough  measures taking into account the announced intention of the  State Duma to act towards national concord and an understanding  by the considerable part of the deputies of the fact that by  passing a resolution on political amnesty they thereby assumed  responsibility for the possible political activity of those they  amnestied.    The president stressed that he regarded the agreement of the  defendants to accept the amnesty as their recognition of guilt  of criminal activities.    "Should the slightest attempt be made at destabilising the  situation in the country, they will be arrested straight after,"  Yeltsin said. The president has issued appropriate instructions  for the purpose.    During the meeting, the president and the chairmen of the  Federal Assembly's chambers coordinated plans for the upcoming  activity of the Federation Council, the State Duma and the  president.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / People: Sir Hal leaves the driving seat Ex-Tory MP Sir Hal Miller is to leave his job as chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers when his contract expires at the end of March. The extrovert 64-year-old former member for Bromsgrove and Redditch, brought in by the SMMT to give a higher profile to the manufacturers' body as its first full-time chief executive, has held the post only since November 1991. He is to take up an as-yet unidentified 'senior position' in the textiles industry. His departure, announced yesterday, came as a surprise to many in the industry, who had expected him to renew his contract for a further year. Sir Hal was believed to have wanted to oversee preparations for the 1994 motor show, which is potentially the last to be held at Birmingham. A review of the show's frequency and location could see it moving to Earls Court in London and becoming an annual affair from 1996. Otherwise, despite the recession in the UK motor industry, he will be leaving with at least one feather in his cap: during his 16 months in office he is widely credited with having played possibly the lead role in persuading the government to abandon the 10 per cent Special Car Tax which had been the industry's bete noir for two decades. There are, as yet, no declared favourites to succeed him, though one candidate must be fellow former MP Roger King, whom Sir Hal drafted in as the SMMT's head of external affairs shortly after his own arrival.</p>

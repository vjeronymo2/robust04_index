			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "H.M.": "Tietmeyer Warns Against Excessive </F> Haste"]    [Text] Gotha -- The current stage of preparations for  European monetary union entail laying the appropriate economic  foundations. The turmoil in the European Monetary System [EMS]  over the past few years has made it perfectly clear that the EU  [European Union] requires extensive economic and economic policy  convergence to achieve stable monetary union. That is what  Bundesbank President Tietmeyer stated at a business conference  in Gotha staged by the Bavarian and Thuringian Governments in  conjunction with the EU Commission. Karl-Heinz Wessel, chairman  of the Bank Association, rejected criticism that the banks were  being too cautious in eastern Germany.    Tietmeyer asserted that the strict fulfillment of the  convergence criteria contained in the Maastricht Treaty must  take priority over the time-frame that has been envisaged.  Until the completion of monetary union, exchange rate movements  must be possible, because monetary union can only be successful  in the long term if there are reasonable exchange rates at the  outset. There is too much of a danger that a monetary union  that is commenced with excessive haste and overlooks actual  facts will turn into a inflationary community that will  ultimately collapse.    With regard to preparations for monetary union, Tietmeyer is  of the opinion that at the present time the credibility of the  monetary, economic, and fiscal policies of member states is  being put to the test. European integration will only proceed  if all the countries display the right degree of political will  and create the necessary economic conditions. Only a lasting  convergence geared toward stability within the EMS can, in  conjunction with progress in political integration, create sound  foundations for monetary union and, at the same time, act as a  pointer for the future European central bank.    Conscious of their central importance for the economy and  society, west German banks were very quick to set themselves the  task of restructuring the east German economy. That was how  Karl-Heinz Wessel, president of the Federal Association of  German Banks, responded to the criticism that the banks were too  cautious about issuing loans in the new laender. By the end of  1995, over 6 billion German marks [DM] will have been invested  in 1,100 east German businesses; 21,000 employees have found  modern, well paid, and secure jobs in the new laender. The  figures for the loans issued also speak for themselves. By the  end of 1993, the total credit volume amounted to almost DM100  billion. The west-east transfer of capital of DM37 billion  contained in these figures does not even take into account the  loans directly granted to east German companies by west German  branches. According to Wessel, loans granted to companies  amounted to DM57 billion at the end of 1993; in 90 percent of  the cases, the loans were unsecured.    Another factor checking development is the low level of  equity on the part of east German companies and the banks have  also become active in this field. Parallel to developing their  credit business, the banks have also extensively acquired stakes  in firms. By the end of 1993, they held stakes in 189  companies. In addition, the banks are under obligation to use  their share of the "bank billions" to acquire stakes in  medium-size companies. This undertaking will be realized by the  end of the year.</p>

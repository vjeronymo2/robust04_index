Adam Michnik, a Solidarity  adviser, said the talks ran into an impasse after a meeting of the working  group set up to discuss political reforms. Michnik said the group could not  reach a consensus dealing with the office of president. The official news  agency PAP said an unspecified number of bus drivers began sit-in protests in  Siedlce and Minsk Mazowiecki, east of Warsaw, paralyzing transportation in the  area.  </P></p>

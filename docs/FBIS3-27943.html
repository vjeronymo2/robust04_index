			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 2 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In the negotiations on automobiles and auto parts in  the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, there is now a  proposal for Japanese automakers to submit yearly plans  itemizing their purchase of U.S.-made parts. Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] officials have started  sounding out automobile companies about whether such a proposal  would be acceptable. The MITI does not consider this to be a  numerical target. It will also ask the U.S. auto industry to  present export plans to break the deadlock in the framework  talks. However, some Japanese automakers have already indicated  opposition to this idea, believing that it will, in fact, amount  to a numerical target.    When former President George Bush visited Japan in January  1992, Japanese automakers had formulated their voluntary plan to  import $19 billion worth of U.S.-made auto parts in fiscal year  1994. Because this purchase plan was eventually incorporated  into the action program announced by the Japanese and U.S.  Governments, the United States regards the purchase plan as an  "official commitment of the Japanese Government" and demands it  be fulfilled. It is also asking for an extension of the  purchase plan in the framework talks.    The most likely proposal being considered for the new  purchase plans asks each automaker to issue a yearly plan  stating not only the procurement volume but also specific items  to be purchased -- for instance, electrical equipment. The  Japanese companies will provide this information to the U.S.  automobile industry voluntarily. The agreement to be reached at  the framework talks on this will not include the amount of money  involved in these purchase plans, on the premise that the  governments of both countries are not directly involved. It is  believed that this way, MITI will be able to argue that it is  not a numerical target.    The framework talks have been stalled on the issue of the  objective criteria to gauge the participation of foreign  companies in the market. The Japanese Government has insisted  that it is opposed to criteria involving numerical targets, such  as amounts of money and future market shares. MITI would like  to urge the U.S. Government to compromise by proposing this plan  for automobile companies to present their parts purchase plans  voluntarily, and to avoid making the proposed objective criteria  -- such as the number of imported finished cars and the number  of dealers of imported cars -- numerical targets. On the other  hand, it will also ask the U.S. automobile industry to present  export plans itemizing products that they can export to Japan.</p>

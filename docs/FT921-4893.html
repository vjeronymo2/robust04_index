			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Unions attack 'Tory hijack' of women's issues CIVIL SERVICE unions yesterday accused the government of 'hijacking' and watering down proposals to improve the position of women civil servants in order to push them through hurriedly as pre-election publicity. The charge followed the launch yesterday by the government's ministerial group on women's issues of a revised programme for equal opportunities action for women in the Civil Service Ms Judy McKnight, women's officer of the NUCPS Civil Service union, said the programme for action was a 'watered down' version of what had been agreed after the 1984 management-union review of the position of women civil servants. She said: 'Key points of good practice included in the 1984 programme were cut out.' Full consultation by the government would not have guaranteed the unions all their goals but would probably have led to a 'meeting of minds' on some things. The Cabinet Office said it had met unions in February and their 'most helpful comments' had been noted. Many, including those on sexual harassment, were in the programme. The government had announced its intention to publish the programme last October and was not rushing publication, the Cabinet Office said. The FDA top civil servants union said it had called for challenging, precise targets, department by department, for women in senior grades. The programme refers to 'informed projections'. The FDA said the Cabinet Office was sympathetic to the idea of targets for women in middle to senior grades, and that proper consultation might have achieved some progress. The Council of Civil Service Unions, a grouping of Civil Service unions, said: 'While of course we welcome any programme of action to achieve equality of opportunity for women, the CCSU is very concerned at the unseemly haste with which this document, which we have been involved in negotiating, has been hijacked by the government, intent on pre-election publicity stunts.'</p>

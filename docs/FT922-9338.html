			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Letter: A home for heritage Sir, In Raymond Snoddy's interview with the new Arts Minister (''F' stands for culture', May 5) we learn that David Mellor is having difficulty in finding a suitable building near parliament for his National Heritage Department. May I suggest that, just across the river, County Hall is exactly the right venue for the 400 staff he intends to appoint? It is next door to the South Bank Arts Centre and, with Mr Mellor in residence, might well attract the headquarters of other arts and heritage organisations. Any remaining space could no doubt be filled by overspill from its close neighbour, the Department of Education, as it takes over tens of thousands of schools opting out of local-authority control. All of which will perfectly symbolise the trend towards central control of what were once locally provided services. Second best maybe, but most of us would prefer a public service future for London's County Hall rather than the proposed Japanese hotel and luxury flats.

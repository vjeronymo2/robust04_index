			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Charter Consolidated It is difficult to fault Charter Consolidated's sale of its 38 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey. Since the two main purchasers, Johannesburg Consolidated and Minorco, are jointly buying 20 per cent, one might have expected them to pay a premium for the degree of control which that represents. But the stake is being kept within the Anglo American family and Charter cannot complain about a historic exit multiple of nearly 20. Indeed the failure of the move to flush out a full bidder and the relatively large parcel which is being placed with institutions suggest Johnson Matthey is pretty fully valued by the market. Charter may not find it quite so easy to dispose of the proceeds. At current interest rates, it will suffer earnings dilution while it holds the money in cash. A reasonably quick move is thus called for. The assumption is that it will begin by buying its own shares back from Minorco, leaving it free to pursue its ambitions in manufacturing. The deal will leave Charter with net cash of some Pounds 400m. That is more than enough to buy out Minorco's 36 per cent stake, which is currently worth some Pounds 250m. The market will then discover whether Charter's Mr Jeffrey Herbert is as shrewd a buyer as he is a seller - no mean challenge when most low-rated assets are cheap for a reason. He must be hoping that, after its help with the first leg of the transaction, Minorco will set the right tone by not driving too hard a bargain on the second.</p>

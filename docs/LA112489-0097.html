			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Government Propaganda: Beijing's main art museum has opened an exhibit called  "Baptism of Blood and Fire," an array of artwork glorifying the military  assault that crushed this summer's pro-democracy movement. The China Art  Gallery show of 113 paintings, photographs, sketches, cartoons and works of  calligraphy is the government's latest effort to justify June's quelling of  what it calls a "counterrevolutionary rebellion." The exhibit includes several  paintings of wounded soldiers, one of whom shouts "I'm for the people, the  people are for me" as he is helped through the smoke and fire of the June  turmoil by a sympathetic citizen.

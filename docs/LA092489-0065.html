			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TOUGH NEW SNAIL ON THE BLOCK  </P> <P> Some people go to the Los Angeles County Fair to see pigs wallowing in sawdust  or to ride the Giant Slide or to buy the latest slice-and-dice contraption or  to admire the prize-winning decorated cakes.  </P> <P> But some go for the snails, says Raymond Harrie. "I've heard a lot of people  say they wouldn't come if it wasn't for the snails," says Harrie, a slight man  with stringy blond hair and bloodshot blue eyes that make him look as if he's  been spending a lot of time in a swimming pool.  </P> <P> Harrie, 34, a resident of Apple Valley, has about a quarter of a million of  them over in the commercial part of Flowers and Garden, right there among the  bonsai trees and miracle plant food and wind chimes and convertible hammocks  being hawked by tradesmen. Seed your yard with Harrie's killers, he suggests,  and they'll blow away those pest snails that have been eating your dahlias.  </P> <P> "It's the tough new snail on the block," says Harrie, who brims with  good-natured snail humor.  </P> <P> Browsers in the exhibit hall see Harrie's sign, complete with blow-ups of  killer snail throttling pest snail, and they move apprehensively toward the  booth, ready to stop short if some leashed gastropod mollusk the size of a  Labrador retriever, antennae quivering, should suddenly dart out from under the  table.  </P> <P> "What do the killers eat?" asks one browser.  </P> <P> "Watch those fingers," says Harrie mischievously. "Don't fall asleep in the  garden."  </P> <P> Take away the livestock exhibits and the home arts, and the County Fair is a  lot like a big medicine show, with pitchmen giving demonstrations of scroll  saws or synthetic chamois cloths or signing up passers-by for hot tub drawings  and encyclopedia raffles. The fair, snake oil salesmen and all, runs through  Oct. 1.  </P> <P> In the time-honored tradition of the medicine show, there's often an element of  exaggeration to those enticing sales pitches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Look Like Dead Mollusks  </P> <P> On Tuesday, for example, hawkers were selling wood lathing machines ("They'll  make any man happy"), cushions with battery-operated "fingers" (offering "the  secrets of Shiatsu, a 1,000-year-old Japanese tradition in finger pressure  massage"), amazing buffing rags and vegetable slicers that can make scalloped  potatoes in 10 seconds flat.  </P> <P> At first sight, Harrie's claims about his killers seem a little exaggerated,  too. The snails look a lot like little sea mollusks. Dead ones.  </P> <P> Harrie, who runs a snail-growing company called Bio-Con Systems, keeps them in  little plastic containers, like cottage cheese vats, which go for $20 apiece.  There are 100 to a container, thin, elongated creatures that don't seem to be  moving at all.  </P> <P> "It's the wrong time of day," says Harrie blithely.  </P> <P> In truth, he says, compared to his little Rumina decollata snails, the garden  variety pest snail is a world-traveling marauder, ranging freely across gardens  and yards, stopping for a meal or two of marigold or lettuce before moving on  in a perpetual journey of destruction. The Genghis Khan of the garden.  </P> <P> But in a good year, the killer snail, a burrower who was probably introduced to  California many years ago on citrus trees imported from North Africa, may  travel 60 feet. That's the maximum.  </P> <P> "What he does is consistent with what you're trying to do in your yard," Harrie  contends.  </P> <P> In other words, the little crawlers don't climb all over your walls and  windows, leaving slime trails on your driveway or destroying your plants, like  the pest snails. But they do eat dead leaves and help to aerate the soil, like  earthworms.  </P> <P> "He's a composter," says Harrie.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Freeway Nuisance  </P> <P> Not so the marauders (Helix aspersa). They proliferate in slimy concentrations  of 2 million per acre, Harrie says, and they love irrigated freeway medians and  shoulders. In San Bernardino County, before the county introduced killers like  Harrie's 15 years ago, there were so many pest snails that they created slick  spots on freeways.  </P> <P> "People were sliding into bridge pilings," says Harrie, an agricultural  biologist who works full time for the San Bernardino County Department of  Agriculture.  </P> <P> Caltrans officials confirm that Decollata snails have been used for at least  seven or eight years to stop pest snails. "The main problem was that the pests  were detrimental to plants," says Paul Drew, area superintendent for Caltrans'  Los Angeles metropolitan district.  </P> <P> "They're not a problem any more," added Drew, a 22-year veteran of Caltrans who  used to work as a landscape specialist. "Eight years ago, there was a big  anticipation (of pest snail proliferation). Then we went into Decollata." No  more Helix aspersa.  </P> <P> And no chemicals were spread in the process, Drew said: "It's biological  control."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shell-to-Shell Combat  </P> <P> The killer snails often don't kill, Harrie confesses. They wound. They follow  the pest snail's slime trail and attack it while it's laying eggs, he said,  twisting into the shell like a screw. "Sometimes the pests survive the attack,  but when they do, they're clinging to the wall with their wounds," he says.  "That's an inactive snail."  </P> <P> It's also one that can't procreate.  </P> <P> "Are you sure these guys will win?" says one of the many curious who stop at  Harrie's booth, pointing skeptically at some of the inert little creatures.  </P> <P> "It's inevitable," Harrie says. "You see, he doesn't fight fair."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chemical Problems  </P> <P> Serious gardeners are impressed. "I have a lot of snails," says Reiko Kawasaka,  a San Gabriel woman who has just bought two vats of killers. "They eat up all  the aspidistra and the dahlias and even the marigolds. I used a lot of  chemicals before, but I was afraid they'd seep into the soil."  </P> <P> Ron and Betty Edgerly have seen a pest snail almost as big as his fist in their  Glendora yard. "They strip the flowers and leaves," said Betty. "Have chemicals  worked? Not really. We still have snails."  </P> <P> "Buy a whole lot," said Ryan Bushik, 10, to his mother, who described the boy  as the "snail patrol" in her Buena Park garden.  </P> <P> "He loves stomping on them," said Julie Bushik.  </P> <P> Harrie looks admiringly at his little killers. "It's basically just a selfish  little animal," said Harrie, tucking the $20-bills bills into his pocket. "It  won't share its territory with other mollusks."  </P> <P> WHAT ARE KILLER SNAILS? Predatory snails used to control pest snail populations  </P> <P> Feed on dead plant matter but not on live plants.  </P> <P> Attack and eat pest snails as a territorial behavior.  </P></p>

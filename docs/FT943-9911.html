			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / MMM hunger strikers held by police Four shareholders of the troubled Russian investment fund MMM were arrested yesterday. They had began a hunger strike in solidarity with Mr Sergei Mavrodi, president of the fund whose operations were frozen last week. After demonstrations in Moscow demanding Mr Mavrodi's immediate release and an end to 'a state attack' on the MMM fund, three of them were charged with illegal picketing and one with 'insanitary behaviour'. Shareholders at one of the demonstrations outside the White House, headquarters of the Russian government, described Mr Mavrodi as 'as saviour who can return to the Russian people the savings accounts and pensions which the government has confiscated through its economic reforms'. They demanded the government release Mr Mavrodi, who himself began a hunger strike last weekend, and cut or eliminate taxes on his businesses, so MMM could return their money. Meanwhile, the authorities have intensified their crackdown on the investment fund, whose share's have dropped to one fiftieth of their previous value over the past two weeks. Tax officials announced that they were extending by 10 days the detention in solitary confinement of Mr Mavrodi, who is accused of tax evasion. An association of Russian businessmen also said they had begun a private investigation into Mr Mavrodi's misdeeds. However, the shareholders' spirited protests suggest that the government's strong-arm tactics against Mr Mavrodi are beginning to backfire. Mr Mavrodi, who first demonstrated his ability to tap into the Russian psyche with MMM's phenomenally successful advertising campaign, has managed to shift the rage of frustrated investors from himself to the state. 'Thanks to the state's intervention, MMM has succeeded in evading responsibility for the pyramid scheme,' said Mr Igor Bunin, a sociologist studying Russia's fledgling capitalism. 'Now there is even a chance that Mr Mavrodi, when he is eventually released, will be able to start another operation of the same sort.' Mr Sergei Taranov, MMM's spokesman, accused the tax police of forging the arrest warrant for Mr Mavrodi. He said the fund could not resume 'normal operations' until Mr Mavrodi's release, but he assured shareholders that, despite his hunger strike, the president was still in good health. 'Mr Mavrodi has no intention of dying,' Mr Taranov said.</p>

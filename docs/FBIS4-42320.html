			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Seidlitz: "Triumph of the Realists"] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton's decision to renew the  most-favored-nation [MFN] clause will have a favorable effect on  trade and cooperation between the United States and China. This  is the gist of a statement published by the Chinese Government  in Beijing as a reaction.    The business-like statement does not reflect the overt  triumph the Chinese Government feels. A few days before the  fifth anniversary of the clearing of Tienanmen Square, which  claimed at least several hundred if not thousands of lives on 4  June 1989, the United States has now also joined those who  follow the popular slogan of "business first." The Europeans  assumed such a pragmatic position a long time ago. Li Peng,  China's head of government who held his own with his tough  course in 1989, forcing reform-minded CPC head Zhao Zhiang into  political exile, is expected on official visits in Austria,  Germany, and Romania. That is realpolitik.    President Clinton decided that trade and human rights would  henceforth be separated. This ends the annual tug-of-war about  the renewal of tariff privileges. One year ago, the same  President still linked the two issues and explicitly made the  granting of preferential trade treatment dependent on an  improvement of the human rights situation in China and Tibet.    Under the pressure of Big Business, the United States has  now  backed out and admitted its helplessness. After all, if the  West is not even able to intervene in the cruel massacres in  Africa and the Balkans, exerting pressure on China, which is  bursting with strength, is absolutely impossible.    The renewal of the tariff privileges means that Chinese  consumer goods -- such as shoes, clothes, toys, electronic  equipment -- remain cheap in the United States. The United  States is China's biggest market. Products worth $33 billion go  from China to the United States. Investments and trade are  helping China to modernize the country. In the best case, this  will in time lead to political transformation. There is no  alternative. Nobody can wish for political chaos in the  overpopulated country.    Reversely, U.S. and multinational concerns, the U.S. service  sector enterprises such as banks and bond houses, and even  fastfood restaurants such as McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken,  Pizza Hut, and Burger King, are now hoping for big business. So  far, as with Japan, the United States has had a huge trade  balance deficit with China. The United States only sells  products worth $8 million to China. According to reports, China  is said to order 50 Boeing aircraft in a single mammoth order  worth $5 billion in return, so to speak, for granting the tariff  privileges. The resumption of military contacts with the  objective of armament sales has also been initiated.    The U.S. business world is, therefore, satisfied with  President Clinton's decision. And Hong Kong rejoices, too.  After all, the bulk of exports to China is shipped through this  city, which will be a British colony until 1997. Hong Kong  would have lost enormous transactions. After this political  U-turn, the Americans argue that changes or an easing of the  politically tense situation would be achieved through economic  relations rather than through political pressure. The slogan is  change through business.</p>

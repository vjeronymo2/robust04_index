			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Islamic party held in check Turkey's secular majority appears to have clawed back electoral ground from a resurgent Islamic party on Sunday in a re-run of recent local elections. The main opposition Motherland party (Anap) seized the Moslem stronghold of Fatih in Istanbul, ahead of the Islamic Refah party (RP). Although it increased its share of the vote to 35 per cent from 28 per cent in March, the RP was pipped by Anap, which almost doubled its vote to take 42 per cent. This was the first sign that supporters of Turkey's mainstream parties may be using tactical voting to keep the Moslems out of power. The re-run at Fatih and in three other areas follows allegations of irregularities in the nationwide local elections on March 27, when Mrs Tansu Ciller's True Path party won a narrow victory on a law and order platform.</p>

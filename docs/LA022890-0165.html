			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 2ND NEWMAN TRIAL STARTS IN WEEK  </P> <P> Paul Newman's legal rematch begins with jury selection next Wednesday in  Bridgeport, Conn.  </P> <P> The actor and businessman is being sued by Westport deli owner Julius Gold, who  wants a share of Newman's food business because he claims he helped develop it.  The first trial, which featured testimony from Newman himself, ended in a  mistrial in 1988 after jurors were inadvertently given documents that had been  ruled inadmissible. Newman denies that Gold helped develop his salad dressing  or that he was promised a cut of the Newman's Own company profits. Newman  donates profits from his food business, which also includes popcorn and  spaghetti sauce, to various charities.  </P></p>

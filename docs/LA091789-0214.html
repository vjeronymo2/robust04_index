			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RANDY LEWIS: FOR POPULAR ENTERTAINMENT, YOU'LL HAVE TO GO OFF CENTER;  </P> <P> PATRONS ARE STUCK WITH TIRED OLD SHOWS THAT FEATURE OLDER, MORE TIRED  PERFORMERS  </P> <P> When the Orange County Performing Arts Center opened three years ago this  month, architecture critics and most Center-goers stood in awe of the  building's boldly innovative, non-traditional design.  </P> <P> But with the notable exception of numerous first-rank ballet groups, most of  the Center's own presentations would have been served just fine by four plywood  walls, an old blanket for a curtain and plastic, fold-out chairs.  </P> <P> Those of us who hoped the Center's bill of fare would offer anything  approaching the range and depth found at other performing arts complexes around  the country will have to keep waiting.  </P> <P> For ballet lovers, things could hardly be better, especially for so young an  operation. In the first year, we got the only West Coast appearance of the New  York City Ballet. Last month, we got the exclusive on the vaunted Kirov Ballet.  And next year, though Center officials haven't officially announced it, we  should see the Royal Ballet of Great Britain in what figures to be its only  pirouette west of the Mississip.  </P> <P> So if your tastes run to dance and nothing else, everything's coming up tutus.  </P> <P> If only the choices in terms of popular entertainment were quite so, well,  choice.  </P> <P> This week's performances of "Anything Goes" put a wrap on the Center's 1988-89  Broadway season, with Mitzi Gaynor attempting to revive (or should we say  resuscitate?) a role in a 55-year-old musical that she played on screen 33  years ago.  </P> <P> We also have been treated to Topol playing "Fiddler on the Roof" for the  umpteenth-thousandth time of his one-role career; Tyne Daly in a revival of  "Gypsy" (another musical nearly old enough to run for President); "Elvis: A  Musical Celebration," a pandering show that had as much to do with rock 'n'  roll as Pat Sajak has to do with incisive wit, and the one (count it) one  remotely new and thoughtful product, Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods."  </P> <P> The Center also has blessed us with such middle-of-the-road entertainers as Vic  Damone and Diahann Carroll.  </P> <P> The Center largely owes its existence to the contributions of the Segerstrom  family, who also commissioned the nearby Noguchi sculpture garden, which  includes a rock sculpture called "The Spirit of the Lima Bean."  </P> <P> In terms of its pop bookings, the Center has been calling often and loudly on  "The Spirit of the Has-Been."  </P> <P> Look around the country and see how other facilities are mixing pop culture  with the high arts. The Kennedy Center in Washington (former stomping grounds  of O.C. Performing Arts Center President Thomas R. Kendrick, by the way),  recently booked soul-music queen Aretha Franklin.  </P> <P> The Kentucky Center for the Arts in Louisville this summer continued its  mall-theater series of "Lonesome Pine Specials" -- performances that would fit  neatly into the Center's 299-seat Founders Hall theater -- with bluegrass whiz  David Grisman, the offbeat a cappella harmonizing of the Bobs and New Orleans  R&amp;B great Irma Thomas, among others.  </P> <P> The Center is attempting to better utilize Founders Hall, but so far we've had  three (count 'em, three) public concerts there in as many years, only one of  which, in the Center's view, has warranted even a penny's worth of advertising  or promotion.  </P> <P> Closer to home, on Thursday, veteran French jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli  will play Royce Hall at UCLA's Center for the Performing Arts.  </P> <P> Pop Renaissance man David Byrne is bringing his heady new musical/theatrical  act to the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles next month. (I can hear the  conversation in the Center board room now: "David Byrne -- isn't he that guy  who used to be married to Meredith Baxter?")  </P> <P> The lavish Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena has not only lined up loads of  orchestras, ballet companies and chamber groups for its 1989-90 season, but is  also managing to find room for admirable cultural diversity with such bookings  as the sublime Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Choir, legendary  country pianist Floyd Cramer, the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Band and the Hungarian  State Folk Ensemble. (At least the Hungarian group will make it to Orange  County; we can thank the Orange County Philharmonic Society for that.)  </P> <P> What do we get? Mitzi Gaynor.  </P> <P> The rub is that when you ask Center officials why they don't offer more, and  better, in the way of popular entertainment, they reassert their high-minded  devotion to what they define as "the four major disciplines: ballet, symphonic  music, opera and Broadway musicals."  </P> <P> (Hmmm. Ex-"Happy Days" stars Tom Bosley and Donny Most mugging their way  through a limp revival of "Strike Up the Band?" Vic Damone cracking crude jokes  about the size of his wife's breasts?)  </P> <P> Yet, quiz them about the retread musicals and persona non talent singers they  line up, and they'll tell you:  </P> <P> "We're just responding to what the public wants."  </P> <P> If this is what the people want, I have a few ideas that should go over great:  How about Mickey Rooney in a revival of "Andy Hardy's Face Breaks Out?" Or  perhaps a live version of "Great Balls of Fire" with Dennis Quaid aping Jerry  Lee Lewis? (By God, let's not get the real thing if there's any way to simulate  it.)  </P> <P> Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery. But originality is still the  sincerest form of art.  </P></p>

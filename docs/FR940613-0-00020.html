			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An amendment to 19 CFR 101.1, adding a definition of ``shipment'', makes it clear that the monetary exemption for third-tier shipments is based on the bill of lading or other evidence used to file or support entry, or oral declaration when applicable. For example, if the document used to file or support entry is an individual bill of lading to the ultimate consignee in the United States, the monetary limitation is applied on the basis of the value of the shipment on the individual bill of lading. This is so whether the document used to file or support entry is itself the bill of lading or an advance manifest, as described in 19 CFR 128.21, listing each of the individual bills of lading. On the other hand, if the document used to file or support entry is a master bill of lading (as opposed to each individual bill of lading), the monetary limitation is applied on the basis of the total value of the shipments on the master bill of lading. The same is true of the application of the monetary limitation in section 321(a)(2) for other importations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> those not involving an express consignment entity). This is so because the definition of ``shipment'' is for general purposes in chapter I of title 19 of the CFR, unless the context of the term requires a different meaning (see 19 CFR 101.1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As is true generally under these amendments, the person who may make entry for the shipments valued between $200 and $1250 which may be entered under the informal entry procedures is the owner or purchaser of the shipment or, when appropriately designated by the owner, purchaser, or consignee of the shipment, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. The person who may make entry for the shipments valued $200 or less which may be entered under the informal entry procedures is the owner, purchaser, or consignee or, when appropriately designated by one of these persons, a Customs broker licensed under 19 U.S.C. 1641. As discussed above, the authority for this distinction is that these entries are made under 19 U.S.C. 1498 and the Secretary of the Treasury is specifically authorized to prescribe rules and regulations for the declaration and entry of such shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments are also made to part 141. Section 141.4 is amended to clarify that shipments subject to the administrative exemptions under &sect;321(a)(2) must be entered under special informal entry procedures for lower value shipments. Only merchandise specifically exempt from entry ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> so-called intangibles, under General Note 13 (formerly General Note 4), HTSUS, and certain vessels) is exempt from all forms of entry. Also, a conforming amendment to the citation of the General Note in &sect;141.4 is necessary because of the redesignation of the General Note ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General Note 4, HTSUS, the predecessor to General Note 13, was redesignated as General Note 13; see Presidential Proclamation 6641, December 15, 1993, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 20, 1993 (58 FR 67032, 66867)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Undeliverable Shipments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act amended General Note 4 (now General Note 13) by adding other articles which are exempt from entry (section 681 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). The newly added articles are articles which are returned as undeliverable to the United States within 45 days of their departure from the United States. The articles may not have left the custody of either the carrier or foreign customs service during that time. The departure from the United States of articles for which the exemption is granted may not be treated as satisfying any requirement for exportation in order to receive a benefit from, or meet an obligation to, the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendment to &sect;141.4 implements this provision. The amendment requires the person claiming the exemption to certify that the merchandise complies with the provision. In addition, the amendment requires the person claiming the exemption to provide, upon request by Customs, any evidence necessary to support the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Exemptions From Entry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 681 of the Act also added a provision to the tariff schedule exempting from entry and release requirements railway locomotives (provided for in headings 8601 and 8602, HTSUS) and railway freight cars (provided for in heading 8606, HTSUS) on which no duty is owed (Additional U.S. Note 1, Chapter 86, HTSUS). Also, section 681 of the Act provided for the addition of a Note to Chapter 99, HTSUS, under which certain Canadian railway freight cars provided duty-free treatment in subheadings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9905.86.05 and 9905.86.10, HTSUS, are exempt from entry and release requirements. The railway freight cars provided for in subheading 9905.86.05, HTSUS, are those produced before July 1, 1991, or if entered after July 1, 1994, produced not less than 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years before the date of importation, and provided for in heading 8606, HTSUS. The railway freight cars provided for in subheading 9905.86.10, HTSUS, are those imported for temporary use in transportation in the United States and certified by the importer to be exported within 1 year from the date of importation and provided for in heading 8606, HTSUS. In the case of both Notes (to be added to chapter 86 and 99, HTSUS), the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized by regulation to establish appropriate reporting requirements and to require that a bond be posted to ensure compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

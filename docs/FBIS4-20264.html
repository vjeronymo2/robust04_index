			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Spain has decided to prolong its  presence in UN Operations in Mozambique [ONUMOZ] with 21  officers from the three services after the first 20 servicemen  end their year-long tour of duty.    Wednesday [27 April], the last four Spanish officers to  finish their mission in Mozambique arrive in Madrid. At the  beginning of March, four came back, and yesterday, 11 others  returned.    The Spanish relief is already deployed in Mozambique. Just  like the others belonging to the UN force, they are in charge of  overseeing the peace accords between the Mozambique Liberation  Front in the government [Frelimo] and the Mozambican National  Resistance [Renamo] that makes up the guerrillas.    Fifteen Civil Guardsmen have been working alongside the  20-odd Spanish officers for the last few days.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Germans settle row over care for aged One of the longest-running political battles in Bonn, over the creation of a new social security scheme to finance nursing care for the aged and handicapped, was yesterday settled in a top-level cross-party compromise. Almost 20 years after plans for the scheme were first proposed, the final details were thrashed out in talks between leaders of the ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). It means German workers and employers will have to pay an extra 1 per cent in social security contributions from January 1, rising to 1.7 per cent in later years, to finance the introduction of statutory nursing care insurance. The scheme will pay for the cost of care in old peoples' homes, and of residential care in their own homes for the elderly and handicapped. The costs have hitherto been paid by local authorities, but soaring numbers of old people threatened to overwhelm their financial resources. The annual cost of residential care is estimated initially at DM14.4bn, (Pounds 5.60bn) with additional administrative costs of around DM1bn. Up to 2.1m old and handicapped people are estimated to be eligible for assistance. Strong industry opposition to the deal was overwhelmed by the determination of the political parties to be seen to be capable of making a decision in an election year, when electors are threatening a backlash against the whole political establishment. The deal was done yesterday after several hours of negotiations between Mr Rudolf Scharping, leader of the SPD, and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the main party in the ruling coalition. Mr Scharping reached the deal against the objections of many within his own party, who claim that the compromise amounts to an infringement of wage bargaining autonomy in German industry. The key to the compromise was an agreement to offset the increased costs to industry by the cancellation of one day's holiday per year, providing one extra day's work. That is supposed to pay for the first phase of the scheme, to finance nursing care at home. There is no agreement on compensatory measures to offset the second phase, the cost of care in residential homes. That will be subject to a report by the government's independent economic advisers, the so-called 'five wise men."</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Climate of reform brings rouble back from the dead: Russia's currency revival AFTER many months of steady devaluation, the Russian rouble is bouncing back. Russia's currency has appreciated in value by 8 per cent over the past month. It now trades at Rbs1,010 to the dollar, up from its June 15 low of Rbs1,104. The rouble's recent performance has become so robust that, after months of futile efforts to prop up the currency, Russia's central bank has been able to intervene heavily to build-up foreign exchange reserves and prevent the appreciation going too far. Western experts, close to the Russian government, estimate that the central bank may have bought as much as Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in the past month since the appreciation began, a third of which the bank has accumulated in the last week. The rise in the rouble is evidence that the Russian government's efforts to stop the granting of central bank credit are working - and perceived to be working. 'What we are seeing are the first effects of a step-by-step stabilisation programme,' says Mr Charles Blitzer, the World Bank's chief economist in Moscow. Mr Blitzer believes that the events of the last few months have created the perception that the Russian government is serious about reforms and boosted confidence in the Russian currency. The surprise popular endorsement of President's Yeltsin's market reforms in the April referendum was followed in May by a credit agreement between the Russian government and the central bank. This agreement was subsequently approved by the International Monetary Fund and allowed the first tranche of the IMF's 'Systemic Transformation Facility', worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn), to be disbursed in June. However, only in the last month has the government begun to prove it will implement this tight credit policy. Mr Boris Fyodorov, minister of finance, has been able to out-manoeuvre advocates in parliament and some sections of the cabinet of heavy spending by refusing to disburse credits issued to his ministry. The rouble's new-found strength has prompted Mr Fyodorov to make a public offer to wager Rbs50,000 (about the average monthly salary) against any taker who does not believe that the rouble will either maintain its current rate against the dollar or continue to rise. Disgruntled Russian industrial bosses say Mr Fyodorov's refusal to release credits to them is one of the reasons why the finance minister might win his bet. Mr Valery Remizev, vice-president of Russia's gas monopoly, Gazprom, one of the country's principal exporters, complained yesterday that the tight-fisted policy of the ministry of finance is forcing his company to purchase roubles with its hard currency earnings in order to cover its wage and tax bills. The government estimates that Russian companies have up to Dollars 10bn stockpiled within the Russian banking system, backed by deposits in correspondent accounts abroad. A further incentive for Mr Remizev and other factory managers to buy roubles with their dollars is the rising cost of borrowing in Russia. Last week the central bank raised its discount lending rate to 170 per cent a year, double the level of a month ago. The increase in interest rates, and expectation that the tight credit policy will bring inflation down, are discouraging factories from borrowing to finance their working capital. A third reason behind the appreciation is the massive sell-off of Russian state assets to the private sector. The pace of voucher privatisation is picking up. Back in February, the government's privatisation vouchers, which have a face value of Rbs10,000, were trading for only Rbs3,700. They have since all but regained their face value, exceeding it on some exchanges. Yet the rise in investor confidence that partly explains the current appreciation of the rouble could just as quickly vanish if the reform momentum falters and inflation does not come down from its current level of 17 per cent a month in June. Mr Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economic professor and government adviser, is urging the Russian government and the IMF to take advantage of the current optimistic mood to negotiate a stand-by agreement before the end of the summer. Such an agreement could unlock the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund, part of the aid package agreed by the group of seven industrialised countries, which would then allow the government to fix the exchange rate. A senior G7 official said recently he believed the Russian government had taken the decisive steps needed to unlock the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the STF. He called for accelerated negotiations to agree a stand-by agreement before the autumn. IMF officials will need to see evidence the Russian government has cut back on the subsidies to industry and agriculture. The government has taken bold step in the right direction, raising the price of natural gas sevenfold yesterday and freeing coal prices earlier this month. But without still deeper cuts in these subsidies, stabilisation cannot work. Yet if these subsidies are cut, then industry will really scream. That, says Mr Blitzer, is when 'the fiscal crunch will really start to bite. There has been serious progress, but I don't think the Russian economy has turned the corner yet.'</p>

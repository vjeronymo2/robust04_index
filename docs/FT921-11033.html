			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Sikh militants adopt hard line on Punjab elections NOMINATIONS for the first state elections in Punjab for several years closed at the weekend with 1,216 candidates contesting. Notably absent from the list were Sikh militants, boycotting the February 19 election in the Indian state despite reports that they would be standing. Mr Gurbachan Singh Manochahal, the militants' leader, said yesterday the boycott would strengthen the cause of Khalistan, the independent Sikh nation the militants are fighting for. New Delhi has poured fresh troops into Punjab to prevent disruption of the polls. The main parties contesting the elections are Congress, Bharatiya Janata, Janata Dal and Communists. But without the dominant factions of the Akali Dal, the Sikhs' main political party, the election will not reflect the political will of the Punjabi people. The Akali Dal formed the last popular government elected in Punjab nearly five years ago. Last June authorities cancelled elections a day before they were due to be held after militants killed 26 candidates in the run-up to polling, despite the presence of 250,000 security personnel in the state. Under Indian laws prevailing then, an election was cancelled if a candidate died before polling began. Last month the government amended the law, making it only applicable to candidates from recognised political parties. Most of those killed in the June violence were independents. At least 5,700 people, most of them Sikhs, were killed in violence in the state in 1991. Nearly 4,000 people were killed in 1990, double the previous year's total.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Marco Ventura in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `The Renewal  Process Must Not Be Stopped'" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE  introduction]    [Excerpts] Rome -- "Let us be honest. [Former Senate  speaker] Spadolini really asked for it. He was pathetic when he  said that he lost because the others, and not he, presented his  candidacy. He was a joke." [passage omitted] Fini is  certainly happy about the election of Carlo Scognamiglio of  Forza Italia and Irene Pivetti of the Northern League as Senate  and lower house speakers. "We will continue in this way, we  have buried the Cencelli manual [power-sharing system]."    [Ventura] The adversaries are accusing you of being arrogant  and of wanting to take everything.    [Fini] Please, this is ridiculous. These statements are  being made by those who have nothing to say. A great many  people in Italy disliked clubby politics: Now that this  terrible custom of the First Republic has finally ended, here  they are shouting out.    [Ventura] Why do you say that Spadolini was asking for it?    [Fini] His position was a very respectable one as long as he  said that he was only available as an institutional candidate.  I said that we did not have the majority in the Senate.  However, when I had evidence that Spadolini was the candidate  supported by [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary] Occhetto  and [outgoing Interior Minister] Mancino, and that the  institutional cover was only an alibi to cover those who had  been defeated at the elections, I no longer had any doubts.    [Ventura] Spadolini said on the spur of the moment: "The new  government reminds me of `Giovinezza, Giovinezza'" [fascist  song].    [Fini] This is an hysterical reaction; he lost his temper.    [Ventura] Yet things will not be easy for this government in  the Senate.    [Fini] We know this. At the beginning many foresaw that  there would be irreconcilable differences among us, Forza  Italia, Northern League, and the CCD [Christian Democratic  Center]. Instead we demonstrated our power of cohesion:  Scognamiglio got all the majority votes, all "my"  parliamentarians voted for a Northern League candidate in the  lower house and for a Forza Italia candidate in the Senate. And  since eight out of nine life members of the Senate voted for  Spadolini, at the Senate we got eight votes that were not from  our people.    [Ventura] What about the future? [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi has "opened" to the center.    [Fini] This was agreed upon with [Northern League Secretary]  Bossi and myself. There is a problem of numbers in the Senate,  there is no use denying this. However, this opening will take  place on the basis of our program and certainly not immediately  with the vote of confidence. The government will have to  promote a possible widening of the majority with policies that  are judged positively in certain circles of the center,  especially on the topic of solidarity.    [Ventura] Will the center go along?    [Fini] The center is weak. Its opposition will inevitably be  sucked up by the progressives. There are already two lines of  thought inside the meager Italian Popular Party [PPI]-Pact for  Italy unit: Not all of them are willing to follow [PPI Veneto  regional secretary] Bindi and [PPI Sicily regional secretary]  Mattarella. I am very optimistic, as long as the center does  not fool itself by thinking that it can stop the renewal and  clean-up process.    [Ventura] Even the Left demonstrated itself to be compact.    [Fini] A possible arithmetical majority against the  government in the Senate will never be a "political" majority:  Left and Center would have to join forces but they would never  make it in the lower house. There is no alternative. The  opposition will have to take on the responsibility of making  Italy ungovernable, while the Italians want a government.    [Ventura] Scognamiglio in the Senate, Pivetti in the lower  house. When will it be the turn of National Alliance?    [Fini] One minute after the closure of the voting booths, I  had already said that we would not make the issue of candidates  a problem: We wanted to facilitate matters for the alliance,  not hamper them. When the government is formed we will be  there, actively.    [Ventura] It seems that the deputy speakers will also be  from  the Northern League.    [Fini] In meetings with Bossi and Berlusconi, we never said:  You take the lower house, I will take the Senate, then at  Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's office] For the first time the  two speakers have been elected without considering parliamentary  seats as pawns to be moved on a larger chessboard that also  includes the ministries.    [Ventura] You have been accused of trading votes, of having  divided the seats among yourselves.    [Fini] Trading, nothing of the kind! These people do not  understand that things have really changed. Moreover, I am  convinced that, while we all will obviously have to work on the  program, the choice of the prime minister instead will fall on  the president and therefore we will put an end to the old power  sharing system.    [Ventura] Will the opposition also remain out of the rest?  How will it be guaranteed?    [Fini] The lower house regulations apportion two deputy  speakers to the opposition. There are mechanisms of this kind  in other sectors. The men that we will choose for the  institutional tasks will be experts. As for the "rest" we will  see.    [Ventura] What about the president of the Republic? Some  from the Northern League are pushing for [President] Scalfaro's  resignation.    [Fini] At the moment, the current head of state is a  guarantee and not an element of confusion: It is neither  opportune nor necessary to question this.    [Ventura] A controversial 25 April [Liberation Day] is  drawing near. Scalfaro is calling for national reconciliation.    [Fini] I hope that he keeps the well-balanced positions that  he held some days ago; I viewed this very positively, just as I  considered the behavior of Interior Minister Mancino to be very  serious: Mancino did not give a damn about the country when he  resigned in an emergency situation that can be difficult. There  are those who see 25 April as a revenge for what happened on 27  March [election day] not for what happened on 25 April 50 years  ago.    [Ventura] Are you afraid of the people even after 25 April?    [Fini] A part of the Left -- I am referring to the CGIL  [Italian General Confederation of Labor] and the COBAS  [rank-and-file committees], will again try to be the  protagonists by publicly protesting. This risk must be defused  with a good government. If 500,000 citizens start protesting  this is one matter, 5,000 party members is something else. The  instigators? It is a matter of public safety: The police know  where Leoncavallo [former Milan squat] is and also where the  Nazi skinheads are.</p>

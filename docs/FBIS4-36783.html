			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Inclination To Normalize Relations </F> Between Cairo and Iran"]    [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Political sources in  Cairo have revealed an Egyptian-Iranian inclination to normalize  relations after tension that has lasted 10 years.    This inclination comes in the wake of the first official  visit to Cairo by Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati,  during which he attended the Nonaligned Movement conference and  met with his Egyptian opposite number 'Amr Musa. They discussed  issues of common concern on the Islamic and Arab scenes.    Well-informed sources stressed that important developments  in  relations between Egypt and Iran indicate that positive steps  are expected to be taken soon, but it depends on the results of  the coming days.    Diplomatic sources have pointed to the two countries'  endeavors to open a new page in relations based on surmounting  the points of disagreement, working to eliminate them, and  bolstering the issues agreed upon, especially what concerns the  two sides on the regional and international scene, in particular  Islamic issues and nonalignment.

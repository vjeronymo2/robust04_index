			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Fate of Hong Kong"] </F>   [Text] With the Legislative Council [LegCo] vote in favour  of the first part of Chris Patten's reforms, Hong Kong has  chosen to back its Governor in standing up to Beijing. How far  that defiance will go remains to be seen. It is quite possible  that the councillors will choose to amend the second, more  controversial, part, in particular an extension of the franchise  in the functional constituencies, comprising members of  different professions and trades. However, whether they tone  down Mr Patten's proposals or not, the rupture between the  British and Chinese governments seems complete. Beijing's  threat to disband the Legislative Council when it takes over in  1997 -- first made at the end of last year -- has been  reiterated in the wake of Wednesday's LegCo vote. The goal of a  smooth transition from British to Chinese sovereignty, one of  the main aims of the 1984 Joint Declaration, is receding to  vanishing point. Failure to attain it will mark a signal  failure in the policy of each country.    The political arrangements for Hong Kong having apparently  reached an impasse, there will be a rush to judgment. Writing  on the facing page, George Walden ascribes the lion's share of  blame to the British Government for believing that it was ever  possible "to have anything approaching serious democracy in Hong  Kong." Yet it seemed vital to some ministers and some  passionate democrats in Britain, following the Joint  Declaration, that the colony should seek to establish a  distinctive political identity before it was handed back to  China. That document spoke of a Special Administrative Region  with "a high degree of autonomy" and a legislature "constituted  by elections." The tactics which Britain has used to define  this new identity are open to criticism. But it should not be  forgotten that Mr Patten's plan for a limited extension of  democracy has enjoyed wide support among the people of Hong  Kong; and that it is they, through LegCo, who will decide its  fate.    The breakdown of relations between London and Beijing over  Hong Kong need not cast too dark a shadow over the future of the  colony. The economy of southern China, in which it plays an  irreplaceable role as entrepot and capital market, is booming.  Continued prosperity in the coastal provinces of Guangdong and  Fujian is essential to the growth of China as a whole. Without  such growth, the Communist Party will lose its sole remaining  claim to legitimacy. A second cause for optimism is the example  which Beijing will set over Hong Kong for the much greater task  of reunification with Taiwan. The more drastically it  intervenes in the first, the more it will encourage the second  to keep its distance. The next three years will be tense and  difficult for Hong Kong. But the Taiwanese and economic factors  may yet enable the colony to pull through to a brighter future  than Beijing currently threatens.</p>

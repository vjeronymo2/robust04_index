			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Summary] On 24 December the ROK National Maritime Police  seized 20 kg of cocaine, worth an estimated $50 million, off a  freighter undergoing periodic repairs at the Hyundai Mipo  Dockyard in Ulsan. Police began searching the  Panamanian-registered Sunny Ocean on 22 December after receiving  a tipoff. Two days later they found 20 kg of cocaine stored in  two plastic containers hidden in a seawater intake port. Police  are investigating 13 Korean crew members, including the ship's  captain, Kim Chun-ung. Authorities think that the crew was  asked by a foreign drug-smuggling organization to transport  South American cocaine, and that they intended to deliver it to  a drug-trafficking group in the South Korea-Japan region.  Police commented that the cocaine was more likely intended for  a third country, because the amount of cocaine involved is  enormous when compared to the size of the ROK cocaine market.  The freighter is owned by the Kitaura-kai [transliterated]  Ocean Shipping Company of Japan, and travels mainly between  Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Argentina, Uruguay, and  Brazil. It was returning to Japan after visiting Brazil,  Argentina, and Hong Kong when it docked at Ulsan on 21 December  to undergo periodic repairs.</p>

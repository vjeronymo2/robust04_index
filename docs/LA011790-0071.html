			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: MIGHT AS WELL THROW IN A PUNCH LINE  </P> <P> Ladies . . . and gentlemen! Preeee-senting! Our main event! Ten rounds of  boxing -- if you want to call it boxing! Or less than 10, depending on which of  these old coots collapses first!  </P> <P> "Innn . . . this corner, in the dark trunks! With the dark eyebrows and the  darker future! Weighing in at 231 pounds, much of it in his head! He lost to  Larry Holmes! He lost to Michael Spinks! You've lost money betting on him!  Gerrrry . . . Gooney!  </P> <P> "Andddd . . . in this corner! In the light trunks! An incredibly large pair of  light trunks, may we add! Weighing in at 253 1/4 pounds, at least before this  morning's breakfast! Theformer heavyweight champion of the world, heavier than  ever! The man who wants his belt back, only several sizes larger! Georrrrge . .  . Forehead!  </P> <P> "Your referee . . . Howie Bilkum!"  </P> <P> "OK, boys, here are your instructions: Let's have a good, clean fight. No  kidney punches, no rabbit punches, no love-handle grabbing, no punches below  the waist, assuming you can find George's waist.  </P> <P> "When I say 'break,' make sure you break. I'd get between you, but there's not  enough room in the ring for the three of us. I'll be standing right out there  on the apron if you need me.  </P> <P> "Gerry, if you get hurt, you be sure to tell me, because it's hard to tell when  you're punchy from your natural state. When you fall -- excuse me, if you fall  -- please be careful, because this is a brand new canvas and we don't want it  damaged. Fall softly.  </P> <P> "George, you can't wear that helmet into the ring. Oh, I see . . . that's not a  helmet, that's your head. OK, fine. Stay away from Gerry's ribs. Stay away from  his cole slaw and fries. When you hear the bell, George, that means the round  is over, and not that dinner is served.  </P> <P> "OK, boys, shake hands and come out fighting. And may the best man win. Sorry,  Gerry. They make me say that."  </P> <P> "Hello again, everybody, I'm Jim Lampshade, here to do the blow-by-blow on  tonight's pay-per-view telecast, and we hope somebody lands at least one blow.  We're sure you're going to get your money's worth. Sorry. They make me say  that.  </P> <P> "Well, you've all heard how this fight's been promoted: 'The Preacher and the  Puncher.' 'The Geezers at Caesars.' 'Jerk and the Fat Man.' 'Two Heifers Come  to Jersey!' 'The Dopes on the Ropes.'  </P> <P> "Before the bell sounds, we'd like to apologize to our viewers for this camera  angle from the top row of the arena. It was the only way we could get both of  these fighters into the same frame.  </P> <P> "OK, here we go! Paramedics are standing by! Neither fighter is breathing  particularly hard at this point, but of course the fight hasn't started yet!  Gerry Gooney looks completely recovered from his shadow-boxing injury, when he  took six stitches from a punch by his shadow. George Forehead looks formidable  in his white trunks and matching truss.  </P> <P> "Waiting for the bell now. The 33-year-old Gooney vs. the 41-year-old Forehead.  The aging bulls! Winner of this bout gets a probable shot at either Mike Tyson  or Evander Holyfield, who are both at ringside, laughing their heads off.  </P> <P> "And there's the bell! Round 1! Gooney crosses the ring, circles, starts out  slowly, feels Forehead out . . . and he's down! Gerry Gooney is down!  </P> <P> "His corner seems to be throwing in the towel! No, it's only to wipe up the wet  spot where he fell! George Forehead has gone back to his corner! He seems to be  eating a baloney-and-cheese sandwich! Ick! I don't think George should be  drinking from that bucket!  </P> <P> "The referee is counting over Gooney! Five . . . six . . . seven . . . he's up!  Gerry's corner is advising him to stay down until eight! Gerry is confused,  because it's only 7:30! The ref's checking Gooney now to see if he's all right!  He's asking Gerry how many fingers he's holding up. Gerry's saying he couldn't  have answered that question before the fight.  </P> <P> "OK, he's letting them continue! Here comes George, charging out of his corner!  Uh, oh! He's gotta go back now, to put the sandwich down! Gooney attacks! A  left! A right! Another left! Uh, oh! George is turning around now! He's facing  Gerry now! Gerry's running away now!  </P> <P> "Wow! Look at that! That's incredible! What grace! What footwork! I've never  seen moves like that! Well, enough about the ring girl! On with the fight!  George throws a punch! Misses by a mile! And Gooney is down again! That's the  hardest he has almost been hit in his life!  </P> <P> "Seven . . . eight . . . nine . . . that's it! The alleged fight is over!  Gooney is still unconscious! I know, I know . . . how can you tell?  </P> <P> "Let's see if we can get a few words with the winner. George? George! What did  you think of the fight, George?"  </P> <P> "What fight?"  </P> <P> "When did you know you had him, George?"  </P> <P> "December."  </P> <P> "What was the toughest part of the fight, George?"  </P> <P> "Fighting with these reading glasses on."  </P> <P> "What's next for you, George?"  </P> <P> "Room service."  </P> <P> "Any truth to the rumor that you're turning senile, George?"  </P> <P> "No, I deny that."  </P> <P> "By the way, what do you think of Mike Tyson, George?"  </P> <P> "No, I deny that."  </P></p>

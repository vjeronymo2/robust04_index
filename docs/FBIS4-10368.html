			<p>BFN     [Text] When he returns from Malaysia, Peruvian Foreign  Minister Efrain Goldenberg will convey that government's  interest in signing with Peru an agreement for mutual promotion  and protection in their capacity as member countries of  multilateral Pacific organizations.    According to information disclosed by the Foreign Ministry,  the two countries have also decided to sign an agreement  eliminating the need for visas.    The president of the Council of Ministers and foreign  minister is currently in Washington, where he will participate  in the election tomorrow of the new OAS secretary general. The  results of this election will be disclosed at noon tomorrow.    In Kuala Lumpur Goldenberg closed the 10th General  Conference  of the South Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (PECC) with  the approval of a declaration emphasizing the private sector's  participation in promoting free trade and investments for joint  Asia-Pacific development.    The day before, Goldenberg addressed an audience of some 200  bankers and investors from Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and  other Asian countries.    The minister's speech focused on the changes taking place in  the Peruvian capital market, one of the most attractive of the  region.    This phenomenon is caused by the positive influence of the  privatization process currently under way and the consolidation  of a national market which is opening its doors to foreign  markets.    The foreign minister commented that this situation has  benefited by Peruvian laws and recent agreements on the  protection and promotion of investments, signed at a bilateral  as well as multilateral level.    Another important aspect of the prime minister's visit is  the  meeting he held with one of the representatives of the Malaysian  business sector, T.Y. Lee, who voiced his desire to invest in  Peru.    Fishing and mining as well as the lumber industry were the  sectors in which the businessmen voiced most interest.    Minister Goldenberg had the opportunity to meet with other  government representatives, such as the Thai vice premier, the  Malaysian prime minister, the U.S. National Security Council  adviser for Asian affairs, and the Indonesian economic  coordinating minister.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (7): Decided advantages and drawbacks / A look at the issues influencing the choice of location Deciding where to locate a business in North America presents a company with an extremely complex trade-off between factors ranging from real estate and labour costs to market proximity and the local quality of life. Much will depend on the type of business in which a company is engaged, and the markets it is serving. A steel mini-mill, for example, needs to be reasonably close to its markets, given the sheer bulk of its product, and also needs a secure supply of cheap electricity and scrap metal. Entertainment companies will be drawn to the industry's greatest concentrations of talent - in Los Angeles and New York City. Tele-marketing companies can be located anywhere in the region, thanks to reliable communications systems, though they will tend towards areas where labour is cheap and the inhabitants do not have pronounced regional accents. Industry specific issues apart, the most important factors in site location include the following: Real estate costs - including lease rates, construction costs and upfront rent concessions - constitute one of the most important relocation decisions, and as the chart shows, there are huge disparities between North American cities, with southern sunbelt and mid-western US states substantially cheaper than the east and west coasts. The North American market as a whole is only slowly recovering from the severe property slump of 1990-1993 as the US economy expands. The US national average vacancy rate in the office sector remains not far below 20 per cent, with occupancy in primary buildings improving at the expense of secondary space. The industrial market, subject to less speculative activity in the 1980s, has less of an overhang, with the south-east, south-west and mid-west showing strongest demand. Labour costs, quality and availability. Wages rates vary widely across North America, (see table), with the eastern seaboard, California and some mid-western states showing significantly higher labour costs than the southern sunbelt and mountain states. Mexico, in turn, hugely uncuts both the US and Canada. However, a recent survey of corporate real estate managers by location consultants Ernst &amp; Young* found that labour costs were only of middling concern in site selection decisions, ranked well behind the availability of an educated workforce. This would appear to favour states and cities which can combine reasonable wage costs and a reputation for good education. A prime example is Utah, which has been enjoying one of the fastest rates of economic growth in the US over the past two years. Infrastructure. Access to principal highways is of crucial importance to most companies and some 46 per cent of participants in the Ernst &amp; Young study reckoned that the availability of advanced energy and telecommunications systems was a very important location criterion. Access to a principal airport with convenient flights will also be important to many companies, particularly foreign businesses with executives constantly shuttling across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Tax and regulatory environment. A favourable local government attitude towards business and low property tax rates tend to be high on companies' site selection factors. However, the Ernst &amp; Young study found tax and start-up incentives - so often highlighted in media reports of relocation decisions - were only named by 27 per cent of participants as constituting a very important location factor. This is perhaps not surprising, since such concessions tend to be considered fairly late in the selection process, as a tie-breaker between sites on a company's short list. But they can still be an important factor in location decisions - particularly in the case of the largest, prestige plants which states are desperate to attract. A very substantial factor in Mercedes' decision to locate its new plant in Alabama was the hefty package of incentives offered by the state. They totalled Dollars 253m and included Dollars 17.4m to buy the plant site for Mercedes and develop it, Dollars 42.6m for building construction and Dollars 30m for a training centre. Alabama is also paying Dollars 60m for training Mercedes workers and Dollars 77m for developing the related infrastructure, such as roads and water lines. On top of all that, Mercedes qualifies for tax breaks, related to its profits and head count, which could total Dollars 9.2m a year for up to 25 years. Quality of Life. This broad category of factors ranges from cost of living to the local crime rate, quality of schools, climate, physical beauty of surroundings and access to recreational facilities. Cost of living, which again varies considerably from region to region (see chart), can be a significant factor in location decisions. A company situated in an area of particularly high living costs, such as the greater New York area, can find it hard to get qualified personnel to relocate to the area without paying higher wages than it need do elsewhere. However, the Ernst &amp; Young survey found that other quality of life characteristics - such as climate and cultural facilities - ranked fairly low with location professionals. That said, quality of life issues can carry considerably more weight in two circumstances. One is when professional individuals are relocating. Thanks to modern telecommunications systems, they can work from a wide variety of rural and semi-rural locations and a significant number of these so-called 'lone eagles' are setting up in business in the Rocky Mountains, attracted by its scenic beauty. The second situation is when a company moves to a new location in large measure because the chief executive happens to like it. * Contained in the Ernst &amp; Young Almanac and Guide to US Business Cities, which gives profiles of 65 business centres.

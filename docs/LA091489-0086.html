He also dismissed  reports that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is seeking to arrange  Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo. Shamir told reporters in Tel Aviv: "In my  opinion, it (Mubarak's peace plan) cannot help us." In Tunis, Tunisia,  Palestine Liberation Organization officials said only that they have  reservations about the plan.  </P></p>

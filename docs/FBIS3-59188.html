			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Davos, Switzerland, Jan 28 (AFP) -- GATT chief  Peter Sutherland, arguing that world trade policy should not be  decided solely by the leading economic powers, proposed on  Friday [28 January] the creation of a top-level forum including  developing states.    He said the forum could meet regularly at prime minister and  trade and finance minister level, and draw institutional support  from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and new World  Trade Organisation (WTO).    Sutherland told the World Economic Forum here that new  cooperative structures were necesssary to follow up on last  month's global trade pact hammered out under the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Bodies such as the Group of Seven industrialised powers or  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development left  out some of the world's fastest-growing economies in Asia and  Latin America, the GATT director general said.    "The fact is that the countries which will increasingly  provide our best hope for economic growth and new markets are  simply not represented where it most counts," he said.    He called for structures that will "recognise the realities  of the 21st century," adding, "We cannot continue with a  majority of the world's people excluded from participation in  global economic management."    Sutherland told some 1,500 political and business leaders  here that his proposed forum would include include developing  countries, economies in transition as well as states of the  24-member OECD.    "Setting up such a forum is the logical step next in the  development of global economic cooperation for which the success  of the Uruguay Round has done so much," Sutherland said.    He said the world had to treat money, finance and trade in  an  integrated way and find ways of coordinating discussions on the  problems of Russia, for example, now spread out over several  groups.    Sutherland also warned that the successful conclusion of the  GATT Uruguay Round after seven years of negotiations did not  eliminate the threat of protectionism from the world trade scene.    The major powers were showing a stubborn readiness to handle  their trade disputes unilaterally and notions of managed trade  and barriers to low-cost imports in the name of saving jobs were  still alive, he said.    Sutherland said such talk hampered Western efforts to  promote  free-market reforms among the former communist bloc.    "To call on others to implement economic reform has a rather  hollow ring to it if at the same time you maintain regime of  managed trade or retain restrictions in key sectors," he said.    The Irishman called on the United States, European Community  and Japan to rapidly ratify the GATT accord and take the lead in  providing the WTO with the means to fulfil its mandate to settle  trade differences.</p>

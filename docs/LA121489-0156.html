			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS REGRET BUT WON'T RETRACT ANTI-ISRAEL ARTICLE  </P> <P> Editors of the student newspaper at Orange County's Saddleback College, under  fire for publishing an opinion piece that attacks Israel, vowed Wednesday not  to bow to pressure for a retraction from administrators and local Jewish  leaders who said the article was anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> Staff members of the Lariat, however, have agreed to print a two-paragraph  "editor's note" in today's edition of the weekly that expresses "regret (over)  any emotional distress (the) commentary and illustration have caused."  </P> <P> Lariat Opinion Editor Lee McCormack said that aside from the editor's note, the  staff was standing behind the piece on First Amendment grounds.  </P> <P> "We are not apologizing for anything," McCormack said. "We are just regretting  the fact that we seemed to offend a lot of people. But I guess people can  interpret (the editor's note) as an apology."  </P> <P> Students, Jewish residents and top administrators, including the college  president, have condemned the article and political cartoon by journalism  student Michael S. Boren, charging that the piece was anti-Semitic and lacked  understanding of Jewish history and culture.  </P> <P> "I think this piece showed extremely poor taste and we were extremely offended  by it," said Elizabeth Gale, Orange County director of the Anti-Defamation  League of B'nai B'rith. "It's disturbing to see a student publish something  that is full of inaccuracy."  </P> <P> Richard J. Sneed, chancellor of the Saddleback Community College District, said  the editor's note does not go far enough, and has hinted that district  administrators may consider changes in the school's highly regarded journalism  program. Sneed did not rule out the possibility that the Mission Viejo school's  award-winning newspaper could lose its funding.  </P> <P> The article, under the headline "Israel Enters Nuclear Arms Race," was harshly  critical of Israel for stockpiling nuclear warheads. It also charged that  Israel is a "fanatical government" that "will resort to any means to protect  their religious claim on (Palestine)."  </P> <P> The piece ended by stating that if Israelis "are indeed God's chosen people . .  . it would seem that God might have made a better choice."  </P> <P> The article was accompanied by a political cartoon that depicted a Hanukkah  menorah tipped with singing nuclear warheads instead of candles. The smiling  warheads, which are engraved with Stars of David, are singing: "We Wish You a  Happy Holocaust."  </P> <P> Since the article and cartoon were published in the Dec. 7 edition,  administrators of the 23,000-student college said they have received more than  100 calls from people who complained that the opinion piece was anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Boren, 26, said he was not prepared for the immense outcry over  his work.  </P> <P> Boren has received numerous awards for his illustrations, which he said are  often controversial, "but not like this."  </P> <P> While the writer-artist said he is "sorry if I offended anyone," he also said  that he stands by his article and cartoon.  </P></p>

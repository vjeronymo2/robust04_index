			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / News at Ten may move to earlier slot PRESSURE IS growing in ITV to move News at Ten to earlier in the evening as a way of countering growing competition from Channel 4. Three of the largest ITV companies - Carlton, LWT and Central - are expected to raise the issue at a strategy meeting of all the ITV companies at Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, this week. At present ITV often has to interrupt a film or drama to make way for News at Ten. There is then considerable audience loss before resumption of the programme that began before the news. The Independent Television Commission, the regulatory body, has made clear it does not want to see the main evening news bulletin moved to 10.30 and has defined prime time as 6pm to 10.30pm. ITV would, however, have the freedom to broadcast its main news programme at any time during that period. Some senior ITV executives say that Mr Michael Grade, the Channel 4 chief executive, is deliberately scheduling some of his best programmes, such as Drop The Dead Donkey and other comedy shows, at 10pm so as to clash with the news. Partly as a result of competitive scheduling, Channel 4 is believed to be taking more than 17 per cent of the commercial television market. If the Sutton Coldfield meeting produces a decision in principle to move News at Ten, there would then be a long debate on what the new time should be. Carlton Television, for example, would like to see the main news as early as 6.30pm. Others would prefer 8pm. Last week the commission expressed its displeasure to senior ITV executives that at the weekend the main news bulletins had been scheduled at 11.15pm. It said the gap between news programmes was too long. The commission has been assured that the late weekend scheduling of the news had always been seen as a temporary measure.</p>

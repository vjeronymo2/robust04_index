			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Observer: Own goal What on earth is happening to Professor Sir Roland Smith? Ever since he lost his job as chairman of British Aerospace last autumn, he has been shedding his outside directorships. But he is now said to be contemplating stepping down as chairman of his beloved Manchester United. The Prof, who not so long ago sat on the boards of more public companies than anyone, told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch yesterday that he is 'unlikely to remain chairman of Manchester United'. However, before he can quit the United directors' bench he has to get the nod of approval from the court of directors of the Bank of England on which he sits. He says that it's the first time such a 'mundane point' has ever been considered by the court. Perhaps it is. But Sir Roland would have gone up in Observer's estimation considerably if he had announced that he was handing in his notice at the Bank of England and devoting more time to United. He would have to attend far fewer board meetings, Old Trafford is much closer to his home, and its financial affairs would benefit from his continued attention.</p>

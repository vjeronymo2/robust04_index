In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioners allege that honey from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a United States industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petition because they are interested parties, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and because the petition is filed on behalf of a significant portion of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to this petition, it should file a written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are natural honey, artificial honey containing more than 50 percent natural honey by weight, and preparations of natural honey containing more than 50 percent natural honey by weight. The subject products include all grades and colors of honey whether in liquid, creamed, comb, cut comb, or chunk form, and whether packaged for retail or in bulk form. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheadings 0409.00.00, 1702.90.50, 2106.90.60, 2106.90.61, 2106.90.65, and 2106.90.69 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price and Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners based United States price (USP) on contract prices from a U.S. importer of the subject merchandise from the PRC. In calculating USP, petitioners deducted amounts for the following: U.S. duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. harbor maintenance fee, U.S. merchandise processing fee, and the Honey Board fee (a U.S. Department of Agriculture assessment on honey or honey used in honey products in the United States). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Non-Market Economy Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners contend that the PRC is a non-market economy (NME) country within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act. The Department has determined in previous investigations that the PRC is an NME, and the presumption of NME status continues for purposes of initiation of this investigation. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Paper Clips from the PRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 59 FR 51168 (October 7, 1994) (Paper Clips). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, foreign market value in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors of production, valued in a market economy country. Consistent with Department practice ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Glycine from the PRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 59 FR 38435, July 28, 1994), absent evidence that the PRC government determines which of its beekeepers/processors shall produce for export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation, to base FMV only on those beekeepers/processors that produced honey sold to the United States during the period of investigation (POI).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument related to the issues of the PRC's NME status and granting of separates rates to individual exporters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. FMV Calculations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of factors of production derived from information developed by a market researcher in India about production processes in India, which petitioners claim are similar to the PRC. Petitioners valued these factors, where possible, based on publicly available published information from India ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> foreign market research report submitted by petitioners on October 14, 1994, at Exhibit 1). Petitioners argue that India is a country at a comparable level of economic development to the PRC and India is a significant producer of comparable merchandise, thus meeting the requirements of section 773(c)(4) of the Act. For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country selection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where Indian values were not available, petitioners valued the factors of production using the U.S. industry's costs, where petitioners determined that this provided a reasonable basis upon which to value such factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners provided FMV calculations based on data associated with two species of bee known to produce honey in the PRC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the low-yield A. cerana (eastern) honeybee and the high-yield A. mellifera (western) honeybee. Petitioners have provided public information which indicates that each species accounts for approximately one-half of the commercial honey-producing colonies in the PRC ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> October 14, 1994, submission of petitioners, at p. 8). In accordance with 19 CFR 353.52(a)(2), petitioners' FMV for the two species consisted of the sum of beekeeping costs, processing costs, profit, and packing, and the factors were valued as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For variable and fixed costs associated with beekeeping operations, as well as processing costs, petitioners used Indian factors of production based on their foreign market research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For labor costs associated with beekeeping operations, petitioners relied on Indian factors based on their foreign market research. Petitioner valued labor costs on the basis of publicly available Indian agricultural wage rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Petitioners added amounts for transportation and land-lease costs associated with high-yield western honeybee beekeeping operations, and valued these based on a U.S. producer's cost-per-pound. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For profit, petitioners used the profit margins for beekeeping operations contained in their foreign market research, and the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of production for processing operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Petitioners added an amount for packing in steel drums based on a U.S. producer's cost per drum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on our analysis of the petition and petitioners' subsequent amendments, we have made certain adjustments to petitioners' FMV calculations as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

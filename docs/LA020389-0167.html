			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SINO-SOVIET SUMMIT LIKELY IN APRIL  </P> <P> The first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years could come as early as April, the  Soviet Embassy said today, after the Chinese government officially invited  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to China.  </P> <P> The Beijing government said Foreign Minister Qian Qichen proposed the visit in  talks with his visiting Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who  "accepted the invitation and expressed his gratitude." Soviet Embassy spokesman  Viatcheslav Duhin said an April date for Gorbachev's visit was anticipated.  </P> <P> Gorbachev would be the first Soviet leader to visit China since Nikita S.  Khrushchev met Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959. A year later, relations between  the countries deteriorated over ideological and strategic differences, and the  Soviets halted technical and military aid to China.  </P></p>

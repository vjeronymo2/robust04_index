Delivery by Mail (8 CFR 208.3(c)(3))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 208.3(c)(3) of the proposed rule stated that mailing to the address provided on the application shall constitute adequate service of all notices and other documents, including any charging documents (Forms I&hyph;221 and I&hyph;122).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments argued that delivery by regular mail of an Order to Show Cause (OSC) violates section 242B(a)(1) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(a)(1), which requires that OSCs be presented by personal service or certified mail. Other comments argued that the OSC should be served by certified mail to ensure that it is actually received and that the rule does not take into consideration that an applicant may move after his or her application has been filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three comments also addressed the issue of service to legal representatives. One comment stated that if the applicant is represented by an attorney, service should be made on the applicant's legal representative, rather than on the applicant. Another comment recommended that mailing documents to the applicant's attorney or representative also should constitute adequate service. Finally, a comment asserted that EOIR should be informed whether an applicant was represented by an attorney at the Asylum Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This provision is not intended to_and legally could not_alter the certified mail delivery requirements in section 242B of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b. In cases where personal delivery of the OSC is not possible, OSCs will continue to be served by certified mail. This provision is adopted with an appropriate clarifying amendment in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The recommendations regarding service upon attorneys or registered representatives have been considered carefully. The Department believes that the rules for service of an OSC must ensure that the person subject to proceedings has actually received the document. The Department also is concerned that an attorney retained for the asylum process might not remain as the applicant's attorney in exclusion or deportation proceedings. As this final rule is implemented, the INS will work with attorneys and advocacy organizations to consider these and other proposals relating to the service of notices and other documents, but the suggestion of having charging documents mailed to an applicant's attorney or representative constitute adequate service has not been adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> d. Signatures under Penalty of Perjury (8 CFR 208.3(c)(4) and 8 CFR 208.3(d))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 208.3(c)(4) and 208.3(d) of the proposed rule stated that the applicant and anyone other than an immediate relative of the applicant who prepares or assists the applicant in preparing the asylum application must sign the application subject to penalty of perjury. A person other than an immediate relative who prepares or assists the applicant in preparing the application also must provide his or her full mailing address. In addition, if the applicant later claims ignorance of the contents of the application, his or her signature may provide the basis for denial of the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments suggested that any preparer, including an immediate relative, sign the asylum application under penalty of perjury and provide an address. One comment argued that exempting family members from signing the I&hyph;589 weakens the regulation because unscrupulous preparers, to remain undetected, will not sign the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

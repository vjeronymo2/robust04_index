			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ideas for UK healthcare imaginative Sir, The government and the Labour party should respond more positively to the imaginative ideas of Mr Peter Griffiths, former deputy chief executive of the National Health Service, on the delivery of healthcare ('Bottomley in row on private healthcare', August 24). The role of government is to ensure that a 'public' service such as healthcare is available to all, but not necessarily to supply it via a public sector monopoly. The delivery of public services should meet three criteria. First, the services should be provided efficiently. Second, users should have a choice of providers. Third, service providers should be accountable to their users. In a simple tax-funded system, however, the supply of services is not sufficiently driven by the choice of users, let alone accountable to them. Instead, government chooses what to supply, and the signals which a market automatically generates are missing. Furthermore, the efficiency of the provider is difficult to measure. Attention is focused on how much government spends rather than what the government gets for its money. The separation of purchaser and provider allows competition among providers and permits greater measurement of efficiency. However, even in an 'internal market', such as the NHS operates, the provider is accountable to its paymaster, not to its user. It is disappointing that the secretary of state is quoted as saying that trusts should be accountable to her, not to patients and the local community. Plans for the future delivery of 'public' services should correct the imbalance between purchaser and user, and create structures which are market-driven and socially based. In a recent pamphlet for the Fabian Society, we put forward ideas for restructuring NHS Trusts, along similar lines to those of Mr Griffiths. We proposed applying mutual principles to the delivery of healthcare. Government should guarantee, and subsidise, the right to membership of a mutually structured healthcare provider. The actual choice of provider would be left, so far as possible, with the user. Contrary to perception, most 'private' healthcare is already provided by mutual suppliers. Thinking on the delivery of 'public' services needs to be more radical. Mr Griffiths' contribution to the debate should be welcomed.

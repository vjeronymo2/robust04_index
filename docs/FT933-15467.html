			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Toshiba, Mitsubishi debt reviewed MOODY'S Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, has placed the long-term debt ratings of two leading Japanese heavy electronics makers under review for possible downgrading. Moody's said it was reviewing the Aa3 ratings of Toshiba and its subsidiaries, Toshiba America and Toshiba International Finance. Also under review are Mitsubishi Electric, and offshoots Mitsubishi Electric Finance UK and Mitsubishi Electric Finance America. Japanese electronics makers have been hurt by the prolonged weakness of consumer demand and sluggish capital spending by companies. Depreciation costs from heavy capital expenditure during the late 1980s are also squeezing the industry's profits. Responding to the announcement, Toshiba said it expected improved earnings for the year to next March. It based its hopes on a recovery in the US computer industry, and the Japanese government's emergency economic package. The agency said it would focus on both Mitsubishi and Toshiba's ability to improve profit margins and cash flow of weak sectors, as well as debt reduction and efforts to cope with the strengthening yen.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> OXNARD;  </P> <P> VOTERS THUMP TAX MEASURE  </P> <P> With the overwhelming defeat of a 5% utility tax increase confirmed Wednesday,  an Oxnard city councilman said heavy cuts in services and personnel, including  police and fire protection, are now the only alternative to avoiding a  projected $2.8-million deficit.  </P> <P> Measure C, which would have generated $5 million annually and was designed to  solve the city's financial crisis, was rejected by almost a 3-to-1 margin,  despite warnings from city officials that defeat of the measure would mean  drastic budget cuts and layoffs.  </P> <P> "Your level of service depends on your revenues," said Councilman Manuel Lopez,  a vocal supporter of the measure who said he was surprised and disappointed at  the results.  </P> <P> He said cuts in police and fire services are now inevitable.  </P> <P> Although supporters and opponents of Measure C expressed surprise at the margin  of defeat, they said voters might have rejected the measure out of frustration  over the city's handling of its finances.  </P> <P> Opponents said that for the last three years the city has had to dip into  reserve funds to balance its budget. Last year, shortly after the city found  that estimates of revenue for the 1988-89 fiscal year were about $2 million too  high, the city announced a surprise find of $1.4 million.  </P> <P> "The city administration has lost all its credibility," said Curtis Davison,  treasurer for an anti-tax group called Oxnard Residents for Responsible  Government, which led the opposition to Measure C.  </P> <P> The tax measure received 4,101 votes in support and 11,069 votes against.  Election officials said a final tally will not be announced for days, pending  the count of absentee ballots.  </P> <P> The voter turnout was up slightly from previous ballot measure elections, with  34% of the city's 46,643 voters going to the polls, city officials said. Two  years ago, 14% of Oxnard's registered voters went to the polls to decide on a  ballot measure that made city treasurer an elected post.  </P> <P> The results of Tuesday's elections were a stunning defeat for Citizens for  Public Safety, a pro-tax group that spent almost $45,000 to persuade voters to  approve the measure and had the support of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. and  the Oxnard Firefighters Assn.  </P> <P> During the last two weeks, Citizens for Public Safety distributed 56,000  brochures, while off-duty police officers and firefighters went door-to-door to  urge voters to approve the measure, warning that Los Angeles gangs would take  over the city if the measure was defeated.  </P> <P> In contrast, opponents of the tax, including the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce,  spent about $4,500 to defeat the measure. The group had no official  headquarters and did no door-to-door campaigning.  </P> <P> Davison said he thinks each vote cast in opposition to the measure was  tantamount to a no-confidence vote for the City Council.  </P> <P> He said the election results sent a message to the City Council, telling it to  stop its free-spending attitude. Davison predicted that voters would express  the same sentiment in November, when the mayor's post and two council seats  will be up for reelection.  </P> <P> Councilman Lopez agreed that the results seemed to reflect voter frustration  with the city's ongoing fiscal problems and said the council is partly to  blame.  </P> <P> He said getting voter approval of any tax is always an uphill battle but that  the council should have responded more often to critics' accusations of  mismanagement and corruption.  </P> <P> "Ninety-nine percent of the time we don't respond because the charges are so  outlandish," he said.  </P> <P> Lopez said the recent surge in commercial and industrial development in Oxnard  may lead to higher tax revenues in about five or six years but will do nothing  toward solving the city's current fiscal crisis.  </P> <P> He said the city's financial woes were partly created in 1987 when the City  Council eliminated a 4% utility tax two years before it was to have ended. He  said that alone cost the city between $7 million and $8 million.  </P> <P> George Lauterbach, president of the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce, disagreed. He  said the utility tax was only generating about $1.5 million annually when it  was eliminated.  </P> <P> He said the city's fiscal crisis was due to a history of bad spending decisions  by the City Council. For example, he questioned why the council has agreed to  spend $13 million for a new library when it is unable to raise enough revenue  to keep the current library open daily.  </P> <P> "The message is that people are feeling that things have not gone well," he  said.  </P> <P> In a report to the council last week, City Manager David Mora recommended  eliminating 64 positions -- including 16 police officers and eight firefighters  -- to balance next year's budget.  </P> <P> The budget-cutting measures include closure of the Carnegie Art Museum, the  elimination of Sunday library hours, the cancellation of the Community Center  Youth Recreation Program and elimination of a $400,000 annual donation to the  Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> Had the tax increase been approved, the city would have used part of the new  revenues to hire 36 additional employees -- including 15 new police officers  and 13 new firefighters, Mora's report says.  </P> <P> Terry Dempsey, campaign manager for Citizens for Public Safety, said he  believes that voters rejected the tax increase based on a gut reaction.  </P> <P> "It's a natural instinct for us not to like a tax," he said.  </P> <P> Although his group had urged voters to approve the measure to retain current  levels of police and fire service, Dempsey said the defeat does not reflect a  rejection of the city's police and fire departments.  </P> <P> He said voters probably rejected the tax increase because they disagree with  the way the council has been handling its finances. Dempsey, a professional  campaign manager who worked as an aide to 1988 presidential candidate Alexander  Haig, credited opponents of the measure for playing to voter frustration with  the council.  </P> <P> However, he said there is now a "feeling of impending doom" among police and  firefighters who fear the council will order layoffs in their departments to  offset a deficit.  </P> <P> Several of the measure's biggest supporters -- including Mayor Nao Takasugi,  Bill Lewis, president of the Oxnard Peace Officers Assn., and Bill Gallaher,  president of the Oxnard Firefighters Assn. -- did not return phone calls  Wednesday. Dempsey speculated that some of Measure C's supporters were laying  low after the vote.  </P></p>

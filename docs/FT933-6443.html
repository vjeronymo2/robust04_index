			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and Renault in sharp falls VOLKSWAGEN and Renault, two of Europe's leading volume carmakers, yesterday announced a dramatic deterioration in their financial performances under the impact of the steep fall in west European new car sales this year. Volvo of Sweden, which is expected soon to complete a full merger with Renault, achieved a modest return to profit, however, after suffering heavy net losses in 1990 and 1992 and operating losses in 1991 and 1992. Renault, the French state-controlled car and commercial vehicle maker said that its pre-tax profits had plunged by almost 90 per cent in the first six months this year to only FFr730m (Pounds 84m) from FFr5.4bn in the same period a year ago. It warned that it saw 'no sign of recovery in the European market for cars and commercial vehicles,' and would cut production in the second half. Volkswagen, the beleaguered leader of the European car industry, confirmed that it had lost DM1.6bn (Pounds 640m) in the first six months of 1993, a DM2bn reversal from the profit of DM445m in the first half of last year. The scale of VW's losses was reduced considerably in the second quarter, however, and the company, which is in the midst of drastic restructuring, said it was working hard to achieve the 'turning point' in profitability in the second half. Renault, which is in the process of extending its alliance with Volvo into a full merger, declined to comment on the state of its negotiations with the Swedish vehicle maker. Sources in the French government, which is keen for the merger to be completed to clear the way for Renault's privatisation, believe that a final agreement could be completed within weeks. Swedish financial analysts, who had predicted losses of up to SKr550m (Pounds 46m) at Volvo for the first six months, said the group's better-than-expected result could strengthen its hand in the merger negotiations with Renault, which are expected to reach a conclusion next month. Volvo said the results from both companies would not affect the substance of the negotiations, however. Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, said that Renault's first-half result was better than the performance of many of its competitors and was commendable given the sharp decline in the European car market.

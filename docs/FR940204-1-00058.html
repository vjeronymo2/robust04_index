The State must identify the resources which are available to complete UAM modeling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pages 10 through 13 describe the resources being utilized to complete the enormous task of UAM-based modeling demonstration. There are ten separate organizations and agencies that MDNR and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency have organized into two committees to provide input to the UAM. The committees are the ``UAM Policy and Oversight Committee'' and the ``Ozone Technical Subcommittee.'' Additionally, MDNR provided a list of the individuals responsible for conducting certain portions of the UAM demonstration and a list of the equipment which has been made available to execute the model and the post processing analysis. EPA believes that the State has provided an adequate demonstration of resources available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The State must provide a schedule outlining the milestones that have been and will be achieved towards the completion of the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT rules. The schedule must include a date for final submittal of rules to EPA. The date for submitting the final rules to EPA must be no later than 12 months after EPA's final approval of the committal SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Page 6 of the SIP submission contains an enforceable schedule. Critical dates included in this schedule are the UAM final submission date (November 15, 1993) and submittal of final NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT regulations to EPA (October 31, 1994). Missouri failed to submit the final UAM modeling exercise by November 15, 1993. However, EPA Region VII is working closely with the state on this submission. We are encouraged by Missouri's progress and we believe that the submission of the final NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT regulations (if necessary) will not be delayed beyond October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that MDNR has committed to submit the final NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT regulations six months before implementation of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT is required by the Act. It should be noted that further failure by the state to meet the applicable milestones listed in the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT schedule contained in the SIP submission will affect EPA's determination to issue final conditional approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to approve Missouri's commitment to adopt NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT rules for the St. Louis area because it meets the requirements of section 110(k)(4) of the CAA and conforms to the policy in the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Supplement to the General Preamble (cited above), and the memorandums from Deputy Assistant Administrator Michael Shapiro of July 22, 1992, and September 16, 1992, concerning the SIP submittals due November 15, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Procedural Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Act requires states to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a state must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing. Section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions of section 110(a)(2). Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a state under the Act must be adopted by such state after reasonable notice and public hearing. The state of Missouri held a public hearing on April 29, 1993, on the commitment to adopt NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT rules for St. Louis. Following the public hearing, the commitment was adopted by the state and signed by the Director of MDNR on May 27, 1993, and submitted to EPA on June 14, 1993, as a revision to the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. RACT Determination and Implementation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> States_including those for which EPA approves a commitment to adopt an NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT rule_are expected to require final installation of the actual NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls by May 31, 1995, from sources for which installation by that date is practicable. The NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Supplement to the General Preamble (57 FR 55623) contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACT requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Implications of This Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to approve the commitment for adoption of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  RACT rule(s) as an SIP revision submitted to EPA for the St. Louis area June 14, 1993. Section 110(k)(4) of the Act provides that where EPA takes final action to approve a commitment to submit an SIP or portion of an SIP, the state must fulfill that commitment (i.e., submit the required SIP or portion thereof) within one year following EPA approval. If the state does not fulfill its commitment by submitting the SIP or revision to EPA within that year, the Act requires that the SIP be disapproved. If EPA disapproves the SIP for failing to meet the commitment, there are several additional consequences. As provided under section 179 of the Act, the state of Missouri would have up to 18 months after a final SIP disapproval to correct the deficiencies that are the subject of the disapproval, before EPA is required to impose either the highway funding restriction or the requirement for two-to-one new source review offsets. If the state has not corrected its deficiencies within six months after imposing the first sanction, EPA must impose the second sanction. Any sanction EPA imposes must remain in place until EPA determines that the state has come into compliance. If EPA ultimately disapproves all or part of the SIP submittal for the St. Louis nonattainment area and the state of Missouri fails to correct the deficiency within 18 months of such disapproval, EPA anticipates that the first sanction it would impose would be the two-to-one offset requirement. Note also that any final disapproval would trigger the 24-month clock for EPA to impose a federal implementation plan as provided under section 110(c)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

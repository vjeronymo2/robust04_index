			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines rejected binding arbitration in the 16-month-old contract  dispute with its largest union. The National Mediation Board began mediating  the Eastern-Machinists talks a year ago. Under its rules, the refusal of one of  the parties to submit to binding arbitration will lead to declaration of an  impasse. That triggers a 30-day "cooling-off period." If there is no  settlement, the union may strike and the company may impose its own work  conditions on the union employees.  </P></p>

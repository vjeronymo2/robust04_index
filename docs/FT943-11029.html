			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Franchise system legal aid launched About a quarter of legal-aid services in England and Wales will be provided through the Legal Aid Board's new franchising operation, it was announced at the scheme's official launch yesterday. Mr Stephen Orchard, the board's chief executive, said about 1,000 solicitors' offices had had their applications to become franchisees accepted. Under the scheme, firms of solicitors which meet performance and management criteria are awarded franchises by the board for particular areas of legally aided work. The scheme is intended to improve the delivery of legal services, but has been criticised by some in the profession for being over-rigid in its control and likely to undermine the freedom of solicitors to conduct cases as they think best.</p>

Police say no one was injured in the  attacks. Following an attempted bombing attack on an  asylum-seeker's home in Hohenstein-Steckenroth, Hesse, an arrest  warrant was issued for a man who has confessed to the incident.  The 20-year-old man said his motive was a hatred of foreigners.    According to police, a fire in an asylum-seekers' home in  Nuremberg, in which one Turkish man died, was an accident that  had no political background.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MONTE VISTA WINS TITLE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME  </P> <P> Joe McNaull, the center for the Monte Vista High School basketball team, knew  it was going in. Coach Zack Peck knew as well. The one thing forward Jeff  Polinsky wasn't sure of was the time on the clock when the soft left-handed  jumper left his fingers.  </P> <P> Sometime between :0001 and 00:00 is about right. The shot hit nothing but net  to give Monte Vista a 38-37 victory over Helix and the championship of the  Grossmont League's 3-A Division Tuesday evening at Monte Vista.  </P> <P> "I had no idea what time it was," Polinsky said after crawling out from under a  pile of teammates and fans.  </P> <P> With 3:54 remaining, it didn't appear as if No. 8 Monte Vista would get a  chance to shoot to win. With McNaull, a 6-foot-9 junior, spending 5:39 through  the middle of the second half on the bench with four fouls, Helix (16-6, 6-2)  had gone on a 11-2 run to take a 35-32 lead.  </P> <P> McNaull left the game with 2:53 remaining in the third quarter. The run began  with Helix's 6-8 senior center, John Pressler, scoring at the buzzer to end the  period and had reached 9-2 when Peck put McNaull back in with 5:14 to play. But  by the time the run ended on a rebound basket by Chris Masilon, Monte Vista had  begun to turn things around.  </P> <P> Helix abandoned the patient offense that allowed it to stay in the game and  started jamming the ball inside to Pressler, who went straight after McNaull  looking for the fifth foul. The first time, Pressler dribbled the ball off his  foot. The next four times, Pressler leaned into McNaull as he shot. But McNaull  held his ground, and the shots wouldn't fall.  </P> <P> "I knew they were going to try to foul me out," McNaull said. "I had to keep my  feet and not commit any stupid fouls."  </P> <P> Only once did someone other than McNaull grab those missed shots, and that was  when Masilon got his only basket of the game.  </P> <P> Monte Vista then came back. Jason Peters hit a shot in the lane with 2:30 to  play to cut the deficit to 35-34. After rebounding a Pressler miss, McNaull  came down and drilled a 10-foot baseline turnaround over his counterpart for  36-35 lead with 1:52 to play.  </P> <P> Helix called timeout, then went to Pressler. McNaull rebounded, and Monte Vista  began to stall the final minute away. Helix only had two team fouls, so fouling  made no sense. Helix needed a steal.  </P> <P> With 15 seconds left, Monte Vista's Curt Howard was trapped by three players in  a corner at midcourt. Helix's Todd McTrusty stole the ball and drove to the  basket. Anticipating a foul, he tossed the ball wildly over his head with his  right hand. To the amazement of most, it went in with 11 seconds left. Monte  Vista called timeout with 8 seconds to go.  </P> <P> "We ran a special play to go inside to (McNaull) and run back door," Polinsky  said. "Howard screened for me, and I came across and shot the jumper."  </P> <P> There appeared to be confusion as the play unfolded. Polinsky faked and  dribbled into the lane, but it didn't appear as if he would get the shot off.  </P> <P> "Jeff's the guy you want the ball to go to," Peck said. "He's just an excellent  shooter, he's uncanny."  </P> <P> Polinsky had 14 for Monte Vista (16-4, 8-0), and McNaull added 12 points, five  rebounds and four blocks. Pressler had 21 points, two blocks and three rebounds  for Helix. JEFFREY PARENTI  </P></p>

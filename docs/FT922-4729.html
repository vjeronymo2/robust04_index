			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The EC after the veto THE DANES' rejection of the Maastricht treaty is a substantial setback for the politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels and Copenhagen, both of whom fought to win a 'yes' to European union from this small and sceptical electorate. But all is not lost, certainly not for the European Community, or even for hopes of economic and monetary union. There could even be gains. What may now have to be devised, though only after careful and cool reflection, is an EC that allows still greater diversity of commitments among its members than envisaged in the Maastricht treaty. Such a Community would, in any case, best tackle the twin tasks of widening and deepening that confront it. The referendum cloud which descended yesterday on Brussels contains silver linings. From the moment the ink was dry on the Maastricht agreement, it has been evident that the treaty contained powerful contradictions. By sharpening the focus of governments and electorates on what was agreed by the River Maas, some of these contradictions may now be resolved. Whether a more positive outcome is reached will depend on how the rest of the EC reacts to the Danish shot fired across their collective gunwales. Hard though it might be, Mr Jacques Delors, Mr Helmut Kohl and Mr Francois Mitterrand should try to avoid falling into depression. There are ways to resolve their immediate problem. It might, for example, be possible for the other 11 nations to implement important parts of the Maastricht agreement - for instance, on economic and monetary union, or on foreign policy co-operation - by swiftly moving to a new legislative basis, independent of that agreed last year. The 11 could even carry on the ratification process presently in hand and hope to steer the Danes on board, perhaps through yet another referendum. Yet the tone of 'Euro-business as usual' adopted in Bonn and Paris yesterday is not entirely convincing. The problem is not merely that the legitimacy of the consent granted by the Danish people in such circumstances would have to be doubted. The greater difficulty is that the Danes may be articulating doubts that are more widely shared. If the leaders of Europe have, in fact, advanced too far ahead of their peoples, they leave not merely themselves but the achievements of the EC itself vulnerable to populist, even xenophobic counter-attack. Better than attempt to continue with business as usual would be to take stock and consider how best to deal with the challenge now presented. Wildly irresponsible In the first place, it would be wildly irresponsible to suggest that the failure to ratify this treaty, should that eventually happen, must threaten the achievements of the EC. The EC, as it is, is the basis for the prosperity and stability of western Europe. A failure to go forward would not make it necessary, let alone advisable, for anyone to dream of going backwards. In the second place, it might be wise to consider ways of allowing member states to go beyond where they are now at different speeds and even in different ways. The Schengen group of countries committed to the abolition of border controls is an example. The Benelux was an earlier one. It would not be impossible, for example, for a treaty on economic and monetary union to be agreed among a number of member states, even on the lines agreed at Maastricht. Any central bank thus set up would ultimately replace the Bundesbank within the EMS, leaving to outsiders the same relationship with the core participants as they now have. Irregular shifts In the third place, a more fluid structure would have the merit of making enlargement of the EC easier than seemed possible under the Maastricht framework, without further administrative change. Progress towards a more united Europe would then occur through irregular shifts, with the different countries maintaining freedom to decide which of several concentric European circles of integration they wish to join. Last but not least, inflation convergence and exchange rate stabilisation within the EC (indeed, within western Europe as a whole) predates the debate about Emu, let alone the outcome of the inter-governmental conference. There is no reason why it should not continue, even if the prospect of Emu were to become less immediate. The reason for convergence was the willingness of EC member states to pursue the necessary policies. The orthodox doctrine has spread in the course of the 1980s from its Germanic core to places as far afield as Dublin, London, Madrid and Lisbon. It is an economic, not a political, doctrine. Governments must now restate their commitment both to exchange rate stability and to the fiscal policies laid down in the Maastricht treaty. They should do so, for the sound reason that it is in their own individual interest to do so. If the member states make such a commitment credible, then the disruption in bond and exchange rate markets that some now fear need not happen. In fact, long-term interest rates - the best single measure of the markets' expectations for long-term inflation and exchange rates - are no closer together than are the current rates of inflation. So the markets do not seem to be persuaded that Emu is inevitable. Provided governments act appropriately, markets should also not conclude that continued convergence is impossible. For some countries this poses a major challenge, Italy being the most important. But it is a challenge that Italy would have had to meet, in any case. The essential requirements now are neither to panic nor to ignore what has happened. It would be wrong to panic, partly because so much has already been achieved within the EC; still more because the members of the EC possess other ways of achieving the integration of Europe as a whole. It would be equally foolish to ignore what has happened. The EC is an association of democratic states. It will survive only with the consent of its peoples. The failure to win that consent must lead to consideration of why that has happened. If policymakers must now rethink at least some of what they agreed, so be it. In the long run, only thus will they be able to build a durable, contented and integrated Community.</p>

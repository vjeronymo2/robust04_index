Groups of the Ismaili and Uzbek militias,  and other Communist opposition groups, are concentrated there  now.    In a telephone contact with AL-HAYAH in Jeddah, the Afghan  sources made little of the attacks that the Uzbek militias,  under the command of General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, are launching  against the capital, Kabul, and described them as "desparate."  They indicated that the government forces had three days ago  taken large amounts of booty in the form of weapons, ammunition,  and tremendous quantities of fuel and provisions. They said that  the Communist militias had been preparing their men and large  quantities of arms, ammunition, and supplies for an attack on  northern Kabul from the Pol-e Khomri region. They described the  amount of booty which the government forces had captured as  "inconceivable, praise God."</p>

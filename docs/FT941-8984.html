			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Bottomley hits at ineffective NHS surgery Hospital doctors carry out too many operations that are clinically ineffective and cause unnecessary costs to the National Health Service, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, will say today. Mrs Bottomley, in a speech to be delivered to a conference in Birmingham, will launch a campaign to ensure that more operations are driven by 'fact not fashion'. She will also argue that new research and development techniques need to be applied systematically to the whole of the NHS. According to Mrs Bottomley the prevailing view on the necessity for some operations has changed, and the NHS needs to concentrate money on activities that bring the most benefit. In an advance copy of the speech she calls into question the method of treating 'glue ear' - the illness that was at the heart of a political storm in the last general election campaign, when a girl called 'Jennifer' was highlighted as having failed to receive treatment quickly enough. Mrs Bottomley supports the view that 'the optimal medical treatment for Jennifer might well have been to wait'. The health secretary also claims that old-fashioned methods may sometimes bring surprising results in treatment. She asks: 'Who would have thought that the humble leech, passed over by the age of reason and science, would be making a comeback as part of the plastic surgeon's repertoire of micro-surgical techniques?' Mrs Bottomley says that managers 'do have a proper role keeping up the pressure by reminding clinicians that when a decision is made, a cheque is written'. She also calls for patients to be involved more fully in the decisions over whether an operation should be carried out. 'The patient, who has to live with the consequences, has a right to be involved in these dilemmas.' Mrs Bottomley outlines three ways in which clinical effectiveness could be raised: Using research to find out what works and to evaluate costs. Using education, clinical guidelines and contracts between purchasers and providers to promote what works. Using clinical audit to assess the effectiveness of what is done.</p>

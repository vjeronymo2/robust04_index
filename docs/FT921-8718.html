			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Travel: The fun of Flims - Skiing so many duchesses, darling - or if you find Davos dull on third acquaintance, then Flims, just 90 minutes south-east from Zurich, could be right up your schuss. Flims is a ski resort for those who think they have 'done' Switzerland. It has a large, pretty ski area which, although not particularly challenging, holds enough slopes to keep an intermediate happy for a week. It is not overcrowded, is relatively high and is convenient for airport transfers. Best of all, it is very little-known to British skiers - no Hoorays on the slopes or gluhwein-louts on the streets. Both Flims and its sister-village of Laax, a few miles away, are cradled amid a sunny bowl which faces south-east and is called Der Weissen Arena - the White Arena. It is a long-established resort with several new lifts, opening-up a relatively well-interconnected 'ski circus.' Flims Dorf, the original village, wends along a busy main road. There is little Alpine romance here; it is a working village with the usual cluster of bars, banks and (expensive) ski-hire shops for tourists. The Albana bar is within staggering distance of the two main ski lifts - a three-man chair to Foppa and a four-man to Naraus, from which there are (occasionally icy) red runs back - and the two-stage gondola to a wider ski area at Startgels. Flims Waldhaus, just up the road towards Laax, is more sedately attractive: a cluster of cafes, shops and purpose-built hotels, among them the slightly fantastical Schweizerhof, which perches like a wedding cake among the trees; the smart Adula, with its gourmet Barga restaurant; and the five-star Park Hotel. In both villages, apres-ski is more muted than manic; but then, many find that a major attraction. Much of the best sport is to be had in the La Siala area. It is largely wide-open, motorway skiing, but hugely enjoyable in good snow. Better skiers should seek out the black descent from Crassons or (in good snow) the steep paths down to Plaun. The piste station of Crap Sogn Gion is served by a cable-car from Murschteg, a purpose-built satellite of Laax. The run under the cable-car is used as a downhill course but can be tackled by a confident intermediate. There are nice, fast red runs from much of the Crap Sogn Gion area, but the great attraction is higher up, on the black run off the Vorab glacier: knee-tremblingly steep for a short while, then a long descent full of swooping and whooping down to Alp Ruschein. The White Arena is well served with largely self-service mountain restaurants, although even the cavernous ones such as Nagens tend to fill quickly at lunch-times. The food is standard hearty German fare; for those whose frozen tongues cannot get around the word weinerschnitzel, nearly everyone in Flims speaks English. One of the best restaurants is the Runcahohe, tucked away in the trees towards the bottom pistes of Flims Dorf, although the long pole to reach it renders one incapable of little more than falling into a chair and calling weakly for the house speciality, coffee laced with a near-terminal dose of rum. A couple of these make the easy, but pretty, tree-lined run back to base more interesting. The real cognoscente soon discover the delightfully-uncrowded farming hamlet of Falera, reached by a long, fast blue run from Crap Sogn Gion or (lower down) the Curnius chairlift. It has a couple of hotels for lunch, two pretty churches, a distinct aroma of cow, and friendly locals who seem surprised that any skier should bother to drop in for . . . well, anything really. It also has the World's Slowest Chair Lift back to Curnius. And that is Flims: unpretentious, efficient, pretty and, although day-to-day expensive, less so than its super-posh near neighbours. Drawbacks? One, and it is T-shaped. In common with many Swiss resorts, Flims suffers from the curse of the T-bar, the silliest ski-lift known to man. There are dozens of the things. And at the head of the queue for the busiest, flashiest T-bar of all, I fell off. Right in front of everyone. And got on again. And fell off again. And again. Until an aged and kindly Swiss gentleman helped me on, and off at the top. He even offered to carry my ski poles. Oh, the shame of it. Thank God there were no Brits there to see me .. Andrew Anderson travelled to Flims with Powder Byrne Original Skiing (071-223-0601) which offers five hotels and one chalet in the resort. Prices range between Pounds 568 and Pounds 684 a person per week for half board in the three-star Waldek Hotel, to between Pounds 860 and Pounds 1,050 in the five-star Park Hotel, depending on season. Powder Byrne 'ski managers' will ski with holidaymakers every day if clients wish - a useful service. The lift pass costs around Pounds 95. Other operators to Flims include Swiss Travel Service and Made To Measure. Flims' close proximity to Zurich means it is a useful long weekend destination; there are regular scheduled flights on SwissAir from London Heathrow to Zurich, or long weekends can be tailor-made by Powder Byrne.</p>

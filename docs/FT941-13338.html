			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Conglomerates have their place Sir, A view from this side of the Atlantic on the validity of conglomeration as a viable corporate strategy ('Diversify and die', January 4). The fact is that the most successful US corporations in the 1980s were conglomerates. It was just that they were not called conglomerates - they were called 'leveraged buy-out' (LBO) partnerships. Consider KKR: from nothing, to more than Dollars 40bn in revenues and nearly 400,000 employees in 20 years, with returns to investors of up to 50 per cent a year. Not a bad performance. The truth is there is no one right sort of corporate strategy. Conglomerates are neither universally good nor bad. A good corporate strategy is one that leverages a unique set of resources - physical assets or intangible assets such as brand name or consumer marketing skills - into those businesses where they contribute to competitive advantage. The valuable resource conglomerates possess is usually a tight financial control system. This can create value for market-leading companies in mature, low-technology industries by creating managerial incentives for efficiency. Conglomeration is, and will continue to be, a viable corporate strategy in a limited set of industries, and for businesses with a particular market position.

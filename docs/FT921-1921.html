			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Design tour de force ANYONE interested in furnishing options might like to know about Chelsea Design Week which runs from tomorrow until Friday. Some 20 companies in the interior design industry (all London-based and including Designers Guild, Nobilis-Fontan, John Cullen Lighting, Liberty, Colefax &amp; Fowler) keep open house to visitors every day from 10 am to 5 pm (until 7.30 pm on Wednesday). You can start your tour by signing up at any of the participating showrooms ( tel: 071-233-5971 for details) and from then on a fleet of cars will whisk you from one port of call to another. Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, London SW1 is bidding to become more than just a source of designer labels for ladies who lunch. It is now a serious contender in the home furnishing stakes. This week it launched several more interior-design-linked concessions on its fourth floor. Last year I reported on the arrival of the Ralph Lauren home collection and the launch of the Mulberry At Home range - now there are 10 more concessions which greatly extend the choice on offer. Global Village is there with its brand of sophisticated ethnic furniture and artefacts. Belinda Coote's tapestries and hand-painted furniture nestle besides Kenneth Turner's floral decorations. There are Persian carpets and kelims in the oriental carpet department, fine linens and layettes at The Monogrammed Linen shop, china and glass at Thomas Goode, decorative items for home and garden from Un Jardin . . . en plus. Wilson &amp; Gough have a marvellous selection of one-off hand-crafted pieces for the home while Bougies la Francaise has candles, candles . . . and more candles. Finally, there is Smythson, of Bond Street, for everything from diaries to invitation cards and headed writing paper.</p>

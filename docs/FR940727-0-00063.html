DA personnel served with civil or criminal process concerning a proceeding in which the United States has an interest (&sect;516.15) will immediately inform their supervisor and furnish copies of process and pleadings. There is no requirement to notify supervisors of purely private litigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Supervisory procedures. When supervisors learn that legal proceedings in which the United States has an interest have commenced, the supervisor will forward a copy of all process and pleadings, along with other readily available information, to the SJA or legal adviser. If no legal officer is available locally, the documents will be forwarded to the SJA or legal adviser of the next higher headquarters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.17  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> SJA or legal adviser procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Immediate notice to HQDA. When an SJA or legal adviser learns of litigation in which the United States has an interest, and it appears that HQDA is not aware of the action, the SJA or legal adviser will telephonically notify the responsible HQDA office. (See &sect;516.15(c)). Immediate notice is particularly important when litigation involves one of the following: a lawsuit against an employee in his individual capacity; a motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction; a habeas corpus proceeding; a judicial or administrative proceeding involving less than 60 days to file an answer; and, actions with possible Congressional, Secretarial, or Army Staff interest. For legal proceedings instituted in foreign tribunals, the SJA or legal adviser will also notify the major overseas commander concerned and the appropriate U.S. Embassy or Legation. A telephonic report to HQDA should include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Title or style of the proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Full names and addresses of the parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Tribunal in which the action is filed, date filed, docket number, when and on whom service of process was made, and date by which pleading or response is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Nature of the action, amount claimed or relief sought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Reasons for immediate action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Transmission of process, pleadings, and related papers. Unless instructed otherwise by HQDA, the SJA or legal adviser will FAX or mail HQDA a copy of all process, pleadings, and related papers. Use of express mail or overnight delivery service is authorized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Notice to U.S. Attorney. If the legal proceeding is instituted in the United States, the SJA or legal adviser, unless instructed otherwise by HQDA, will notify the appropriate U.S. Attorney and render assistance as required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.18  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Litigation alleging individual liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Subpart D for procedures to follow when DA personnel, as a result of performance of official duties, are either sued in their individual capacities or face criminal charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;516.19  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Injunctive relief. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. Plaintiffs may attempt to force government action or restraint in important operational matters or pending personnel actions through motions for temporary restraining orders (TRO) or preliminary injunctions (PI). Because these actions can quickly impede military functions, immediate and decisive action must be taken. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Notification to HQDA and U.S. Attorney. The SJA or legal adviser will immediately notify Litigation Division or other appropriate office at HQDA when a motion for TRO or PI has been, or is about to be, filed. The SJA or legal adviser will also notify the responsible U.S. Attorney. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Neritan Ceka, known among the people as Neritan  Alia, the bootlicker of Milosevic and the denouncer of Astrit  Qorri, thinks that his declarations make him credible. Aware  that he is branded for many reasons, he thinks that he might  ease the burden on himself. It is no use. No water can cleanse  his sins nor those who surround him. In mid-January, Shkoder was  added to these sins. The Shkoder incident is a continuation of  their pro-Serb policy, after the pro-Serb exposition made in the  hall, and is an indictment of them in every way. It is the  Serbs and their Allies who want the destabilization of Albania,  an Albania exhausted by civil war, and an Albania divided on  religious lines, to achieve their anti-Albanian aims, easily  delivering a fatal blow to democracy in stir country in order to  settle accounts in Kosova. It is the Serbs and their allies who  are distressed by the trial according to democratic justice of  Ramiz Alia and Fatos Nano, the spawn and successors of Enver,  who served the Serbs and their allies until his end. These and  other related motives also explain what happened recently in  Shkoder and, in general, the whole campaign of the left-wing  extremists against democracy and the democratic regime in  Albania. They are attempting in this way to rescue Ramiz Alias  Fates Nano, and others who collaborated in their crimes, theft,  and corruption. However, these wretches have erred in their  calculations. The justice which put their godfathers in their  places will not find it difficult to deal with their vassals and  bootlickers, with adventurers who show no sense of  responsibility for the destiny of the country and the people.</p>

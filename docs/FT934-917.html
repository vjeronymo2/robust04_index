			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: It is all a question of taste - Television Poor little French television producers and film directors: great big Yankee bullies are forcing unwilling Frenchmen to sit down and watch Hill Street Blues and coralling them into cinemas to watch Basic Instinct when all they really wanted to do, left to their own devices, was luxuriate in French television's literary marathon Apostrophe and watch exciting Jean Luc Godard films? There there. Never mind, the exclusion of film and television programmes from the new Gatt agreement will no doubt enable you to put a stop to all that. If by some wild chance it does not, and your fellow countrymen wilfully persist in watching Miami Vice and Terminator Treize you will just have to pass a few laws banning Hitchcock movies and rationing viewers to one American sitcom a week. To ensure they are doing as they are told you may need to install home monitoring devices to watch all viewers as they view. You could call this 'Grand Frere'. Can there really be anybody in France, even the most heavily bearded, thickly tweed jacketed, Gitane smoking director of art house movies, who seriously believes that you can legislate for taste? Or is the idea to build a cultural Berlin Wall to restrict the French to French culture and stop them being seduced by another, more attractive? To ask such sarcastic questions is not to imply that Shane is 'better' than The Three Musketeers (though that is not inconceivable) or that The Golden Girls is superior to . . . well, whatever the French equivalent may be. Significantly the French equivalent has not exactly taken the world by storm, though that is not because other countries have erected tariff barriers to exclude French comedy. The sarcasm is prompted by the bizarre sight (whoops, sorry, cannot have French words invading the English language - the peculiar sight) of an ancient European culture attempting, at the end of the 20th century, to use tariff barriers to stop its people experiencing a newer, younger, culture which is seen to be (presumably, otherwise why all the anxiety?) more powerful and more popular. None of which is to deny sympathy for the protectionists' object; only for their methods. Of course any intelligent viewer wants to see preserved and even extended that part of the culture which is full of insight, beauty, truth, enlightenment, joy, curiosity, revelation, and artistic sensibility and not merely that which is entertaining, scandalous or shocking. Anyone living in the UK, and especially in the capital city, during the past year must have noticed the signs that, at least as far as television is concerned, Britain is drifting, or perhaps steaming, in a similar direction. Programmes on the ITV network in general and on Carlton, the new London weekday station in particular, have been not so much slipping down market as galloping. The network which used to bring us such serious current affairs series as First Tuesday, This Week and Viewpoint now brings us The Big Story, Blues And Twos ('See the old lady trapped under the lorry] Hear her whimper]') and Hollywood Women which might have been better entitled Hollywood Boobs. It would be absurd to suggest that everything appearing on the old ITV was magnificent and everything appearing on the new version is appalling. For years the old ITV got away with screening Crossroads not once but twice and even three times a week. Much of the embarrassing rubbish they show today was developed under the old system: Blind Date, Beadle's About, Prisoner Cell Block H and much more. Conversely, some of the programmes shown by ITV in the past 12 months, whether from long established series or new ones, have been excellent. The drama series that has just finished, All Or Nothing At All, about a City charmer who tries to make others happy by providing 100 per cent per annum interest for his friends and colleagues, and then blows all their investments on the horses was, by any reckoning, impressive. Cracker was outstanding. A recent report by Trevor Phillips in The London Programme, about black people systematically defrauding the social services, and organised corruption among blacks in local government, was astonishing. Had it been made by a white man it would never have been screened. Phillips is a brave man. But whatever the exceptions they are memorable because they do prove the rule: that whereas the people in ITV used to be interested in competing with the BBC for kudos as well as audiences, today their eyes are fixed unswervingly on the ratings. Once upon a time when the BBC rejected The Naked Civil Servant, declaring it untransmittable, Carlton's predecessor, Thames TV, commissioned the drama and won worldwide admiration and shelves full of awards. It is inconceivable that Carlton would do the same today: even if someone inside the company recognised the quality and wanted to commission the programme, the risk (which is to say the chance of failing to make a large profit) would be too great. This indicates a radical and sad change, due almost entirely to Thatcherite broadcasting legislation. Tell that to today's ITV executives and they run their thumbs down the backs of their Armani lapels, smile (you may say 'sneer' but I could not possibly comment) and tell you that they simply do not make programmes for television critics any more. This is their way of agreeing that considerations of quality and prestige have now gone by the board and ratings are indeed the sole criterion. And why is that? For a while they will try to maintain that their only aim is to satisfy the largest possible number of viewers, but later in the evening, when they become honest, they will admit that all that really counts is making the largest possible amount of money. And why not? Do not grocers and hairdressers maximise profits by satisfying as many people as possible? Of course . . . as do drug dealers and prostitutes. Perish the thought that one should compare ITV executives to such people, but the idea that they are culturally neutral suppliers of services like grocers or hairdressers is disingenuous. Perhaps it does not matter; perhaps such a change is desirable. Rupert Murdoch and others have always claimed that too many of the programmes on British television, so obviously a mass medium, are made by middle class trendies for middle class trendies. If ITV as a federal network (even though it still includes companies such as Granada where quality counts for a lot) continues to jettison its old high quality series and goes all out instead for ratings using scandal, hypnosis shows, cringe-telly, ambulance chasing, and big breasts, why should that matter? In a sense it does not. We tolerate vulgar trash in newspapers, books, music and most areas of our culture and nobody assumes that the hideous rubbish which comprises so much popular music will somehow destroy Verdi operas or Beethoven symphonies. In this we seem to differ from the French. The important thing, surely, is to see that the cultural influences available to us are wide ranging. The danger is that television is a very young medium, still developing, and has not yet escaped from government control. The baby could be lost with the bath water. So long as we continue to have the BBC providing a full range of programmes, including those of very high quality, perhaps it does not matter if ITV lowers its sights and throws in its lot with the comics, paperbacks and pop concerts which constitute so much of mass culture. It would certainly be both pathetic and patronising to attempt to legislate for public taste a la Francais. But we should be open and honest about what is happening. If ITV moves off determinedly down market, so be it. We should note the move, plot it with care, and take greater trouble than ever to sustain the BBC.</p>

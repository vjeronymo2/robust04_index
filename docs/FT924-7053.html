			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: Daihatsu suffers Y4.92bn loss DAIHATSU, the Japanese carmaker which specialises in minicars, yesterday announced that the downturn in the country's economy had forced it into its first loss since the second world war. Daihatsu joins Nissan and Mazda Motors as the car manufacturers which have been hit worst by the slowdown in Japanese consumer spending. Nissan last week declared a first-half loss and Mazda reported a fall in pre-tax profits of more than 70 per cent. In contrast Toyota, the leading manufacturer, and Honda have managed to contain the impact of the downturn on their finances. Daihatsu, which is affiliated to Toyota, reported pre-tax losses of Y4.92bn (Dollars 39.67m) for the six months to the end of September. This compares with pre-tax profits of Y3.63bn in the first half of last year. Its net losses amounted to Y4.94bn, against profits of Y2.24bn in the first half of 1991. The company said that it would not pay senior executives a winter bonus and halved its interim dividend to Y1.5. Daihatsu blamed the the sharp deterioration in its finances on rising sales and labour costs which outstripped its 2.5 per cent increase in turnover to Y391m for the half-year. The value of Daihatsu's sales rose mainly due to production of higher priced models for Toyota. However, sales volume fell by 12 per cent to 287,000 units in the first six months of the year.</p>

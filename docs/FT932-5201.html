			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (7): Some effective cards to play - Tourism / Improving quality of life is an attraction MID GLAMORGAN is succeeding in attracting people not just as workers in the new industries that are replacing the coal mines, but as tourists. The county, the most industrial in south Wales and in parts the most deprived, may seem an unlikely magnet for tourists, but there is a potential that is being increasingly exploited. Mr Paul Loveluck, chief executive of the Wales Tourist Board, which has played a big part in promoting new attractions, says: 'We have never got it out of perspective, and tourism cannot replace the old traditional industries, but but it can have a growing role in bringing much needed employment to the area.' Mid Glamorgan, despite its image of valleys scarred by pitheaps and steelworks, has always had some effective tourism cards to play, including an unspoilt stretch of coastline, the family seaside resort of Porthcawl, wild moorland including the fringes of the Brecon Beacons, and Caerphilly Castle, one of the greatest surviving medieval castles in Europe, rivalled in size in the UK only by Windsor. What has been happening in recent years has been the addition to this list of examples of the area's unique industrial history. Rhondda heritage park is probably the best known example of the local community's determination to construct a future from its past. Despite the relatively undeveloped state of the county's tourist industry, it already employs more than 4,000 people, which puts it ahead of transport, metal manufacture and vehicles, and the trend is upwards. If indirect employment and the multiplier effect of tourists' spending is taken into account, the total exceeds 7,000. The tourism potential of the industrial heritage of the valleys began to be appreciated in the mid 1980s. A marketing campaign, starting from modest beginnings, was given added impetus in 1987 when Ebbw Vale in neighbouring Gwent was chosen for the 1982 national garden festival. The intention was to give visitors to the coast and to the urban centres of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport a reason for going up into the valleys, and a series of attractions for day visitors was promoted. 'We were given a boost by the garden festival,' says Mr Loveluck. 'It achieved one of its objectives of changing people's perceptions of this part of Wales, and many of the festival's 2m visitors have either returned to the valleys or have said they will.' A tourism strategy for the area was launched in 1988 and an initial Pounds 1m was allocated to tourism projects in the industrial valleys. When this was used up in a year, additional resources were found. The campaign has been geared essentially to day visitors, but in 1990 accommodation began to be promoted in order to persuade visitors to stay longer. There was plenty of room for improvement as the available hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation in the mid-80s was sparse and often of indifferent quality. The situation has now improved substantially, and much better hotel, guest house and self-catering accommodation is available. Since 1988 the tourist board has deployed Pounds 1.4m on projects in the valleys, with a special emphasis on the Rhymney Valley, one of the most deprived following the demise of the mining industry. Eleven projects were earmarked for help, including a golfing hotel, five other hotels, a farm project, a water skiing centre and a country park. The biggest new attraction in the valleys is probably Rhondda heritage park on the site of the Lewis Merthyr colliery north of Pontypridd, which closed in 1983. The old buildings have been transformed into big industrial theatres, bringing to life the story of coal. A new programme on energy has just been launched, and next year a trip underground will be included. In contrast, one of the best examples of a semi-fortified Tudor manor house, Llancaiach Fawr Manor at Nelson in the Rhymney valley, has won awards for its recreation of life at the time of the civil war. Actors and local people dressed in authentic costumes and speaking in 17th century dialect bring the period to life. Further south on the borders of Mid Glamorgan is Llanerch vineyard, which with its six acres of German and French vine varieties, is the only vineyard in the principality to bottle its wine on the estate. The county has four country parks and all offer a range of recreational activities for the family including walks, picnic and barbecue sites and children's playgrounds. At Parc Cwm Darran, near Bargoed, lakes provide one of the finest coarse fisheries in south Wales. Dare Valley near Aberdare has a visitor centre, fishing and horseriding, Bryngarw near Bridgend has a Japanese garden, and Bryn Bach near Rhymney has waterskiing and windsurfing. Although the promotion of tourism by the Wales Tourist Board, the Welsh Development Agency and local authorities is seen as an end in itself in generating more jobs, it will do something equally significant. The enhanced infrastructure of better roads, hotels and attractions will play a valuable part in persuading potential inward investors to choose the area because of its enhanced quality of life. The valleys will no longer be seen as an area that has lost its way with the demise of king coal.</p>

The approximately 40 students were taken in for questioning  after demonstrating for a quick handling of an alleged banking  scam said to involve collusion between high officials and  businessmen, Antara said.    The students were rounded up by a company of soldiers from  the garrison in the Indonesian capital.    Antara said that the students, from two separate groups --  the Youth and Student Committee against Corruption and Collusion  and the Representative Group of Universities Throughout  Indonesia -- were whisked to the Central Jakarta Police station.    The agency said a duty officer at the police post, contacted  by telephone, declined to give any information on the students.    The students were demanding that authorities quickly resolve  the so-called Bapindo affair, named for the state-owned Bank  Pembangunan Indonesia (Bapindo), which lost 613 million dollars  after issuing business credits to an ethnic Chinese businessman.    They also demanded that several senior Bapindo officials be  investigated.    Press reports since the disclosure of the scam in February  have said several top officials of the bank are believed to be  implicated in or have knowledge of the alleged scam.    Bapindo issued a letter of credit to Eddy Tansil's Golden  Key  group for the import of 430 million dollars in goods for five  projects, but the document was later converted into a "red  clause" letter of credit, under which the beneficiary can draw  on the money though the goods have not yet been shipped, the  attorney general's office said.    The credits have not been repaid, and interest and other  charges have brought the total loss to 613 million dollars.    The attorney general has detained Tansil and three former  high- ranking Bapindo executives for questioning and has  scheduled a trial for Tansil next month.    The attorney general has also frozen the accounts of one of  the bank's executives but none of the officials have so far been  questioned in the case.</p>

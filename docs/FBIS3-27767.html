This source well  versed in the situation of the Korean peninsula and Northeast  Asia reported: China is paying special attention to the fact  that North Korea has formed a new South Korean operation team in  the Workers Party of Korea and appointed Kim Yong-chu, a  moderate who had been excluded from power for almost 20 years;  and Kim Tal-hyon, who recently retired from vice premier of the  State Administration Council, as the top and assistant leaders  of the team. China is saying that this shows North Korea's will  to improve relations with Western countries.    This sources also said: China views that North Korea's  agreement with China on a joint promotion to construct indirect  social capitals in the Najin-Sonbong area and to enlarge and  develop Chongjin Port forms a link in the chain of its long-term  policy for opening up.    It has been learned that the Chinese view of the North  Korean  situation, in particular, was revealed in a classified document  which was secretly circulated recently among ranking Chinese  cadres in charge of party policy.</p>

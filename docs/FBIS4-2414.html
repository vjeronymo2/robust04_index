			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee held a televised  conference on rural work to relay the guidelines of the recent  central rural work conference and arrange Jilin's rural work for  this year. Attending the conference were provincial leaders He  Zhukang, Wang Jinshan, Zhang Yueqi, Feng Ximing, Liu Yazhi, Xu  Zhongtian, Wang Guofa, Quan Zhezhu, and (?Liu Xilin) as well as  principal responsible comrades of various provincial departments  and principal responsible comrades of city, autonomous  prefectural, and county party and government organs.    Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, presided over the conference. He Zhukang, secretary  of the provincial party committee, gave an important speech.    He Zhukang first emphasized: We should correctly estimate  the situation and enhance the sense of urgency toward the  endeavor to make agricultural and rural work successful. The  current overall rural situation is developing well, but we  should never be unrealistically optimistic. We should remain  clear-headed to understand that our current capacity for  agricultural production is still low, that improving  agricultural level is a task that takes time, that great efforts  are needed in increasing the strength for sustained development,  and that we must never lower our guard to neglect or slacken  efforts in agriculture and rural work. Based on the guidelines  of the central conference, the provincial party committee put  forward eight demands on Jilin's agriculture and rural work for  this year.    First, party committees and governments at all levels should  conscientiously put agriculture and rural work in the first  place of economic work and devote great efforts to them. This  year is the last year for us to attain the target of promoting  the economy to a new height in three years. According to the  requirements of this target, grain output should exceed 19  billion kg, agricultural output value should increase by 6  percent, township enterprises' output value should grow by 33.3  percent, and peasants' per capita income should exceed 1,000  yuan. These tasks are very arduous. All levels must step up  efforts to implement them in a down-to-earth manner, pay  attention to key issues, and add impetus to work.    Second, we should adhere to the principle of developing the  rural economy in all sectors. The general requirements are as  follows: In grain production, we should concentrate efforts on  per-unit yields, increase total output, tap potential, and  reduce production cost; and in animal husbandry and other  diverse production, especially township enterprises, which are  currently the major ways to lead peasants to an increased income  and affluence, we should regard them as the strategic priority  of the rural economic work and accelerate their development.  Proceeding from the specific local conditions, all localities  should fully develop their advantages to comprehensively develop  the agriculture and rural economy that reflect their own  characteristics.    Third, we should strive to raise agricultural productivity.  1) We should map out ways to enable surplus laborers to have  work to do and peasants to [words indistinct] all the year  round. 2) We should study ways to develop Jilin with the  application of science and technology and the promotion of  education, the ways to rely on scientific and technological  advance to upgrade peasants' quality, and the ways to carry out  extensive and in-depth activities to develop agriculture with  the application of science and technology and the promotion of  education, accelerate the dissemination and application of  scientific and technological achievements, achieve success in  the rural vocational and technical education, and improve the  peasants' ability and level in making the best of rural  resources. 3) We should study ways to restructure agriculture  and rural production setup more rapidly in line with specific  local conditions and develop high-yield, good-quality, and  high-efficient agriculture.    Fourth, we should add impetus to reform to particularly  address the difficulties in rural economic development. In the  current endeavor to deepen the rural reform, we should give  particular attention to stabilizing the relations in land  contracts, clarifying ownership, stabilizing the rights to  contract, relaxing control on land use rights, and establishing  a reasonable mechanism for transfer. We should step up efforts  to build markets, develop rural markets, connect urban and rural  markets, accelerate the establishment of the socialized service  system, and actively lead peasants to markets. We should  develop the collective economy to expand the collective economic  strength. We should continue the good job in the experimental  zone for rural reform and development to blaze a new road for  deepening the rural reform.    Fifth, we should devote earnest efforts to the  implementation  of various policy and measures. At present, we should  particularly supervise and urge the implementation of the  policies on supporting the rice sacks and vegetable baskets, the  policies on reducing the burdens on peasants, the policies on  the production and marketing of the means of agricultural  production, the policies on service by increasing agricultural  funds, and the policies on supporting the farm machinery,  irrigation, and agricultural science and technology service  systems. Leaders at all levels should not merely pay lip  service to their effort to attach importance to agriculture and  rural work. They should let this effort be manifest in their  specific work. Strengthening agriculture and rural work is the  major work for the entire party and entire society. We should  establish effective systems for inspection, supervision, and  guidance and regard implementation of policies as an important  criterion for appraising the work styles and performance of  cadres.    Sixth, we should ensure stability in rural society. Leaders  at all levels should be aware of hardships and resolve well the  hot issues with which the masses are much dissatisfied in a  timely manner. The focuses are 1) to continue to successfully  reduce the burdens on peasants, 2) to conscientiously strengthen  rural public security work, and 3) to improve party style and  administrative honesty. We should be firm in reducing the  burdens on peasants. Based on the central guidelines, the  provincial party committee reiterated the following work.    1) It is not permitted to continue collecting fees that  should be canceled as stipulated in explicit central and  provincial orders and to continue the activities for attaining  certain targets and levels that should be canceled as stipulated  in explicit orders. 2) It is not permitted to collect  unwarranted funds from peasants this year, and those who do so  should be held accountable. 3) Wanton collections of fees,  donations, funds, and fines should be resolutely dealt with and  banned. 4) All levels and all departments should inspect how  they have implemented the regulations of the party Central  Committee and the State Council and strictly deal with those who  violate the regulations. Regarding the departments in charge  which fail in this work, their leaders should be held  responsible. Resolute efforts should be made in the  comprehensive management of rural public security. Meanwhile,  we should resolutely check the unhealthy trends within the party  and in society, that the masses have many complaints, especially  the healthy trends of extravagance, extortion, and exaggeration.  We should resolutely oppose fraud. Those who resort to  improper means to gain fame and cheat higher level should be  investigated and have their responsibility affixed once  discovered.    Seventh, we should succeed in improving rural grass-roots  organizations. Party committees at all levels should attach  importance to improvement of rural grass-roots organizations and  achieve success in improving party branches, villagers'  committees, villagers' collective economic organizations, and  youth, women, and militia organizations so that they will  continue to play their role in rural reform, development, and  socialist construction.    Eighth, we should strengthen the rural spiritual  civilization. We should conduct extensive education on  socialism, patriotism, collectivism, and scientific and general  knowledge, eliminate numerous bad feudal and superstitious  customs and habits, and establish good social practice. We  should strengthen family planning, raise the quality of the  population, and develop the two civilizations in a coordinated  manner.    In conclusion, He Zhukang emphasized: We should firmly  embrace the idea of serving peasants and agriculture and  maintain close ties with the masses. It requires the concerted  efforts of all fields to achieve stable agricultural development  and promote rural work. However, the most important thing is to  rely on the vast number of peasants and fully stimulate their  enthusiasm and creativity. With the issues on peasants resolved  and agriculture promoted, we will have a reliable foundation for  the development of all our undertakings. We should give heed to  the views of peasants. In particular, leading cadres at all  levels should often go deep into the reality of life to directly  listen to the voice of peasants and learn about what they think,  what they expect, what they support, and what they oppose. We  should increase the transparency of rural economic management.  With regard to financial management, in particular, we should  make systems public and publish revenue and expenditure accounts  for the scrutiny of the masses so that (?democracy in rural  areas will be strengthened). We should protect the legal rights  and interests of peasants. At present, we should earnestly  address the hot issues which peasants are concerned about. We  should adopt effective measures to solve the problem of usurious  loans in rural areas. We should support and protect peasants'  entrance into the market and create a market environment for  competition on an equal footing. Any deeds that damage the  interests of peasants, such as wanton price rises in the means  of production, marketing of fake and inferior commodities, and  forcible purchases and sales, should be strictly investigated  and handled and resolutely corrected. We should show concern  for peasants' hardships. All localities should conscientiously  do a good job in helping those ridden by poverty and  difficulties, with the focus on helping the areas with  concentrations of poverty-stricken towns and townships, and  mobilize and organize the masses to win a success in supporting  the poor and achieving affluence. All levels and all  departments should further change their work styles and improve  their work methods. After this conference, major leading  comrades of the provincial as well as city and county party and  government organs should all devote a certain period to  investigation and study activities in rural areas. They should  hold heart-to-heart talks with the masses, pay attention to the  opinions and expectations of grass-roots cadres and peasants,  and clearly understand to what an extent the central and  provincial policies have been implemented, the true conditions  in rural reform, economic development, and peasants' life, and  the major problems that dampen peasants' enthusiasm and affect  rural economic development. They should look for effective ways  together with the cadres and the masses to solve these problems.  Spring farming will begin soon. Party committees and  governments at all levels should concentrate efforts on spring  farming to lay a good foundation for this year's bumper harvest.  The provincial party committee is convinced that as long as  party committees and governments at all levels in the province  attach great importance and devote earnest efforts to  implementation of the guidelines of the central and provincial  rural work conferences, Jilin's agriculture and rural work will  be promoted to a new level.    Comrade Wang Jinshan pointed out at the end of the  conference: Party committees and governments at all levels  should conscientiously organize cadres and the masses to study  Comrade He Zhukang's speech, comprehensively understand its  guidelines, implement them in doing their specific work, and  strive for practical results. After this conference, all levels  should put forward, as soon as possible, the specific opinions  on implementation of these guidelines and submit them to the  rural work office of the provincial party committee in the near  future.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A press statement was issued today in Tripoli,  Bamako, Niamey, and Ouagadougou, following the visit of  Presidents Blaise Campaore of Burkina Faso, Alpha Oumar Konare  of Mali, and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger to the Great Jamahiriyah.  Here follows the text of the statement:    In the framework of the fraternal relations linking the  Great  Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah [RSPLJ] with Burkina  Faso, the Republic of Niger, and the Republic of Mali, and  proceeding from the principles and objectives of the OAU, and in  eagerness to strengthen the relations of brotherhood and good  neighborliness between their countries, Presidents Blaise  Campaore of Burkina Faso, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, and Alpha  Oumar Konare of Mali paid a business and fraternal visit to the  RSPLJ from 15 to 18 June.    Brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great  al-Fatih revolution, had metings with the guest presidents, and  intensive talks were held between them on relations between  their countries in the political and economic spheress, and on  regional, African, and international issues of common interest.  The leaders expressed satisfaction at the tangible development  of relations and cooperation between them, and they stressed the  importance of relations between their countries in the  political, economic, and security-related domains, and the  founding of the appropriate organs toward this end.    The leaders expressed their great concern over the situation  in Rwanda. They condemn the massacres being repeatedly  perpetrated against civilians in Rwanda. In this respect, they  stressed the importance of an immediate cease-fire between the  parties to the conflict, and the need to find a radical solution  that would bring security and stability to Rwanda.    With the aim of bolstering collective relations between  their  states, the leaders underscored the importance of activating the  group of states bordering the Sahara, and of promoting  cooperation between them in order to secure stability and  security, and to resolve the problems in the region, which would  become an element toward a linkage and not separation between  the north and south of the Sahara, and in order to secure  collective cooperation between them in harmony with the  historic, social, and cultural ties between their peoples.    The leaders reviewed the efforts being made to carry out the  national charter in the Republic of Mali, and the talks underway  in order to put an end to the armed rebellion in northern Niger.  They stressed the importance of finding a final solution to  these questions out of their commitment to preserving security  throughout the region. Therefore, the leaders agreed that a  meeting be held by the foreign ministers of the concerned states  in the Republic of Mali in order to prepare for the convening of  a summit in the RSPLJ. Toward this end, the foreign ministers  have been assigned the task of intensifying contacts and  meetings and exchanging information.    The leaders also reiterated their solidarity and that of  their peoples with the people of the RSPLJ in facing up to the  measures imposed on the Arab Libyan people. They expressed  their support for the Arab, African, and international efforts  being made in order to find a just, honest, and rapid solution  so as to put an end to these measures, which affect all the  peoples of the region.    At the conclusion of the visit, the presidents expressed  their thanks and gratitude to brother leader Mu'ammar  al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution, and  the Arab Libyan people, for the warm welcome and hospitality  offered to them.    Signed in Tripoli on 9 Muharram, corresponding to 18 June  1994.</p>

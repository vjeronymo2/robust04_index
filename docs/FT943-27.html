			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (45): Prudent and decisive - Profile / Kenneth Clarke Some 16 months into the job, Kenneth Clarke is emerging as a one of the more impressive chancellors in Britain's post-war history. His decision earlier this month to raise UK interest rates by half a percentage point while inflation was at a 27-year low showed he was prepared to act as well as talk tough to nip incipient inflationary pressures in the bud. In his first Budget, 10 months ago, he showed similar decisiveness, raising taxes and cutting public spending to quicken the pace at which the UK's budget deficit is lowered. Both actions showed that Mr Clarke is prepared to take political risks to establish a record of economic prudence. Although the UK economy grew at a rapid 3.8 per cent in the first half of this year, the interest rate rise could still backfire if recent signs of a slight slowdown in the growth of consumer demand presage a more significant reversal of the recovery from the recession of the early 1990s. The tax rises, coming on top of those decided in the March 1993 Budget of the former chancellor Norman Lamont, added up to one of the most severe fiscal tightenings in Britain this century. It would have been easy to imagine another incoming chancellor, whose experience of high office had been in spending ministries, looking at a then uncertain recovery and at the Tory party's very poor ranking in the opinion polls and deciding on a less radical course. But, unusually for a British politician, Mr Clarke is prepared to take a medium-term view of the economy and politics. He is serious when he says he wants to avoid the boom and bust cycles that have so often plagued Britain since the second world war. Realising how UK economic policies suffer from a credibility gap, he has acted to accord a greater role in monetary policy to the Bank of England. He has moved to make policy more transparent and accountable, notably through publishing the minutes of his monthly meetings with Eddie George, the Bank of England governor. His aim, stated in his 'Mansion House speech' to the City in June is 'a long period of healthy balanced growth, which creates jobs and sees gradually higher living standards for all'. He has faith that the British people will respect a government that 'sticks to its prospectus' of putting the public finances on an even keel at the expense of short-term populist measures. He has pledged to keep tight control of public expenditure and only permit tax cuts when the country can afford them. In hammering home this message, he has cut through the old convention that a chancellor should stay silent about tax plans in the months ahead of his Budget. At the press conference to announce this month's rise in UK bank base rates to 5.75 per cent from 5.25 per cent, Mr Clarke bluntly ruled out tax cuts in his forthcoming Budget on November 29. Tax cuts would jeopardise recovery. Even if the public sector borrowing requirement were likely to end up lower than the Pounds 36bn forecast for the 1994-95 financial year it would be 'hopelessly premature' to lower taxes in November. Giving the idea 'no chance', he dismissed it as 'not serious politics'. In fact, Mr Clarke, when thinking about politics, gives the British public far more credit for economic common sense than many of his colleagues in the House of Commons or analysts in the City. While making clear that his long-term goal is to cut taxes, he told his audience at the Mansion House that: 'The public are usually more sensible than politicians and the press. They will not put their confidence in a government that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under control.' He is equally determined not to generate a 'fraudulent, inflationary feel good factor' among the electorate. This would soon turn 'to 'feel very bad' as the bust followed the boom'. Such earthy common sense reflects a man who has risen to high office and yet never lost sight of his relatively humble origins as the son of a hard-working watch repairer in Nottinghamshire, in Britain's industrial Midlands. Mr Clarke's climb up the political greasy pole began with scholarship successes to the upmarket Nottingham High School and to Cambridge University where he studied law and forged early alliances with fellow students who were to form the 'Cambridge Mafia' in the Tory governments of the 1970s and 1980s. But his political career has been anything but smooth. Although he was just under 30 when he won the Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe in 1970, the choice of Margaret Thatcher as Tory leader in 1975 left him isolated. As one of the party's more prominent young left-wingers and and a pro-European, he stayed a junior minister until 1985. After entering the cabinet as a minister in the department of employment, he won a reputation as a battler against vested interests. As health secretary he began the controversial reforms of the National Health Service and became embroiled in politically costly disputes with doctors and ambulance workers. He won few friends among the educational establishment as education secretary and as home secretary courted trouble by seeking to restructure the police. That he was appointed chancellor in May 1993 was a measure of the failure of the government's policy to peg sterling to the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism and the inability of Mr Lamont, his hapless predecessor, to recover from the humiliation of the pound's forced exit from the ERM two years ago. Mr Clarke has been lucky at the Treasury. He inherited an economy with low inflation and low interest rates that was recovering more strongly from recession than people recognised at the time. This month's decision to raise interest rates is a pointer to more testing times ahead. The chancellor's response to date has been characteristically robust. It remains to be seen whether such bravery yields the desired economic and political rewards.</p>

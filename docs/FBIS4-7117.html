			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Keating's Bridge to Thailand"] </F>   [Text] Thailand, the quiet achiever of trade-driven Asia,  is one of Australia's best friends in the Asia Pacific.  Virtually without fanfare the Thai people have knuckled down to  build an industrious economy. Concurrently they have nurtured a  commitment, fragile but growing, to democratic principles and an  open society.    Bilateral relations with Australia have also grown steadily,  especially in economic and political terms. Globally the two  have acted together in common cause, notably as members of the  Cairns Group pursuing free and open agricultural trade through  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Today these links  will be celebrated in a highly symbolic fashion when the Prime  Minister, Mr Keating, formally opens the Australian-funded and  constructed "Friendship Bridge" spanning the Mekong River  between Thailand and Laos.    The bridge completes a highway network extending for the  first time from Beijing to Singapore. It has immense economic  significance, and will entrench Thailand's status as a key  gateway to Indochina. For Australia, the $42 million [currency  further not specified] bridge symbolises efforts both in  strengthening regional links generally and in employing  Australia's technological capacity for the benefit of the region.    Australia and Thailand have often taken their relations too  much for granted, as officials on both sides of yesterday's  talks between Mr Keating and his counterpart Chuan Leekpai,  acknowledged last night. The talks aimed to change that, with  new perspectives on how to lift bilateral trade and investment.    From an Australian perspective Thailand has been the  neglected power of South-East Asia partly because bilateral  relations, compared with other parts of the region, have been so  problem-free and untroubled. Yet it has the second largest  economy in the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Though  less than a quarter the size of Australia's, its gross domestic  product has grown on average 7 per cent every year since the  1950s. Last year Australian exports to Thailand increased  nearly 50 percent, to $1.2 billion. This makes it our 12th  largest export market -- up from 20th only two years previously.    Economic success has not come without cost. Most Thai  industry is centred on Bangkok, which with only 16 percent of  the population produces half of GDP. Pollution and exploitation  in the labour market are serious problems. However, the gradual  rise in prosperity has also created a large and politically  activist middle class, which has come a metaphor for Thailand's  capacity to make a lasting transition from military-dominated  rule to parliamentary democracy.    Mr Keating's visit to Laos, Thailand and Vietnam is a  natural  and consistent expression in the modern era of what he has  termed Australia's "constructive engagement" with the region.  These are not countries of first rank importance in terms of  Australian foreign policy, but that does not diminish the value  of regular high-level personal contact. It is 5 years since the  last prime ministerial visit to Thailand. That was made by Mr  Bob Hawke, who used the occasion to announce Australia would  build the bridge Mr Keating is to open today.    The importance of Thailand, with a population three times  more numerous than Australia's, an export economy dominated by  manufacturing and a stabilising political system, is growing.  It is an influential force in ASEAN and a keen supporter of the  Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. As resources-rich  Thailand prospers, Australia should be confident about ensuring  bilateral relations flourish along with it.</p>

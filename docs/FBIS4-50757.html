			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] In response to an invitation to visit the U.S.  extended to President Li Teng-hui jointly by Republican Senator  Murkowski and Senator Brown, an official of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs said: During past years, many U.S. senators and  congressmen as well as academic organizations have invited  President Li to visit the United States. But under the U.S.  system in which administrative, legislative, and judicial  functions are separate, President Li's visit to the United  States is possible only when, in addition to the maneuvering on  the part of Congress, the administrative branch should have good  will. Given the current policy of the United States, which  deems mutual visits by high-level officials not in line with its  interests, President Li's visit to the United States is  impossible.    However, the official said: If there are more voices of  support, this will put pressure on the U.S. Government. The  accumulation of such efforts will certainly bloom and produce  fruits. A case in point is the U.S. arms sales to us. We have  worked hard on this issue over the past 13 years. Another  example is our entry to GATT. In the future, we will mobilize  more people to support us. It is our hope that the U.S. side  will come to understand that we do not mean to sabotage the  relations between the United States and Communist China. It is  hoped that the United States will separately deal with its ties  with Communist China and its ties with us.</p>

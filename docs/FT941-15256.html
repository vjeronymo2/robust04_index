			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Travel: Anything goes on Tahoe's slippery slopes - Skiing Devil or Angel - an old 1960s potboiler - was playing on the car radio as our Chevy rolled into South Lake Tahoe . . . Las Vegas on ice. The song might have been written specially to describe this tinseltown sprawled across the state line between California and Nevada. This is where the good, the bad, the ugly, the magnificent, the seedy, the spectacular and the kitsch finally meet in one extraordinary, vibrant melting pot. No matter how long the drive has been - in our case 10 hours - or how tired you might be, as you nose through the glare, the flashing neon lights that illuminate the lakeside gambling hotels also fire up an energy transfusion. All thoughts of snuggling into a king size bed suddenly evaporate. The Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, where you can gamble 24 hours a day, is not designed for sleep. If it were not for the cold shock of a million artificial crystals blasting you in the face from one of America's biggest snow-making systems, you might never wake up properly even on the mountain, which would be regrettable since you would miss the breathtaking views from Heavenly across this huge cobalt blue lake. This year, as it nears its 40th birthday, Heavenly Valley, as it was originally called when 19th century settlers found 'heavenly relief' from the valley heat, has finally dropped the 'valley' and is now plain Heavenly. What is unique about the mountain, apart from the quite extraordinary views of Lake Tahoe on one side and the Nevada desert on the other, is that you actually ski in both states. Most people start the day at the Californian-based lodge where the tram takes you to mid-mountain. From there you can ski to the bottom of the recently installed Sky Express high-speed quad which whips you to the top of Monument Peak at more than 10,000ft. From there you can either glide back down on any number of fast blue cruising trails - pausing, as you are bound to, in order to gaze out on the shimmering lake - venture via the likes of Big Dipper, Comet and Stagecoach into naughty Nevada where gambling, prostitution and just about anything else goes. Most of the mountain is intermediate cruising, although in good snow years (so far this is not one, but last year was superb) there is an abundance of excellent powder skiing among the trees. Mott and Killebrew Canyons on the Nevada side, with runs such as Snake Pit and Ramarrah's, provide a swashbuckling back country area for experts. There is nothing like Lake Tahoe anywhere else in the American West. The lake is magnificently beautiful; the huge gambling areas, nightly cabaret spots and neon lit razzmatazz magnificently gaudy. It is almost a relief to escape to Squaw Valley where the lake is over the hills and far away (though still visible) and the volume and the lights of everyday living have been discreetly turned down. At Squaw, the venue for the 1960 Winter Olympics, you have six mountains to choose from, including some of the toughest terrain in Tahoe. Beginners love it here too because, unusually, the nursery slopes are perched high on Emigrant Peak which means they can ride the tram and even ski all the way down at the end of the day if they have enough skill or gumption. Squaw, for years without much in the way of local lodging, now has an excellent base resort where skiers are pampered in luxurious surroundings without a flashing neon sign to be seen. With good reason, Squaw and Heavenly are the best known of the Tahoe resorts but there is a wealth of other ski areas - 15 in all - circling the lake. Even if you have a fortnight here you will never get round to them all. Try to find time, however, for Kirkwood, off the beaten track south of the lake, where there is some steep, invigorating terrain with a craggy, wild west movie backdrop, and Mount Rose, now linked with its neighbour, Slide Mountain. Between them they have a good mix of challenging gradients and exhilarating tree skiing that should bring a smile to most skiers' faces. Diamond Peak at Incline Village has good family skiing and views of Lake Tahoe that rival even those from Heavenly. Heavenly's first skier was a postman called John 'Snowshoe' Thompson. Snowshoe's 90-mile mail route carried him from Hangtown (now Placerville) in California's gold country, over Monument Peak Pass, down the Nevada slopes of Heavenly to Genoa, Nevada's first settlement. As the local tourist office points out: 'Lucky Snowshoe must have gotten some unbelievable first tracks]' Arnie Wilson's visit to Lake Tahoe was arranged by Virgin Holidays, Sussex House, High Street, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 1BZ.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Bernt Conrad commentary: "Hata Wants To Cooperate"] </F>   [Text] The new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is  plagued with bad luck. Hardly had he been appointed Morihoto  Hosokawa's successor when his grand coalition collapsed, and  while he toured Europe in an effort to demonstrate his country's  goodwill, his own justice minister, Shigeto Nagano, disgraced  him with the most inappropriate comment that Japan never started  a war against any Asian country in 1937-38. Indignation soared  in China and South Korea. Hata had to call his unruly colleague  from Paris and reprimand him, but he made up for this by saying  that Japan has caused unbearable suffering in its recent history.    Germany's friend did not have to expect any trouble in Bonn.  Naturally, just like Francis Mitterrand in Paris, his German  interlocutors, Helmut Kohl and Klaus Kinkel, asked him to open  up Japanese markets wider than before. Hata could not and would  not contradict their arguments, for it is apparent that the  sooner Japan facilitates access to its markets, the better will  German-Japanese trade relations develop. The Japanese guest,  therefore, promised an improvement. But whether he is able (or  willing) to coax Japan's stubborn bureaucracy into a more open  attitude remains doubtful.    In any case, during his talks on the Rhine, Hata appeared as  a pleasant interlocutor who is willing to cooperate  constructively with the Germans, whom he values so highly, as  well as with other Europeans and the Americans. He will have a  practical opportunity to do so at the world economic summit in  Naples in early July, unless the parliamentary majority at home  topples him before then.</p>

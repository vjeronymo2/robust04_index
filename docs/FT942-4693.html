			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Moody's cuts BNP senior debt rating Moody's has lowered the debt rating of Banque Nationale de Paris and placed Societe Generale's debt under review for possible downgrade. BNP's senior debt rating, which had been under review since January 14, dropped from Aa1 to Aa3. The agency said the cut was based on a belief that BNP's profitability and economic capitalisation would be challenged for some time by asset-quality stress, competition among banks and low credit demand. Moody's said any SocGen downgrade would 'probably be minor'. The Aa3 long-term debt rating of the Industrial Bank of Japan has been placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's.</p>

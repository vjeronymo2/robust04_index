			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A seriously centralised vision of Europe Sir, 'This Gallic craving for order' mentioned by David Buchan ('Balladur's bravura balancing act', December 11) is going to have a lasting impact on British life. Rules, regulations and a deep, deep mistrust of the instincts and passions of its own people are part of the French tradition. It is interesting to see how the present-day nation of France was composed. Independent or semi-independent states, Normandy, Brittany, Languedoc, Burgundy, were gradually added to the core state, which was the region around Paris. After the revolution, under various republics, local languages were forbidden or heavily discouraged. The importance and unity of the French state as well as the superiority and vocation universelle of French civilisation were and are strongly emphasised in school textbooks. The French elite, whether inclined to the right or to the left, are completely impregnated with this traditon. They feel, instinctively, that a similar process will be repeated in the creation of the European state. They have never been encouraged to understand other traditions and ways of doing things, only the superiority of their own culture and history. People like Jacques Delors, Francois Mitterrand, and also Edouard Balladur and Alain Juppe only see Europe in terms of their own history. All this is understandable, but as the bureaucracy at Brussels is dominated by the French, their highly centralised vision of a future Europe should be taken very seriously.

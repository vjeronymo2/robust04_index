Eye pathology was found in 371 children, or  20.4 percent, with the most common problem being refraction  anomaly with lowered visual acuity. Congenital pathology was  identified in 109 children. Inflammation was found in 70, and  conjunctivitis in 54. In general, the incidence of eye pathology  was a function of the overall gamma levels in the population  centers. In the settlement of Kholmy, for example, where the  gamma levels stood at 97 R/hr, roughly 30 percent of the  children examined presented with eye pathology. References 6  (Russian).</p>

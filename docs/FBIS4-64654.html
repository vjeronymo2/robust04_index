			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Chote and Donald Macintyre report: "Clarke Insists </F> on Need for Strong Welfare State"]    [Text] Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  said yesterday that Britain needed a strong welfare state to  help people cope with the volatile wages and spells of  unemployment which were a natural result of making industry and  the jobs market more flexible.    In a clear attempt to reestablish the party's appeal to the  centre ground, the Chancellor said in the annual Mais lecture at  City University in London that the uncertainty of the jobs  market could leave people fearful of change and opposed to it.    "Not only adequate state welfare provision but a whole range  of other social policies should alleviate such fears and offer a  sense of security in a world where retraining and changes of job  are becoming necessary events in most people's working lives,"  he said.    Mr Clarke's emphasis on social policies dearly  differentiated  him from Michael Portillo, his deputy at the Treasury and a  likely rival in any Tory leadership contest. It also threatened  tension between them in drawing up this year's tax and public  spending plans.    The Chancellor hinted in his speech that the Budget might  include reforms of the social security system to improve  incentives for the low paid. These might include changes to  Family Credit and Income Support to make it more worthwhile for  the unemployed to take work and for low earners to seek higher  paid jobs. Mr Portillo is keen to limit the cost of benefits  through means-testing, which tends to worsen incentives.    Mr Clarke's frequent complaints that any important  pronouncement he makes is interpreted as a naked leadership bid  would almost certainly be justified on this occasion. If  anything, it is a coherent attempt to do on domestic issues what  Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, has done for European  policy: to drag the party's centre of gravity back from where  many on the Thatcherite right would like it to be. By  reasserting the importance of the welfare state, Mr Clarke has  rejected suggestions that it is inherently left wing to suggest  that economic change should be humanely managed.    Mr Clarke said that tackling unemployment had to be "the  main  preoccupation of economic policymakers in the 1990's," but  argued that the free-market approach successfully used to create  jobs in the US had to be tempered. "The American approach  results in unacceptably low levels of social support across the  range for those not in work, as well as those employed," he said.    One of the Chancellor's key themes was the need for the  Government to help people cope with the job changes and periods  of unemployment which result from a more flexible labour market.  He promised measures next year to make it easier for people to  transfer their pensions when they change jobs, adding that  mortgages also had to be more flexible to cope with greater  fluctuations in incomes.    "No individual will see any advantage in a flexible labour  market unless he or she sees how career prospects and life-cycle  finances can be enhanced by it," he said.    He urged a move away from direct measures to help the less  well- off, arguing that people needed to be given greater  opportunities to take part in the market economy, which required  better education.    He rejected the notion, long proclaimed by Thatcherites in  Britain and Reaganites in the US, that the benefits of buoyant  economic growth would trickle down to the less well-off. A  strong welfare state was therefore needed to help people who  were unable to work.    The Chancellor said employers' demands for skilled workers  had widened the gap between the high and the low paid, and that  it was unclear how much further this would go. But the  Government should try to equip the low paid for more highly paid  work rather than using tax and benefits to narrow the gap.</p>

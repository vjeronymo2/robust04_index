Former Bavarian Minister-President Max  Streibl had met secretly with Republikaner Chairman Franz  Schoenhuber last November. [passage omitted]    Streibl acted "stupidly," said Juergen Ruettgers, Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] parliamentary manager of the CDU/CSU  Bundestag group. It is "completely idiotic" when leading  politicians meet with the Republikaner chairman, CDU Deputy  Horst Eylmann said. However, one should not overestimate  Streibl's action. Guenther Mueller of the CSU called for  dealing politically with the Republikaner. "However, the  question arises of whether this must be done on one's own sofa  at home."    Last Saturday [12 February], Streibl called his CSU chairman  and told him what had happened. Finance Minister Theo Waigel  was assured of the private nature of the meeting and, outwardly  he reacted with Bavarian calmness. The CSU's attitude toward  the Republikaner has not changed: There will not be any  cooperation with them. Asked whether it is prudent to meet with  Schoenhuber at this time, Waigel said that everyone has to  justify this to himself; the party cannot decide this.    Bavarian Culture Minister Hans Zehetmair viewed the action  as  a temporary clouding of his party colleague's political  instinct. Streibl will "come to his senses again," his deputy  of the Upper Bavarian CSU said. Zehetmair ruled out the idea  that his party colleague might join the Republikaner. "I think  he is too smart for that." Zehetmair called the Republikaner  the "declared opponents" of the CSU.    Schoenhuber announced: "Streibl did not give me any internal  CSU information." In the same breath, he yesterday rejected the  accusation that he had told DER SPIEGEL about the meeting. "I  state categorically and unambiguously that I did not talk about  the meeting, which took place months ago, and that I strictly  adhered to the agreed confidentiality."    Yesterday Alliance 90/Greens in the Bavarian Landtag  demanded  that Streibl be watched by the Land Office for the Protection of  the Constitution. Anyone who cultivates friendly contacts with  the chairman of a right-wing extremist party and fans hatred of  foreigners must be counted among the sympathizers of this party,  which is hostile to the Constitution. Interior Minister  Beckstein, who is officially responsible to such requests, did  not want to comment. He is on vacation until Ash Wednesday, it  was said in his office.</p>

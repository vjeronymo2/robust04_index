			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 20 and  21 March 1994 publish a number of articles by Iraqi columnists  commenting on the "split" within the UN Security Council during  its latest periodic review of the blockade on Iraq. The  columnists are unanimous that the split indicates an erosion of  U.S. influence in the Council and growing sympathy with Iraq.    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 19 March carries on page one a  500-word article by Taha al-Basri entitled: "The Blockade Is  Bound To Be Eroded." Al-Basri writes that the heated debate  within the UN Security Council over the statement it normally  releases after every review of the blockade "is tangible proof  that the unusual Iraqi steadfastness and the wise leadership of  struggler President Saddam Husayn have borne fruit and that the  blockade will sooner or later be eroded." The article adds that  after more than three years of U.S. absolute domination of the  Council "differences have emerged for the first time, splitting  the members into two groups." The article continues: "Events  of the past three days have clearly shown that a large majority  of the members are now convinced that Iraq has the right to  demand the lifting of the blockade after it has fulfilled its  obligations under the Council resolutions." The article  concludes: "By doing so, the member states are defending:  first, the interests of their own countries; and second, the  clear right that Iraqi diplomacy has been trying to explain to  them all along."    The paper also publishes in its "Standpoint" column on page  two an 800-word article by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi entitled: "UN  Majority is With Iraq." Referring to the split within the  Security Council, the article says: "Most big powers,  especially France, China, and Russia, and the overwhelming  majority of the world states have realized that the United  States and Britain are playing a dirty political game that has  nothing to do with UN resolutions and regulations, but has a  great deal to do with their narrow-minded interests and their  calculations to harm the Iraqi people and the other world  nations, which have been affected by the unjust blockade that  has been imposed on Iraq for more than three years." The  article adds: "The U.S. and British Administrations must  understand that the world around them is changing and that Iraq  has rights and is an influential factor in the region and the  world." Concluding, the article says that the world, which is  speeding toward the 21st century, aspires for "balanced  relations based on common interests, common concern for human  progress, and justice."    The paper further publishes in its "Attention" column on  page  tree a 500-word article by Hasan al-Kashif entitled: "After the  Non-Resolution." This item too refers to the split within the  Security Council and the failure of the member states to come  out with the usual periodic statement. It notes that this  "non-resolution on the blockade has come as a big resolution to  end the United States' new world order," thanks to Iraq's  steadfastness and sacrifices under its great historic leader  Saddam Husayn. It has also proven, the article adds, that  "Washington is not suitable for the role of arbiter, because it  has not discarded the garb of pirate and colonialist and is  still influenced by the tendencies of domination, plunder, and  even invasion and occupation." The article says that by  supporting the "clear, firm facts" the UN Security Council  members "have regained their role, position, and the respect of  world nations and governments, which believe in peace,  stability, justice, and fairness. "As for the Arabs," the  article concludes "they are put before a test for the umpteenth  time. They should either act as Arabs or remain mere followers  of U.S. policy and thus fall behind the honest stands by  governments of even non-Arab states. This is what we do not  wish for any honest Arab."    The paper also publishes in its "Windows" column on page  seven a 150-word article by Diya' Hasan entitled "The Split Has  Occurred and the Rest Will Follow." The columnist notes that  the important thing is that a split has occurred in the UN  Security Council and that the majority has not given an easy  "yes" this time. The article adds that despite the decision to  continue the blockade for two more months, this time the  decision did not come "by a mere hand signal from America's  Madeleine Albright," but following a grueling debate lasting  more than two days. The article adds: "The good thing about  what happened was the anxiety expressed by some Security Council  member states over Tariq 'Aziz's message to the Council, because  it vehemently asserted Iraqi rights and pointed to the duties  and obligations of the Council, which the Americans and British  considered rather excessive under the prevailing logic in the  world organization; that is, the logic of superiority and  hegemony. But the message was intended to break the back of  that useless logic." The article concludes that the Iraqi  message succeeded in creating the split, which will be further  widened if the member states also act according to their own  national interests.    Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 21 March 1994 publishes in its  "Standpoint" column on page two an 800-word article by Sabri  Hammadi entitled: "What Does This Split Mean?" Hammadi says the  split in the Security Council must have disturbed and  embarrassed the U.S. Administration, proving that the Council is  no longer "a mere section of the U.S. State Department devoted  to serving the aims and interests of the United States and its  pampered protege, Israel. Here are three permanent member states  in the Council saying no to U.S. hegemony and defending their  interests and prestige as big powers." The article adds: "Of  course, we do not want to exaggerate by considering the split  that occurred as the desired change in the Security Council that  will put an end to U.S. tyranny and monopolization. What took  place was, however, the beginning of a new phase in the  relationship between the permanent member states." The article  concludes: "True, despite its significance, the clear split  within the Security Council did not achieve the objectives  aspired by Iraq, but it must also be said that what happened was  a serious and promising start for a more just and fair  international stand responding to Iraq's rights and legitimate  demands."</p>

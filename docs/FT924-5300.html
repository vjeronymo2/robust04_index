			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Local taxation THE ANNUAL ritual of UK local taxation began its course yesterday, with the government announcing details of its grant to local authorities. The environment secretary, Mr Michael Howard, said that it allowed for a 3.1 per cent increase in expenditure. This appears generous given the 1.5 per cent ceiling on the public-sector pay bill, since 70 per cent of local spending goes on wages. The local authorities disagreed. The grant is 3.1 per cent up on what councils were supposed to spend last year, but only 0.4 per cent more than they calculate they actually spent. Since the government has tightened the capping rules to curb high spenders, many councils will be unable to increase their spending next year even if they wish to. Some - including Conservative authorities - are threatening cuts in services. This year, there is an added complication in the replacement of the poll tax by the council tax. The transitional relief scheme to ease the introduction of the new tax should ensure that winners outnumber losers, according to ministers. But many people will find the new tax difficult to understand, not least its cunning banding system which has provided a steady flow of misleading press stories about average bills throughout the summer and autumn. And people living in homes which have fallen in value recently may feel that a tax based on property values in April 1991 is unfair. As with any tax change, there will be losers who will be vocal, and winners who are likely to keep their good fortune to themselves. A tranquil debut for the new tax is unlikely. All of this points to another political storm over local taxation in the new year. There will be pressure for a further switch from local taxation to central government grants, as in 1991 when VAT was increased to hold down poll tax bills. This should be resisted. Council tax is already too highly geared, providing only 15 per cent of local government revenue. Any increase in gearing would further undermine the tax base of local government and constrain its ability to provide services in line with local wishes. The real concern about yesterday's announcement, however, is not in the figures but in the fact that they so greatly restrict discretion to increase funding on local services. That makes local government little more than the local administration of Whitehall's policies and priorities - an outcome which is most undesirable for British democracy.</p>

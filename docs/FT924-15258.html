			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Maputo seeks poll aid MOZAMBIQUE has asked foreign countries to pay most of the Dollars 80m (Pounds 44.9m) it needs to pay for elections next year, western diplomats said yesterday, Reuter reports from Maputo. The government, which signed a peace agreement with right-wing rebels on Sunday, gave the figure to the foreign diplomatic corps in Maputo last week at a meeting chaired by the co-operation minister, Mr Jacinto Veloso. The government told the diplomats it could cover only 5 per cent of the estimated cost and was relying on foreign donors to provide the balance. Among the most expensive items are road works - thousands of miles were made unusable during the civil war - election materials, vehicles and the salaries of election staff, the diplomats said. About 15 parties are expected to contest the elections. To overcome transport difficulties the authorities will need a large number of four-wheel drive vehicles, trucks, helicopters, light aircraft and boats, it said. France welcomed the peace agreement yesterday and said it was ready to help Mozambique 'emerge from its difficulties'.</p>

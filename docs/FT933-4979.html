			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Molins pension surplus split The Pounds 38m surplus on the UK pension schemes of Molins, the tobacco machinery and packaging group, has been split between the schemes' members and the company. The 6,000 members stand to gain an average of 10 per cent enhancement of their benefits from roughly half the surplus, while Molins has received Pounds 11.8m after tax which it will use to reduce group borrowings. The move had been expected since a proposal to share the surplus between the company and members was made at the group's annual meeting in April.</p>

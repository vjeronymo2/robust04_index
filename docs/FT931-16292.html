			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Weaker tone in Europe THERE WAS a much weaker tone to trading in both European cash and futures yesterday as pressures inside the exchange rate mechanism eased, writes James Blitz. Cash rates in the French franc market fell as the currency strengthened against the D-Mark, moving above FFr3.41 per D-Mark. There was continuing tension in the Irish punt money market, with the authorities announcing that overnight rates will be set at 50 per cent from today. The effects of Tuesday's Franco-German communique supporting the franc continued to be felt in markets, and there was a little more confidence about the prospects of the franc surviving the current crisis without the need to devalue. Three-month money fell to 12 7/8 per cent from the 14 per cent rate of the day before, and the overnight rate was down to 12 1/2 per cent from Tuesday's 15 per cent. The more positive tone was felt in French franc futures, where the March contract finished 17 basis points higher at 90.46. Euromark futures enjoyed a minor rally yesterday following rumours that the Bundesbank was planning a 50 basis-point cut in the Lombard rate to support the French franc. The March contract rose 7 basis points to a high of 92.25 on the rumour, but fell back to close unchanged on the day at 92.18 after it failed to be substantiated. Indeed, what hard news there was from the Bundesbank tended to be bearish. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said inflation continued to be the central bank's top priority. It was also disclosed that there would be no news conference following today's meeting of the central bank's council, which was interpreted as implying that there will be no rate cut. In the sterling markets, dealers ignored the sharp appreciation of the pound against both the D-Mark and dollar. Cash and futures prices implied that there will be no imminent cut in UK base rates. The March short sterling contract slipped 10 basis points to a low of 93.30, but partially recovered to end at 93.35. In the cash market, three-month money was unchanged at around 7 1/4 per cent. One dealer said base rates were probably going down, but that the next reduction may not be until after the spring.</p>

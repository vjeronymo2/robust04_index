			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME CLASS ACTS  </P> <P> I was distressed to read Dianne Klein's column (March 25). I have two children  enrolled at the Roston Montessori Schoolhouse in San Juan Capistrano, the  oldest having been there over six years. I am a responsible parent who also  wants the best environment for my children. Both are enrolled at the Roston  Montessori Schoolhouse because I know that they are receiving the best  education my money can buy, and I repeat the word buy.  </P> <P> When my children are in the classroom, I know that professional educators are  instructing them, and that the instructor's attention is not being drawn away  from the children to parent helpers, who are not qualified to be in the  classroom. When the children are at school, I know that they are well cared  for, both in the classroom and at the playground. The environment, in general,  is one of spontaneity and discipline, learning and exploration. It's fun!  </P> <P> So why am I writing to you? I am a veteran of the private school wars. I also  have personal horror stories. In fact, at one time my son and eldest daughter  were enrolled in another private school. For my daughter it was wonderful, but  for my son it was a disaster. I removed my son and enrolled him in another  school, but I did not remove my daughter. It was the same school, with two  different experiences. I demonstrated my objection by removing my son. No  school fits every child perfectly. To this day I thank the teachers at that  school for the help they afforded my daughter, even though they created serious  problems for my son.  </P> <P> I believe that the parents who created this tempest really thought that they  were doing something positive. However, a private school is a business. When  customers disrupt the business to the detriment of other customers, refusal of  service is in order. Rokeya Lee was correct in what she did, and she has my  support and, I would hope, the support of the parents whose children are still  enrolled in the school.  </P> <P> GAIL REGO  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

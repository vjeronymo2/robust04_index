			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USING THE U.N. TO SETTLE MIDEAST CRISIS  </P> <P> Tom Clancy wrapped up his lengthy comments on the present Persian Gulf crisis  with this -- "The likelihood of a world-ending conflict is nearly gone. If we  can next show in the Persian Gulf that petty wars will not be tolerated, the  dream of all human history -- the elimination of war as an instrument of policy  -- will become something more practical than a dream" (Commentary, Aug. 20-21).  In other words, if the American military can just fight one more war in some  faraway place with a strange sounding name, we will gain the world peace we  have been searching for. (The impossible dream?)  </P> <P> A long time ago when I was a young soldier, I used to read a lot of military  history. I often wondered how they could get all those soldiers to go off on  those long crusades, when, even if they did make it back, they were discarded  like used sandals -- so the leaders could start off on the next one with fresh  new ones. For the past 50 years, U.S. warriors have suffered, fought and died  all over the world -- seeking that illusive dream -- peace. Yet here it is 1990  and our leaders are telling us, "Just one more war and we will find it."  </P> <P> Are Americans ready again to see naked little girls running and screaming down  a road, covered with burning napalm? American soldiers lying in grotesque  shapes after being shot or gassed? Burning tanks with our crews still inside?  How many evening news programs will they have to watch before they start to  feel the horrors of war that they so bravely send those young soldiers off to  fight and die in?  </P> <P> True, most of those soldiers are mostly from working or poor-class families --  so it isn't like seeing your own son there, is it? Are you going to try and  blame them for all this latest carnage when they come home -- like they did the  Vietnam veterans? The time to start thinking about this is right now. History  has shown that all those old crusaders accomplished little more than a ripple  in the history of mankind. And that's all we will accomplish, too. Yesterday's  heroes -- today's fools.  </P> <P> DON LOVE  </P> <P> Palm Springs  </P></p>

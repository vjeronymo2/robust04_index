			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Iraqi forces quit 'haven' after western ultimatum IRAQ began pulling its forces out of the Zakho area yesterday, hours after the US, Britain and France had told Baghdad through the United Nations to withdraw hundreds of armed police 'early this weekend' or face the threat of force. All its forces except for 50 policemen had been removed from the northern Iraqi town 'to the satisfaction' of all parties, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's UN ambassador, said in New York. President George Bush called the withdrawal announcement 'encouraging'. It was vital that they left the area. The ambassador's statement came as soldiers and journalists witnessed hundreds of armed police piling into buses and armed personnel carriers and leaving the town. Zakho is due to become a centre for the Kurdish refugees. It was unclear how many Iraqi soldiers or policeman, if any, remained in other areas in northern Iraq close to where the allies are trying to set up additional relief camps. The withdrawal from Zakho began after Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that Mr Thomas Pickering, the US ambassador, had delivered a demarche, or diplomatic note, to Mr al-Anbari on Wednesday night. The action was taken after consultation among the allies to avoid any 'accidents' or armed confrontations and to encourage Iraqi Kurds to return from the mountains to the refugee camps being built and secured by the allies. 'An atmosphere of security is essential to facilitating the relief operation,' Mr Fitzwater said. 'The presence of Iraqi security forces goes counter to conveying such an atmosphere.' He said there had been indications that the Iraqis were prepared to yield to the order. On Wednesday night British commandos were involved in a confrontation with Iraqi policemen in Zakho who tried to drag away a Kurd injured in a car crash. About 2,300 US, British, French and Dutch troops have moved into northern Iraq after ordering Baghdad to remove two Iraqi army battalions from the frontier town. Baghdad complained about the order, eventually complied and then sent armed police - reportedly secret police - instead. Mr Fitzwater said the zone to be cleared of the 'intimidating presence' stretched for several miles around Zakho. In terms reminiscent of the days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he said the allies were prepared to 'take whatever steps are necessary' to ensure the safety of the area. Mr Richard Cheney, US defence secretary, said later: 'We've got sufficient forces in the area so there is no question but that we would prevail.' The US, British and French ambassadors at the UN also presented a number of other demands to Mr al-Anbari relating to the Gulf war. A US official said the demands referred to what the west regards as Iraq's failure to give a full list of its arsenal of weapons, to Kuwaiti complaints about Iraq's continued detention of Kuwaiti citizens and property, and to lack of progress on demarcating the Iraq-Kuwait border. Allied troops have selected two temporary refugee sites, one just outside Zakho and one 15km east of al-Amadiyah. Both Iraq and the allies want the UN to take control of the camps, but UN officials say they do not have the facilities to do so immediately. West European governments have decided to strengthen their co-ordination of aid for the Kurds. The decision, which was taken at a meeting of the nine-member Western European Union defence grouping and which follows the recent European Community decision to delegate humanitarian aid through WEU, will be implemented at weekly meetings of military staff officers from the WEU capitals. All nine member governments are making some contribution to the refugee relief effort, providing men, transport aircraft or helicopters. Western governments, meanwhile, have reacted with caution to the agreement in principle between Kurdish rebel leaders and President Saddam Hussein on autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan. In Baghdad Mr Saadoun Hammadi, the Iraqi prime minister, said the aim of the talks was to find 'an objective patriotic solution to the autonomous region'. He said Iraq was conducting the Kurdish dialogue 'with sincerity and good intentions' and was prepared to 'open a new page, a new chapter' in foreign relations. Mr Jalal Talabani, the leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said the talks would resume after President Saddam Hussein's 54th birthday on Sunday. Emma Tucker adds: Mr John Major said he was sceptical of much of the reported agreement on autonomy and democracy reached by Kurdish leaders and President Saddam on Wednesday. 'I imagine there would be a considerable degree of reservation among many of the Kurds as to precisely how this would operate,' he said in an interview with the World Service to be broadcast tonight. He said it was too early to say whether the agreement would bring forward the date when British troops could leave northern Iraq. Kurds gamble, Page 4</p>

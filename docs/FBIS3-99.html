			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today told  wananchi [citizens] in Lugari constituency in Kakamega District  [western Kenya] to ignore threats by opposition parties and turn  out in large numbers on Thursday, 3 March to vote for Kenya  African National Union [KANU] in the by-elections.    The president said in a democratic society people should be  free to decide their own destiny and wondered why opposition  politicians were intimidating voters in the run-up to the  elections. He, however, assured wananchi that the government  had enough security machinery to contain any situation that may  arise from those threats. President Moi said KANU stood for  peace, love, and unity and the government shall not condone any  acts of violence in the country. President Moi was speaking at  various centers on his way to Nzoia chief's camp in Lugari to  address a campaign rally on behalf of the KANU candidate in the  constituency by-elections, Mr. Apili Wawire.    Among the centers he stopped at were Uasin Gishu Kakamega  border, Nangili, Kongoni, Matunda, and Kona Mbaya. Thousands of  jubilant wananchi, waving the popular one-finger KANU salute,  assured the president that they will vote in the KANU candidate,  Mr. Apili Wawire. President Moi told those wananchi that by  voting for Mr. Wawire they will have voted for KANU, which  stands for progress and stability. President Moi dismissed as  cheap politics by a Forum for the Restoration of Democracy  [FORD]-Kenya candidate, Burudi Nabwera, that part of Lugari  constituency would be made part of Rift Valley Province. He  said it was a pity that such an old man would stoop so low as to  tell such lies only for the sake of wooing votes.    President Moi, who is also the president of the ruling  party,  KANU, wondered why the opposition was against harambee [communal  fund raising] and yet that spirit had contributed a lot to the  development of this nation. The president said that KANU will  always concern itself with development matters and the general  welfare of all Kenyans without discriminating. The president  reiterated that it was the opposition parties which started off  the tribal clashes in parts of Rift Valley and Western province  and they should not use the same against KANU. President Moi  recalled how he had appointed Mr. Nabwera to head several  parastatals, including appointing him a minister of state in his  office and [word indistinct] why he was not grateful to the KANU  government.</p>

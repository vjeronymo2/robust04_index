			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> 'QUILTERS' IS TOUCHING, FUNNY, BRILLIANT;  </P> <P> THE EXQUISITE, ALL-FEMALE FRONTIER MUSICAL AT MOULTON THEATRE IS THE SHOW TO  SEE. TERI RALSTON DIRECTS THE PRODUCTION.  </P> <P> "It will come as a great surprise to many that 'Quilters' failed on Broadway,"  Laguna Playhouse executive director Richard Stein writes in his program note  for the exquisite, all-female frontier musical that opened over the weekend at  the Moulton Theatre.  </P> <P> I'll take Stein's word for it, but I really am not surprised. If anything, it's  more surprising that "Quilters" got to Broadway in the first place. "Annie Get  Your Gun," an Ethel Merman star vehicle meant for out-of-towners, is the sort  of frontier musical that Broadway historically has favored. "Quilters" is not a  show for out-of-towners. It has the appeal of the authentic.  </P> <P> In the wrong hands, of course, "Quilters" could easily become quaint and  languorous. Its episodic vignettes about pioneer times on the prairie, pieced  together like the show's handmade quilts, have a tendency toward the elegiac.  But this touching, funny, musically winning production has been directed by  Teri Ralston and performed by its cast of seven women with a verve and lack of  nostalgia that give it the unsentimental pulse of life.  </P> <P> Whatever else theatergoers plan to see between now and Dec. 16, when "Quilters"  is scheduled to close, this is one show they should try not to miss. In fact,  this latest version of the Molly Newman-Barbara Damashek musical is such an  unassuming marvel of theatrical brilliance, it is hard to know what or whom to  praise first.  </P> <P> Shall we begin with the accomplished vocal talent of the wonderfully well-cast  players -- Laura Pryzgoda, Lisa Picotte, Tricia Griffin, Karen McBride, Carolyn  Miller, Colleen Dunn and Karen Angela -- or the considerable dramatic gifts  that enable them to create individual portraits of pioneer women so  gratifyingly different from each other?  </P> <P> Or shall we begin with the feeling that the piece has captured an immense cycle  of experience common to most, if not all, women -- pioneering or otherwise?  "Quilters" deals with everything from menstruation and courtship to childbirth  and mothering, aborting an unwanted fetus to surviving a beloved husband's  death, being young and playful to growing old.  </P> <P> The varied pacing of Ralston's direction-cum-choreography is not to be  overlooked, nor Jacquie Moffett's and Doug Williamson's functional but  evocative design: a towering windmill, a raised platform and a few  strategically placed wooden beams -- all set against a quilt-like backdrop and  bathed in Steven Wolff Craig's flesh-toned lighting. Note, too, the  understatement of Marthella Randall's plain country costumes and the effective  use of simple props.  </P> <P> If the ensemble work looks as cohesive as the beautiful quilts that have gotten  the characters through the good and bad times in their hard lives on the  prairie, it is not for lack of practice: This cast has performed "Quilters"  four times before under Ralston's direction. And plans are under way to do so  again later this season in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Ralston, who appeared with the original cast of "Quilters" at the Denver Center  Theatre in 1983 and in a production at Los Angeles' Mark Taper Forum in 1985,  first directed the show with this cast at the Moulton in January, 1987. That  was followed by an hourlong version in June, 1987, mounted at a national  competition of the American Assn. of Community Theatres in Norman, Okla., where  Ralston and company took top honors.  </P> <P> They remounted the full-length show at the Moulton in May, 1988, to raise money  to travel to Dundalk, Ireland, where "Quilters" competed in the 23rd annual  International Community Theatre Festival. (The adjudicators awarded "Quilters"  second prize, while the audience disagreed and voted it the top show.)  </P> <P> Pryzgoda, who clearly has the outstanding voice of the ensemble, offers two of  the production's musical highlights: a haunting rendition of "The Butterfly,"  which embellishes a particularly affecting tale about an orphan and the death  of her young mother, and "Quiltin' and Dreamin' " which is part of a droll  sketch about a plain Jane who catches the eye of the handsomest cowboy in the  county (played with amusing panache by Dunn).  </P> <P> The brightest of nearly two dozen numbers include the entire ensemble doing  "Pieces of Lives," "The Windmill Song" (featuring Picotte and Angela), "Every  Log in My House" and "Cornelia."  </P> <P> Griffin also has a notable solo in "Green, Green, Green," as well as an  affecting dramatic scene about a husband's death on the railroad.  </P> <P> Miller gives a fine, melancholy reading of an old-maid schoolteacher who can't  have children, while Picotte provides an essential buoyancy throughout in a  polished and energetic performance both as a singer and actor. Angela, though  at times a bit shrill, brings off some of the sharpest moments of comedy as a  clever scamp. And McBride has an anchoring presence as a pioneer matriarch.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the band lends vivid support not only as musical accompanists but  also as sound-effects technicians creating the mood of the prairie.  </P> <P> Mark Turnbull plays a variety of instruments from wind to percussion, along  with Rocio Marron on fiddle, Cynthia Merrill on bass and Bob Hawkins on guitar  and mandolin.  </P> <P> 'QUILTERS'  </P> <P> A Laguna Playhouse production of the musical by Molly Newman and Barbara  Damashek.

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: US oil and gas side of Santa Fe Int'l for sale The state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp yesterday said it would sell the US oil and gas exploration and production operations of Santa Fe International Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Mr Nader Sultan, KPC deputy chairman, said the US operation was 'no longer a strategic priority'. The sale will not affect Santa Fe UK's operations in the British sector of the North Sea. Nor will it include Santa Fe's extensive international drilling operations. Santa Fe was one of a series of US and European investments made by KPC during the 1980s under the chairmanship of Sheikh Ali Al-Sabah, the then oil minister. KPC paid Dollars 2.5bn, or Dollars 51 a share, for Santa Fe in 1981. Santa Fe lost Dollars 2.9bn between 1981-90, according to official Kuwaiti figures. A Kuwaiti parliamentary watchdog has charged that the acquisition was a 'hasty personal idea' rather than part of a well thought-out investment strategy.</p>

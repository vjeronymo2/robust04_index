			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (8): Black-out fuels the debate - Case study, Enel Southern Italians were reminded of their dependence on electricity one morning at the end of August. The grid in central Italy had tripped, blacking out the south for several hours. Trains were stuck between stations, passengers trapped in lifts and, in the middle of a heat wave, refrigerators ceased functioning. It is easy to understand why angry users demanded that privatisation of the state electricity corporation, Enel, should be speeded up. At the same time, however, opponents of privatisation were quick to use the black-out for justifying their position. They claimed that the absence of state control over the electricity industry would lead to poorer service, with higher risk of more and longer power cuts. While the black-out seriously inconvenienced about 18m users, it did provide ammunition in the privatisation debate. Enel's reaction to the black-out and the relatively prompt return of the grid has also been exploited by those prepared to accept privatisation provided Enel is retained as a unified, vertically integrated electricity corporation. They say that restoring supplies in southern Italy would have been much harder with a fragmented industry. Whether Enel should be split into separate production, transmission and distribution companies, or left alone, has been an issue dividing privatisers and partners of the governing coalition. Alleanza Nazionale (AN) is firmly against break-up, partly because of its centralist and corporatist fascist roots and partly because its electoral base is concentrated in the south. If Enel were split, southern users might suffer in terms of poorer service and higher tariffs. Lega Nord has different ideas to its AN coalition partner. Favouring a federal political structure, it is not surprising that it leads calls for splitting Enel. Mr Vito Gnutti, Lega Nord industry minister, says that selling Enel as a unified, vertically integrated utility would only create a private sector monopoly. Support for splitting Enel came in a document from the anti-trust authority at the end of June. The authority considers that promotion of competition in the electricity sector requires that Enel's privatisation should be directed towards market liberalisation. British experience should provide the guide, suggests the anti-trust authority. It proposes: separating ownership and management of the production, transmission and distribution phases; selling off production plant; maintaining the single and centralised management of the transmission system; and reorganising distribution on a regional basis with the creation of separate companies. Such proposals have met vigorous opposition from Enel's senior management. They argue that a unified and vertically integrated structure offers advantages of better plant co-ordination and security and service guarantees, economies of scale in production, distribution economies, negotiating muscle with international fuel suppliers and homogeneous tariff structures. Enel says that there is also financial advantage in privatising the corporation as it stands. In a brief prepared for a hearing by a Senate commission in September, the corporation's board noted that splitting Enel would damage the image and credit rating that it presently enjoys in international financial markets. 'The sale of shares in a large corporation like Enel, that is well known and has good standing in national and international markets, would certainly be more successful than stock market quotation of several smaller, and unknown, companies derived from break-up.' Break-up would need time, and would probably necessitate the appointment of new management given the opposition expressed by Mr Franco Viezzoli, chairman, and Mr Alfonso Limbruno, managing director. So if the government's schedule for privatisation in the first half of next year is to be met, Enel will have to be sold as it stands. Enel became a joint stock corporation in July 1992 and London merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was appointed the Treasury's advisers on privatisation in August last year. There has since been continuous co-operation aimed at preparing Enel for stock market quotation, the corporation's officers told the Senate commission. Indeed, Enel is ready for the market. 'Preparatory measures for share quotation that are Enel's responsibility have been completed. Kleinwort Benson's work is finished. Other measures that need to be taken are those connected with the quotation which can only be commenced when the quotation itself is decided,' the commission was informed. Two crucial political decisions have been under discussion for some time. These are the stipulation of an operating concession and the establishment of a regulatory authority for the electricity industry. The operating concession has been a controversial issue since reports that it would give Enel a 99-year deal. Free marketeers, municipal utilities and vehicle producers reacted immediately. So did the anti-trust authority, which suggested that the concession's duration should be 20 years. The anti-trust authority recommended: 'The concession should indicate clearly and unequivocally that there should be no guarantee of economic indemnification in the event that exclusive rights should be removed as a result of changes in national or Community law.' The concession is a critical piece in the privatisation puzzle, shaping the structure of Italy's electricity industry through the conditions it establishes and the roles that it defines for a privatised Enel and other operators. With enactment of legislation at the end of July, establishment of the regulatory authority became critical. The law requires that sale of state shareholdings in energy companies must be subordinate to the creation of an independent body for regulating tariffs and overseeing service quality. Enel cannot be privatised until there is a regulatory authority. With the coalition parties haggling over the number of its members, and with uncertainty about its role and that of the industry ministry in tariff setting, establishing the regulatory authority has not been straightforward. At least Enel's financial indebtedness, often described as needing attention before privatisation, is no longer considered an obstacle. Medium and long-term debt was L34,504bn at the end of last year and the net short-term bank position showed borrowings of L2,003bn on net equity of L20,000bn. However, net indebtedness fell by L1,448bn in the first half this year, with internally generated finance increasing to L5,235bn from L4,005bn in first-half 1993. Profits have also improved. The post-tax result was L344bn last year, 47 per cent up on 1992. Enel's board considers that the operating margin in the first half, 29 per cent higher than last year, and continuing rationalisation allow expectations of a full-year outturn better than 1993. Potential investors will be looking closely at profits and will want to see further substantial increases. Despite the improvement, last year's result would have been insufficient for satisfactory shareholder remuneration. Says Mr Paolo Azzoni of Milan securities house Gamba &amp; Azzoni, the Paribas Capital Markets subsidiary: 'As an electricity utility, investors will be looking for dividends from Enel. Profit is crucial.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------               ENEL KEY FIGURES (in billions of lira)  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                      1991     1992     1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Sales revenues                     25,903   28,536   30,104 Added value                        17,422   19,114   19,304 Gross operating margin              9,052   10,241   10,618 Depreciation                        4,310    4,103    4,298 Profit before tax*                  1,300    2,110    1,089 Accelerated depreciation            1,209    2,026    1,853 Net post-tax profit                   229      234      344 Net financial indebtedness         32,170   34,291   36,507 Payroll (000s)                      109.7    107.4    105.8 Net production (TWh)                168.0    168.8    163.7 Sales (TWh)                         194.1    197.5    198.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Note: *and extraordinary items  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Enel  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

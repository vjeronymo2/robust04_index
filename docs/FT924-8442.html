			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / People: Draper bows out of Virgin Music Simon Draper, Richard Branson's second cousin by marriage and the musical ears of the Virgin Music Group, is leaving to pursue other interests - chiefly classic car collecting and historic motor racing. 'I knew the day it was sold that I would go. I have never worked for anyone else,' says 42-year-old Draper, whose discovery of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells put the Virgin label on the map. Earlier this year, Thorn EMI paid Pounds 510m for the group, which in 20 years grew into the world's fifth largest record company. Draper says that, while he ran the company for a decade until 1988, he had gradually delegated more of the day-to-day operations to Ken Berry, though he had retained the title of chairman until the takeover. Indeed, he claims to have been keener on selling out than was his cousin. 'I become disenchanted with the business two years ago.' Since he arrived from university in South Africa in 1970 to join Virgin part-time, Draper says he had seen the whole cycle of a company's growth and that 'enough was enough'. After the Thorn EMI deal, he had 'chosen' the title of principal A&amp;R adviser and stayed on because he was 'genuinely not sure' what would happen; he will now leave when Thorn will let him go. For the moment he will indulge his love of classic cars, and race with his 'great friend' Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason. He says he fails to be inspired by a lot of today's music, but that he may in time make a comeback.</p>

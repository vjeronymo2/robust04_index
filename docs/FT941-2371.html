			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Currency overlay strategies find wider appeal - Risk and Reward The currency overlay, long a practice of US investors, is slowly making its way across the Atlantic and is attracting increasing attention from UK fund managers. Since good value in a bond or stock market does not necessarily mean good value in its currency, portfolio managers can use overlay strategies to separate their currency decision from their underlying bond or equity decision. This enables them to offset their currency risk, and in some cases to enhance their returns. Imagine a UK pension fund with a 15 per cent holding in US equities, says Mr Les Halpin, chief executive at Record Treasury Management. 'We would hedge the currency exposure on that position so that, if the dollar drops, the fund is short dollars,' he says. Conversely, 'if the dollar rises, we would try to ensure the fund is neutral on the currency position so that it benefits from the rise.' European bond markets last year provided a classic example of the benefits of overlay, says Mr John Stopford, bond and currency manager at Guinness Flight. The high-yielders - Italy, Spain and Scandinavia - offered the best-performing bond markets but the worst-performing currencies. 'If you had held bonds unhedged you would have gained on the bonds, but lost on the currencies. By separating the two investment decisions, you could benefit from both the fixed-income and the currency element.' Guinness Flight has been using overlay strategies on its international bond portfolios for years. The fixed-income allocation of its Global Bond Fund currently includes a 5 per cent holding in US Treasuries, 20 per cent in Italian bonds and 10 per cent each in Australian, Spanish, Danish, Japanese bonds and gilts. The fund's currency exposure diverges markedly: 57 1/2 per cent is held in US dollars, 15 per cent in Australian dollars, 10 per cent in Italian lire and 5 per cent each in Canadian dollars and Swedish kronor. Rather than seeking merely to limit their downside risk, more and more money managers are using dynamic currency strategies to boost their returns. 'You increase your exposure to foreign currencies when they strengthen and reduce it when they weaken,' says Mr Reza Vishkai, director of international equity research at US consultants Rogers Casey. This strategy protects investors' downside but allows them to participate in the upside. According to Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan, there is good reason why currency overlay has taken so long to catch on in Europe. 'Correlations between bonds and currencies switch from positive to negative depending on the force of European convergence,' he says. In an environment of currency stability, as between 1987 and 1992, currencies and bonds perform as though they were the same asset class. But in an environment of divergence, as in the UK since September 1992 when it left the European exchange rate mechanism, 'bonds and currencies have become very separate asset classes and currency overlay adds significant risk reduction to a portfolio,' he says. Between October 1993 and January 1994, sterling's 5 - 6 per cent rise contrasted with a 2.5 per cent fall in 10-year gilt prices. Currency markets have been relatively calm since the ERM turmoil. However, 'currencies will continue to be volatile, and there are gains to be made,' predicts Ms Celia Cull, director of fixed income at BZW Investment Management. BZW last year developed a currency trading model. 'If it is successful, an overlay product may fall out of it,' she says.</p>

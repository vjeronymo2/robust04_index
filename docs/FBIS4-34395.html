			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jairo Calle and unidentified </F> announcer]    [Text] [Announcer] We have a last minute report from  Medellin. Here is Jairo Calle:    [Calle] Yes, good evening. Unfortunately, there has been an  escalation of terrorism in the city. Approximately eight bombs  have been detonated in different areas of the city. So far,  there is no report from the authorities about the situation.  The only thing we know is that there have been detonations in  the city's east side and the nearby Bello Municipality. There  have also been explosions near the Caracol facilities in Los  Laureles and in the area of 80th Boulevard in western Medellin.  So far there are no reports on whether the detonations, which  have alarmed citizens, have caused casualties or damage. This  is our report from Medellin. We understand that many of these  terrorist actions were directed at banks. The authorities have  begun to report that some CONAVI's [National Savings and Housing  Corporation], such as the one located in Manrique in the city's  east side, have been the target of these explosions. The  Suramericana Bank branch in Los Laureles, near Caracol, was also  affected by one of the explosions.    [Announcer] Jairo, might this be an escalation of acts of  terrorism like the ones the Simon Bolivar Guerrilla Coordinating  Board frequently undertakes in various parts of the country?  You say that eight bombs have exploded so far?    [Calle] Yes, this is an escalation that had been foreseen.  The authorities had intensified the so-called Democracy Plan  this evening because there was intelligence information about  these terrorist attacks and sabotage of the city's urban bus  service, as occurred before the previous elections, when 16  vehicles were set on fire.    [Announcer] Well, eight bombs have exploded in the past few  minutes in Medellin. Authorities indicate that it seems this is  an escalation of terrorism against banking institutions. So  far, no casualties are reported, although there are damages.</p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES trod a measured but reasonably firm path, with much of Friday's vigour having dissipated and hopes of an imminent interest rate cut fading, writes Christine Buckley. The December contract on the FT-SE 100 started at 3,149 and mustered a small rally which was knocked back by a slightly higher than expected public sector borrowing requirement. Some momentum came back to the market ahead of Wall Street's opening and the contract reached its day's high of 3,167. But with the US market proving a little soggy the contract then began to drift back although it kept ahead of its premium to the cash market. Some long positions by dealers added a technical acceleration to the contract's afternoon slide. Further brakes came from lacklustre gilts and short sterling. The contract ended at 3,156 which was 4 points up on its fair value premium to cash which is taken at about 15 points. At 7,235 contracts, the volume was moderate. Index options continued to prove a strong part of traded options with much activity in December puts on the FT-SE 100 option. The move into December FT-SE options a sign of hedging in readiness for the Budget. Of the total traded options volume of 37,913 lots, 18,693 was in the FT-SE 100 and 2,485 in the Euro FT-SE.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and </F> Libyan Foreign Minister 'Umar al-Muntasir by Fu'ad Abu-Mansur in  Tunis on the "last day" of the OAU ministerial council meeting]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    [Abu-Mansur] What is Egypt's position and stand amid the  attempts to Arabize and internationalize the Yemeni crisis?    [Musa] What does the Arabization and internationalization of  the crisis mean? Some people are fearful of these two words,  and this means leaving things as they are and looking at the  crisis with indifference. We urgently call for respecting the  UN ceasefire resolution. The party that does not implement the  ceasefire resolution will be violating international legitimacy.  We were afraid of the Arabization or internationalization in  the Gulf war and there are some now who want to do the same in a  tacit attempt to let the blood flow. We reject this totally and  reject this reasoning.    [Abu-Mansur] When will Egypt recognize the Democratic  Republic in south Yemen? When will it recognize the secession?    [Musa] Egypt supports Arab and international legitimacy in  this issue as in others. We support Yemeni unity. But this  unity cannot be imposed and cannot be maintained through  bloodshed. This is a clear stand and there is no need to  elaborate further on it.    Libyan Foreign Minister 'Umar al-Muntasir replied to  AL-ANWAR'S questions as follows:    [Abu-Mansur] Is the "Lockerbie" case included in the African  summit's agenda? Are you seeking an African stand supporting  your views as was the case, for example, with the Arab League?    [Al-Muntasir] The Lockerbie issue was raised at the  committee  level. We want the summit to issue a resolution supporting  Libya as the Arab League and the Nonaligned Movement have done.  We believe that merely holding the summit in fraternal Tunisia  means a decision that supports our stand on the Lockerbie case  and the decisions on extraditing the Libyans accused of  exploding an American plane over Scotland several years ago.    [Abu-Mansur] What are the new factors and developments in  the  dispute between Libya and the three Western countries--the  United States, France, and Britain? It has been reported that  the issue is going around in a vicious circle.    [Al-Muntasir] We still hold that the Libyans are innocent.  But we have agreed to have them tried in a neutral country or  before the International Court of Justice in The Hague. We are  expecting the OAU summit in Tunisia to issue a resolution  backing Libya's demand, similar to the ones issued by the Arab  League and the OAU. We are hoping for this, especially as  Tunisia is hosting the summit.    [Abu-Mansur] What is the Libyan Jamahiriyah's stand on the  Yemeni crisis? What solutions do you propose to stop the  bloodshed?    [Al-Muntasir] We are now in an African forum and there is no  scope for dealing with this issue. But in reply to your  question, I say that we support Yemeni unity and Libya cannot  support the south's secession from the north. Regarding the  solution, we believe that it should be a Yemeni one in the first  place because the dispute is an internal one. Officials there  should find a solution that takes into account the Yemeni  people's interests and responds to their aspirations and hopes.  We in Libya believe that the Yemeni people cannot lean toward  partition and fragmentation. We have conveyed our stand to the  Yemeni brothers.    [Abu-Mansur] How do you assess the efforts to Arabize and  internationalize the Yemeni crisis so as to contain the war and  limit the losses caused by the bloody conflict, which is taking  the form of a "scorched earth action?"    [Al-Muntasir] We in Libya reject the internationalization of  the Yemeni crisis.    [Abu-Mansur] And the Arabization? What do you say to that?    [Al-Muntasir] We say: There is no power and might without  God Almighty. [passage omitted]</p>

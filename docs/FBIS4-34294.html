			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan police  found 42 gasoline bombs at a high school in the capital today.  Meanwhile, student protests against the government continue.    Orlando Hernandez, chief of the Metropolitan Police (PM),  told the press his men had also found enough fuel and containers  to make an additional 50 Molotov cocktails. The materials were  found at Andres Eloy Blanco High School.    Student demonstrations worsened in the last few hours, in  protest of the repression against student activities, the high  cost of living, the plans to increase fares for urban  transportation, and the government's poor handling of the  banking crisis.    Hundreds of depositors of the eight banks in which the  government intervened yesterday gathered outside the head  offices of these institutions in an attempt to pressure the  government into allowing them to withdraw their money.    The government will administrate the funds of the eight  intervened banks. Depositors will be allowed to have access to  only a portion of their money.    A group of students from a high school in the western  section  of Caracas hurled rocks and gasoline bombs at riot police, who  responded with tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Two  policemen were injured in the clashes and taken to nearby  hospitals.    In other cities around the country, such as Maracaibo,  Barquisimeto, and Valencia, protests continued for a third  consecutive day. In light of this, the National Guard has moved  in.    Local news media have reported 100 peasants were arrested in  the town of Turen, 400 km from Caracas, after staging  demonstrations to protest high prices and looting several stores.    Defense Minister Rafael Montero has accused Lieutenant  Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias (who led the February 1992 coup  attempt) of being one of the instigators of the recent wave of  protests the country has experienced.</p>

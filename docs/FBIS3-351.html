For the moment, the tense atmosphere between the two countries  has cooled off. This disclosure was made this afternoon by  Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe who was  granted audience in Lome II by the head of state, General  Gnassingbe Eyadema. Let's listen to the Nigerian diplomat.    [Begin recording] [Kingibe] My visit to Togo today is in  line  with regular consultations between Nigeria and Togo especially  when a problem arises in our region or between our two  countries. As you are aware, the Togolese president has taken an  initiative which has deeply touched all Nigerians by going to  Cameroon and Nigeria to see if he could offer some sort of  mediation in this small problem between Nigeria and Cameroon.  So, I have come here in this context and presently there is a  Togolese delegation in Abuja. My Togolese counterpart is  currently in Abuja. So, you see that it is normal for Nigeria  and Togo to always have regular and very close contacts and  consultations.    I have come here in this context and I am highly satisfied  with the outcome of my talks with the president. I came to  convey some suggestions and viewpoints of President Sani Abacha  and I am very pleased with the observations made by President  Eyadema on this viewpoints. I am happy to confirm that, thanks  to President Eyadema's personal intervention and also to other  measures adopted by President Sani Abacha and President Paul  Biya, the present tension has cooled off a great deal. Calm  prevails now, and the two governments -- the two leaders -- have  demonstrated their desire to engage in fraternal dialogue and to  avoid internationalizing the dispute. So, the prevailing  atmosphere is very, very satisfactory now. Calm now prevails.    [Unidentified correspondent] Will the heads of state meet?    [Kingibe] By the grace of God.    [Correspondent] And will the meeting come very soon?    [Kingibe] I hope very, very soon. But the truth is that no  precise date has been fixed now. However, I am very confident  that a meeting will be held very, very soon. [end recording]</p>

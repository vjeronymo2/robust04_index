The security regulations there prevent us from showing  them to you, but I can tell you that there has been an emergency  there. Paramilitary protection service personnel here have  discovered a theft of nuclear fuel as used by nuclear  submarines. Three uranium control rods have been stolen. A  crime file has been opened. The theft is being investigated by  a special interdepartmental group which includes representatives  of the Fleet Military Prosecutor's Office, military  counterintelligence organs, and the Internal Affairs  Directorate. The theft, the specialists believe, was committed  by people familiar with this kind of nuclear fuel. That is, the  thieves knew in advance that the fuel rods represent a health  hazard.    [A. Zolotkov, engineer of the Murmansk Maritime Shipping  Company radiation safety service, identified by caption]  Nothing like this has ever happened in Murmansk before.  However, I am convinced that but for our mismanagement and  negligence this theft would not have taken place. All it needs  is to commission the branch railroad built long ago for the  Northern Fleet military base in Zapadnaya Litsa and the  equivalent civilian nuclear fleet enterprise for this fuel  transit center to be dispensed with.

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Public school heads demand A-level reform The A-level exams taken by pupils aged 17 and 18 in England and Wales must be reformed and the divide between academic and vocational qualifications abandoned, independent school headteachers recommended yesterday. Their proposal follows calls for a radical reform of sixth form studies from organisations including the Labour party, the Confederation of British Industry and the Industrial Society. However, the government refers to A-levels as an 'academic gold standard', and reform was ruled out last year by Mr John Patten, then education secretary. The Headmasters' Conference, which represents the heads of the most prestigious independent mixed and boys' schools, meeting in Bournemouth, said: 'We believe the terms academic and vocational as they are currently used are misleading and damaging.' A working party of headteachers, including representatives of several schools which regularly reach the top of government national rankings of A-level results, described the exams as 'educationally wasteful'. It said 30 per cent of 18-year-olds were now attempting academic A-levels, although they were designed to be taken by a significantly narrower proportion of the age group. More than a quarter of those attempting them abandoned them or failed. Instead, the heads recommended there should be a 'structured progression' from a broad national curriculum to 'something more differentiated', which took account of differing aptitudes. This system would give equal esteem to vocational courses by subsuming all current qualifications under a general 'advanced certificate of secondary education'. One central authority would oversee the qualifications. Responsibility is split at the moment between the education and employment departments.</p>

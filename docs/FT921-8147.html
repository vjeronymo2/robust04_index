			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Den norske Bank losses treble DEN norske Bank, the troubled Norwegian bank, yesterday unveiled a three-fold increase in net losses, before extraordinary items, for 1991. It also warned that non-performing loans would not show a rapid decline until the Norwegian economy improves. Net losses for last year totalled NKr4.32bn (Dollars 679m). DnB said that operating profit, before tax and credit losses, was halved to NKr1.27bn, against NKr2.54bn in 1990. Credit losses swelled by NKr1.77bn to NKr5.58bn. DnB said that the net volume of non-performing loans was NKr8.58bn at the end of 1991 but that accumulated provisions for estimated losses totalled about NKr8.9bn. 'The adverse trend in the Norwegian economy in the last part of 1991 made it necessary to increase loan-loss provisions substantially,' explained Mr Finn Hvistendahl, DnB president. Mr Hvistendahl added that income on 'healthy' loans was acceptable. Nevertheless, net interest income slipped to NKr4.66bn from NKr4.95bn in 1990. He declined to give a forecast for the development of the bank in 1992. Local analysts say there is unlikely to be any significant improvement this year. One bright note is that DnB managed to reduce costs to NKr4.96bn last year from NKr5.59bn in 1990. 'Since 1988, costs have been pared by NKr1.09bn, with staff reductions of 2,466 full-time positions. The bank is now considerably more cost efficient,' Mr Hvistendahl said. 'The accounts show that income on healthy loans is acceptable,' he said. The bank's income on trading in foreign exchange and treasury products as well as income generated in some of the bank's domestic subsidiaries is considered satisfactory as well, the group said. The recent restructuring of the group's operations into separate divisions for private customers and medium-sized corporate clients will contribute to improved profitability, Hvistendahl said. In a complex deal orchestrated by the state, DnB's biggest shareholder, last December the bank acquired Realkreditt, a financially-troubled mortgage group. Realkreditt will be consolidated into the bank's accounts this year. Realkreditt yesterday announced 1991 net losses, before extraordinary items, of NKr1.28bn from NKr165.8m in 1990. Realkreditt posted an operating loss, after credit losses, of NKr762.7m, up from 1990's operating loss of NKr496.2m. Credit losses rose by NKr45m to NKr624m. Realkreditt explained that last year's figures were strongly influenced by restructuring costs - put at NKr163m - and a continued fall in the value of property values which forced it to write down significantly the value of its property portfolio.</p>

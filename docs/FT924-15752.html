			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Eastern eyes on Trafalgar's treasure chest: Andrew Taylor and Roland Rudd explain the attraction of a debt-laden conglomerate Trafalgar House is a debt-laden property developer boasting a ship with a hole in it, hotels with empty rooms and a management reportedly at each others' throats. Its share price dropped by two thirds in five months, and - say critics - its purchase last year of the Davy engineering business may have cost too much. So why is Hongkong Land buying a large minority stake? The answer lies in the potential value locked away in Trafalgar's battered treasure chest of famous names: Cunard, Ritz, Scott Lithgow, John Brown and Davy. Some of these businesses have lost their sparkle - and the QE2, Cunard's most glamorous cruise liner, is under repair after running aground last month. But if the businesses were sold separately, they might fetch more than Trafalgar's market capitalisation of just over Pounds 600m. This calculation, say observers, lies behind yesterday's dawn raid on Trafalgar's shares by Hongkong Land, a sister company of Jardine Matheson, one of the last of the traditional expatriate-run Hong Kong trading companies. In a matter of hours, Hongkong Land built up a stake of just under 15 per cent in Trafalgar. It announced its intention of moving as soon as possible to 29.9 per cent, the maximum permitted without triggering a full bid under Takeover Panel rules. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson, met Sir Nigel Broackes, Trafalgar's founder-chairman, to tell him of their move. Sir Nigel must have been half-expecting such a visit. The slide in Trafalgar's share price before the raid had left the company conscious of its vulnerability. It has been hinting that it might be prepared to sell its hotel and shipping businesses - which include the QE2 and the Ritz - at the right price. That would leave management to concentrate on a core business of construction and engineering, running alongside a shrunken property operation. Any benefit this news might have brought to the shares was promptly undone by reports that the plan was setting Trafalgar's senior management at loggerheads. Sir Nigel Broackes is said to have faced disagreement from his chief executive Sir Eric Parker, who disliked the idea. Now Hongkong Land has stepped in, offering a warm but potentially stifling embrace. It has two choices: to leave the management in place to carry out the divestment plan; or, if it grows dissatisfied, to press for management changes. It has already indicated it will ask for seats on the Trafalgar board. Not surprisingly, Trafalgar's advisers were yesterday indicating that the group views Hongkong Land's actions as hostile. Sir Eric Parker said: 'If there was a full bid we would know where we stood. But this in-between situation is unacceptable. 'We are in no mood to change the board. However, if Hongkong Land gets control of 29 per cent of the shares we will have to listen to what they have to say.' A move by Hongkong Land to realise some of the value locked away in a weakened Trafalgar House may not be without risk. Trafalgar itself discovered the perils of bargain-hunting last year when it bought Davy. Trafalgar seemed to be paying a discount price when it agreed to pay Pounds 114m for Davy. Since then, however, it has had to inject more than Pounds 100m of working capital into Davy, after finding that its problems were worse than it had thought. As a result, Trafalgar remains highly borrowed. Net debt, including off balance sheet borrowings, is estimated by City analysts at about Pounds 550m, representing gearing of nearly 90 per cent. Group results for the 12 months to the end of September are expected to include further substantial write-downs against its recession-hit housebuilding and commercial property operations. Analysts estimate that pre-tax profits for the period have fallen from Pounds 122m to anywhere between Pounds 60m to Pounds 100m. Faced by these difficulties, it would be surprising if Trafalgar pays better than a nominal final dividend. So how much is the business worth? It depends on whether you look at the profit and loss statement or the balance sheet, according to Mr Andrew Mitchell, conglomerates analyst with stockbroker Smith New Court. He says the group's engineering and construction business needs few fixed assets and is a generous cash generator; in the last 12 months, he thinks, it has generated profits of more than Pounds 100m. Assuming earnings of 7p a share and a conservative multiple of 12.5 times historic earnings, this business alone could be worth 90p a share. On the basis of 1992 earnings Mr Mitchell has calculated an overall value for the group of 109p a share. That makes Trafalgar look cheap, based on Wednesday's closing price of 60 1/2 p for the ordinary shares, and still good value at yesterday's 89 1/2 p. However, a look at the balance sheet produces a different answer. The group's net asset value may have sunk as low as 33p a share, says Mr Mitchell, if you discount the properties to reflect the current state of the market. Such a calculation indicates that Hongkong Land might wish to follow the Broackes strategy, selling the asset-heavy parts of the business to concentrate on the engineering business created from Davy and John Brown. When things go well, process engineering is a highly profitable, cash generating business. There are huge sums at stake, however, in a typical contract - and it only takes one contract to go wrong to wreck the profits. That gives some force to Sir Eric Parker's comment yesterday: 'Hongkong Land is just a property developer. What experience do they have of managing a construction and engineering group?' If it came to a fight, however, he might find that shareholders preferred a new hand, however inexperienced.

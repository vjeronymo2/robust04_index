			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HOMELESSNESS IN SUBURBIA' AND SHEEN'S OFFER OF A SANCTUARY  </P> <P> After reading, and re-reading many times Pettepiece's poignant article I came  to the realization that most of us are only a few weeks away from joining the  ranks of the homeless when unexpected adversity strikes.  </P> <P> Bravo to Pettepiece for sharing his experiences. Also, best wishes for success  in his literary career.  </P> <P> M. POLLARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

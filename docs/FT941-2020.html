			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Howe pins dam blame on Younger Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, said yesterday that the decision to link an offer of aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam project with a Pounds 1bn defence contract was taken entirely by Lord Younger, his cabinet colleague in 1988. He said a protocol signed by Lord Younger, who was defence secretary at the time, and the Malaysian government in March of that year had caused 'animation', 'astonishment' and 'dismay' in Whitehall when its contents became known. In recent months the focus in the affair has been on claims that the linkage between the aid and defence deals could have broken established government guidelines prohibiting such entanglement. Lord Howe yesterday revealed to the Commons foreign affairs committee that one of his principal concerns at the time was that the protocol, which he said made 'a substantial moral commitment' to offer aid, could have allowed the Malaysians to make a considerable call on funds from Britain's aid budget. In particular, Lord Howe supported claims that Lord Younger had risked committing the government's entire budget for aid and trade provision to Malaysia for three years when he secured a contract to sell defence equipment in 1988, according to evidence given yesterday to MPs. He said that, under the terms of the protocol, the UK 'took note' of the Malaysian government's wish that a promise of aid in support of non-military projects should amount to no less than 20 per cent of the defence sales. He pointed out that - with a defence deal potentially worth Pounds 1.5bn in the making - this would immediately have committed the UK to grant Malaysia Pounds 300m in cash, three times the annual budget of the scheme which gives aid to developing countries so that they can secure British contracts. 'We had to limit the financial commitment involved,' Lord Howe said. He said that he understood Lord Younger's determination to secure the defence contract. 'In retrospect we can say it was an error of judgment, but at the time the main thing was that he got the deal.' He outlined how senior figures from five Whitehall departments - including Mr John Major, the then chief secretary to the Treasury - tried to disentangle the connection between the defence and aid deals after Lord Younger returned from Kuala Lumpur. He was also critical of Sir Nicholas Spreckley, Britain's former high commissioner to Malaysia, saying that he was 'slightly surprised' not to have received a memorandum on the deal that Lord Younger was planning to sign. The commitment to offer Pounds 300m could have undermined contracts signed with Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Thailand and other developing countries. It is understood that, under the regulations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an aid and trade provision grant can comprise at most 35 per cent of a total package, the rest of which must be made up of private-sector money. Lord Younger's commitment might therefore have forced Britain to find private backers for Pounds 1.5bn of non-military projects in Malaysia.</p>

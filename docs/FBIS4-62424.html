			<p>BFN     [Text] A large number of people, including refugees from  Abkhazia, gathered in front of the Georgian parliament today.  They wrote a statement that was later read at the evening  sitting of parliament. The statement demands that the  Georgian-Abkhaz agreement should not be signed and yesterday's  decision by parliament should be complied with. In the case of  the opposite happening, a hunger-strike would be staged outside  the parliament building.</p>

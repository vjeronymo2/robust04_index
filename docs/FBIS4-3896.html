			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Authorities Confirm Explosion in </F> Xichang Satellite Base in Early April"]    [Text] The Chinese authorities confirmed that an explosion  occurred on 2 April at the Xichang Satellite Launching Base.  One person was killed in the accident and over 20 people were  injured. A laboratory and an advanced meteorological satellite  were destroyed. Western space experts believe that the accident  was a serious setback for China's aerospace industry.    A spokesman for China's Aerospace Industry Corporation  confirmed the accident to foreign mass media after the U.S.  magazine NEWSWEEK published a report about the explosion in  Xichang. However, the spokesman said that only one person was  killed and this was different from the NEWSWEEK report claiming  two deaths. It is said that the satellite destroyed in the  accident cost $75 million. MING PAO took the lead in reporting  about the Xichang explosion on 9 April.    The spokesman for the Aerospace Industry Corporation  stressed  that the accident would not affect China's plan to launch other  satellites throughout the rest of this year. Last month,  GONGREN RIBAO reported that China planned to launch five  satellites this year.    The spokesman also said that the authorities were  investigating the cause of the explosion and would make public  the findings once they reached a conclusion.    NEWSWEEK, in the latest issue published yesterday, quoted a  diplomat as saying that the explosion was caused by a leak in  the fuel supply system. The NEWSWEEK report said that this was  a serious setback for China's aerospace development plan.    China attaches great importance to its satellite launching  plans. On 8 April, the Chinese official mass media said only  that the satellite launch was postponed due to unexpected  factors. According to the original plan, a Fengyun-2  meteorological satellite was to be carried into space orbit by a  Changzheng-3 rocket.    In fact, China has strong competitive power in the field of  satellite launching. Although a live televised satellite launch  failed in 1992, people in this industry believe that the Chinese  rockets were basically reliable and were extremely "economical."  China only charged $45 million for launching a customer's  satellite and this was much cheaper than the American and  European services. The American companies normally charge $100  million and Europe's Ariane Company charges $85 million.</p>

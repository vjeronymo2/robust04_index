Reportedly, the technique can  also be applied to other metals. Consequently, the NEW SCIENTIST  reports (No. 1917, p. 18, 1994), in future a number of new  liquid crystals could be created with interesting properties,  as, for example, coloration.    The incorporation of metals in liquid crystals can improve  their properties. The crystals, reportedly, become more stable  because of their greater polarizability. Polarizability is the  ability to change the electronic structure into electrical  fields. In addition, displays incorporating such liquid crystals  are more legible because the metals also alter the optical  properties.    Since metals are prone toward coloration, liquid crystal  displays of various colors could also be produced without the  need of expensive color filters. Finally, the metals could also  make the displays respond to magnetic and electrical switching,  since almost all metals react to external magnetic fields.    Because of the special form a molecule must have to form a  liquid crystal, it has so far only been possible to incorporate  a handful of metals in liquid crystals. The molecule must be  long and, above all, flat. But most metals prefer tetrahedron-  or octahedron-structured environments. Only a very few, as, for  example, platinum, nickel, and copper, accept planar structures.    Duncan Bruce and Xiao-Hua Liu of Sheffield University  (Center  of Molecular Materials, Department of Chemistry, Sheffield, UK  S3 7HF) have succeeded in producing a molecule that contains  octahedron-bound manganese. The metal atom is introduced  somewhat to the side in about the middle of the long rod-like  molecule so as not to disrupt the formation of a liquid  crystalline phase.    The molecule is a particle in which the structural elements  are linked together in a chain-like manner. There are long  hydrocarbon groups at the ends; in the middle there are ester  bonds and a so-called imino group by means of which the  manganese atom is bound. The scientists report in the journal of  the Chemical Society, CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS (No. 6, p. 729,  1994) that the metal also has four additional carbonyl groups  that hold the complex together.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Food: Making the best of beetroot - Cookery even in the world of fresh foods. First, there were stewing packs of diced root vegetables; stir-fry packs of bean sprouts with batons of courgettes and carrot; and whole cauliflowers stripped of their leaves and broken into sprigs, plastic-filmed and on a tray ready for microwaving. Now, it is hard to buy rocket on its own, although every supermarket offers it as an ingredient in a ready-washed-and-mixed salad leaf pack. And vandals seem set on destroying the sculptural beauty of pineapple which is sold ready-peeled, cored and stamped into unenticing rings. Next? Probably ready-peeled-and-pipped grapes, marketed as 'the ultimate gift for the sick.' In the face of all this hideous trimming, I am defiant. I buy vegetables in bunches whenever I can. There is something reassuring about their earthy exuberance. The billowing leaves and whiskery rootlets fighting to escape the wasp-waist rubber bands that hold the stalks in check are a happy reminder that real food still exists. Vegetables should be bursting with life when they reach the cook. In Mediterranean markets, leeks and milky-fresh garlic often are displayed with their long flowing leaves intact. Tomatoes may be sold in long tresses on the stalk. Herbs are tied in sweet-scented nosegays. Ruby and white ribbed chards are offered in colourful bunches. So, too, are tiny green and violet artichokes, as pretty as bouquets of flowers. In Britain, peppery watercress and radishes traditionally are bunched. So are baby turnips and young carrots the feathery foliage of which so delighted the Stuarts that these royals pinned great green sweeps of it to their hats). Then there are bunches of summer beetroots, a welcome sight in the shops just now and stars of my recipe this week. The aromatic sharpness of blackcurrant and the earthy sweetness of beetroot team well, a glowing partnership that is particularly good with rich meats such as duck. BEETROOT AND BLACKCURRANT SALAD WITH DUCK To serve 4-6 people, allow 1 x 5-6 oz boneless duck breast portion per person. Fry them gently in a heavy-based pan, cooking them skin side down for most of the time to avoid toughening the meat and to render most of the fat. Pour off the fat as it runs from them. Let the cooked duck rest and cool completely. Carve into thin slices for serving and spread the cold jellied pan juices on lightly-toasted ciabatta to eat with the meat. The beetroots, like the duck, should be prepared several hours or a day ahead. Snip the leaves off  3/4 -1 lb of them, taking care to cut well above the bulbous roots or they will'bleed' profusely and lose colour in cooking. Do not trim the whiskery rootlets. Save the leaves to use for another dish: chop them, stew in butter and use for stuffing pork or an omelette. Wash the roots gently and cook them in boiling water with a slice or two of lemon for an hour or so until the skins feel loose (or bake them for twice as long in a low oven). Cool completely (in the cooking liquid if boiled). Strip  1/2 lb blackcurrants into a pan. Add 3-4 tablespoons water and 2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste. Cover and cook until the fruit is warm and tender and the juices begin to flow. Keep the flame low and shake the pan occasionally to encourage even cooking. Fierce heat and/or stirring risks overcooking and breaking up the fruit. Let the cooked fruit cool a little while you skin and dice the beetroots. Grind plenty of black pepper over them, then pour on the contents of the blackcurrant pan. Mix gently, adding a splash of the beetroot cooking water to thin the sauce if liked, and strew with a little chopped tarragon, dill or mint.</p>

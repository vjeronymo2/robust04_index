This would also  be in the interest of the Western alliance." Bronislaw  Geremek's advice to Western leaders was very clear. At the  weekend, the chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of the  Polish Parliament gave a lecture at the Institute for the  Sciences of Man in Vienna on the issue of: "The collapse of  communism and European security."    After the collapse of the communist regimes, Professor  Geremek sees internal and external reasons for the feeling of  insecurity in Central and East Europe: The conversion to the  mechanisms of the market economy has led to a steep increase in  the number of unemployed; the crime rate has also exploded, "a  fact that is dramatically undermining public security." Of the  external reasons he regards first of all Russia as the main  source of danger "because it has not given up its imperial  ambitions. Thus, NATO membership would significantly strengthen  the feeling of security but also the process of democratization  in the new democracies," Geremek said.    If, however, NATO were to continue to oppose expansion, the  Polish politician suspects that "the spirit of Yalta would  continue to prevail, and the division of the world would be  prolonged. The imperial tendencies in Russia would even  increase." Geremek believes that the current NATO cooperation  scheme Partnership for Peace and the possibility for cooperation  in the Western European Union is "not an adequate response to  Russia's neo-imperial tendencies."    Europe is currently at a crossroads. Geremek: "Europe must  look ahead and, especially on the issue of security policy, give  up its traditional bureaucratic way of thinking."    According to agency reports from Brussels, Russia recently  linked its participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program  to a series of conditions: Moscow has demanded a veto on NATO  planning, wants to complement or amend the program with a  proposal of its own, and is seeking a special status within the  framework of the Partnership. Said one NATO staffer: "That is  unacceptable for us."</p>

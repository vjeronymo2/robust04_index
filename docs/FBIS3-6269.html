			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The International  Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco)  printed a bulletin on March 3.    The bulletin in an editorial titled "New Prospect for  Solution of Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula" says an  agreement reached between the DPRK and the U.S. in New York on  Feb. 25 entirely conforms to the spirit of the joint statement  issued between the both sides last year, which clarifies the  principles to be maintained in solving the Korean question  including the nuclear issue as a whole.    It is owing to the United States that the joint statement  has  not yet been implemented and the tensions still remain on the  Korean peninsula, the bulletin points out, and goes on:    The most important question at the present juncture is to  put  international pressure upon the United States so that it may  honor its promise.    The bulletin calls upon the world peaceloving forces to more  vigorously conduct the international solidarity movement for  supporting the just struggle of the Korean people for the  independent, peaceful reunification of the country.    It edits news about the solidarity movement for supporting  Korea's reunification held in different countries of the world.</p>

At the jubilant moment for millions of  households, I extend, on behalf of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government, Spring Festival  greetings to people of all nationalities, commanders and  fighters of Liberation Army units, armed police officers and  men, and public security cadres and policemen in Anhui; warm  regards to comrades staying fast at their posts during the  festival; and deep appreciation to all comrades and friends who  have contributed to Anhui's development.    The past year was one in which Anhui witnessed the fastest  and most efficient growth of its economy since the introduction  of reform and opening up. The gross provincial product totaled  94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent. We reaped a bumper  agricultural harvest and pushed village and town enterprises to  a new stage of development. As a result, the annual per capita  peasant income increased 150 yuan to reach 724 yuan. Industry  grew at a rapid pace, and high-tech and high value-added  products increased by a big margin. Anhui's ranking of  industries at and above the township level rose from 14th to  12th in the country. A number of energy, transport, postal and  telecommunications, and water conservancy projects were  successively completed and put into operation, thereby building  up strength for further development of the provincial economy.  We were especially gratified with a breakthrough in enterprise  reform. The instant success of the Maanshan Iron and Steel  Company, the Anhui Energy Corporation, and the Meiling  Enterprise in issuing and listing their stocks on markets  resulted not only in the raising of over 7 billion yuan in funds  for construction, but also the accumulation of invaluable  experiences for establishing modern enterprises. While the  economy was developing rapidly, we also made advances in the  building of socialist spiritual civilization and various social  undertakings to further consolidate political stability and  unity. Scenes of vigorous economic growth were seen everywhere  on both sides of the Chang Jiang and along the Huai He. Facts  have once again borne testimony to Anhui's conditions for  developing faster and more efficiently and to its people's  capablility of tiding over any difficulty in their course of  advance and of continuously pushing forward the great cause of  rejuvenating the province.    This year will be very crucial for us in advancing on the  crest of victory to deepen reform and accelerate development.  In the coming year, we shall comprehensively implement the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and, focusing  on the center of economic construction, pay close attention to  three major tasks. First, we should go all out to carry out  reform, expedite the establishment of a modern enterprise  system, energetically promote reform of the fiscal and taxation,  banking, investment, and foreign trade systems, and open Anhui  wider to the outside world so as to further stimulate economic  growth with breakthroughs in reform and opening up. Second, we  should bring into play the spirit of tenacious struggle; push on  in the flush of victory; exert every muscle to maintain the  momentum of sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development;  and meticulously organize forces to accomplish the current  provincial government's goal of "achieving vigorous growth in  three years and scale a new height in five years" so as to scale  a new height in Anhui's comprehensive strength. Third, we  should implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's principle of grasping  two links at the same time, intensifying the building of  socialist spiritual civilization, and continually consolidating  and developing political stability and unity so as to create a  favorable environment for reform and construction.    The people's interests and happiness are the starting point  of our work in all fields. In the course of deepening reform  and accelerating development, party committees and governments  at all levels should carry forward the fine traditions of  forging close ties with the masses, paying attention to work  methods, and improving work style so as to harness the  enthusiasm of the masses in reform and construction. It is  necessary to always bear in mind the immediate interests of the  masses, protect their interests, and do everything possible to  solve their practical problems, especially the practical  problems of poor areas. I am convinced that, guided by the  party's basic line and through the common effort by the people  throughout Anhui, our cause will be invincible.    Looking to our bright future, the people of Anhui shoulder a  heavy task. In the coming new year, let us more closely rally  around the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at  the core, advance along the road of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, and score fresh achievements in reform,  opening up, and economic construction.    Finally may you all have a happy Spring Festival, good  health, happiness in family, and good luck!</p>

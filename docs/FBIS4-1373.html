			<p>BFN     [Text] The DTA [Democratic Turnhalle Alliance] has alleged  that the Angolan government has been sending military troops to  Namibia charging there were about 2,000 MPLA [Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola] government soldiers in areas along  the northern border with Angola.    DTA president, Mr Mishake Muyongo, said his party had been  informed that the soldiers were in Namibia to launch attacks on  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  positions across the Kavango and the western Caprivi areas. "If  this information is correct, as we believe it is, one would like  to know from the Namibian Government whether Namibia is now  participating in the Angolan war by backing the MPLA government  and giving them sanctuary in order to attack UNITA on Namibian  soil," he said.    "Is the Namibian government overlooking the fact that  Angolan  war can spill over to Namibia, thereby forcing the people of  Namibia to become victims of the Angolan conflict, which is not  of their own making?"    Mr Muyongo said it was ironic that while Namibians stood on  their "toes", fearing that the South African situation could  spill over here, the Government was prepared to "close" one eye  to the activities of the MPLA government on Namibian soil. Such  a situation, he said, could promote a war spill-over from  Angola. "Is the Namibian government overlooking the fact that  the Angolan war can spill over to Namibia, thereby forcing  people of Namibia to become victims of the Angolan conflict?"  asked Mr Muyongo.    "Or, is it the price that SWAPO [South-West African People's  Organization] has to pay to the MPLA for the long years that the  MPLA helped them while operating from Angola?" The shadow  president said his party did not want Namibians to be victims of  the Angolan war.    "The Government of Namibia will be well advised not to get  involved in this protracted war in Angola under any  circumstances, but rather try and find a peaceful solution that  will reduce the human suffering that is now prevalent in  Angola," said Mr Muyongo. He said his party had also received  information alleging that the consulate of the MPLA government  in Rundu and the Military Attache of the Angolan Embassy in  Windhoek were involved in bringing soldiers to Namibia.    "If this is also true, then we ask the Namibian Government  to  urgently take action against these Angolan officials who are  implicated in bringing these armed MPLA soldiers to Namibia,  before the situation gets out of hand," said Mr Muyongo.</p>

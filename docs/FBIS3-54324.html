Addressing the meeting on behalf of Foreign Minister Najmuddin  A. Shaikh, the Pakistani ambassador to Iran drew the ministerial  council's attention to the atrocities being carried out by  Indian forces in occupied Kashmir and the serious human rights  violations there. He said that the world cannot remain a silent  spectator when innocent Kashmiris are being massacred and their  houses set on fire. He said that Pakistan wants a peaceful  settlement of the Kashmir dispute. It will not, however,  deceive the international community by holding meaningless talks.    The acting leader of the Pakistani delegation also referred  to the killing of innocent citizens in Afghanistan and expressed  Pakistan's grave concern in this regard. He discussed the steps  Pakistan has taken to achieve the ECO's objectives, saying that  the Karakoram Highway will be reinforced to withstand the heavy  traffic moving from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to China.    Earlier, inaugurating the meeting, Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani highlighted the need for regional cooperation  to achieve collective self-reliance and economic development.</p>

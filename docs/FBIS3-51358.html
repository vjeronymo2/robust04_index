			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 15 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- President Rafael Angel  Calderon said today Costa Rica will continue its struggle to get  better conditions in European markets for all banana producing  nations. Calderon regretted that Ecuador, Panama, Guatemala,  and Honduras did not attend the 13 January banana producers'  meeting in Costa Rica "to help find a joint position" against  the commercial restrictions of the European Union (EU).    Last December the EU offered to increase the Latin American  producers' annual banana import quota by 10 percent. The quotas  were set last July at 2 million tons with a high tariff on the  surplus. The EU also proposed to distribute 70 percent of its  import licenses among these nations by establishing fixed quotas  for each country. Through this mechanism Europe seeks the  withdrawal of charges filed by the area's producers before a  GATT panel.    Costa Rica summoned the banana producers to a meeting but  Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama did not attend because  they consider that any regional proposal should follow the GATT  decision on the dispute.    Calderon told NOTIMEX: "Costa Rica will continue its  struggle to get better conditions in the European market to  benefit not only the Latin American nations but also the  Caribbean producers." The president said that Colombia, Costa  Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela will seek median formulas to  guarantee a satisfactory solution for everyone.    Foreign Trade Minister Alberto Rojas said the problem was  serious because "a GATT panel resolution did not obligate Europe  and its enforcement could take years, with irreparable damage to  the producers."</p>

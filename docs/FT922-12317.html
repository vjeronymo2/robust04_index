			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Authorities hunt for La Cinq successor AFTER spending weeks trying and failing to find a rescuer for La Cinq, the bankrupt French television station, the French broadcasting authorities are now searching for a new station to take La Cinq's place as France's fifth channel, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. On Friday the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the watchdog for French broadcasting, will begin a formal inquest into the collapse of La Cinq, which filed for bankruptcy on New Year's Eve and was taken off air a week ago. After the inquest the CSA will decide what sort of station should replace La Cinq, and will advertise at the end of June for candidates. There is no shortage of suitable candidates. Long before La Cinq had gone off air, a stream of would-be successors presented plans to fill the fifth channel. TF1 teamed up with M6 and Canal Plus, two other French stations, to table proposals for a current affairs channel while the French government has floated plans to launch ARTE, an Anglo-German cultural channel.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Livshits, head of Russian </F> presidential group of experts, by political observer Vitaliy  Golovachev; date, place not given: "Aleksandr Livshits: `Price  of Reform Must Be Reduced'" -- first three paragraphs are  introduction]    [Text] Doctor of Economic Sciences Professor Aleksandr  Livshits has been appointed to a key post that has a direct  bearing on the implementation of reforms. He has become head of  the Russian presidential group of experts and is, in effect, one  of Boris Yeltsin's main economic advisers.    Aleksandr Livshits recently taught at Moscow's Machine Tool  and Instrument Building Institute -- he was head of the Economic  Theory Department. He wrote the textbook "An Introduction to  the Market Economy" [Vvedeniye v Rynochnuyu Ekonomiku] (1990).  He has spent the last two years working at the presidential  administration's Analysis Center. He was responsible for  formulating the economic section of Boris Yeltsin's draft  message to the Federal Assembly.    In an exclusive interview with TRUD Aleksandr Livshits said  the following:    [Livshits] We will not only analyze objectively the course  of economic reform, but will also forecast the results of  proposed decisions and point to any possible adverse results.  The group of experts' tasks include proposing specific measures  to prevent events taking an undesirable turn.    [Golovachev] Aleksandr Yakovlevich, the president's message  says that the state should repay its debts (which currently run  into many trillions) and at the same time prevent a rise in  inflation. How can it perform these incompatible tasks?    [Livshits] First, the debts must not be repaid straightaway,  but gradually. But it is absolutely essential that they be  repaid. The state debt is a hallowed concept: It must be  repaid, particularly as regards wages and other payments.    Second, there are noninflationary means of swelling state  funds, which I think the government will announce in the near  future. Specifically, by expanding the consumer market and  reforming the state sector.    [Golovachev] Many specialists consider that the government  and Yegor Gaydar in particular, made a major miscalculation in  abandoning state enterprises to the will of fate for two years  while the state -- their owner -- dodged managing them, putting  its trust in the "unseen hand of the market."    [Livshits] Of course this was a miscalculation. State  property ended up a kind of no-man's-land, more often than not  the director's patch. The market is still weak and the owner  (the state) is not managing his enterprises. And now look at  the result -- disorganization, nonpayment, a very serious  situation.... But we do have experience of managing state  enterprises, and considerable experience at that. We now have  to rectify the situation.    Let me say that management means, in particular, creating  favorable conditions for attracting mixed (private and state)  capital for structural restructuring and investments, it means  rescue and rehabilitation packages, bankruptcies, support for  promising enterprises, well-considered cadre and pricing policy,  and so on.    [Golovachev] The president's message to the Federal Assembly  made fairly tough assessments of the activity of Viktor  Chernomyrdin's government. "The government was unable to impose  the requisite order" (with state enterprises). "The downside of  the reform was attributable to mistakes by the bodies of state  power responsible for reform. The government took poor account  of the consequences of some decisions, postponed the adoption of  others, was slow to make overdue corrections to reform.... The  pause in reformation became protracted." "In two years of  reform the government has simply been unable to elaborate an  effective structural policy. This inaction will cost the  Russian economy dear." And so on. The following question  arises: Has the government exhausted its potential? What is  your view?    [Livshits] We will be able to answer this question in the  near future. Let us see how skillfully the government performs  its new tasks. I personally am confident that the government  still has tremendous potential.    [Golovachev] What do you see as the main problem today?    [Livshits] The main point is to ensure that the price of  market transformations is not too great for society. So far we  have, regrettably, failed in that. That is why the president's  message raised the following important task: "Without reducing  the pace of reform, market transformations must be rendered less  burdensome for society."    [Golovachev] One last question. Being totally sincere, do  you believe in success, in other words that it is possible to  start getting out of the hole without reducing the standard of  living further?    [Livshits] I am convinced of that although this task is a  very difficult one today. But it is reassuring that mutual  understanding with the State Duma and its Committee for Economic  Policy is growing stronger. The day before yesterday we held a  press conference with Sergey Glazyev, head of this committee. I  would like to hope that we will attend future briefings as a  trio -- with a government leader as well.    We have no other option. If we do not secure the  preconditions for economic stabilization this year by joint  effort, the country may find itself beset by tremendous  upheaval. I believe that we will not permit this, common sense  will prevail.</p>

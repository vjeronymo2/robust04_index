			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Thousands more electricity jobs to go over next 3 years MORE THAN 10,000 jobs were lost in the privatised electricity industry in England and Wales last year, and several thousand more are likely to go in the next two or three years. This emerged from the financial results of the regional electricity companies and the two power generators which have been announced over the past six weeks. All the companies have given cost-cutting top priority. The biggest job losses occurred at the two large power generating companies, National Power and PowerGen, which are rationalising their power station networks to cut out excess capacity, and shifting to more efficient forms of power generation such as gas. National Power shed 4,000 workers, bringing its workforce down to 7,400 compared with about 16,000 at privatisation just over two years ago. The company warned that more than 1,000 jobs will have to go over the next two or three years. PowerGen cut 1,100 jobs last year, reducing its workforce to 4,900, barely half its size at privatisation. Among the 12 regional distribution companies some of the most severe cuts came at Southern Electric, based outside Maidenhead, Berkshire. It cut 600 from its 7,800 workforce last year, and said 1,000 more employees would have to go over the next three years. The cuts were part of a six-month-old deal agreed with staff and unions to introduce more flexible staffing. As with most electricity companies, the job cuts enabled Southern to report a strong gain in profits and recommend a double-digit rise in the dividend. Big job losses also came at Seeboard, serving south-east England. Nearly 400 jobs went last year from a workforce of 6,000, and 500 to 600 will go this year, mainly through an exercise to reduce headquarters staff. As well as job cuts, staff at some regional companies faced reductions in wages, particularly those engaged in contracting work where wages had outstripped private-sector levels under the Central Electricity Generating Board's management. Although the regional companies are all striving to achieve efficiency gains, their cost-cutting comes ahead of a possible tightening of price controls by the electricity regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild. He is engaged in a two-part review of prices and is due to announce the results of the first part in within a week. These could include a decision to oblige electricity companies to absorb more costs rather than passing them straight on to customers.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Personal View: Lady who felled the feelgood factor Have you met Naomi - the lady chiefly responsible for the joylessness of the British recovery? She is the Non-Acceptance Of Minimal Inflation, and she is currently riding high. No UK British politician, businessman or banker can afford to ignore her. Naomi is the problem of transition from life with inflation to life without it. Three lots of people embody her: those who dislike the idea that inflation is dead, those who do not believe that its death will last, and those who cannot believe they have killed it. Together they are smothering the feelgood factor the government so desires. The first group fondly remembers the ingredients of inflationary happiness. The 10 per cent pay rises that were a sham but sounded good down at the pub. The misleadingly generous interest on deposit accounts. The mortgage debt that was always covered by the rise in house prices, even though part of it was blown in local showrooms. The banks that liked to say Yes, and whose endowments of interest-free deposits minted them profits when interest rates were at crisis levels. These nostalgic Naomis will moan more loudly as the joyless recovery continues. With the job market improving, their ingrained conviction that a pay offer of less than 5 per cent is a slap in the face will be restored - the nurses are leading the way. The failure of the great housing escalator to roll will be missed more and more by would-be trader-uppers and all who profit from their dealings. This group shares an unstated instinct - that low inflation blocks social mobility, favours the haves and is basically reactionary. The disbelievers note the political power of the first group. International investors have shifted the British yield curve, as shown, to reflect their disbelief that the fashion for non-inflationary government will last. Look at the way expected inflation, which dominates long-term interest rates, has jumped this year. Businessmen still seek returns of 18 per cent on new factories: they have not adjusted to non-inflationary times, so their investment is stingy. Would-be house-sellers sit tight: whether trapped by 'negative equity' or not, they cannot believe their rightful gains will not come. These faithless Naomis eye western Europe's persistent unemployment and public debt, and know the old world is going through a wrenching process of disillusionment about what labour rights its employers can afford and what social benefits its governments can afford. They know it is easier to disguise both problems with inflation and devaluation than to face up to them explicitly. They know Britain's household debt-to-income ratio, the highest in Europe at more than 100 per cent, begs for inflationary relief. Recovery or no recovery, they are damn sure the soft option will prevail. Cue the entry of Naomi Clarke, Naomi George and Naomi Pennant-Rea. These killjoys - chancellor, and Bank of England governor and his deputy - are determined to nip inflation in the bud even if it takes a microscope to find it. They are closing the bar before the party has even started. Well-meaning Naomis they, but they complete the dismal picture. The pleasures of inflation have gone. The pleasures of non-inflation have not yet come. And the monetary pain of moving from one to the other is not yet over. Will three-headed Naomi drive Britain back into its bad old ways? The bond markets say Yes. But I say No, precisely because of the shrillness with which the markets are speaking. Today's free, worldwide capital movements have silently removed the inflationary option from any individual government; they sack the offending bond market at the first sign of temptation. Naomi will finally expire - perhaps after bringing down the government that raised her. The author is editorial director of the Economist Intelligence Unit</p>

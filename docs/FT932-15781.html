			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / US Budget: Dollars 1m pay earners comb the fine print - Salary curb THE Clinton administration's plan to curb excessive executive pay by ending the tax deductibility of salaries of more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 660,720) will still leave companies considerable leeway. The economic package published in February said salaries above Dollars 1m could still be deducted if the pay were linked to the company's performance. More detailed proposals published by the US Treasury this week show that performance-linked pay would include not only commissions or other earnings based directly on an executive's percentage of sales, but also any compensation package based on performance standards approved by the company's shareholders. These standards would have to be set up by independent directors of the company. The ban on deductibility would affect only the chief executive and the four other highest paid executives in a company - a limit which is expected to help Wall Street firms that may have many more employees earning more than Dollars 1m - and compensation plans already in place before the measure was outlined on February 17 would also be exempted. Compensation consultants appeared to be divided over how onerous the proposal would be for companies, with much remaining to be determined by the precise regulations that are eventually published to implement the measure. Much may depend, for example, on how much detail the Treasury will require companies to give shareholders before they vote on any compensation package. President Clinton has said the measure is to encourage companies to examine pay policies with the goal of helping 'shift business spending from excess pay to investment'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A new direct shipping  route from this north China port city to the west coast of the  United States means the end of cargo shipping via Hong Kong and  the Middle East to North America.    An official at the container shipping headquarters of the  China Ocean Shipping Company, which opened the new route, said  that the rapid growth of Sino-U.S. trade and trade with other  Far East nations have made the opening of the new route a  necessity.    According to the official, ships will leave Tianjin every  Saturday and go via Qingdao in Shandong Province, and Kobe and  Yokohama in Japan to Seattle in the United States. Then they  will sail north to Vancouver in Canada and return to Tianjin via  Kobe.    Six ships capable of handling a total of 2,700 containers  will ply the new route. That will push the China Ocean Shipping  Company from tenth position to fifth position among 100 shipping  companies in the Pacific region in terms of shipping capacity.    The first port with a specialized container dock in China,  the Tianjin port now has eight berths for containers, with an  annual handling capacity topping one million standard  containers. The port has opened some 160 international shipping  routes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] "Russia is not quite satisfied" with the rules for  the passage of ships through the Black Sea straits, Bosporus and  Dardanelles, established by Turkey early this year. A Russian  delegation led by the First Deputy Director of the Foreign  Ministry's legal department, Yakov Ostrovskiy, left for Ankara  on Monday to discuss this problem. Interfax learned this from a  high-ranking Russian diplomat in charge of relations with Turkey.    The passage of ships through the Black Sea straits is  regulated by the Montreux Convention signed in 1938 by the USSR,  Turkey and some other countries, he explained. "Provisions of  that convention satisfy Russia. As for Ankara, while  proclaiming its adherence to the convention verbally, in fact it  interprets the document rather freely," the diplomat said.    The new Turkish rules, he explained, stipulate that the  ships  passing through the straits must necessarily be accompanied by  pilots (Interfax's note: under the convention pilots can be  used only with the captains' consent).    Moreover, Interfax's interviewee noted, Turkey's provision  that large ships must pass through Bosporus strictly in their  turn "is not quite in line" with the convention. "Under the new  Turkish rules, when a large ship enters the strait, the  remaining ones must wait. This creates numerous  inconveniences," the Russian diplomat said.    Turkey established "a very complicated procedure" for the  passage of nuclear-armed ships, he pointed out. Preliminary  notifications and the observance of some other formalities are  required for the passage of such ships. "This is understandable.  Istanbul is a city populated by 12 million people, and any  accident may result in great casualties. Nevertheless we  believe, and our view is shared by many Turks, that such issues  should be resolved in the framework of an international  conference. Such a conference may be convened in the near  future," the diplomat concluded.</p>

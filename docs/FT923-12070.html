			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Platform to build on There was good news on two fronts for travellers at London's Angel underground station yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes. London Underground said its Pounds 74m rebuilding programme to ease passenger congestion at the station was almost complete. It also announced a refund system for passengers delayed on the underground as part of its customer charter. Travellers delayed by more than 20 minutes will be able to apply for refund vouchers. Vouchers will be given only when London Underground considers itself to blame.</p>

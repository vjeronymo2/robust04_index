			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Training providers seek better relations MEASURES to improve relations between national providers of Youth Training and training and enterprise councils (Tecs) are to be announced next week after the withdrawal from the scheme by several large employers and an industry federation. The measures, drawn up by the Department of Employment, have persuaded the British Printing Industries Federation to reverse a previous decision to stop being a managing agent for Youth Training. They include arrangements for more of the monitoring visits of YT schemes to be done by a central unit and fewer by Tecs. The department said the initiative did not put the Tecs' right to negotiate individual contracts with providers in jeopardy. The federation and several large companies announced that they would withdraw from YT last year because of the burden of negotiating locally with the 82 Tecs in England and Wales and 22 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs), their equivalent in Scotland. Midland Bank and Mothercare have withdrawn for similar reasons. Only the federation has said it will reverse its decision. A conference between Tecs and national providers of training will be held on Tuesday where the changes will be discussed. Mr Robert Jackson, employment minister, who has been in discussions the providers about the issue will attend the conference. A number of changes will be announced. They include: Standardising the monitoring of quality standards. Although quality criteria are standard, Tecs have done their own monitoring. Providing a contracting forum at a convened conference to be held in this month.</p>

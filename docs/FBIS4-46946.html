			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Rivkin (jointly with Multinational </F> Strategies, Inc. --experts on state risk in Central and East  European Countries): "There Is a Need To Have a Will and a Way  To Pay Debts"; first paragraph is introductory paragraph]    [Text] The credits issued by foreign banks to  Vnesheconombank (Foreign Economic Bank) have lost 50% of  their  value since early December. Western investors discuss further  prospects with enhanced interest.    A government's ability to pay debts is determined by two  fundamental reasons: the possibility to pay and a desire to pay.    At present, the Russian government's ability to pay debts on  time has lowered due to the costly attempts to keep the ruble  rate from sharply falling. It was estimated that in the most  turbulent week of January these attempts cost the government  approximately from one to 1.4 billion. The inflationary  consequences of economic policy will adversely affect subsequent  economic development and add to the already powerful leakage of  capitals.    This will slow down the growth of new resources and be  instrumental in the further depletion of the existing ones,  whereas all this taken together will tell on solvency in respect  to credits.    These negative economic trends will force Russia to seek  external sources of financing, such as from the IMF.    It has to be admitted that the Russian government's desire  to  pay debts has likewise been lowered.    It looks as if those who form Russia's policy are not at all  worried over the menacing prospect that access to credit markets  could be closed in the event of failure to pay the debt. The  West has little faith in financial threats and promises.    And, lastly, in keeping with the Constitution of Russia and  with Yeltsin's Decree of November 1993, parliament alone can  determine the size of foreign loans and draw up the federal  budget. However, considering the character of the new parliament  and its literal understanding of the Constitution, the  government will have to carefully analyze and weigh up which  conditions of paying the debt parliament will see as acceptable.    The aforesaid makes it possible to understand why the price  of Russia's debt has been lowered. However, an agreement with  the IMF on the deferral of payment could overturn this entire  scenario and enable Russia to somewhat brace itself before  beginning to pay the debt.    The importance of this agreement is evidenced by the fact  that in the draft of the 1994 Russian budget the sum earmarked  for the payment of the debt (6.4 billion dollars) roughly equals  the sum of the new offered foreign credits. (2.5 billion are  expected to be borrowed from international financial  organizations.) How real the prospect of reaching an agreement  is depends on Russia's specific policy. The IMF would like to  conclude such an agreement, but as we all know, a tango needs  two.  <H5>  Russia's Different Liabilities for Its Debts </H5> <H5>  Eurobonds of Vnesheconombank </H5>   These bonds have three positive characteristics meriting  attention. First, since the moment of their emission in  1988-1990 there has not been a case of non-payment on these  bonds. Second, non-payment on international bonds always has  greater significance (price) than the non-payment of commercial  bank credits on international markets. This is explained by the  fact that the international markets of securities are more  effective, and therefore a bad reputation on these markets is  particularly undesirable. Third, payments on these bonds were  relatively small in 1994. The full package of these shares gives  an interest to approximately the sum of 115 million.  <H5>  Finance Ministry's Dollar Bonds </H5>   The principal drawback of these bonds stems from the fact  that the Russian government is the heir to the former Soviet  government with its traditional non-payments on internal state  bonds. And the political culture, enabling the government to  handle its people in this way, is being changed at a very slow  pace. Not long ago the Russian authorities again demonstrated  their scorn for their citizens' financial interests when they  withdrew from turnover the rubles emitted prior to 1993 -- this  campaign was poorly prepared and organized.    In this way, the drawbacks of the financial policy have the  effect that at the given moment all hopes in connection with  paying the debt are pinned on foreign credits.    In a crisis-like situation it is logical to use these  credits  primarily for the purpose of keeping communication lines open  and honoring international debt liabilities to the detriment of  innerstate ones. (The total sum needed for the repayment of  domestic bonds in 1994 comes to roughly 500 million dollars.)  One more negative moment consists in the relative non-liquidity  of these bonds in comparison with Eurobonds. The longer terms of  payment (repayment) on these bonds do not permit them to be  quoted at foreign banks.  <H5>  Vnesheconombank's Debts to Foreign Commercial Banks </H5>   The total sum of this debt (on which interest is accrued) is  roughly 20 billion dollars, which is roughly four billion more  than the fixed interest on payment. Of the three main types of  debt liabilities this debt is the most susceptible to both  positive and negative factors. Therefore it is more liable to  fluctuations in the rate of prices. This debt is the biggest and  most liquid of the three. The positive moment consists in the  fact that, to all appearances, the Russians have continued  acting in accordance with the terms of the agreement reached  last summer on payments for 1993 -- in keeping with which Russia  must pay the incomplete interests on 500 million in exchange for  a deferral of the payment for five-ten years. This is attested  by the sum earmarked in the draft budget for the payment of the  debt. The negative moment, however, is that a concrete debtor  was discussed at the talks and the question is in whether it is  possible to present a suit to the Russian state in the event of  non-payment.    Any steps in the direction of fulfilling the reached  agreement are important to keep the price of the debt (the rate  of prices) alive. Whether it will be possible to reach such an  agreement relative to payment in 1994 and further on depends on  the general international situation.    A worsening of Russia's economic position adds to its  dependence on foreign creditors. There is also a need to note  the circumstance that the fright triggered by the elections and  the subsequent development of events has led to greater  pliability on the part of commercial banks -- they have shown a  leniency to negotiate even on terms offered by Russia. One  analyst has surmised that the banks may even go to the length of  forgiving debts, although nothing has yet been said about this  anywhere.  <H5>  Forecast </H5>   Considering the present-day trends, it is safe to surmise  most likely that in the next six months the Russian government  will continue claiming that it remains true to the policy of  reforms. Though in view of this it will continue printing money  and not permit itself to take care of inflationary consequences.    Such actions will soon lead to a growth of inflation, a fall  in the ruble rate and a general deterioration of the economic  situation.    It is not ruled out that by the summer the worsening of the  economic situation will lead to a search for new ways of  economic development and a resurgence of the dispute between  reformers and conservatives. And in the second half of the year  the results of this dispute will tell on the price (rate) of  Russia's debt.    Another major moment, which may subsequently influence the  prices of the debt, is the outcome of elections in Germany.  Chancellor Kohl is directly linked to the moral and financial  support being rendered to Russia by German banks.    The large-scale character of this aid places the German  banks  in opposition to the likely variant of the Brady plan which,  among other things, implies forgiving the debt should this  question arise at the talks.    The new government will not consider itself to be bound by  liabilities on extended credits and therefore (although every  possible kind of financial considerations may also exist on this  score) it may fully support the Brady plan. It is important to  stress, however, that the mere fact of Kohl's defeat at the  coming elections alone will not lead to a rise in prices -- the  new government will have to announce its concrete policy on this  question. It is also important that as of today the Brady plan  does not figure in any talks on debts.    New York</p>

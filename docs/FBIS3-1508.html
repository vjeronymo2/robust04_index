The emergency will remain an option for  the TEC and President F W de Klerk if the security situation  continues to deteriorate in the province and if political  initiatives fail to produce results. The other option is the  declaration of unrest areas in selected magisterial districts.    The TEC on Tuesday agreed in principle to a state of  emergency to ensure that election preparations went ahead and  that the security situation was stabilised. Troops were already  being deployed on an "incremental basis".    The TEC's Law and Order Sub-Council, TEC legal advisers and  government representatives were meeting in Pretoria on Wednesday  afternoon to draw up the regulations in terms of the public  safety act.    The preparations would be completed by Thursday afternoon,  putting President de Klerk in a position to introduce at the  stroke of his pen draconian security measures last seen in the  province when the state of emergency there was lifted in October  1990.    The TEC source said there would be a state of emergency  "unless there is major movement on the political front".    "The emergency will be held as a sword of Damocles over  kwaZulu," the source said.    Meanwhile, negotiating teams representing the African  National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party were due to meet  in Johannesburg on Wednesday afternoon to put the finishing  touches to preparations for international mediation to resolve  their outstanding constitutional differences. The mediation  process could get underway next week.    And the four-sided summit involving President de Klerk, ANC  President Nelson Mandela, IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi and  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is due to take place next week.    The TEC source said the emergency regulations may be held in  abeyance until the outcome of the summit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 1993 task of democratically assessing party  members has been completed. A number of outstanding party  members have emerged as the times require and a very small  number of party members have been organizationally disciplined.    This year, in accordance with the characteristics of the  ideological work in their own localities, departments, and  trades and with existing problems, party organizations have  stressed the main points of the specific fields of assessment  work. Offices laid stress on gaining the forgiveness of the  masses, forming close ties with the masses, and providing  warm-hearted service to the grass-roots units; enterprises laid  stress on supporting reform and fostering the spirit of being  the masters of their own affairs; and the agricultural and  animal husbandry areas laid stress on being in the forefront of  guiding the masses in taking the road of common prosperity.  Moreover, various localities and units paid special attention  to national unity and universally conducted education among  party members in safeguarding social stability, strengthening  the unity of the various nationalities, and correctly  approaching the issue of religion, thus enhancing the thinking  and understanding of the broad masses of party members.    To ensure both quality and [words indistinct], many units  made their own specific arrangements. Party organizations at  all levels in many localities combined the assessment work with  anticorruption work, encouraging honesty, self-examination, and  self-correction, with the goals of party branches and party  members; with year-end summarizing of party work and the  election of outstanding party members; with socialist  ideological education and education in the party's nationality  and religious policies; with day-to-day education and the  centralized training of party members; and with peasant party  members' efforts to take the lead in taking the road to  prosperity using science and technology.    Thanks to well organized arrangements, regular guidance  given  and the inspection of work done during holidays, and the  adoption of rectification and correction measures, the work  committee for organs under the provincial government, Hainan and  Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Regions, and other localities have  achieved quite good results.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Berlusconi answers bribery charges: Prime minister quizzed by magistrates - Coalition partner threatens to aid fall of government The Italian government last night looked increasingly unstable as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, faced questioning over bribery allegations and his political partners threatened to bring down the coalition. The accelerating weakness of the seven-month-old right-wing coalition was underlined by the appearance of Mr Berlusconi before Milan magistrates to be interrogated about alleged payment of bribes to members of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, while running his Fininvest business empire. It was the first time in Italian post-war politics that a serving prime minister has been questioned about alleged corruption. Afterwards Mr Berlusconi said the investigation was based 'on a theory devoid of any firm evidence' and repeated he would not resign. The move to quicken the fall of the government was signalled yesterday by the opposition and the populist Northern League, a key partner in the coalition. Both agreed to withdraw amendments to the 1995 budget to allow a speedy parliamentary passage, possibly before Christmas, opening the way for a no-confidence motion against the government. They also want the budget passed to avoid further uncertainty on financial markets. The long-postponed interrogation of Mr Berlusconi began just before 12.30 in Milan's imposing Palace of Justice. The questioning lasted more than seven hours and was conducted by Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosector, whom Mr Berlusconi has repeatedly accused of mounting a political vendetta against him. Two other magistrates were present. Mr Berlusconi was supported by Mr Giuseppe De Luca and Mr Ennio Amodio, two of his lawyers. Outside the court a small crowd was dominated by government opponents including a group collecting signatures in support of Milan's Mani Pulite ('clean hands') anti-corruption team and their star magistrate, Mr Antonio Di Pietro, who resigned last week complaining of political manipulation. In an open letter on the front page of Sole 24 Ore, Italy's main business paper, Mr Berlusconi said he was going to the interrogation 'with my head held high and utterly convinced of all my arguments'. Mr Berlusconi was being asked about three payments totalling L330m (Pounds 129,000) made between 1989 and 1992 to the Guardia di Finanza to ensure favourable inspections of Fininvest subsidiaries - Videomusic (television production), Mondadori (publishing), and Mediolanum (life assurance). Mr Salvatore Sciascia, head of Fininvest's tax department, and Mr Paolo Berlusconi, the premier's younger brother, admitted the payments when arrested last July. Outlining his defence, the Sole 24 Ore letter said: 'It is obvious that whatever the rare and isolated episode, which involved giving in to degenerate public habits, it could in no way be attributed to me personally as an entrepreneur and head of a big diversified multinational group - save in bad faith.' But the magistrates were expected to extend their questioning to cover other of their investigations into Fininvest. As he was being questioned, the climate within the judiciary became more bitter with the resignation of all 20 inspectors at the justice ministry. They said they were protesting at the impossibility of working in the face of mounting public criticism. The inspectors had been sent to investigate the activities of Milan and Palermo magistrates on government orders. Editorial Comment, Page 17 Lex, Page 18 World stocks, Page 35</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Draft Agreement Is Ready"] </F>   [Text] On Friday night [10 June], a delegation of the  Crimean parliament handed a draft agreement between Ukraine and  the Crimea to the Ukrainian side. The negotiations between  representatives of the sides within the framework of the  interparliamentary Ukrainian-Crimean working group were  completed in Simferopol.    As the agency INTERFAX-UKRAYINA was informed by the head of  the Crimean delegation and representative of the parliamentary  Commission for Legislation and Law Enforcement, Sergey Nikulin,  the draft consists of three parts: Powers that the Crimea hands  over to Ukraine; powers that Ukraine may hand over to the  Crimea; and joint powers. However, he did not specify the  content of those parts.    According to S. Nikulin, during the scheduled round of talks  "the sides did not even try to discuss those articles of the  Crimean Constitution that did not suit Ukraine." The Crimean  delegation, he said, stated directly and unambiguously: There  will be no revision of the Crimean Constitution.    The working group believes that just the first stage has  been  completed and insists that work be continued.</p>

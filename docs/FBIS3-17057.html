Boris Yeltsin would reportedly be  removed from power as a result of the overthrow and his place  would be taken by the current prime-minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.    In a Tuesday interview with INTERFAX Stankevich said that  the  publications reflect "the intentions of some political forces to  change the predominant political atmosphere because at the  moment the focus of public attention has shifted to the question  of national accord."    In his opinion this new backdrop does not find favor with  forces that can survive only in conditions of acute  confrontation and that want to "push the president to some  extraordinary steps."    The purpose of such reports is "to damage certain  politicians  and provoke a clash with the president." According to  Stankevich, the blow is primarily directed against Chernomyrdin  "as the strongest political figure next to the president."  Stankevich believes that a blow was also delivered against the  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who has announced his intention to  run for presidency in 1996.    At a Tuesday meeting with the press the chairman of the Duma  committee for economic policy Sergey Glazyev (Democrat)  described Version No.1 of a coup in Russia reported by the media  as a crude provocation aimed at plunging the country into chaos.    According to him, "the rumors are being spread by the same  people who are now trying to discredit the movement Accord for  Russia." Together with representatives of several Communist and  nationalist parties and movements he signed a statement on the  formation of the movement last week.    In his opinion, the idea of the new movement is civic peace  and harmony, the unification of all constructive forces,  including the opposition. "Everything that separates people in  different parties is insignificant compared to the current  danger to our country," Glazyev stressed.</p>

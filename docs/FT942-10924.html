			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: Dreams of a trip to Lord's / Teresa McLean goes to watch a fiercely contested match on the rural road to a cup final - Cricket To celebrate the 23rd year of the National Village Cricket Championship, I took my husband last Sunday to see one of its opening round matches for this season, which gave us some splendid cricket. We watched Barrington, near Cambridge, at home against Pytchley, who had come from near Kettering, Northamptonshire. Both teams are in group 16: Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. This contest was supervised by one umpire from each team. The Barrington umpire was a noble figure, in the best village tradition of long, white coat far below the knees and clear decisions softened by smiles free of teeth. A tireless supporter of his village's cricket, he had moved from playing to umpiring as years passed by. Barrington is keen on its cricket. Gary Smith, the captain, looked down last Sunday's page in the Barrington score-book, in the care of a villager, and told me 'nine of the lads are from the village'. A cement works not far away employs most of the village and supports its cricket. The works is going to pay half the cost of extending the sturdy little pavilion. Cricket and football are played on the same stretch of long, thin village green, cut as occasion demands. The wicket did not look bad on Sunday, but the cutting of the uneven outfield that weekend, ready for cricket, had not served to speed it up. Whatever landed on the outfield stopped dead. Barrington players knew its evils and some took aggressive action to overcome them, including 'the famous square upper-cut airborne towards the boundary'. The championship is organised by The Cricketer magazine, which has no illusions about the difficulty of finding such teams. Susan Hill, who is one of those running the operation, laughed when I asked whether players are meant to live in their villages. 'That would be impossible to work out or enforce. We would spend all our time checking addresses.' They have settled for getting together teams of village players. Every player must be a paid-up member of his village club, who has played at least eight outdoor matches for it in the last two seasons. No problem for Barrington. Every village must also provide an umpire for the first four rounds and a scorer for all the rounds. Barrington's scorer on Sunday was Mr Wilkins. Pytchley's scorer was Sylvia, who scores for them every weekend, 'as a way of getting out'. Sadly for Pytchley, the Barrington wicket-keeper, Marcus Jarman, kept the scorers hard at work with 50 in 64 balls, including some fine shots. He was 62 not out at the end of Barrington's 40 overs. His captain too was hitting the ball well before being caught behind for 22, attempting an ambitious cut. Young and generously built Keith Faint was smiting rather than hitting, with a vast six into a nearby garden, then played on for 27. But the most sparkling cricket was one of those miraculous moments that can never really be described: a high, leaping, one-handed catch, facing the sun, by a Pytchley deep fielder called Weston, to remove Barrington's hard-hitting Mr Heginbotham, scourge of the nearby garden. Scoring eased and in the end captain Smith was not over-pleased with his team's total of 178 for six. 'I prefer about 200 in this sort of game,' he told me, but with a quiet smile. He knows his bowlers, starting with lively openers Faint and Chicken, experts at extracting nasty bounce from the Barrington pitch. No runs were scored off the bat by Pytchley until the sixth over. Bowlers are allowed nine overs and Barrington's opening spell on Sunday was enough to warn poor Pytchley of its imminent dismissal for 92. Barrington is used to getting through the first few rounds. It once reached the group 16 final, which it lost but which boosted morale and re-enforced ambition. 'The main reason we enter is to play in the final at Lords,' the vice-captain told me. The Cricketer confirmed this as the motive for most villages' participation. About 650 villages take part each year. Sometimes the whole village turns out for the final, complete with village loyalists who have no interest in the game. Some hire five or six coaches to London. Troon in Cornwall, the first champions, hired a train. The 1994 Championship Annual describes last year's final between local rivals Kington (Herefordshire) and Frocester (Gloucestershire), as well as the banquet for players and wives at the Regent's Park Hilton the night before. Hill told me: 'The villagers have a marvellous time. It's a real treat for them.' Might not some villages prefer a donation to their cricketing efforts, rather than a banquet? The question is less likely to arise this year because, the annual explains: 'Rothmans UK Ltd, who have recently sponsored the competition so generously, have opted out due to a change of policy.' A new sponsor is wanted. All that is wanted at Barrington is to reach Lord's. In the next round, it is another home match: Barrington versus Barley. I enjoyed the last game enough to go and watch the next one.</p>

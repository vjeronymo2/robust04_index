			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Porsche falls into the red PORSCHE, the German sports car manufacturer, has fallen into the red for the year to July 31, reflecting the worldwide difficulties in the luxury car market, AP-DJ reports from Stuttgart. The company yesterday announced a net loss of DM65.8m (Dollars 42.89m) compared with a profit of DM17.1m in the previous 12 months. Group sales slid 13 per cent from DM2.7bn from DM3.1bn. Vehicle sales declined at the same rate to 23,060 units from 26,486 units. Sales in the domestic market rose 9.2 per cent to 11,404 cars while exports slumped 26 per cent to 11,656. The loss was attributed to high-priced incentives needed to sell its cars and the costs of cutting jobs. After shedding 850 workers in the 1992 fiscal year another 1,000 job losses are planned in the current fiscal year. Such cuts represent heavy layoffs for the company, which employed little more than 9,000 workers a year ago. The world economic slow-down and the weak car sector in particular were cited behind the company's falling earnings, revenue and vehicle sales.</p>

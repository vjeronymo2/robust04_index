			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Counting the cost - John Pitt on the downturn in emerging markets After the rewards reaped by investors in emerging markets in 1993 has come the reckoning in 1994. Some of last year's best-performing markets  - such as Turkey, the Philippines and Brazil - have shown a darker side after being hit by negative news, both at home and abroad. The most significant contributor to the downturn was the first round of US interest rate increases in February. With many Asian and Latin American economies linked to the US dollar and interest rates, it was not long before foreign investors moved out of equities in a big way. While the correction might have unnerved some investors, it has been seen as necessary and healthy by a number of commentators who feel that the growth in emerging markets over the past few years has been overdone. But the latest lift in US rates last Tuesday - the fourth this year - is not necessarily seen as posing the same threat as the previous increases; indeed, some say it might help to trigger an upturn. The Hong Kong equity market, for example, rallied nearly 5 per cent the day after the announcement. Michael Hughes of BZW argues that if you accept the Fed will not move again on interest rates for the foreseeable future, and if you believe that the economic growth cycle has probably peaked in the US, then the prospect for the emerging markets does not appear so bleak. In fact, he says, a case can be made for building up weightings again, particularly after taking into account that the strong rally in Europe during the first months of the year might also be approaching its end. Of the Asian markets, Hughes especially favours Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan, which have all remained relatively stable during the course of this year. Elizabeth Morrissey of Kleiman International Consultants, an independent monitoring group based in Washington, points out that emerging markets became over-heated during 1993. 'A touch of reality this year has been good, since many of these markets were simply over-priced,' she says. 'The slowdown in investment certainly occurred in the first quarter, but things are now back to relatively normal levels.' Indications are that the flow of funds into emerging markets will be well down on the estimated Dollars 50bn that went in last year; but Barings Securities, which collates such data, expects a better performance in the second half of the year. Whatever the longer term forecasts, domestic factors are likely to provide a continuing damper on performance in some of this year's weakest markets. Foreign investors in Turkey, for instance, have seen a 218 per cent gain in dollar terms during 1993 turn into a loss of 66 per cent during the first five months of this year. This sharp reversal was triggered by a downgrading of the country's foreign debt rating, before accelerating as the Turkish lira came under fierce pressure on the money markets. To make matters worse, Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's global strategist and an influential commentator on emerging markets, this week cut his exposure to Turkey in half. According to Biggs, while the Turkish government's economic stabilisation package - which plans to cut the nation's fiscal deficit in half - is on the right track, it faces tremendous opposition in the country at large. Another worry on the horizon is China's fledgling financial markets, which have provoked a rash of optimistic - some would say over-optimistic - forecasts from financial institutions looking for new opportunities. Morrissey is one of the many who are advising caution. She suggests that investment here could be a 'fad that may have taken off a little too quickly'.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE: NEW LUXURY HOTELS PROJECTED TO BOOST ECONOMY $5 BILLION  </P> <P> Several new resort hotels planned for the coast could bring an extra $5 billion  or so to the county's economy.  </P> <P> Accountant Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. said 4,700 new resort hotel rooms are on  the drawing boards in the county, a number that he said is likely to double by  the end of the decade.  </P> <P> There are 1,700 rooms in local resort hotels now.  </P> <P> All those new rooms should boost the number of tourists who visit the county,  said Gary Wescombe, one of the accounting firm's partners. In 1988 -- the  latest figures available -- nearly 35 million tourists visited the county, and  another million came on business or for conventions.  </P> <P> Those people spent $6.5 billion, tourism officials estimate, nearly a third of  which was spent on lodging.  </P> <P> The hotels already planned include three in Huntington Beach. (Another just  recently opened.) They have a total of 1,450 rooms. Then there are three hotels  -- 2,150 rooms among them -- planned for the coastal hills between Newport  Beach and Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> And two hotels were planned in Dana Point with a total of about 1,100 rooms,  but their future has been uncertain, because their Australian developer went  into receivership last year.  </P></p>

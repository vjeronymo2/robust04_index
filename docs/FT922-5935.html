			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: Monetary union Sir, Lord Cobbold's idea of a merger between the pound and the franc, referred to by Anthony Harris ('When gentlemen prefer bonds', March 26), has financial precedents as well as being a contemporary manifestation of Sully's Grand Design. Previous attempts at monetary union lacked a political base. Three were tried in the last century: between Austria and Germany from 1857 to 1866; the Latin union of the 1860s and 1870s when French coins circulated freely in Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy; and in Scandinavia from 1875 into this century. However the 'political improvement' which John Stuart Mill believed would encourage a world currency was too fragile. D P Jeffcock, Wellington House, Captains Row, Lymington, Hampshire SO41 9RR</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Berlusconi plan to hold down deficit The Italian government last night gave a long-awaited foretaste of its economic policy, committing the right-wing coalition headed by prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to finding extra revenue to meet shortfalls in the 1994 budget and to reduce the 1995 deficit. Full details of the government's macro-economic plans were promised after a cabinet meeting on July 21. Release of the bare outlines last night appeared a response to impatience in the markets. Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, said L5,000bn (Pounds 2bn) would be found this year to hold the public sector deficit down to L159,000bn, over 10 per cent of gross domestic product. He said this would come from extra revenue, relying on two main sources  - a pardon for illegal buildings and an easing of tax assessment procedures. The building pardon will permit formal registration of some properties put up without proper planning permission. This will lead to registration fees and property taxes. Easing of tax assessment procedures will enable the finance ministry to clear a backlog of 3.2m cases involving L85,000bn at present in dispute. The ministry's short-term aim is to let tax authorities be more flexible, but the longer-term aim is to encourage dialogue instead of confrontation between taxpayers and the state. The government has been forced to seek new revenue because of lower receipts as a result of the recession and higher spending on pensions and social security than anticipated. On the broader aims of the 1995 budget and three-year macro-economic plan, Mr Dini said the aim was not to raise taxes, so as to avoid fiscal pressure rising above the 1992-93 levels. But he warned that spending cuts were inevitable, with the government holding the increase in current spending to 2.5 per cent in line with inflation. The cuts would come from health, social welfare and probably pensions. Mr Dini said the 1995 budget would reduce the budget deficit to L140,000bn, based on current interest rates. He said measures would have to be found to raise an extra L40,000bn - an ambitious target without increasing fiscal pressure. If achieved, this would produce a primary surplus (the balance between receipts and expenditure excluding debt service) of L34,00bn. This is equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, double the 1994 primary surplus. But, if the cost of servicing Italy's huge stock of debt is included, the 1995 public sector deficit is still only just below 10 per cent of GDP, almost double the average in the European Union.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Six were killed and about 25 wounded, mostly  lightly, in an explosion inside a bus during a boarding interval  in the Hadera central bus station. The No. 820 bus was on its  way from 'Afula to Tel Aviv.    It is believed that Arabs, who boarded the bus at one of the  stops, left the bomb on the bus. Another theory says the  perpetrator was a suicide terrorist. [passage omitted]    Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv adds that there has been a  second explosion on the bus, this time apparently a planned  blast activated by bomb disposal experts, who found another  bomb. The Hadera central bus station has been closed off, and  local inhabitants are staging a demonstration nearby, calling  out anti-Arab slogans. [passage omitted]</p>

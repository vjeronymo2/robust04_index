			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Shares fare best in the long term - Financing the Family / Whatever the need, companies offer products that they claim will fit the bill. But it can be a mistake to rely wholly on 'manufactured' solutions. The surest answer is far-sighted saving Most aspects of family life have a financial dimension. If you own a home, you need to insure the building; wherever you live, you need to insure your possessions. If you have children, you may want to educate them privately, or give them a lavish wedding: both require financial planning. Where there is a financial need, there are sure to be companies offering products which, they claim, will exactly fit the bill. But it is a mistake to think that one must rely on specifically-designed products. The only answer to a long-term financial commitment is long-term saving, and unit or investment trusts, particularly held in personal equity plan form, may well be better for the purpose than 'manufactured' products. Certainly, the sooner you start to save, the better. The remarkable effects of compound interest are often forgotten. Someone who invests Pounds 1,000 and earns 10 per cent per annum will have Pounds 1,610 after five years; after 18 years, they will have Pounds 5,600. Furthermore, the greater the time period, the more the saver can rely on equities for the bulk of his portfolio. Equities have repeatedly shown themselves to be the best long-term investment. They may be beaten by cash or bonds over five years, but it is very rare indeed for shares not to prove the best investment over 10-year periods. Once the time periods get longer than that, the outperformance of equities becomes staggering. According to BZW, Pounds 1,000 invested in equities in 1945 would have grown to Pounds 125,690 (with net income reinvested) by the end of 1991; but to just Pounds 9,400 had it been placed in the building society. A regular savings plan in a unit or investment trust - or better still, two or three different savings plans - as well as providing good long-term returns will also be more flexible than the industry's favourite product, the endowment policy. Investing for children can be more complex, mainly because of the tax regulations. The Inland Revenue prevents parents from avoiding tax simply by transferring investments into the names of the children. If parents give capital to children which produces income of more than Pounds 100 a year, then the whole of that capital is taxed as if it were the parents'. Nevertheless, careful planning can avoid these problems. The Inland Revenue rules do not apply to money given by grandparents, for example, allowing each child to exploit his or her personal allowance of Pounds 3,445. And there are also tax-free investments for children, such as National Savings and friendly society bonds. When it comes to protecting the family against disaster, consumers are often unwilling to face the costs involved. Car insurance is, of course, compulsory; and house contents insurance is accepted as a necessity by most people. Both, however, have become substantially more expensive in recent years, leading many to economise by taking out 'no frills' policies or by under-insuring. Such tactics, understandable in the face of soaring premiums, can be false economies. Rising crime statistics are not a mirage, and the distress of a car accident, fire or burglary will only be increased by financial disaster. It is certainly worth shopping around to try to reduce your premium bill - although the new telephone-based direct insurers are choosy about the policyholders they will accept. An even less palatable subject for consumers to accept is their own mortality. Although endowment policies were sold by the lorryload in the 1980s, cheaper term-insurance policies proved less popular. Perhaps this is because there is no pay-out if the policyholder survives the term. But the lack of a savings element in term insurance means that consumers can get a much bigger 'bang for their buck' in terms of family protection. The rule of thumb used to be that the head of the household should have insurance equivalent to 10 times his salary, in order to provide adequately for his dependants on death. Perhaps, with low interest rates reducing the income received from a capital sum, that sum should be even higher. Given that the average annual salary is Pounds 15,000, this implies that each household should have life insurance covering at least Pounds 150,000. Many people may not have anything like this cover, although employees should find out whether their companies provide death-in-service benefits. Death is not the only tragedy that can strike a family. The growth of so-called 'critical illness' policies has been fuelled by statistics showing that many people often survive heart attacks and strokes. However, the survivors of these illnesses often find that their wage-earning abilities have been impaired, and they may face extra costs in the shape of nursing or home help. Early policies were dogged by some complex provisions covering the range of illnesses that provoke a pay-out. A list of standard illness definitions has been developed, which should help consumers to know what they are buying. The 'greying' of the British population creates another financial problem - paying for long-term care. The elderly can no longer rely on their children, or on the state, to look after them, and the cost of private health care is rising faster than inflation. It has been estimated that the demand for long-term care will rise by 50 per cent over the next 40 years. One particular problem is that much of elderly people's wealth is locked up in the form of their homes. This led to financial scandals in the 1980s as many were persuaded into dubious home-income schemes, in which houses were remortgaged and the proceeds invested in insurance bonds. Interest rates then rose, the bonds fell in value and investors found the cost of servicing their mortgages was eating into their capital. While there are respectable home-income schemes - mostly based on annuities  -probably the best way of releasing capital from a house is to sell it and move to a cheaper property. Many are reluctant to do this, however, because it may involve moving away from long-standing friends and other social links. There is an obvious need, therefore, for long-term health care insurance, but the market at the moment is fairly underdeveloped, with two companies, Commercial Union and PPP Lifetime, leading the way. But given the growing need in this area, it is surely likely that other insurers will develop policies over the next few years.</p>

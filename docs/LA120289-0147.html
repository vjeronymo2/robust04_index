			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS SIGN LANGSTON TO BASEBALL'S RICHEST CONTRACT  </P> <P> The California Angels boldly pursued and won baseball's premier free agent  Friday when left-handed pitcher Mark Langston agreed to a guaranteed,  five-year, $16-million contract that made him -- at least for the moment -- the  highest-paid player in baseball.  </P> <P> The 29-year-old San Diego native spurned "serious" proposals from the Los  Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees to enlist with the Angels, becoming the  sixth starting pitcher on a staff that last season had the second-best  earned-run average in the American League.  </P> <P> Langston's contract, which will contain a no-trade clause, will be the longest  given a professional baseball player since Eddie Murray signed a five-year pact  with the Baltimore Orioles in 1987 (Murray subsequently was traded to the  Dodgers) and is the most lucrative guaranteed contract ever, surpassing the  $13.6 million Dave Winfield was guaranteed by the Yankees in a 10-year deal  before the 1981 season.  </P> <P> Langston also becomes baseball's third $3-million man, joining Minnesota's  Kirby Puckett and Oakland's Rickey Henderson in that elite group. He will get a  $1.5-million signing bonus, a 1990 salary of $1.5 million and a salary of $3.25  million in each of the succeeding four years.  </P> <P> "I'm not out to break ground in that regard," said Langston, the Angels'  biggest free-agent signing since Reggie Jackson joined the club in 1982.  </P> <P> While admitting that the dollar amounts discussed "without a doubt boggles the  mind," security was paramount in Langston's mind.  </P> <P> "Some teams were close, like the Dodgers and Yankees, but I think from the  start -- from the very first meeting with the Angels -- meeting with (owners)  Mr. and Mrs. (Gene and Jackie) Autry, the Angels were first-class, and from  that point on, they took the lead," said Langston, who had a combined record of  16-14 last season with the Seattle Mariners and Montreal Expos and has a career  record of 86-76.  </P> <P> "I was more comfortable with the situation they presented before me as far as  the five-year deal and the no-trade provision. That's something that was very  important to me. Every time we (he and agent Arn Tellem) said something, they  responded. They were the front-runner as far as responding to everything we had  to say. . . .  </P> <P> "My main concern was playing for a pennant-contending team," he said. "Even  when I played for Seattle, I thought the Angels were classy and I always liked  playing in Anaheim. I knew every year they would do what it took to put a  winning team on the field."  </P> <P> Angel General Manager Mike Port, who in the past has been criticized for not  aggressively pursuing free agents, said signing Langston will give him more  options in trade discussions.  </P> <P> Reluctant in the past to sign players for longer than two years, Port made an  exception because of Langston's ability and the knowledge that another starter  might have averted the late-season collapse that took the Angels out of the AL  West race last summer.  </P> <P> * DEALING AN ACE  </P> <P> Langston is delighted but the Dodgers are disappointed by Angels' latest  acquisition.  </P></p>

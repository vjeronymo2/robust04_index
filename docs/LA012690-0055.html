			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: A MULTIMEDIA EXHIBIT ON LIVING WITH AIDS  </P> <P> Some are angry, some are hopeful, some are sad, and some are confused, but the  voices -- all of them -- are strong.  </P> <P> "It's not normal to be in your early 40s and to have known so many people who  have died," says one man with AIDS, who stopped counting after 20 of his  friends had died from the disease.  </P> <P> "I found a lot of power I never thought I had," says another man, who spent  weeks in a coma while fighting AIDS. "I never got into that 'I feel sorry for  myself' syndrome."  </P> <P> The voices, compiled on a 40-minute tape, resonate in the Pierce College Art  Gallery, where thoughts, photographs and possessions of people with AIDS are  displayed in a multimedia exhibit titled "Living With AIDS -- A Collaborative  Reflection."  </P> <P> The show, which features the work of eight artists and is open through Feb. 8,  provides a powerful yet unsentimental look at how the disease has affected  individuals.  </P> <P> "Statistics are important so you can get a grip on the scope of the epidemic,  but there's the human side we need to deal with," said Kim Abeles, one of the  show's coordinators. "We all need to deal with death and the way we treat  people who are ill."  </P> <P> Abeles built the show's centerpiece, a glass-topped table that displays  personal effects of people with AIDS. The items, embedded in purple satin,  include a miniature globe, a graduation cap, a wedding portrait, a Purple Heart  and a rejection letter from the Social Security Administration for Supplemental  Security Income.  </P> <P> The table is surrounded by six different chairs, all painted purple and  surfaced with felt, where viewers are encouraged to sit. Hovering above is a  purple chiffon chair with a metal frame. The floating chair, Abeles said,  represents the soul. "It's some sort of space between living and dying," she  said.  </P> <P> Out of speakers on the ceiling, come the voices of people with AIDs. The  interviews chronicle, with humor and anger, their first moments after being  diagnosed, their thoughts about death and the reactions of their friends.  </P> <P> "People think of AIDS as victimization -- the idea that these people are  helpless -- but a lot them lead fairly normal lives," Abeles said.  </P> <P> Many don't, however, and the exhibit also reveals the disgust and terror of  those stricken in the prime of their lives.  </P> <P> One is a woman named Delta, who is photographed in a room full of stuffed  animals sitting on a pull-out sofa bed between her two young daughters. The  woman, about 35 years old, looks furious. "How can this be happening to me?"  she seems to be saying. "I still have a lot left to do."  </P> <P> Two sets of self-portraits by men with AIDS also express sadness and confusion.  </P> <P> In a photo titled "Torn Apart and Isolated," Wade Phillip Wenthur appears in  four overlapping exposures, but much of his head is cropped off.  </P> <P> "On the one hand, I felt the need to tell my friend of my illness," Wenthur  says, in a statement accompanying his photos. "On the other hand, I faced the  prospect of rejection."  </P> <P> While primarily chronicling the human side of AIDS, the show also explores the  politics of the disease.  </P> <P> A slide show expresses what one artist considers the media's depersonalization  of AIDS, with images such as newspaper headlines, Ronald Reagan and a mournful  Latino family set against the American flag. The slide show is accompanied by  mirrors on surrounding walls "so the viewer can interact" with the piece,  Abeles said.  </P> <P> Political commentary also is offered in a series of photographs called "Street  Graphic Interventions." The photos document the clandestine campaign of an  activist group that stuck small posters throughout New York's subway system,  instructing people how to use condoms and clean drug paraphernalia. The posters  were removed the next day by New York authorities.  </P> <P> One of the posters gives step-by-step instructions on how to clean a needle. It  appears among bacon and eggs, fried chicken and an ice cream sandwich on an ad  for Andrew's Coffee Shops. "Put A Smile In Your Coffee Break," the ad says.  </P> <P>  "Living With AIDS -- A Collaborative Reflection" will be on display through  Feb. 8. The gallery is open noon to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 6 to 8:30  p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, and 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Thursday. For information,  call (818) 347-0551.  </P> <P> SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG  </P></p>

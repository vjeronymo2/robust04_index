			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milos Zeman, chairman of the Czech Social </F> Democratic Party, by Jiri Leschtina; place and date not given:  "Meeting the Government Halfway Would Be Political Suicide"]    [Text] Milos Zeman, a year after he was elected chairman  of the Social Democrats, is still embarrassing not only his  opponents within his own party, but also those who helped him to  come to power some time ago. Some of his people are asking if  his strong antigovernment course of action makes any sense at  all, and they are disquieted by the declining election  preferences for the party. Milos Zeman, who threatened that his  arrival as head of the Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD]  would become a tragedy for the rightist parties, does not allow,  in an interview for MLADA FRONTA DNES, any questioning of his  work as head of the CSSD:    [Zeman] Politics is a long-distance race. It is measured  not in months but in years. We will become a dangerous  opposition to today's conservative government, as dangerous as  the Labor Party is to the Conservatives in Great Britain or the  Social Democrats to the Christian Democrats in Germany.    [Leschtina] After you were elected you said that your party  would flood parliament with legislative bills. Where are they?    [Zeman] We presented a bill to abolish the senate and one on  conflict of interests. In a short time, we will be presenting  two bills--one on territorial division and one on the obligation  to prove one's source of income and property.    [Leschtina] This is not a formidable flood of bills.  Moreover, according to information available to us, the bill on  the conflict of interest has not been presented to parliament  yet.    [Zeman] Your information is not correct. We have already  presented the bill to committee, and we are now holding talks  with the Civic Democratic Alliance on whether we can come up  with a joint draft. Otherwise, I admit that our original idea  to establish a team of well-paid experts whom we need to draft  individual sections of the law has been abandoned because our  coffers are empty and we have debts. Owing to our lack of  funds, our original intentions have been curbed but not changed.    [Leschtina] You have promised to disclose a number of  privatization affairs, including the "violation of the law by  the Civic Democratic Party." Can you give an example to our  readers of a case in which you have caught the Civic Democratic  Party violating the law?    [Zeman] We have presented dozens of these. For example, the  Aero Holding affair, which was presented by Deputy Kraus, the  Plzenske Pivovary [Plzen Breweries] affair presented by Vaclav  Grulich, the affair surrounding the buildings of the Research  Institute of Agricultural Technology belonging to a religious  order.... I could continue....    [Leschtina] They are cases that have been discussed in the  press. Have you yourselves come up with evidence that the Civic  Democratic Party has violated the law?    [Zeman] The opposition can only suggest that the cases that  had been revealed be sorted out. We have suggested several  times, always in vain, that a parliamentary commission be  established. We have submitted a report to the Control Office.  Our party is not a detective agency able to discover all of the  violations of the law in all the minute details.    [Leschtina] As long as you say that the law has been  violated, you can initiate criminal proceedings at the Office  for Investigation. Why did you not do so after you had said  that Communist Party of Czechoslovakia property was used, to a  certain extent, to finance the election campaign of the parties  with a strong anticommunist program?    [Zeman] You are asking me to assume the role not only of a  detective office but also that of the prosecutor general, which  has been abolished, by the way. A political party may express  suspicion that the law has been broken and present supporting  arguments.    [Leschtina] What arguments can you bring to support the  suspicion that one of the rightist parties financed its election  campaign using some communist property?    [Zeman] We are willing, of course, to present evidence, if  parliament deals with the problem. Specifically, this case  happened in North Bohemia.    [Leschtina] You are not going to tell us more?    [Zeman] Our sources are from former inspection authorities.  You will certainly understand that I do not want to say anything  specific because we would be unable to acquire more information.    [Leschtina] Very often, in connection with the Civic  Democratic Party, you say that we have, once again, one-party  rule. The Civic Democratic Party, however, is working in  coalition with three parties and is unable to push for anything  without their support in parliament.    [Zeman] I do not want to dramatize the situation, but I do  realize that there is a significant difference between the  situation after and before November 1989. Nevertheless, if I  have to use your arguments, I must say that even the Communist  Party of Czechoslovakia did not have an absolute monopoly.  Other government parties shared power, at least formally.    [Leschtina] Are you then comparing the Civic Democratic  Party and other coalition parties to the powerless members of  the National Front?    [Zeman] I am not saying that the two things are identical,  but I am saying that pushing for only one acceptable alternative  means limiting the democratic space.    [Leschtina] In the annual report you presented to the  Central Executive Committee of the CSSD in January, you said,  among other things: "Zhirinovskiy's relative success may  finally have opened the eyes of those who have been idealizing  our right-wing parties and refuse to see their inclination  toward authoritarian, and, in extreme case, fascist, forms of  government." Do you believe that our right-wing parties have  fascist tendencies?    [Zeman] I was building on Mr. Kotas's statement some time  ago that the more right-wing that people were, the better. With  my sentence I am reacting to the idea that the more right-wing I  am, the more democratic and open I am. Josef Kudlacek, the  publisher of CESKY DENIK, is of the opinion that we should  become even more right-wing. I was trying to use the proof by  contradiction. If you amplify a certain trend, which has  authoritarian forms in our country, you can demonstrate its  extremes. The fascist form is such an extreme. Mr. Kudlacek or  the Republicans are certainly extreme right-wingers.    [Leschtina] These gentlemen are not in government. Does  that mean that you do not believe that the government parties  have fascist traits?    [Zeman] Our coalition is being accused of having  authoritarian inclinations. However, I cannot exclude the  possibility that, if some representatives from the ruling  parties--I mean mainly their fundamental wings--found themselves  facing a difficult situation, they would show fascist traits.  On the other hand, I firmly believe that those who describe  themselves as pragmatists will win within these parties.    [Leschtina] How do you explain that the continued growth in  your party's popularity has halted and declined, according to  recent polls?    [Zeman] As I said, without money, successful politics cannot  be conducted for a long time. Almost everything is done on the  basis of voluntary work in our party, and this is why we often  react with a certain delay, and--I have to add  self-critically--we often lack expertise. By cooperating with a  team of qualified experts, we can become a more efficient and  aggressive opposition. I do not need to remind you that the  popularity of our party is better than Mr. Lux's party, which  has 85,000 members and whose chairman we can see constantly on  television.    [Leschtina] On the other hand, the Civic Democratic Party  still has the support of two-thirds of the population. What is  the reason for that, in your opinion?    [Zeman] People have the feeling, thanks to coupon  privatization, that they have become rich owners, and they are  expecting fat dividends, which makes them satisfied with the  government. However, the enterprises that thousands of small  owners are unable to control are facing a gradual downturn.  When the people sober up from their illusions, from the dream  that every little old lady in the Orlicke mountains has become a  minicapitalist, as Tomas Jezek [National Property Fund chairman]  put it, they will turn away from the Civic Democratic Party.    [Leschtina] Are you sticking to your statement that our  coupon privatization is the fraud of the century?    [Zeman] I am convinced that it will soon become clear that  the feedback that has been severed between the owner and  management will lead to a decline in output in a large number of  our enterprises. From this viewpoint, the statement about the  fraud of the century holds.    [Leschtina] Are you not underestimating the intelligence of  our population when you say that 80 percent of the nation has  swallowed the bait?    [Zeman] The Bolshevik concept of nationwide ownership is not  very remote from the idea of coupon privatization, and the  majority of our population swallowed it in the past. We cannot  argue by saying that, if the majority agrees with an idea, this  is sufficient proof of its correctness. We would then have to  accept the absurd fact that Hitlerism was correct because almost  80 percent of the population agreed with it.    [Leschtina] Those are dangerous comparisons.    [Zeman] You cannot infer from this that I am comparing the  existing regime to Hitlerism--God forbid! I am only describing,  using a drastic example, that majority approval may be  meaningless.    [Leschtina] Are you suggesting that your party's strategy  should be based on the fact that people are somewhat retarded,  but they will realize it, and one day they will understand the  avant-garde management of the CSSD?    [Zeman] I have never said anything like that. We are not  visionaries, we are not turning away from today's problems, and  our reactions--to the security situation, for example--testify  to this fact. Apart from that, we are trying to react to  problems that do not seem topical to a number of people, but  soon will be. A classical example of these problems is  unemployment, a problem that is dismissed by the majority but  that will become a topical problem tomorrow. We are preparing  specific programs to deal with unemployment now.    [Leschtina] Recently, your adviser Oto Novotny came up with  a document saying that the Social Democrats cannot become  successful in the long run through a confrontational strategy  and by criticizing the government without giving it credit for  its successes. How does the man who has become a celebrity  because of his statement "we must go for the government's  throat" react to this document?    [Zeman] The case of Mr. Hirs and many others shows that a  policy that would meet the government halfway is political  suicide for the opposition parties. Every day the opposition  must vehemently criticize errors by the government, its  conservatism and its monetarism. Monetarism ceased to be a  topical issue in economic science a long time ago. This is what  other social democratic parties in Europe are doing, in any case.    [Leschtina] Their criticism is specific and does not go  beyond the borders of elementary political culture, which cannot  be said of some of your statements.    [Zeman] Look, U.S. President George Bush once said that his  dog Millie understood foreign policy better than Bill Clinton.  I do not see any reason to use less juicy statements than a  politician who, unlike us, lived in the milieu of the  traditional Western culture for 40 years.    [Leschtina] Some CSSD members are afraid that Zeman's  antigovernment bigotry will become an increasingly large burden  on his party on a political scene that is stabilizing. Will  your election for leader of the CSSD become a tragedy for the  CSSD?    [Zeman] First, I do not believe that our political scene is  stabilizing. The constant deterioration of the economic  situation will lead to political unrest. As regards my future:  Sartre wrote that the truth about yourself becomes the genuine  truth only after it is understood by others. I would like to  add that the truth becomes the genuine truth for a politician  only when it is understood by the electorate.</p>

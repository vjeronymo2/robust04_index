			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Individuals' share deals show rise Individual investors have increased their participation on the London Stock Exchange for the first time since 1989, figures released yesterday by the exchange show. The Stock Exchange's Quality of Markets Review for Autumn 1993 shows that in the first nine months of this year individuals' share of turnover, by volume, rose to 16 per cent from 14 per cent a year ago. This comes at a time when overall turnover has been particularly strong. In the third quarter of 1993 the total value of transactions on the London and Irish stock exchanges was a record Pounds 146.7bn, up 2.7 per cent from the third quarter of 1987, the previous quarterly record. However, the data suggest that the increased activity is more likely to be the result of individuals selling shares rather than buying them. In bargains of up to Pounds 50,000 in size, where small investors are likely to be the predominant executors, sales of securities marginally outweighed purchases. However, in bargains of Pounds 50,000 or over purchases outweighed sales, particularly for transactions of Pounds 1m or more. Participation by small investors on the exchange has been falling almost steadily since 1980, when by volume it accounted for about 37 per cent of all bargains traded there. Meanwhile, the exchange found that the 'touch' - the average difference between the best buy offer and the best sell offer for a given share - narrowed to its lowest level since the stock market crash of October 1987. This trend started at the beginning of January 1992, when the average touch was 1.2 per cent of share price. By the end of September 1993 that had narrowed to 0.7 per cent. 'The touch represents a real transaction cost to investors, especially private clients,' the exchange's bulletin says. Some 80 per cent of bargains of Pounds 2,000 or less - likely to have been struck on behalf of individual investors - were conducted at the touch. A narrowing of the touch suggests greater liquidity in the markets. The exchange noted that the narrowing has not only not been limited to the largest and most liquid stocks but in fact has been even more pronounced in the case of less liquid stocks. Among these the average touch was just over 10 per cent at the start of 1992 but has now fallen to 6 per cent of stock prices.

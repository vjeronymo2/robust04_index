			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf, commander of the  Palestine National Security Forces in the Gaza Strip, has stated  that the Palestinian National Authority will arrest any person  who collaborated with Israel or who will do so in the future  outside the framework of the authority, provided that there is  sufficient evidence.    Asked about Israel's stance on the arrest of agents who  collaborated with it, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in an exclusive  interview that "this is an internal Palestinian affair. No one  can compel us to pardon or to arrest anyone." He added that  what we are doing on this matter is similar to what any other  national authority in the world would do.    On the stance of the National Security Forces in the event a  joint patrol comes under fire by Palestinian opponents, he said  his forces have security duties that they will implement  regardless of the circumstances because our people support any  measure that provides them with security and stability.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf disclosed that the authority is holding  constant contacts with the Hamas leadership, noting that there  have been good results so far and that he is optimistic that an  agreement will be reached.    He said that he does not oppose peaceful demonstrations but  that in the next stage such things will require a permit.    On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said the main problem  facing his forces is the shortage of funds, which the donor  nations have promised to give to the Palestinian National  Authority to pay the salaries of the security forces. He said:  "They have given nothing, other than the vehicles provided by  the United States."    Maj. Gen. Yusuf said a 300-man police force is expected to  arrive in the Gaza Strip today to join the current force  estimated at 2,600 men. He added that 120 men from the Fatah  Hawks have been merged with the national security forces in view  of their security expertise and knowledge of the Gaza Strip.</p>

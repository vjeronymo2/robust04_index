			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the RPF; place and date not given] </F>   [Text] The communique reads as follows: It is now seven  months after a peace agreement was signed between the RPF  [Rwanda Patriotic Front] and the Rwandan Government. The  implementation of the peace agreement was to begin 37 days from  4 August 1993. Also, it is almost two months since RPF leaders  and a battalion of 600 RPF soldiers arrived in Kigali. That was  on 28 December 1993, which was in line with the implementation  of the peace agreements.    The broad-based transitional government was supposed to be  set up on 29 December 1993. However, this was not possible up  the present day due to a few people who want to maintain the  dictatorship because of their personal interests and interests  and benefits. Those people are none other than the MRND  [Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] CDR  [Coalition for the Defence of the Republic] clique, with  President Habyarimana at the top. President Habyarimana created  divisions within the PL [Liberal Party], after which he and his  cohorts created another pretext that the broad-based  transitional government should be set up after the parties that  will comprise the transitional institutions have agreed to give  amnesty to all people who have or may have comitted crimes in  the past. By this, the clique intends to forget that amnesty is  given by the people to whom the crimes were committed, and after  the people who committed the crimes accept the crimes and  confess to the people that were offended.    However, this was not the real issue that the MRND-CDR  clique  wanted to bring forward, but only a tactic they wanted to employ  so as to maintain the same powers MRND had before the signing of  the peace agreements. With much effort to frustrate the setting  up of the broad-based transitional government, President  Habyarimana's clique has resorted to creating divisions in  political parties, terrorism and widespread massacres all over  the country, especially in the capital, Kigali.    On the 20 February 1993, a group of MRND-CDR supporters who  called themselves power started acts of terrorism in the  capital, Kigali, with an intention to preempt a political rally  that was organised by Mr. Faustin Twagiramungu, the prime  minister-designate for the broad-based transitional government.  The acts of hooliganism left car windscreens shattered, houses  broken into and several people dead.    The following day, on 21 February, the same group of people  put barricades around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the  Constitutional Court, thus holding hostage employees in the two  places for the whole day.    During the night of 21 February leading to 22, a date on  which the broad-based transitional government was to be in  place, the minister of works and energy, Mr. Felicien Gatabazi,  who was also the secretary general of an opposition party, PSD,  [Social Democratic Party] was shot dead. The death Mr. Gatabazi  met could occur to any other political leader within the  opposition parties, even the RPF. This is aimed at reducing the  force that opposes the clique that wants to cling on to power.    The RPF informs all banyarwanda [Rwandan people] and the  international community that it cannot accept and allow  President Habyarimana and his clique to continue acts of terror  and killing innocent banyarwanda. President Habyarimana does  all this when the international community is looking on and  instead of denouncing him decided to attribute all that is  happening in our country to political parties in Rwanda. The  RPF will not keep on watching. It has the ability and the right  to take decisions at any time. The RPF is impressed to see  banyarwanda coming together to fight for their rights. The RPF  also requests an inquiry into the death of the minister of works  and energy, Mr. Felicien Gatabazi, so that those responsible for  his death are brought to court.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The UK government has painted a slightly less bleak picture of consumer behaviour with yesterday's revision to its credit statistics. The picture could also be more accurate despite the confusing presentation of the change. This involves stripping out debt write-offs by lenders from the figure for net movements in consumer debt with the hope of reflecting more closely the actual behaviour of consumers during the month in question. The revised figures show small net borrowing by consumers during the first five months of the year compared with a net repayment of debt for every month except February on the old basis. The snag is that June shows a repayment on of Pounds 55m the new basis too. Admittedly these fluctuations are trivial compared with total outstanding credit of nearly Pounds 30bn. But there is little sign that a savings ratio of 11.5 per cent in the first quarter left consumers comfortable with their level of debt in the second. Expectations that rising real wages would eventually persuade individuals to borrow and spend seem increasingly forlorn. Instead it may now be time to start asking whether the savings ratio will eventually settle at a rate rather higher than expected just a few months ago.</p>

A habitat conservation plan (HCP) will be prepared by the applicants. The applicants are Clark County and the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, Mesquite, and Boulder City, Nevada. The Service is initiating the scoping process for preparing the DEIS. Major concerns include the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects that issuance of the proposed permit would have on the desert tortoise and other fish and wildlife resources. This notice is being provided as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA) (40 CFR 1501.7). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> A public meeting on the proposed action will be held in the Commissioner's Meeting Room, 5th Floor, McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada, at 5 p.m. on February 14, 1994.

The permit and HCP are short-term, and will be in effect through July 31, 1994, unless the permit is reissued under a long-term HCP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service proposes to prepare a DEIS to evaluate the impacts from issuing a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) for incidental take of desert tortoises due to development of the area addressed by the long-term Clark County Desert Tortoise HCP. The term ``take'' is herein used as defined in the Act and its implementing regulations as: To harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect a listed species of fish or wildlife, or attempt to engage in any such conduct. ``Harm'' is further defined to include significant habitat modification or degradation that results in death or injury to listed species by significantly impairing behavioral patterns such as breeding, feeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3). ``Harass'' is defined as actions that create the likelihood of injury to listed species to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavior patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Urban development in areas occupied by desert tortoises has created conflict situations in the Las Vegas Valley. Much of the private land which would be covered by the long-term HCP cannot be developed due to the prohibitions of section 9 of the Act. In order for many planned development projects to proceed in compliance with the Act, a permit for incidental take must be obtained. The decision by the Service to issue the incidental take permit is a Federal agency action that must be considered in an environmental document pursuant to the NEPA. The Service has determined that an EIS should be prepared because the proposed action may be a major Federal action and may have potential effects on the human environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

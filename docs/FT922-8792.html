			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (19): Lifeline for city dwellers - Luanda's alternative market 'THIS,' declared my guide with a sweep of his hand, 'is Angola's real economy.' The Roque Santeiro black market, spread out before us, is bustling with activity. It sprawls among the barren, sun-drenched hills, 15 minutes' drive from central Luanda. For a splendid view of the city, drive along the Avenida Boa Vista, look beyond the run-down factories and shanty dwellings and the city is laid out before you, red-tiled suburbs, tree-lined boulevards, and the bay itself. But few are here for the view. Thousands of people are making their way on foot and bicycle, or piled into battered trucks and cars. They are preparing to buy or sell just about anything. In downtown Luanda, most of the shopfronts have been empty for years. Faded posters and dusty neon signs offer poignant reminders of a past Luanda. But Roque Santeiro market is thriving. No-one knows exactly how many people flock to the Angolan capital's largest  -and unofficial - market. Certainly, tens of thousands, if not scores of thousands, of people pass through every day of the week, from morning to night-fall, to trade in anything from whisky, fruit, vegetables and medicines to modern hi-fi equipment, tools, refrigerators, and cars. Almost everything is on sale in Roque Santeiro, but at a price - and not without risks to the unwary; beware of muggers and pickpockets. It is both a source of goods unavailable elsewhere and a lifeline for many of the city's estimated 2m inhabitants: a place where local people can supplement subsistence incomes by selling bartered goods, their own small manufactures and market-gardening produce, or even products bought in official stores or directly from state factories. A large quantity of stolen goods also finds its way onto the market. It is usually off-limits to the police, but occasionally - heavily armed - they will look in to search for stolen property. Roque Santeiro is unique in Angola because of its vast size. There are several similar but smaller markets in other towns. They are tolerated because they are an essential part of an economy that has been devastated by 16 years of civil war. Goods on sale are not cheap by local standards. A pair of Portuguese shoes can cost Kz55,000, although with some bargaining the price may be brought down to Kz45,000. But this represents a small fortune for most Angolans - the average monthly salary is Kz25,000-Kz30,000. A refrigerator may sell for between Kz700,000 and Kz1.4m, roughly the same price as in one of the supermarkets in town. But whisky at about Kz10,000 was Kz3,000 cheaper: for a shopper using the parallel exchange rate of Kz1,500 to the US dollar, it was a bargain. Like a gigantic bee-hive, the market appears chaotic on the surface but a closer look shows that it has evolved with sections for food, clothing, shoes, electrical and other goods. Small makeshift stalls are erected each day from discarded wood panels, boxes or tin drums, with shelter provided from a piece of cloth hung over a few sticks. Some traders dispense with stalls altogether and stand next to piles of boxes of canned beer and soft drinks - almost certainly brought straight to the market from the port where duty probably went unpaid, and where the lawful owner of the goods will be making fruitless inquiries. Hairdressers clip away in the open air and small boys dart in and out the crowd, selling watches, cigarettes or trinkets. A few tough-looking young men stand around with wads of banknotes in their hands, waiting to swap currencies. The authorities seem happy to turn a blind eye to the transactions. Raiding the market would be unpopular and ineffective, simply driving traders underground or to other parts of the city. Roque Santeiro and other markets of its kind operate and survive in a no-man's-land of individual initiative and private enterprise that was never stifled during the years when the state dominated the economy. Now the markets are more popular than ever.</p>

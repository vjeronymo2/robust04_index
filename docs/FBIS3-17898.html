			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent on news conference </F> given by LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy at the State Duma on  29 March; Zhirinovskiy's remarks recorded]    [Excerpts] [Video shows Zhirinovskiy at news conference]    [Zhirinovskiy] I am starting to go sour. I need an enemy,  somebody to fight with. The Communists and the Democratic  Russians are lying down -- who can I fight with? I cannot kick  a man when he is down, understand? There is nobody to fight.    [Correspondent] That is how the LDPR [Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia] leader assessed the political power of his  party today. [passage omitted] The first task of the LDPR now is  the struggle for the rights of Russians in the former Soviet  Union, and, says Zhirinovskiy, this struggle will be merciless.    [Zhirinovskiy] We will use all the most effective means to  defend our population, so that they will always [words  indistinct] to touch citizens of the Russian state, always.  There will only be a scorched desert left. There will be  nothing left.    [Correspondent] Apart from that, the leader of the LDPR once  more made a firm prediction for the geopolitical future of the  former republics of the Soviet Baltic.    [Zhirinovskiy] You will get a governor general of the Baltic  guberniya, a Russian, in the capital, in Riga, you will get a  small town of Tallinn choking without light or heat, where  Estonians will catch fish and eat them cold because there will  be no electricity, and the town of Kaunas, the capital of the  little Lithuanian state. You will definitely get that. A weak  little national banner will flap in the wind over those two  territories, Kaunas and Tallinn. [passage omitted]</p>

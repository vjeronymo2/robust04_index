			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Several comments were made about the complexity of the rule, with many commenters offering suggested changes to clarify different sections. Many of these recommendations have been incorporated into the final rule. For example, the standards for batch cold cleaning machines have been moved to a separate section, the operator test has been included as appendix B, and a table summarizing the applicability of the General Provisions to this rule has been included in appendix C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The applicability section of the rule has been clarified to ensure that the standard regulates only those solvents originally intended for inclusion; namely, MC, PCE, TCE, TCA, CT, and C. Several commenters were concerned that, as proposed, the rule could be interpreted to regulate non-halogenated solvents contaminated by trace amounts of halogenated solvent. The EPA never intended for these solvents to be included in these standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An equation and table have been added to allow solvent cleaning machines that do not have a solvent vapor/air interface area to comply with these standards. Several new cleaning machines are currently being developed by industry that cannot install the equipment control devices included in this final rule, do not have an idling mode, and do not have a solvent vapor/air interface area to relate to the solvent emission limit. The equation and table in the rule allow owners or operators of halogenated solvent cleaning machines without a solvent vapor/air interface area to comply with the standard by meeting an overall solvent emissions limit based on cleaning capacity that is equivalent to the overall solvent emissions limit for machines with a solvent vapor/air interface.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The list of equipment combinations has been modified to remove overlapping controls and to add carbon adsorbers to the control combinations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are multiple control combinations available for meeting the rule, many of which are pollution prevention measures. Many of these options also reduce worker exposure. However, some sources may rely on lip exhausts instead in order to meet OSHA requirements. Use of a lip exhaust without any controls, while reducing worker exposure on the one hand, would dramatically increase the overall emissions to air. Thus, if lip exhausts are used on solvent cleaning machines, the rule requires carbon adsorption controls (which have been added explicitly as a control option in the final rule). Although the lip exhaust-carbon adsorption combination reduces worker exposure and overall emissions to air, it may impose additional cost and burden on sources as well as on the environment for a number of reasons. First, carbon adsorption units are generally more expensive than other controls listed in the options. Second, these units may present cross-media impacts such as effluent discharges if not properly operated and maintained, and spent carbon beds that have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. Thus, when making decisions about what controls to install on halogenated solvent cleaning machines to meet the requirements of this rule, all of these factors should be weighed and pollution prevention measures are encouraged wherever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA acknowledges that data show little additional benefit is achieved by the use of a working-mode cover in the presence of reduced room draft. Therefore, these controls are no longer included in the same control combination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Some changes have also been made to the compliance and reporting schedules. The initial notification report deadline for existing sources has been extended from 90 to 270 days after promulgation. This overrides the 120 day deadline in the final part 63 General Provisions. This was done to allow more time for the delegation of this rule to the States and to allow more time to process the reports from the large number of facilities affected by this rule. The initial statement of compliance report deadline for new and existing sources has been extended from 30 days to 150 days after the compliance date to allow time for owners or operators to determine compliance with the 3-month rolling average emission limit. The compliance time for existing sources has been extended from 2 to 3 years. This extension has been provided to allow sources the maximum flexibility in complying with these standards, including allowing time to consider alternative cleaning technologies. This change is consistent with the General Provisions (&sect;63.6(b)(3)). The exceedance report schedule has been changed to include a biannual exceedance report if there is not an exceedance. This change is consistent with the General Provisions (&sect;63.10(e)). Exceedance reports must still be submitted quarterly if there is an exceedance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

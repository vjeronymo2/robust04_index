			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Collor crisis nears climax: Brazilian president's former private secretary to testify BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor's desperate attempt to save his political career is expected to come to a head today with the crucial testimony of Mr Claudio Vieira, his former private secretary, which Mr Collor says will prove his innocence of corruption charges. The crisis has gripped the nation for two months, since Mr Collor's younger brother accused him of corruption. This provoked a congressional inquiry (CPI) into alleged extortion by the president's friend, campaign treasurer and alleged frontman, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, who is known as PC. The noose had tightened around Mr Collor last week after documentary evidence presented to the CPI revealed financial connections between Mr Farias, the government and the president's family. Congressmen from all parties emerged shocked from CPI sessions in which they scrutinised more than 40,000 cheques, receipts and bank statements made available by the central bank and federal police. The documents allegedly show that Mr Farias was running a kickback scheme, controlling 30 per cent of the government budget and receiving millions of dollars from construction companies in exchange for arranging government contracts. Questioned by the police, the owners of these companies have been unable to explain the payments which, in one case, amounted to Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.5m). According to Brazilian press reports, the documents also show that Mr Farias and his companies, often using fake names, were paying the president's household expenses including his car, fittings, payments to his first wife and the wardrobe of his second wife, Rosane. Calls for the president's impeachment have reached a new level and his future hinges on today's evidence. Mr Collor has claimed in a nationwide address that he has had no contact with Mr Farias for two years and that Mr Vieira was controlling all his bank accounts. Mr Collor, who returns to Brazil today from the opening of the Olympic Games in Spain, continues to insist he is the victim of a 'campaign by coupmakers'. The last few days have seen demonstrations of support for the vice-president who would take over in the event of impeachment. Mr Benedito de Figueiredo, a congressman from the PFL, the main pro-government party, defected last week, claiming, 'there is no way to deny that the president is in-volved'.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: NZ bank to raise NZDollars 200m in flotation Trust Bank New Zealand, the country's fifth biggest bank, is to raise up to NZDollars 200m (USDollars 109m) in a public flotation early next year, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. There has been speculation that it intends to use the money to buy Countrywide Bank, the country's sixth-largest retail bank, from Bank of Scotland. Trust Bank is the largest New Zealand-owned and controlled bank, formed by the merger of nine regional savings banks in the late 1980s. Chief executive Mr Graeme Pentecost said yesterday there are no specific plans. However, ANZ McCaughan Securities analyst Mr Hugh Amundsen said the funds being raised were well above what the bank needed for its capital ratios, and suggested the capital may be used to buy Countrywide Bank.</p>

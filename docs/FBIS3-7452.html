This is a grave military threat to the DPRK and an  intolerable undisguised challenge to it.    The U.S. and Japanese military forces sit together to  discuss  an operational plan for controlling the DPRK by force of arms at  the time when the situation of the Korean peninsula is rushing  up to the brink of a war, which shows that the maneuvres of the  U.S. imperialists to provoke a new war are entering a very grave  stage.    But it is a foolish daydream that the U.S. and Japanese  reactionaries try to control the DPRK with their military  conspiracy.    They must look straight at the realities and act with  discretion.</p>

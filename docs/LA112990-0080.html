			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> ZONING CODE CHANGES OKD  </P> <P> The Culver City Council approved several changes in zoning codes Monday that  will affect new construction of apartment complexes. The changes include  reducing some height limits, increasing the number of parking spaces per unit,  and mandating open space for larger complexes and private outdoor space for  smaller apartment complexes.  </P> <P> The 3-2 vote approving the changes also maintains current density regulations  that limit large R-3 complexes to 15 units per acre and smaller R-4 buildings  to 29 units per acre, with a further limitation of nine units per lot.  </P> <P> Mayor Steven Gourley and Councilman James Boulgarides, who were in favor of  reducing the number of units allowed per lot, voted against the measure.  Council members Paul Jacobs, Jozelle Smith and Mike Balkman voted in favor.  </P> <P> "This does not solve that problem (of high density housing)," said Gourley, who  noted that the purpose of having the Planning Commission review the code  regulations was to prevent such high density housing. "Maybe it couldn't. Maybe  it was an impossible task. But because of that, I can't support it."  </P> <P> Among the code revisions the council approved, the height limit and parking  requirements are most significant. Buildings in R-3a and R-4 zones will be  scaled back from 35 feet to 30 feet, or two stories.  </P> <P> Developers will be required to provide two parking spaces for each one-bedroom  apartment, 2 1/2 spaces for a two-bedroom apartment, and 3 1/2 spaces for a  three-bedroom apartment.  </P> <P> Larger R-3 complexes will now have to provide at least 30% of a project as open  space. Smaller R-4 buildings will have no open space requirement, but they will  instead have to provide 70 square feet per unit of private outdoor space, such  as balconies, patios or decks.  </P> <P> Other revisions deal with formulas for determining front, rear and side  setbacks, landscaping for side setbacks, and a requirement for a storage area  for each unit of 78 cubic feet.  </P></p>

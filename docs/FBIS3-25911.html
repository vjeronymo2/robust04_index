This is the most extensive tax law propagation  activity in Fujian since the founding of the PRC.    Recently the State Taxation Administration decided to  conduct  a month-long nationwide taxation propagation activity from 23  January to 23 February. This activity had previously been  scheduled for April this year. They also decided that 23  January would be the first day of enforcement for the new Tax  Law throughout the country.    Giving up their holidays yesterday, all taxation cadres set  up more than 1,000 propagation centers throughout the province  and also went to factories, mines, and enterprises, thus  starting the month- long province-wide taxation propagation  activity.    Wang Jianshuang, a member of the provincial party  committee's  Standing Committee and vice governor, took part in the  propagation activity held in the [word indistinct] center in  Fuzhou City.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> DUMPING PLAN SOUGHT FOR HOUSEHOLD WASTES  </P> <P> To discourage illegal dumping of household hazardous wastes, county health  officials are proposing the creation of two special collection stations at  existing landfills and working with four private stations elsewhere in the  county to handle such materials.  </P> <P> Operating the pilot program would cost about $1.2 million a year. To pay for  it, county officials have proposed a 25-cent a ton surcharge on trash deposited  at county landfills.  </P> <P> The proposal is part of a series of changes in landfill fees recommended by  county health and waste management experts. Under the plan, the basic landfill  rate on July 1 would jump from the current fee of $11 per ton to $13.75 per  ton, which includes the surcharge. Fees for individual trucks using the  landfills would increase from $4 to $5 a load, but the rate for individual cars  would remain at $3 per load.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposal  at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> The fee increases are being proposed to offset the costs of the planned  closings of the Coyote Canyon landfill south of Irvine and the Santiago Canyon  landfill east of Orange later this year, and the simultaneous opening of the  Bee Canyon Landfill northeast of Irvine, officials said.  </P> <P> Complying with more stringent environmental regulations for disposing and  handling trash also has proved more costly for the county.  </P> <P> The special collection stations for household hazardous wastes would be created  at existing landfills in Brea and San Juan Capistrano. The county also would  work with private facilities in Anaheim, Stanton, Huntington Beach and Irvine.  </P></p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Ciba-Geigy faces big tax bill Japan's tax authorities have sent Ciba-Geigy Japan, a subsidiary of the Swiss chemical and pharmaceuticals group, an additional tax charge of Y5.7bn (Pounds 37m) for allegedly inflating royalty payments to its parent company between 1990 and 1992. The move is the latest by Japan's national tax administration agency to extract penalty taxes from foreign multinational groups operating in Japan believed to have transferred locally made profits overseas. Ciba-Geigy said the assessment was unjustified and outrageous with regard to international taxation standards, and it would use all possible avenues to oppose it. 'In this matter Ciba-Geigy has the full support of the Swiss authorities,' it said. Last week Japanese tax authorities agreed to reimburse AIU, the US insurance company, for some of the back taxes collected under the transfer pricing tax rules following discussions with US tax officials.</p>

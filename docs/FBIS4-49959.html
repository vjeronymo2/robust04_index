			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, may 12 (XINHUA) -- Residents along large  reservoirs in central China's Hubei Province have become  prosperous as local governments have adopted preferential  policies to encourage them to develop a commodity economy.    Statistics show that the 45 large reservoir areas directly  administered by the provincial government generated 530 million  yuan in industrial and agricultural output value last year,  compared with 360 million yuan in 1990.    The per capita net income of local residents also increased  drastically. Most of the farmers living in the reservoir areas  have now gotten enough to eat and wear.    While earmarking more money to support construction of basic  facilities, such as farmland and water-control works to improve  production and living conditions for local farmers, the  provincial government has also adopted measures to encourage  farmers in the above-mentioned areas to turn rich resources into  economic advantages.    Local farmers have now established many cash forest areas,  fish ponds, fenced streams for breeding fish, and bases for  growing edible fungus, while making active efforts to set up  numerous industrial businesses compatible with these bases.    Such efforts have begun to pay off. With more money in hand,  farmers in the reservoir areas in turn have started to pursue  more and better cultural activities.</p>

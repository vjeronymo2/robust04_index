			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Insurance companies face disclosure of accounts Draft regulations designed to bring disclosure in insurance company accounts into line with other UK companies were yesterday introduced into parliament. The regulations, which implement an EU directive on insurance company accounts, would mean that insurance companies would have to give a true and fair view of company assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. Companies would also have to disclose hidden reserves. The regulations would apply to financial years starting on or after 23 December 1994. The level of disclosure and transparency stipulated by the regulations is similar to that already required for all other types of company throughout the European Union. Separately, the Department of Trade and Industry has sought comments on revised banking accounting regulations. The changes would broaden the definition of banking activities and transactions as currently defined in the law.</p>

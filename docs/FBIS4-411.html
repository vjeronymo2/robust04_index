			<p>BFN     [Text] Bujumbura, 8 Apr (KNA) -- The speaker of Burundi's  National Assembly, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, is getting ready to  succeed the late president Cyprien Ntaryamira, who died  Wednesday [6 April] in a plane crash near Kigali, the capital of  neighboring Rwanda.    In his second address to the nation on Thursday evening,  Ntibantunganya repeatedly appealed to Burundian citizens to  "preserve the existing calm". He commended the country's higher  organs and security forces for their "positive role in the  management of the crisis born from the sudden death of the head  of state".    Meanwhile, Radio Bujumbura reported that Ntibantunganya held  talks in the presidential palace with ambassadors in Bujumbura,  to "inform them of the situation prevailing in the country and  ask for their support", the national radio reported.    In case of vacancy of power, the Burundi Constitution says  the speaker of parliament acts as the interim president for a  maximum period of three months, pending the election of a new  president.</p>

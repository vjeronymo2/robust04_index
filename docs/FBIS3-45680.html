Since the beginning of 1994, more than 150 business people  from Hong Kong, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Italy, Malaysia  and Taiwan have come to Tianjin for business inspections and  trade talks.    Ninety-five contracts were signed in the first ten days of  January, involving a negotiated investment volume of up to 168  million U.S. dollars in the aggregate. Meanwhile, billions of  yuan worth of agreements and letters of intent have been reached  between the city and overseas companies. Both contracts and  funds involved are equal to those for the whole year of 1991.    Mayor of the municipality Zhang Lichang described the inflow  of overseas funds as a result of the city's bold reform measures  designated for a market economy.    He said his city is attractive to overseas investors because  of its ideal geographical location, advanced transportation,  rich natural resources, high-grade technologies, and  well-trained personnel.    Following the northward movement of foreign investments  coming to China, the mayor said, Tianjin has become a new  favorite for investors across the world.    General manager of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation  Kawamura Hiroshi, regretful for his company's belated arrival to  invest in Tianjin, said he was convinced that much of China's  development potential lies in the north, with Tianjin the most  hopeful contender to lead the northern economic take-off.    While facing competition from other provinces in the drive  for overseas funds, Tianjin's success, starting from the sound  foundation laid down over the past few years, will hinge on the  established policies of accelerating development through more  foreign investments, the mayor said.    As part of the efforts to expand business overseas, Mayor  Zhang led a trade delegation to the Republic of Korea, Malaysia,  and Hong Kong. During the tour, he had talks with chiefs of  more than 40 financial groups about conducting business  cooperations.    As a result, agreements were reached on more than 20  cooperative projects, which involved more than four billion yuan  in overseas investments.    Thanks to these efforts, Tianjin has become better known  worldwide, which in turn benefits the city economically.    According to a recent meeting on foreign trade and economic  relations, the city's target for 1994 is five billion U.S.  dollars of contracted overseas investment.    Meeting participants were told that the bulk of the funds  will go to the construction of infrastructures, capital  industrial projects, the upgrading and renovation of old  enterprises, the development of real estate, and the service  industry.    As mapped out in the city's development strategy, Tianjin  will complete the renovation of more than seven million old and  unsafe houses within seven years. And eight years is the  maximum period in which to finish upgrading of old enterprises.    The city also envisages setting up a new development zone in  its coastal areas along the Bohai Sea.</p>

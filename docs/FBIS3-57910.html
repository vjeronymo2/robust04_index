			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dominique Garraud report: "Paris Wants NATO Intervention in </F> Bosnia"]    [Text] Violent fights were going on yesterday evening in  the Grbavica district in downtown Sarajevo, which is under the  control of the Bosnian Serbs. According to an information  released yesterday by OUEST-FRANCE, a French UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] soldier shot a Serbian sniper on 25 December  who was terrorizing people in Sarajevo. "It was the first time  it happened," commented Colonel Traqui, the commander of the  French detachment in Sarajevo. "In the past, we fired shots  even though the targets had neither been located, nor  identified. (...) After multiple acts of provocation, we thus  showed our exasperation."    It is in this context that the French Government will take  advantage of the upcoming NATO summit on Monday [10 January] to  try to compel the Atlantic Alliance -- and most of all the  United States -- to commit itself more actively in the settling  of the crisis in former Yugoslavia. The feeling of irritation  expressed by the military heads of UNPROFOR -- which was shown  by the anticipated departure from Sarajevo of Belgian General  Francis Briquemont -- has been largely supported in France by  the political leaders.    Foreign Minister Alain Juppe expressed the hope on Tuesday  that the NATO summit would provide a "new initiative."  Governmental circles indicate that the stake will be to have  the United States stop "beating about the bush" and show a "real  will to act." In this context, Defense Minister Leotard would  like "the United States to intervene and help us so that this  war does not extend to the whole of Southern Europe."    In concrete terms, French officials think an initiative that  would bring all the belligerents to a real negotiation implies  an active participation of the United States in reinforcing  UNPROFOR, at all levels -- either diplomatic or political. The  26,000 UN troops stationed in former Yugoslavia, and chiefly the  12,000 who are in Bosnia, are incapable to fight against the  probable attacks by the warring sides next spring. The security  zones, such as Tuzla and Srebenica, are about to be blocked by  the Serbs who deny access to them whenever they want to.    It is becoming more and more obvious that a total withdrawal  of the UNPROFOR will be envisaged if the UN ground forces are  not considerably reinforced (which implies a U.S. participation)  with a possible shift to air raids and renewed diplomatic  pressures on the belligerents. The French officials consider  this solution as being "the worst" of all and do not want to be  the only ones to take the responsibility. With the first  contingent (6,000 troops) of Blue Helmets on the spot, France  has done much in trying to solve this crisis which it also  considers as a test for the future of the stability in Europe.    Signs from London and Ottawa seem to indicate that France is  about the only country to believe that a withdrawal is not  unavoidable. In the worst case, the French Government -- which  is not too hopeful that the American "wait-and-see" attitude  will turn into a "will to act" -- will have to realize that NATO  is helpless; in the meantime new negotiations on former  Yugoslavia will start in Geneva in a few days.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "Even if the Council of the Federation disagrees  with the resignation of Aleksey Kazannik from the post of  Prosecutor General, his duties will be performed by Aleksey  Ilyushenko appointed to the post by President Yeltsin." This is  the opinion of the official presidential representative in the  Federal Assembly, the prominent lawyer Aleksandr Yakovlev.    On Wednesday he told Interfax that under the constitution  the  Council of the Federation appoints and dismisses the Prosecutor  General but only candidates proposed by the president.  Therefore, in Yakovlev's opinion, "common sense prompts that  the council itself does not have the right to appoint anyone  acting Prosecutor General, this remains the prerogative of the  president."    Yakovlev recalled that Kazannik resigned of his own free  will, not as a result of "any unlawful moves by the leadership,  in this case the president." "Therefore in any case the duties  of the Prosecutor General will be performed by the person  appointed by the president," Yakovlev said.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Nissan falls into Y14.24bn half-year loss NISSAN Motor, Japan's second largest carmaker, yesterday reported heavy losses and suspended its dividend for the first time, because of weak car markets and loss of market share in Japan. The parent company reported a slide into Y14.24bn (Pounds 75m) pre-tax losses for the six months to September from profits of Y41.46bn a year earlier. Sales fell 8.5 per cent during the period to Y1,910.8bn, from Y2,090bn, with unit sales off by 12.5 per cent to 1m, reflecting a sharp recent decline in Japan's domestic vehicle market. 'The main reason (for the decline) was the simultaneous depression in the three main markets for cars: Europe, North America and Japan,' said Mr Atsushi Muramatsu, executive vice-president. However, Nissan has been losing sales in Japan rapidly. Unit sales were down 20 per cent to 546,778 units, with market share in the first half of the fiscal year off 1.2 percentage points to 22.2 per cent. Mr Muramatsu attributed the loss of market share to Nissan's poor offerings of recreational vehicles, which are popular in Japan. He also said a company policy to seek higher margins rather than market share had been carried out too rigidly, and hinted that Nissan would attempt to sell more vehicles by means of greater discounting. Although Nissan did not report consolidated results, Mr Muramatsu said these would likely be worse than those of the parent company, as many of Nissan's sales subsidiaries were in loss. Mr Muramatsu said Nissan expected to break even in the second half of the year and return to profitability next fiscal year, on the assumption that the market would stay flat. Analysts however regard this outlook as highly optimistic given the recent heavy decline in Nissan sales. Mr Kanemitsu Anraku, general manager, said Nissan had gained Y21bn by cost-cutting and productivity increases. However, these gains were more than offset by Y45bn of sales losses, Y5bn in net foreign exchanges losses, and Y10bn in net higher labour costs and depreciation. Net profits from securities sales were down to Y1.2bn from Y9bn. Appraisal losses on securities stemming from the decline of the Tokyo stock market rose from Y0.6bn to Y3.9bn. On a net after-tax basis, Nissan lost Y21.99bn compared with a profit of Y24.3bn last year. Nissan announced no new measures to cope with the fall in the business. Mr Muramatsu said the company would seek to reduce costs by gradually extending the model life of cars. The company also sought to lift labour productivity by 10 per cent a year for the next three years. Overtime work was being eliminated, the organisation was being streamlined, and more company personnel were being assigned to the sales force. Nissan's basic strategy, however, remained to cut costs and wait for the market to improve. Nissan, whose credit rating has recently been lowered by the main credit agencies, will face heavy refinancing requirements during the next year, with Dollars 500m in bonds coming due in February, and Y1.5bn in warrant bonds maturing next year. Nissan projected a Y20bn net loss for the year on sales of Y4,050bn. The company expected to pay a final dividend of Y7 per share, half of last year's full payout.</p>

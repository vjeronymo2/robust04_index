			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 11 Jan -- Serhiy Plachynda, the chairman of  the Peasant Democratic Party of Ukraine [SelDPU] has stated that  U.S. President Bill Clinton's declaration that a trilateral  agreement on nuclear weapons is to be signed in Moscow, is none  other than a diktat and that it grossly interferes in Ukraine's  internal affairs.    "Clinton ought to think about the fact that Ukrainian  nuclear  missiles are a guarantor of peace worldwide, rather than just  for Ukraine, as well as for Europe and America itself," said the  SelDPU chairman.    "If Zhirinovskiy does come to power, he will not be  fastidious in either utterances or actions, which is why there  must be a deterrent, which is what Ukraine's nuclear weapons  are. After a considerable section of Russians have followed  Zhirinovskiy, having opted for fascism, to make such statements  as that by Clinton is quite outrageous," SelDPU Chairman  Plachynda pointed out.</p>

			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LEO DUROCHER HURT IN CAR WRECK  </P> <P> Former baseball manager Leo Durocher was in serious but stable condition at  Desert Hospital today after he was hurt in a traffic accident, authorities  reported.  </P> <P> Durocher, 83, was injured in a traffic accident here about 9 a.m. Wednesday  when his 1989 Cadillac collided with another car at the intersection of Sunrise  Way and Arenas Road, Palm Springs police Sgt. Joe Zingg said. Durocher injured  his head in the accident, but "he was conscious at the time. He gave a  statement," Zingg said. A nursing supervisor at the hospital declined to  describe Durocher's injuries. No citations were issued. Durocher played a  prominent role as a manager and player from the 1920s to the 1970s, earning the  nickname "Leo the Lip" for his fiery umpire-baiting and scrappy style of play.  </P></p>

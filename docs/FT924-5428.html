			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / People: Rolls-Royce powers up Rolls-Royce yesterday announced another big shake-up of senior executives that creates a company-wide engineering and research supremo and brings a new managing director of the company's aerospace group. Stewart Miller, 58-year-old managing director of the Rolls-Royce aerospace group, is moving to the new post of director, engineering and technology, from January 1. The moves come two weeks after Frank Turner, director of Rolls-Royce's civil engine business, was appointed head of Lucas' aerospace division. Turner's replacement, who has not yet been named, will report to John Sandford, Miller's successor as managing director of the aerospace group. Sandford is also 58 and currently president and chief executive of Rolls-Royce Inc in the US. British-born, he is a well-known figure in the North American aerospace industry, where he has held senior posts at Rockwell, De Havilland Aircraft Canada, Rohr Industries and Gulfstream Aerospace. The appointment of Sandford means that both the Rolls-Royce aerospace group and the industrial power group - which includes NEI - have new chiefs. Earlier this month Richard Maudslay became managing director of the industrial power group. ***** John Maxwell was yesterday appointed chief executive of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer. Alan Turner, chief executive since 1978 remains as chairman. Turner, who will be 60 next year, has combined the post of chairman and chief executive since 1985. During that period he has had to fight against a bitter European price war as BPB, Knauf of Germany and Lafarge Coppee of France have battled for market share. The struggle, however, has abated and prices have started to rise again this year after falling by as much as 50 per cent in the UK since 1987. John Maxwell, 47, formerly chief executive of financial services company Provincial Group, joined as finance director earlier this year. He had previously been with Grand Metropolitan and Rank Xerox. He is replaced as finance director by Peter Sydney-Smith, previously finance director of a British Gypsum subsidiary. Martin Clark, a director of Northern Foods, joins the BPB board as a non-executive director.</p>

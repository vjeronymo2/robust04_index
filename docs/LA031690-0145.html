			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACTIVISTS TO LINK HOMELESS CENSUS, VOTER REGISTRATION;  </P> <P> OUTREACH: THE DRIVE IS CALLED THE FIRST MAJOR EFFORT TO REGISTER STREET PEOPLE.  COURTS HAVE AFFIRMED THEIR ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE.  </P> <P> State and local activists plan to mount the most far-reaching effort to date in  California to register street people to vote when the U.S. Census Bureau  conducts its landmark count of the homeless next week.  </P> <P> Homeless advocates this week described the campaign as the first significant  statewide effort to register homeless residents since the courts affirmed their  eligibility to vote four years ago.  </P> <P> "There is a real need for the homeless to have more of a voice in what is  happening to them," said Kay Knepprath, co-director of the California Homeless  Coalition. "Many task forces around the state will include a few homeless or  formerly homeless, but they have not had a real voice to speak out and say what  it is they need."  </P> <P> Using the slogan "You Count Me, I Count You," homeless advocates said they hope  the voter registration campaign will remove fears among some homeless people  that they will somehow be exploited by the census and draw more of them into  shelters and other social service agencies during the count, scheduled for  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Homeless advocates also reason that a voter-registration drive will give a  feeling of greater political clout to those who believe that politicians have  paid only lip service to the issues of homelessness.  </P> <P> "They are citizens, people who are being affected by policy decisions and they  need to be represented as voters," said Susan Oakson of the Orange County  Homeless Issues Task Force.  </P> <P> Homeless advocates generally cite a 1985 court decision as establishing the  basis for voting rights of the homeless.  </P> <P> The case started when a group of homeless residents in Santa Barbara sought to  register by using the street address of the park where they slept. The  California Court of Appeal ultimately ruled that state election laws allow the  homeless to use as a residence any place they normally sleep, such as parks,  shelters or street corners.  </P> <P> Homeless residents are required, however, to list a mailing address where they  can receive voting materials and many shelters and charitable agencies have  agreed to lend use of their own addresses for the homeless.  </P> <P> The California Homeless Coalition, the largest group of its kind in the state,  has sent mailers to nearly 400 shelters statewide, enlisting their aid in  providing voter-registration materials. Of the 25 permanent shelters in Orange  County, several have already indicated that they will participate.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, more than 100 people, including a group of nuns and high school  students, have volunteered to assist in the voter-registration drive, said Toni  Reinis, a local homeless advocate. In addition, the Los Angeles County  registrar of voters has promised to provide at least one staff person to handle  the processing of voter-registration forms, Reinis added.  </P> <P> In Orange County and elsewhere in the state, the League of Women Voters and  other local civic groups have offered to send teams to some of the shelters to  assist in filling out forms.  </P> <P> The 1990 Census will be the first to try to quantify the problem of  homelessness, even though census officials concede that it would be impossible  to count every homeless person.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, many homeless advocates, including Washington-based Mitch Snyder,  are burning census forms and urging others to boycott the count, arguing that  the data will be used to minimize the homeless problem.  </P> <P> Some California activists said they will not cooperate in the registration  drive because it is linked to the census.  </P> <P> "Some (homeless advocates) are using registration as an appeasement factor, but  they are buying into a trap," said Paul Boden, a coordinator with the San  Francisco Homeless Coalition. "You can register people to vote any time you  want to do it; to tie voting and the census together is unnecessary."  </P> <P> In Orange County, where estimates of the number of homeless range from 4,000 to  10,000, advocates said they believe it will be particularly difficult to come  up with an accurate census count because of the "invisibility" of much of the  county's homeless.  </P> <P> A recent demographic survey of nearly 2,000 homeless residents revealed that  roughly 40% said they spent the previous night in their car or a motel, places  that are unlikely to be tapped by census-takers.  </P> <P> For that reason, local homeless advocates say something like a  voter-registration drive is needed to draw the homeless to shelters and other  places where they are more likely to be counted.  </P> <P> "The homeless here are not as concentrated as in other parts of the state or  country, but in terms of services being provided, we know they are there,"  Oakson said.  </P> <P> In addition to shelters, the Orangethorpe United Methodist Church in Fullerton  and St. John's Lutheran Church in Orange will also provide voter-registration  assistance for homeless people.  </P></p>

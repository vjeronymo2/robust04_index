			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chrysler to raise Dollars 1.5bn through global share offer CHRYSLER, the financially-stretched US carmaker, last night announced plans to bolster its balance sheet by raising nearly Dollars 1.5bn through an international offering of 40m new shares. The company will be taking advantage of its buoyant share price, which has more than trebled since the start of 1992, thanks to a line of new products which has won widespread praise. Chrysler has 295m shares outstanding. They closed last night - before the announcement of the offer - at Dollars 36 3/8 , up Dollars   3/8 , compared with around Dollars 10 at the start of 1992. Its last share issue was in the autumn of 1991 when it raised Dollars 354m through a sale of 35m shares. The company's ability to sell shares contrasts sharply with its position three years ago, when many analysts questioned whether it could survive as an independent company. It has bounced back thanks to new products, a re-organisation of the way it makes cars, a strenuous attack on costs, and disposals. Chrysler said last night that the new shares were part of a plan to strengthen its financial condition, increase its liquidity and add to its equity base. Analysts said that without new equity, the company had looked unlikely to generate sufficient cash from operations during the current upswing in the business cycle to meet two ambitions. The first is to cut its unfunded pension liabilities, which stand at Dollars 4.4bn, by around Dollars 2bn. The other is to build up a Dollars 5bn cash reserve which will enable it to keep funding its product development programme. The equity offer will also help the company's credit ratings, which have been languishing in 'junk bond' status. Moody's Investors Service last night raised Chrysler's senior notes to Ba2 from Single-B1.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Arts: Gloriana - State Theatre, Mainz Apart from isolated foreign tours by Sadler's Wells and English National Opera, this is only the second time Gloriana has been staged outside London, and Mainz has scored an unmitigated triumph. At first glance Britten's Coronation opera seems a curious choice for a minor German house. But his other stage works are being performed ever more frequently in Germany, the video of Colin Graham's ENO production of Gloriana has done good mileage on continental television and the Mainz management just happened to foresee that 1992 was the 40th anniversary of our present monarch's accession to the throne. The chance to revive Britten's study of a dutiful queen growing old was too good to miss. Mainz's anglophile interest doesn't stop there: the concert programme for the next three months includes no less than three important Elgar works and Delius's 'Walk to the Paradise Garden', apparently the choice of the local music director, Peter Erckens. But it was his deputy, Gunther Bauer-Schenk, who super-vised the opening night of Gloriana with such assurance and an unmistakable grasp of Britten's rhythmic and textural palette. Far from revealing traces of self-consciousness or pastiche in the score, this performance pointed up its sincerity and range of invention, its cumulative punch and psychological perception. The full-strength Mainz orchestra sounded very impressive indeed - much more so than the underpowered chorus. The Swiss stage director and designer Martin Schlumpf maintained the work's period flavour, but with discreet modern echoes (liberally supplemented in the programme book) which added a touch of irony to the proceedings - underlining that the theatre of monarchy remains the same today, even if its powers and personal dilemmas have changed. The opening scene, for example, featured a crowd of flag-waving royal-watchers, kept in place by a police cordon; during their fireside discussion, Cecil helped himself and the queen to tea from a trolley, dwarfed by an ancient wall-map in which Britain dominated the contours of the modern world; and Elizabeth herself was complete mistress of the 20th-century royal wave. The pared-down representational decor - a heraldic banner and arch in the opening scene, a golden globe in the queen's ante-chamber, a star-lit bower for Essex's garden - kept the action moving swiftly and atmospherically. With silver-grey gowns and bustles for the ladies, stylised ruffs for the men and a dash of colour for the principals (including a punkish pink wig for the queen), there was no shortage of ceremonial dignity in the Act two ball, which ended in a flickering red glow as the dancers made merry into the night. Schlumpf's handling of the 'private' scenes - the suggestion of physical passion beneath the royal mask, the shock of discovering royalty off-guard - was equally masterful. None of this would have counted without the wealth of characterisation provided by a well-integrated ensemble of singers. Struck by a virus just before opening night, Edith Fuhr was able only to act the part of Elizabeth, but she did so with dignity and stern strength of character. The role was sung from the side of the stage by Anna Sylvan, a member of the chorus who had studied it of her own free will, and who possesses a lustrous soprano of ideal proportions. It was a pleasure to applaud two artists for such a smoothly synchronised performance. John Treleaven captured Essex's impetuous, flawed ambition, but lacked the sweetness and purity of tone for 'Happy were he'. As the principal courtiers, Angelika Rode, Elaine Woods, Hannu Niemela and Peter Anton Ling gave strong support. The performance was sung in Egon Waldmann's German translation, which misses the poetry of the original. The first scene of Act two (the assembly and masque at Norwich) was omitted.</p>

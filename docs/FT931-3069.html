			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Crusaders in the capitalist cause: US shareholder activists are gearing up to make underperforming managements more accountable Mr James Wood, an Englishman who heads America's quaintly named but poorly performing Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, has suddenly found himself thrust into one of the less enviable positions in US business. The north-eastern supermarkets chain, usually known as the A&amp;P, has become a prime target for the increasingly powerful US corporate governance movement, which is beginning to have a big impact on the running of American business. The movement, which brings together some of the largest institutional investors in the US, tries to improve the financial performance of companies by making their managements more accountable to shareholders. Its muscle has been demonstrated most graphically by the recent forced resignations of chief executives - IBM, American Express, Westinghouse and General Motors - at least in part because of shareholder dissatisfaction over their performance. The movement is now in its most concentrated period of annual activism, the so-called 'proxy voting season' of spring and early summer, when most American corporations hold their annual shareholders' meetings. This season is producing some of the most concerted shareholder action yet, thanks partly to important changes by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the US securities industry, in the way 'proxy contests' - shareholder voting battles at annual meetings - are waged. The new rules, brought in last October, allow investors to band together more easily, and give them greater flexibility in the tactics they use against management. A separate SEC change, forcing companies to reveal much more about their executive pay practices, is giving investors a new stick with which to beat the boards of poorly performing businesses. The tussle at A&amp;P is a product of all this change. The Dollars 56bn New York State pension fund, one of America's largest institutional investors, recently announced that it would oppose the re-election of A&amp;P's directors at the July annual meeting because of the group's underperformance. Thanks to the SEC rule changes, it would urge other shareholders to do likewise. The fund has no hope of victory, since A&amp;P is 53 per cent owned by Germany's Tengelmann retailing group, which will presumably support the existing directors. But strong backing for New York from other investors might at least force A&amp;P to look at ways of improving its performance. According to Mr Edward Regan, New York State's chief fiscal officer and pension fund trustee, A&amp;P's efforts to deal with its problems are 'anaemic and unacceptable'. Its managers, he adds, 'are guys that need a kick in the pants on behalf of our beneficiaries'. Three main factors lie behind the rapid rise of the corporate governance movement, which only began its first tentative challenges to management at the end of the 1980s. The first was the growth of institutional investment in the 1970s and 1980s, and the decline of the small US shareowner, giving big stakeholders immense potential clout. The second was the 1980s takeover boom, which encouraged the managers of weak companies to pay off corporate raiders, or erect 'poison pill' defences around the business, irrespective of whether this was in shareholders' interests. The third was the rise of indexation - where fund managers invest in a portfolio of stocks weighted according to a market index, such as the Standard and Poor's 500, rather than trying actively to pick winners or sell poorly performing stocks. 'Indexed equity portfolios invariably contain real dogs,' says Ms Carol O'Cleireacain, New York City's finance commissioner. 'But one way to improve our performance is to train these old dogs to do new tricks.' In other words, exert pressure on management to run the company better. Initially, companies were selected as targets on a somewhat subjective basis  -what Mr Regan calls the corporation du jour syndrome. One of the most important recent developments has been the adoption by several large funds of more scientific, computer-based 'screens' to identify poor performers. A particularly elaborate model has just been set up by the New York state fund, which is using it for the first time in its campaign against A&amp;P. The three-stage screening process starts with a statistical review of a company's performance; goes on to an examination of its corporate governance and executive pay; and finishes with a consultant's report on the group's long-term prospects under the existing management. The Council of Institutional Investors, an activist umbrella organisation, is looking at ways of sharing a similar service between all its members, so that screening is not limited to the largest, richest funds. Ms Sarah Teslik, the council's executive director, says screening will tend to concentrate institutional attention more powerfully on the same group of poorly performing managements. But she hopes it may also help to broaden the corporate governance movement, at present dominated by the big state employee pension funds and individual activists, such as those belonging to the umbrella United Shareholders Association. Performance screens could provide a degree of statistical respectability to help overcome the qualms of other investor groups, such as insurance companies and mutual funds, which up to now have been wary of the high-profile wave-making of the activists. That said, the tactics of many activist institutions have mellowed over the past year or so. Take, for example, the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the largest public pension fund in America and the most prominent shareholder activist. In preparation for this year's proxy season, it decided to focus on 12 companies, chosen after a performance screening, which it did not immediately name in public, and tried to get them to change through discussions with their non-executive directors before filing proxy proposals. In most of the cases it appears to have achieved its goals. The main focus of concern for Calpers and many other activists, as demonstrated by this year's resolutions, is the composition of a company's board and its power structure. Their main aim is to curb the power of the company's executive officers - particularly where the roles of chairman and chief executive are combined - and give more weight to non-executive directors. At some companies investors are demanding that any new directors be nominated by a committee composed entirely of non-executives; at others they are calling for the separation of the jobs of chairman and chief executive, or a non-executive chairman. And they are insisting that non-executives be put in charge of director compensation at companies where this is not already the policy. They are getting results too: companies which two to three years ago dismissed the activists as minor irritants are now more prepared quietly to meet their demands and head off a proxy fight, having seen the muscle they can command. An important demonstration was last autumn's decision by Sears, Roebuck, the troubled retailing group, to spin off its financial services business after two years of pressure from activist investors led by Mr Robert Monks, a veteran of the shareholder movement. The SEC's new rules give the institutions additional clout. 'They have very fundamentally changed the proxy process - more so than I think even the SEC staff realised,' says Mr John Wilcox, chairman of Georgeson &amp; Co, which advises companies on proxy matters. Under the old rules, if 10 or more holders of a company's stock discussed a shareholder proposal, they were required to send a notice to all stockholders and file documents with the SEC disclosing what they were doing. It was a cumbersome and extremely costly process. The new rules allow any number of shareholders to communicate orally without these restrictions (some written material must still be filed with the SEC), provided they are not seeking authority to cast the votes of others. They also allow investors to announce in advance of a meeting how they will vote, and why. As a result, investors can now launch quick, informal proxy protest campaigns, simply by issuing a public statement saying they will vote against the directors of company X because of policy Y, and inviting others to join them. That is precisely what happened at A&amp;P. A similarly sudden protest campaign was mounted ahead of last week's annual meeting at Paramount Communications, the media group led by Mr Martin Davis. The public pension fund in the state of Wisconsin announced that it would withhold its annual meeting vote for the four directors responsible for Paramount's executive pay policy, on the grounds that the company's 'abysmal' investment performance did not justify the substantial incentive bonuses they had paid management. And it sent notices to 150 other leading shareholders urging them to do likewise. The Paramount protest is one of the first fruits of the SEC's new rules on the disclosure of executive compensation, which came into effect last autumn amid mounting public concern that the pay of US chief executives was spiralling out of control. Companies must now provide a comprehensive new table disclosing the annual salary, bonuses and all other compensation awards of its top five officers over a three-year period and spell out stock option benefits more clearly. The board committee in charge of compensation must also report on its pay policies and say how compensation relates to executive performance. And the proxy must include a graph showing total returns to shareholders over the past five years, compared with returns from a broad market index (such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500) and an index of peer companies. The protest at Paramount ended up as a damp squib - the directors were re-elected with more than 98 per cent of the votes - but the link between executive pay and performance is likely to be one of the hottest activist issues over the next few months. The ultimate test of all this wave-making is whether it leads to significantly improved financial and share price performance at the target companies. There is some evidence, albeit largely still anecdotal, to suggest that it may. If so, putting money into poorly performing companies and then agitating for changes in corporate governance could become a significant investment strategy over the next few years. Some investors on the cutting edge of the governance movement are already moving in this direction. Calpers, for one, is considering actively investing Dollars 1bn itself in underperforming companies and putting cash in two similar outside funds. One of these, called Lens Inc, was set up last year by Mr Monks, the Sears campaigner, and acquired stakes in four companies with the aim of persuading managements to improve corporate governance and change the group's strategy. Two of them - Westinghouse and American Express - have since seen the forced resignations of their chief executives, while the others, Sears and Eastman Kodak, are in the throes of big shareholder-influenced restructurings. All but Westinghouse have enjoyed strong share price performances since initiating change, suggesting that good corporate governance may also be excellent capitalism. Indeed, several prominent business academics see in this trend the potential seeds of a new compact between business and institutional shareholders, which they have labelled 'relationship investing'. This involves an investor making a large, long-term financial commitment to a company in return for a say in the way it is run. Corporate America, which complains that most shareholders are interested only in short-term trading in and out of stocks, would get long-term investor stability, while the institutions would get a better-run business. The idea is hardly new (though its wholesale implementation would be). After all, this kind of investing has long been practised by one of America's most successful fund managers, Mr Warren Buffett. It also has plenty of pitfalls. For example, many institutions could face serious conflicts of interest if they became too closely involved in a business. But at least it offers one way of ameliorating the antagonism between the owners and managers of American business.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The battleground  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Main corporate governance issues at annual meetings* include:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                 Issue  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Advanced Micro          Independent nominating committee, separate Devices                 chairman &amp; ceo  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Chairman Int'l          Separate chairman &amp; ceo  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Eastman Kodak           Shareholder advisory committee  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- A&amp;P                     Poor financial performance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- General Dynamics        Majority independent directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- McDonnell Douglas       Independent nominating committee  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Paramount Comm          Executive pay trends  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Polaroid                Independent pay committee  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sears                   Separate chairman &amp; ceo  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * As of early March  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investor Responsibility Research Center, FT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

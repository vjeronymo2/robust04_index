			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Howard seeks to calm EC seat row MR MICHAEL Howard, home secretary, last night sought to head off a revolt by Tory MPs against the bill authorising the creation of six new Euro-constituencies and increasing the number of MEPs representing the UK from 81 to 87. He replied in emollient tones to a series of interruptions from Euro-sceptics on the Conservative backbenches who, after embarrasing the government through delaying the passage of the Maastricht bill, turned their fire on the European parliament. Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), one of the most outspoken critics of the European Community, stressed that if the bill were to be defeated all the member states would be prevented from increasing their representation in the European parliament. Mr Howard acknowledged that the tactics employed by the Euro-sceptics against the Maastricht bill meant that there would be insufficient time for the proposed boundaries for the new Euro-constituencies to be subjected to public inquiries. He explained that two special European parliamentary constituency committees would fulfil the role normally played by the parliamentary boundary commissions, and that he hoped they would include some of the members of the commissions. Mr Howard looked to the committees to complete their work on boundaries for five new Euro-constituencies in England and one in Wales by the end of November. With the next elections for the European parliament due to take place in June 1994 there would not be time to hold public inquiries, but written representations would be considered before MPs were asked to approve the boundaries of the six new constituencies, he said. Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, challenged the decision not to allocate a new constituency to Scotland. He also maintained that it would be possible, in spite of time constraints, for the proposed boundaries for the new constituencies to be subject to public inquiries.</p>

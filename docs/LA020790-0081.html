			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLORIDA SNAPPER MIGHT BE RECORD  </P> <P> A fisherman using 20-pound-test line without a leader landed an 82 1/2-pound  snapper, a potential world record in that line class.  </P> <P> Michael Mack was fishing Sunday night in 60 feet of water when he hooked the  cubera snapper, usually a deep-water reef fish.  </P> <P> Thinking the fish was a shark, Mack wanted to cut his line, but was talked out  of it by Tiny Edwards, captain of the charter boat Mack was fishing from. When  they pulled the snapper aboard, they found it was hooked in the corner of the  mouth, barely beyond the reach of teeth that could easily have snapped the line  or the hook.  </P> <P> The catch exceeds the existing International Game Fish Assn. snapper record by  11 pounds in the 20-pound-test class. Only three bigger snapper have been  caught on any tackle, including the record 121 1/2-pounder hooked off Cameron,  La., in 1982.  </P></p>

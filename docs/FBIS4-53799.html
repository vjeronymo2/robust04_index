			<p>BFN     [Text] Almost half a million acres of military installation  protection areas will be decontrolled to the maximum allowable  extent from next month in a significant move to make way for  regional development.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae announced in a press  conference  yesterday that 433,335 acres (535 million pyong), amounting to  20 percent of the total privately-owned land in direct use or  under control of the armed forces, will either be decontrolled  or deregulated to a large extent. He said the measure, due to  take effect June 1, is being initiated after a full year of  consultations with related government agencies and political  parties. The total area is far in excess of the 283,500 acres  of protected regions which have been decontrolled since 1973.    "The decision to decontrol the protected area is in line  with  a directive from President Kim Yong-sam to provide greater  convenience to residents in affected areas and to contribute to  national economic development," he said.    The areas to be decontrolled are concentrated in the  northern  parts of Kyonggi-to and Kangwon-to and include regions located  close to the metropolitan area and Inchon, the minister  explained. The affected areas include land in Pochon, Ilsan and  Koyang, all in Kyonggi-to, and Hwachon, Kangwon-to.    In addition, he said, areas near the Civilian Access Control  Line which have been opened to group tours by civilians and  recreational activities will be reclassified and downgraded from  "controlled" to "limited."    Minister Yi noted that the measure effectively means that  regulations pertaining to construction and rehabilitation of  existing facilities will be eased to open the way for brisk  development.    "Certain military facilities along the coastal areas will  also be transferred to the Navy, making it simpler for  construction projects to be approved," he added.    Yi went on to say that the draft revision to the Military  Installation Protection Law has been put on public notice and  will go into effect June 1.    Once the revision is in place, owners, who have for long  been  virtually prohibited from exercising their right on their real  estate holdings, will be able to utilize their land for urban  development and agricultural activities. However, he said,  strict measures will also be implemented to ensure that the  decontrolling of the area will not lend its hand to encouraging  real estate speculation.    "The Construction Ministry is prepared to deliberate  carefully on each of the applications and only those who are  judged to be sincerely interested in developing the areas will  be given approvals," he said. He elaborated that all those  found to be violating related regulations and filing false  applications will face criminal charges and be prosecuted to the  maximum limit.    Autonomous groups such as city and provincial  administrations  will also establish special task forces to crack down on people  suspected of engaging in real estate speculation and subject  them to tax audits, he said.</p>

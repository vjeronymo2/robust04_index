			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Zhanna Kasyanenko report under the "Rumors and Official </F> News" rubric: "Clubs for May Day"]    [Text] During the discussion of the State Duma agenda  yesterday morning, Deputy V. Marychev (Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia) took the microphone and voiced concern at the power  structures' vigorous preparation for the May Day holiday. A  multitude of crimes are committed in the capital every day, God  knows what kind of "guests" visit it, yet the law enforcement  organs are not very worried about all this, the deputy noted,  but as soon as the day commemorating spring and labor draws near  they begin rehearsing operations using clubs and gas in the  Luzhniki stadium.... After a brief exchange between the deputy  and the presidium, it was decided that the May Day preparations  will be discussed at a session soon.    But what in fact were the deputies worried about?    It has come to light from several sources that two Taman  Division regiments -- the 1st and 15th Motorized Rifle Regiments  -- are getting ready for May Day with armored personnel  carriers. Blackmail and threats are being employed against  officers who are not in favor of sending the regiments into the  city.    It is being said that the parachute regiment has been  transferred from Tula to Khimki. Part of a spetsnaz regiment  from Bryansk, allegedly formed from hired criminal elements, has  gone to the Sofrinskaya Brigade for training. A communications  brigade has been transferred from Sokolniki to another location  and has been replaced in Sokolniki by a separate battalion of  airborne assault troops directly subordinate to the defense  minister. The 901st Personal Ministerial Spetsnaz Battalion has  been stationed in Kubinka. The regiments of the Pskov, Tula,  and Ryazan Divisions have been virtually disarmed but each of  them has one battalion which is being maintained on combat alert  condition 1.    There is information that Moscow Mayor Luzhkov is almost  personally involved in the formation of MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs] subunits. Former OMON [Special Purpose  Militia Detachment] members, militia men, and Afghan war  veterans are being recruited to them. They are being promised  enormous pay and apartments in Moscow. The Moscow spetsnaz  subunits are being urgently reformed into rapid reaction  detachments. State of emergency headquarters are being set up  under all Rayon Internal Affairs Departments in Moscow.    In addition, specific means of influence on people are being  made ready: These include far from "harmless" types of gas,  such as "cheremukha" [tear gas], and noise-making devices  capable of causing panic and rendering a crowd uncontrolable.  Hired provocateurs are being trained to fire on OMON units  [dlya ognevogo porazheniya omontsev] during the mass events.    I would like the authorities to tell us what all these  preparations betoken or else deny the facts that I have cited.</p>

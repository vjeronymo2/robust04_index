			<p>BFN     [Text] On 24 May, the U.S. House of Representatives took a  stand to oppose a U.S. military intervention in Haiti. On the  contrary, they favor the establishment of a free port on La  Gonave Island where refugees can be received. The lower house of  Congress adopted this nonconstraining amendment to the defense  budget, by 223 to 201 votes. The amendment was presented by  Representative (Porchugos), a Republican from Florida, and  emphasizes its opinion to the executive.    The vote came after the U.S. Navy, in charge of enforcing UN  sanctions against Haiti, on 22 and 23 May, fired [words  indistinct] against two Bahamas-registered ships, which ignored  their orders by trying to break the embargo. In its amendment,  the House of Representatives expresses its opposition to a  military invasion of Haiti unless there is an urgent and known  danger threatening U.S. interests or citizens.    President Bill Clinton has not formally ruled out the use of  force against the military that is exercising de facto power in  Haiti. A new regime of sanctions imposed by the United Nations  went into effect on 21 May.    The text also proposes that a free port be opened in La  Gonave, an island located off Port-au-Prince with 80,000  inhabitants and a small military contingent. This free port  could be used to examine the requests of Haitian refugees who  wish to be granted political asylum in the United States and as  a base for President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    We have also learned from reliable sources that besides the  eight U.S. ships stationed off Haiti to ensure enforcement of  the international embargo, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower, and  the helicopter carrier (Rusp) also embarked into Haitian seas,  with 650 additional Marines whose mission is to enforce respect  for the embargo. They stated: We are ready to carry out any  action provided that its main objective is to drive the military  out of power.    For the time being, the White House confirmed that Bill  Clinton has made no formal decisions about sending troops to  Haiti in order to reinstate President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>

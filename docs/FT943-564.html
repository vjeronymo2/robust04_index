			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / First US soldier dies in Haiti Senior US army officials were yesterday investigating the death of a US soldier, who was found with gunshot wounds in a northern suburb of Port-au-Prince. The serviceman was thought to be clearing out a guest house for exiled parliamentarians returning for today's convening of the National Assembly. The first death among American troops came as the US army took a visible initiative to restore democracy in Haiti yesterday by deploying troops and armoured vehicles to secure the parliament buildings before the assembly convened by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide votes on an amnesty law. Under the agreement between the US and the Haitian military the generals who usurped power from Mr Aristide will step down on October 15th or when the amnesty law is passed, whichever comes first. Swift passage of the legislation could bring an end to the rule of Gen Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, The amnesty is seen as a critical precondition for the reconciliation of Aristide supporters and those still loyal to the military regime. The US was yesterday due to fly back the 10 members of the Chamber of Deputies and the two senators in exile.</p>

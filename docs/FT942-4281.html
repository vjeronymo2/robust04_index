			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Building societies shake off the fear of 'blackmail': John Gapper hears a sigh of relief in the sector For the first time since Lloyds bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester on April 21, a feeling of order has been restored to the building society industry. Although several chief executives of building societies thought that C&amp;G's team of advisers and lawyers might find a way around the obstacle erected by the High Court, which ruled that the structure of Pounds 1.8bn cash bid was illegal, most were convinced that a restructured deal would relieve pressure to follow suit. The 1.2m members of C&amp;G who would have been eligible for payments of at least Pounds 500, and up to Pounds 10,000 each, may not be so pleased at the safeguards to mutuality being preserved. But chief executives of societies were breathing a little more easily. If Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, had decided in favour of the bid, it would have placed strong pressure on the Treasury to respond by tightening the law. But the decision also appears to leave the way clear for the government to proceed with its review of the 1986 Building Societies Act peacefully. Mr David O'Brien, chief executive of National &amp; Provincial, summed up the mood of many executives of larger societies. 'It leaves us exactly where we were before, but it gives us a little more confidence that we do not have to fight in a legal environment with an obvious flaw.' Sir Donald's bar on cash payments to members of societies who have held shareholding accounts for less than two years is a large obstacle to banks taking over societies. It precludes cash from Lloyds' Pounds 1.8bn bid being paid to 27 per cent of C&amp;G's 825,000 shareholding investors. This makes it particularly hard for fast-growing societies to cross the voting thresholds for transferring to an existing company. These require the society to achieve not only a 50 per cent majority among those eligible to vote, but a 75 per cent majority of those who actually do vote. Even if the 220,000 investors debarred for payment did not vote, C&amp;G could probably achieve this, but a move among them to scupper the deal could easily succeed. Thus societies with similar proportions of new members - such as Britannia and Woolwich - will also find takeovers difficult. This appears to lessen considerably the worst fear raised by the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal: that it would expose other societies to a form of blackmail. Although boards of societies have no legal obligation to put offers to members, they could be vulnerable to a public debate on an offer. Society executives were worried that if Lloyds was able to distribute such large sums of cash to C&amp;G members, their own members' would have their hopes raised. This would mean that banks could threaten to publish a cash offer for a society unless its board agreed to recommend it. Mr Chris Sharp, managing director of Northern Rock, said 'there may not be the same pressure' hanging over societies as a result of the ruling. It would be harder for banks to 'excite the membership to demand an general meeting to consider the overtures they have made to the society'. Yet this conclusion may not be clear-cut if C&amp;G members of under two years' standing can be given value in some way. The only apparently foolproof way of doing this is to wait for a change in their status by delaying the deal, but this would require the society to put off new members. A simpler step would be to pay members of under two years' standing in shares, either ordinary or preference. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, says this is possible because Abbey National's share distribution for its 1989 flotation was ruled legal by courts. But there are three difficulties with switching from cash to shares: One benefit of the deal to Lloyds was that it absorbed excess capital. A rights issue to finance the deal would not allow this, and would also dilute existing holders. Preference shares would be better, but Lloyds might want to issue them through a subsidiary rather than the holding company. Any handout of redeemable shares easily convertible into cash would almost certainly be challenged by the Building Societies Commission. The best that holders could expect would be a coupon on the shares and the ability to trade them publicly after the initial distribution. If preference shares were issued, the Abbey National ruling suggests that no 'priority' could be given to new holders. Mr Wriglesworth says this would force C&amp;G to make a flat rate offer to all eligible members and depositors - rather than varying the amounts and paying large depositors more. Any restructured deal is unlikely to be as easy for C&amp;G members to understand. This will in turn make it easier for other building societies to convince their members of the benefits of mutuality. They argue that not having to pay dividends allows societies to compete with banks. Several building societies also believed it would be immoral for new members simply to pilfer net assets built up over time. 'It is akin to joining a tennis club and voting to sell the ground underneath to a developer,' said Mr Donald Kirkham, chief executive of the Woolwich. It may be easier for smaller regional-based societies to carry that case with conviction than large societies with millions of members which have little obvious connection with their roots. But most societies felt yesterday that Sir Donald had at least given them a fighting chance.</p>

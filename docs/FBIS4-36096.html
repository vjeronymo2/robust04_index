			<p>BFN     [Text] The economic talks in the Jordan--U.S.-Israeli  forum will continue today. Our Washington correspondent Arye  Golan reports that although the atmosphere in the talks is good  and positive, no agreements have yet been reached. Israeli  sources said that part of the talks -- pertaining to the  demarcation of the road from Jordan to Egypt via Israel -- may  be relocated to the region. Israel claims that the marking and  measuring work could be used to demarcate the border between the  two countries, an issue which Jordan would like to tackle  already at this point. It was further reported that the United  States may be involved in the paving of this road.</p>

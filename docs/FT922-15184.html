			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Arab League opposes sanctions THE ARAB League warned yesterday of dangerous consequences from the United Nations' imposition of sanctions against Libya, but reaction among most Arab states was relatively restrained. In Cairo, home of the Arab League, officials were describing the resolution as hasty and ill-conceived, and they doubted it would force Libya to yield the two men suspected of the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland. The league called on the international community to intensify the search for compromise 'in order to avoid the dangerous consequences of this resolution.' League officials said they would continue working behind the scenes in an effort to defuse the crisis, but they were not optimistic. Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestine Liberation Organisation derided Security Council resolution 748 as another example of 'double standards', comparing it unfavourably with the west's perceived failure to exert similar pressure on Israel to vacate Arab land. The sanctions oblige all UN member states to bar flights to or from Libya, prohibit arms deals with the North African state and significantly reduce the staff of Libyan missions. Libya has been given until April 15 to yield the two men accused of the airliner bombing in which 270 died. It is also being asked to hand over four of its nationals to France for questioning in connection with the 1989 downing of a French UTA airliner over Niger in which all 171 passengers and crew perished. A Libyan foreign ministry statement accused the US, Britain and France of conducting a 'crusader war against Arabs and Moslems' by depriving them of their weapons. The UN will send a senior envoy to Libya tomorrow to discuss the Lockerbie dispute, Reuter reports from Cairo. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, informed the Arab League of the mission.</p>

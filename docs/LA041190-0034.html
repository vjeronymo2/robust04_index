			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS BALK AT BACKING HIGHER SALES  TAX  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors balked Tuesday at endorsing  legislation to increase the state sales tax, the key element of a proposal to  raise money for new schools in the Santa Clarita Valley, unless the legislation  is amended.  </P> <P> The bill by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) -- which would require approval by  voters throughout the state -- would boost the sales tax by a quarter-cent per  dollar and allow property taxes to be raised by a majority of voters instead of  requiring approval by two-thirds.  </P> <P> A report by the county chief administrative officer said the bill is unfair  because income from the sales tax increase would go only to school districts  with booming enrollments, and only to those that increase their property taxes,  a difficult feat for large districts such as Los Angeles.  </P></p>

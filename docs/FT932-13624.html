			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: French retailer widens electric goods business PINAULT-PRINTEMPS, the French retail group, yesterday announced plans to develop its electric goods business by taking a majority stake in the privately-controlled Groupelec and putting it together with its publicly-quoted CDME subsidiary. The resulting company is to be renamed Rexel, with a turnover of some FFr16.7bn (Dollars 3.09bn), 13,000 employees and 870 retail outlets. The Pinault group has been selling off some non-core businesses in order to reduce the debt it assumed in buying the Au Printemps department stores in 1991. But seeing growth in the electrical goods sector, it has since built up its stake in Groupelec to 49 per cent, and yesterday it said it would raise this, first to 53.4 per cent and by the end of this year to 60 per cent. Galeries Lafayette, another department store chain, has announced a steep fall in profits to FFr69m last year from FFr356m in 1991.</p>

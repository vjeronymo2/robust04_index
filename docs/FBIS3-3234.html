			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS)--Member of the CPPCC and  former vice minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  Mr. Wei Yuming forecast today that China would continue to have  an adverse balance of trade this year but that it would be less  than that of last year.    He summarized the following factors adversely affecting an  increase of Chinese exports this year:    --Foreign trade enterprises are lacking circulating capital  and it will be difficult for them to get bank loans. There will  also be a shortage of funds for the purchase of goods for export.    --The purchasing price for goods for export will increase  following the price hike in the country. This will affect  export goods' prices and the confidence of overseas businessmen  in Chinese commodities.    The depressed world economy will lead to a small demand from  overseas markets.    Mr. Wei said that foreign trade enterprises last year had  achieved more autonomy in their management and had received  financial aid from banks in the country. China was planning to  set up banks dealing with import- and export-related business.  Such things would help meet this year's foreign trade target.    Mr. Wei, who is now director of a research group for reform  of the Chinese foreign trade system, said that the most  difficult period for reform of the foreign trade system had now  gone. Difficulties now facing China were how to develop various  kinds of markets, letting the foreign trade enterprises move  towards forming large-scale groups and how to prevent a draining  of talented people from this sector.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Kwik Save up 9% as market share grows: Sales rise to Pounds 2.5bn KWIK SAVE, Britain's largest discount grocery group, saw pre-tax profits increase from Pounds 101.7m to Pounds 110.6m in the year to August 29 while turnover moved ahead from Pounds 1.9bn to Pounds 2.5bn. Sir Timothy Harford, chairman, said the company had achieved significant market share gains against a difficult economic background. 'The market will continue to be tough this year, but we will continue to make progress.' He said that Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive since 1988, would leave in June to become managing director of Dairy Farm International Holdings, the Hong Kong-based company which owns 25 per cent of Kwik Save. Mr Seabrook will be succeeded by Mr Graeme Bowler, managing director of Franklins, an Australian discount food retailer owned by Dairy Farm. The 8.8 rise in pre-tax profits was achieved in a 52-week year, though Kwik Save used a 53-week accounting period the previous year. On a comparable basis, the increase was 10.8 per cent. Operating profits rose by 14.8 per cent from Pounds 98.5m to Pounds 113.1m but the pre-tax result was after interest payments of Pounds 2.46m on borrowings made to finance the acquisition of stores from Gateway. Kwik Save received Pounds 3.21m in interest payments the previous year. Trading margins fell from 4.7 per cent to 4.2 per cent. Kwik Save said the decline was due entirely to expansion of its drinks and tobacco businesses, which now accounted for 20 per cent of its sales and carried lower margins than grocery retailing. Underlying volume from like-for-like sales grew by 12 per cent, while new stores contributed growth of 7.4 per cent and acquired stores added 5.1 per cent. A further 9.3 per cent came from Liquorsave, the discount drink and tobacco business purchased from Argyll. Kwik save said its market share rose from 7.8 per cent to 8.9 per cent during the year and that it was now the third largest retailer of branded package groceries after J Sainsbury and Tesco. Turnover in the current quarter was 15 per cent ahead of last year. Mr Seabrook expected discount stores to increase their share of the grocery market from about 10 per cent to about 15 per cent in the medium-term. The final dividend is 11.3p, bringing the total for the year to 16p, an increase of 8.8 per cent, while earnings per share increased by 8.9 per cent to 48.21p (44.26p). Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: There's nobody here but us Ross Perot rang me yesterday. I wish he would leave me alone, for the pesky little Texan is becoming extremely nuisanceful. He regards me as the London member of the Committee to Elect Ross Perot, though I have told him to include me out. The only good that came of yesterday's conversation was that I was able to tell Perot the name of the winner of Hawks &amp; Handsaws' Little Rays of Light Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface competition. 'How you doing, boy?' demanded Perot grumpily when Miss Lee, my assistant, put him through. 'Still keeping your hair short and shaving twice a day? I hope you're not playing roulette, boy, or consorting with married females. They can cast a boy down utterly, boy - just snap him in half like a twig.' 'No, Mr Perot,' I said wearily. I was put on the Committee to Elect Ross Perot last June, after meeting Perot in a restaurant in Vail where I was eating my dinner, probably elk though it could have been buck deer. For some reason, Perot had the notion that I was an expert on techno-politics - electronic voting, that sort of thing - and that I was the type of can-do boy with whom he could do business. 'I want you to help me, boy,' said Perot yesterday. 'Ever since I let my millions of supporters browbeat me into re-entering the race for president, jumped-up media folk with no more wits than a coyote in a barrel have been saying I don't have a foreign policy, so I'm coming to London to rustle one up. Just a few days, boy. Here's what you do. Book me a hotel. If you have to, buy one. Get me some theatre tickets - Andrew Boyd Webster. And line up some people, strictly top brass - the prime minister and his side-kick for finance. What are their names, boy?' 'Laurel and Hardy,' I said. 'But nobody will see you. They've all disappeared, skiddooed off to Pluto. Britain's economic policy went up in smoke three weeks ago, along with every other policy, so we're the laughing stock of Europe. We've been beastly to the Germans. Everybody hates us. The reason Laurel and Hardy have skiddooed off to Pluto is that they genuinely and sincerely don't know whether interest rates should go down or go up. Can you imagine that, Mr Perot?' 'What about the foreign minister?' 'Pluto, Mr Perot.' 'Commerce?' 'Pluto.' 'Transportation?' 'Pluto.' 'How's about Queen Liz?' 'Skiddooed - ages ago. Let's face it, Mr Perot, there's nobody here but us chickens.' 'Nobody?' 'Well, the lumpen intelligentsia is still thick on the ground. I could get you Michael Ignatieff or Jeremy Paxman, Mr Perot. No prob whatsoever.' 'Can't you suggest anything? I had high hopes of you, boy.' I said: 'What you need, Mr Perot, is a big idea, something to put the fun back into American politics. Here's one for free. Recently, Hawks and Handsaws staged a competition in which readers were invited to suggest ideas for brightening our lives. I called these ideas LRLAPDPS's: Little Rays of Light Across the Planet's Doomed and Pitted Surface. 'The winner - you are the first person to hear this, Mr Perot - is E V Bernard of the Isle of Man, who suggests an MCFMP: Musical Chairs For Members of Parliament campaign. He wants musical chairs three times a day, each game eliminating an MP until there are only 250 left. 'He predicts various beneficial effects: '1) The remaining members will be fit, alert and quick-thinking, a marked improvement on current standards; 2) It should be possible to find useful and productive employment for all attendees, rather than having some 300 or 400 unoccupied mischief-makers wandering about the place as happens now; 3) The reduction in numbers would enable present salaries to be doubled without cost to the taxpayer, thus encouraging a better class of applicant in future'. 'Wouldn't that be fun, Mr Perot?' 'You're addled, boy,' snapped the smallest man in Texas. 'Your brain's been drained. Roulette and married females have ruinated you, boy. You're practically a communist. I'm firing y'all this minute]' Runners-up in the Little Rays of Light competition were Ian and Wendy Campbell of Edinburgh. FT prizes will be sent to all three quite shortly.</p>

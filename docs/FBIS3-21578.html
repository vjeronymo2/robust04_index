The agency cites a Ukrainian Defense Ministry statement  issued on Friday. Justifying this step, the Ukrainian ministry  has accused the Russian media of disseminating confidential  information on the transportation of the warheads from the  Ukrainian territory into Russia. This is seen by the Ukrainian  military as a threat to the safety of the nuclear materials due  to be transported.    It was earlier reported that the first nuclear trainload  arrived in Russia last Sunday.</p>

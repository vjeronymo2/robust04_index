			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edgar Augusto Sanchez in Cesar Department; from </F> the "TV Today Newscast"]    [Text] Guerrilla members and smugglers have apparently  created an alliance against customs guards in Santander and  Cesar Departments. Seventeen customs officials have been  assassinated in those departments during the last two years. As  a precaution, the guards now remain at a distance of up to 10 km  from the dirt roads used to bring contraband into the country.    These roads are in bad condition, but they are the safest  and  most reliable for smugglers. A sizable part of the alcoholic  beverages and cigarettes which negatively affect the economy in  Santander Department are brought into the department using these  roads. The dusty roads are suitable for smugglers because they  are located in so-called conflict-ridden areas, where various  guerrilla fronts freely operate. Obviously, due to security  reasons, customs representatives never go there.    [Begin Santander Finance Secretary Angel de Jesus Becerra  recording] They know they cannot go out and conduct operations  without coordinating everything first to ensure that they are  properly backed up by public security forces. [end recording]    "TV Today" newscast toured the area and observed vehicles  turning off from the main highway to avoid checkpoints.  Official intelligence sources emphasized that the alliance  between smugglers and guerrilla groups was formed to smuggle  merchandise. Only two highway policemen manned the checkpoints  on the road to Cucuta.    [Begin unidentified policeman recording] We have learned  that guerrilla forces blew up the next post. That is the way  things are around here. They operate around here and in Los  Colorados. [end recording]    Given the roads' geographical location, customs guards do  not  dare enter the zone for fear of losing their lives.</p>

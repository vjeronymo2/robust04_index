			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Arts: Separate Tables - Theatre A pleasing coincidence gives London revivals of plays by Noel Coward, Terence Rattigan and John Osborne. Anyone who sees all three will, I hope, begin to discard the belief that British theatre changed radically with the opening of Osborne's Look Back in Anger at the Royal Court on May 8 1956. For if you look at the playwrights as a group, it is their continuity that stands out. True, there was a change in the milieu - a move from the drawing room to the ironing board. With Osborne's success, Rattigan went out of fashion and Coward into decline. But there was no revolution. The conventions remained pretty much the same, the aim being a well-made play with a beginning, a middle and an end, and a capacity to shock thrown in. It was Osborne who was the conservative. He followed his masters closely, but dropped such controversial subjects as drugs and homosexuality. The difference was that he seemed to have moved the frontiers by writing about a lower down a class in the social hierarchy and expressing anger at the status quo. It was not until Inadmissible Evidence, now revived at the Royal National Theatre, that he moved to more complex relationships. Looking back, it is clear that was a great deal of anger in the British theatre before 1956. As early as 1924 Coward was an angry young man writing about drugs and sex in The Vortex. And anyone who has seen the revival of his Present Laughter at The Globe will have noticed that it is not entirely a play about upper-class society. The menage in which Gary Essendine lives contains a broad social mix. Rattigan pushed the frontiers much further. In the recently revived The Deep Blue Sea, practically every social class, including immigrants, has a look-in. The play is a marvellous plea for tolerance of social and sexual deviation within a society constricted by the law. How anyone could have thought that Rattigan was a conventional playwright merely because he used conventional forms must now defy the imagination. Apart from everything else, he used the conventional forms so well. Separate Tables, which is now revived at The Albery, is a slightly less good play. First performed in 1954, two years after The Deep Blue Sea, it was initially a winner but may have been the beginning of Rattigan's downfall, because it was about old England - a mixture of shabby genteel people slowly fading away in a private hotel near Bournemouth. The fault lies with the structure. Separate Tables tries to roll two sets of events into one with a gap of 18 months in between. The first concerns a disgraced former Labour Party minister (class of 1945) whose ex-wife, a once and perhaps still beautiful model, arrives in the hotel. They are at least temporarily re-united by the manageress (Charlotte Cornwell), who represents all that is tolerant and decent in a strained environment, and is also the former minister's current mistress. In the second half, the admirable Ms Cornwell strikes again for the forces of liberalism. She allows another disgraced guest to stay despite the fact that he has been exposed, and reported in the local newspaper, for minor indecency in a nearby cinema. The mildly jarring asymmetry is that here, the manageress has had no direct involvement in the emotions. She is more the wise ruler than the partial victim. Yet if you want a liberal Ms Britannia trying to hold a declining country together in Bournemouth in 1954, look no further. The appropriate patriotic music quietly pervades the play. Ms Cornwell even has a line that seems a refinement of Mona Lott in ITMA: 'It's surprising how cheerful one can be when one gives up hope.' Some of the period details are wonderfully done. In the early 1950s, educated Conservative voters read the New Statesman (here called New Outlook, for which the disgraced politician writes under the pen-name of Cato), claiming that they did so only for the music criticism. In Separate Tables, they have views on taxes and dividends that relate to real life, and (picked up from a television programme) on the respective merits of levelling up and levelling down. The biggest shock, and it is considerable, is when the seemingly progressive wife of the young medical student, turns out not to be a liberal. There is a lovely twist at the end, when a new couple appears at a table, talking only to each other, unaware of what has gone before and the drama that is going on around them. Perhaps here was the beginning of Act 3 or another play. I like to think of it as a defiant Rattigan gesture: a hint of what might have been said next, had he not been so rudely interrupted by a change in fashion. As it is, there is an ironic shaft at the coming shift in conventions. The former minister is reprimanded for using the French windows which are concealed from view. As for social class, he was originally a docker from Hull. One more point: there is a direct and telling reference to McCarthyism. No-one should ever have said that Rattigan was out of touch with his time. The setting - by which one really means the seating - in Separate Tables is crucial. In Sir Peter Hall's production, designed by Carl Toms, it is a trifle ponderous, but that may have been the flavour of the period. As a theatrical device, the separate, sometimes communicating tables are a delight. The menu is a mixture of listening, watching, talking and occasionally eating. Peter Bowles and Patricia Hodge double as the main romantic parts in both sections. Albery Theatre. (071) 867 1115</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Management: How to bridge functional gaps - Electrolux is integrating, with a difference, as it tries to become more competitive A year ago this month a group of Scandinavian middle managers from Electrolux, the Swedish household appliances multinational, spent several days at a conference centre in Sigtuna, a town north of Stockholm. Officially, their purpose was to learn new marketing skills. But the debate kept turning to a much deeper problem: how to bridge the 'functional' barriers that still bedevil the company, separating its sales and marketing organisation from its product development and factory units - what Electrolux calls the 'industrial' side of the organisation. This gulf has made the company slower, less innovative and less cost-efficient than it should be, hampering its ability to beat arch-rivals such as Germany's Bosch-Siemens and America's Whirlpool-Philips. It is still suffering from this problem, in spite of the improved profits trend it reported this month. In one of the conference coffee breaks at Sigtuna, a couple of the managers sketched a diagram on the whiteboard entitled 'how things should be done'. In place of the company's current structure, they drew what they called an 'integrated' organisation, in which sales, marketing and 'industrial' were all merged into a set of international product divisions, each with a full range of functional responsibilities. Electrolux's top management also feels keenly about the urgent need to integrate the two sides of the organisation. 'It is an absolute necessity,' says Leif Johansson, president of the group since 1991, when Anders Scharp moved up to the chairmanship. 'It is the only way to achieve the necessary competitive speed.' But in recent months Johansson has made it clear that he considers a structural merger impractical. Instead, he is trying to achieve the integration by various other means, both 'hard' and 'soft'. Electrolux has thereby declared itself a dissident from a powerful movement that is emerging among multinational companies in industries as diverse as engineering, information technology and chemicals. In a quest to increase competitive speed, and cut complexity and costs, most companies are streamlining their organisations by shifting the internal balance of responsibility and power sharply towards their international product divisions or 'lines of business'. This is being done at the expense of the other dimensions of the complex 'matrix' organisations which these companies used to operate. The other two dimensions were functional management, such as technology and production; and geographic management (either national or regional), which in most multinationals has been in charge of sales and marketing. In IT, IBM has been moving steadily in this direction since Lou Gerstner took over as chairman early last year. The American giant's latest step this summer provoked the defection of the German head of IBM Europe, disgruntled over the latest erosion of his own power, and that of his managers. In chemicals, Ciba and ICI are just two of a cluster of groups which have taken similar steps, again not without controversy. Only a minority of companies in any industry is following the lead set by ABB, the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant, in maintaining a matrix in which the national subsidiaries retain considerable power over both sales and marketing. In moving so strongly to divisional structures, most other companies are running a twofold risk of swinging the pendulum too far towards divisional management: loss of touch with national market differences; and demoralisation of the very managers on whom that responsiveness depends. Electrolux is well aware of this risk. So, in the marketing and sales side of its European organisation, it is retaining a strong element of national management, in practice though not in name. When it abolished its powerful country managers in Europe in late 1992, it gave about half their responsibilities to three pan-European 'industrial' divisions, which now control product development and manufacture. Two, for 'cold' and 'hot' products, are based in Stockholm. The 'wet' one, covering washing machines and dishwashers, is  - appropriately - based near Venice. But instead of transferring the country managers' power over national marketing to the new divisions, these were given - as at Whirpool - to a central marketing unit based in Italy. Much-expanded under a top manager from Stockholm, Christer Forstrom, this unit now controls all European marketing and sales through brand 'portfolio managers' in each country or sub-region. A number of Electrolux managers felt this should be only an interim step, and that a full-blown merger of the marketing and industrial sides should follow. Hence last year's backchat at Sigtuna. At top management level, 'we talked a lot about merging the marketing and industrial sides of the organisation, but decided not to because it would actually cause much greater complications than what we have now - it would recreate a very complex matrix', explains Aldo Burello, head of the 'wet' products division. The reason for this is that Electrolux runs four different brands in most countries. It is enough of a challenge for the European marketing unit to co-ordinate them, without adding all the difficulties that would arise if each product division had to run four brands. 'It would mess up our account management completely,' says Johansson. Stressing the need for a unitary marketing organisation, Halvar Jonzon, brand portfolio manager for Scandinavia, says 'trade customers expect you to be able to handle the full range of products from all three divisions - cold, hot and wet - not only by brand, but also by all brands'. These barriers to further structural integration give an added urgency to the wide range of other mechanisms which Johansson and his team have unleashed over the past year. They deal partly with new processes, procedures and systems, but also with factors such as people's sense of sharing a common set of goals, and their willingness to co-operate with each other regardless of their specialisms and formal reporting lines. 'Integration is very much a question of people's mindsets,' says Johansson. The initiatives represent an even greater challenge for Electrolux than for most companies. This is because of the fact, now recognised throughout the company, that Electrolux's long era of growth by acquisition is at an end after the takeovers a decade ago of Zanussi in Italy and White (Frigidaire) in the US, plus AEG's appliance arm this autumn. As a result, many of its past management attitudes, skills and practices are in need of urgent change. 'In organic growth, the core competencies you need are entirely different from during restructuring,' says Forstrom. Among the new processes, two are particularly ambitious. The first constitutes classic 're-engineering': a comprehensive 'order-to-payment' process which will span virtually the whole of sales, manufacturing, logistics and payments operations across Europe. Ulf Sodergren, who heads the new process, claims the first pilot projects are cutting order-to-delivery times by up to 80 per cent, and halving stock levels. The second initiative is a mechanism which many re-engineering-minded companies are signally failing to introduce: an integrated reporting system. For the first time in Electrolux, this measures cross-border financial performance by product division and brand. In process terms, 'we're starting to measure end-to-end flows', says Johann Bygge, the group's controller. Together with other new integrated information, measurement and reward systems, this will do much more than just stop the traditional haggling over internal transfer prices. It will also end each manager's tendency to optimise his or her own unit's performance to the detriment of the overall European division, brand or process of which it forms part. 'But this is not happening overnight - it needs a long education process,' says Bygge. 'Systems thinking' of this kind is hard to breed in any company. For one with Electrolux's strong functional, national and decentralised traditions, it will be extra tough.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Ruhrkohle move on four-day week Ruhrkohle, Germany's largest coal producer, is to discuss a proposal from IG Bergbau und Energy (IGBE), the mining industry trade union, for the introduction of a four-day working week in forthcoming talks with union representatives. The union is hoping a shorter working week will avoid massive lay-offs facing the recession-hit industry. Ruhrkohle, which produces 80 per cent of Germany's hard coal, is due to axe 6,000 jobs in coming months. The redundancies come on top of 20,000 jobs which must be eliminated between 1991 and 1995. The move follows an agreement struck last week between the IG Metall engineering union and Volkswagen which will introduce a 28.8-hour week and lower wages in order to save up to 30,000 jobs. Mr Hans Berger, president of IGBE, said the proposal from his union could save up to 10,000 jobs in the mining industry. The union is also offering pay cuts of 5 per cent in the talks which will take place in two weeks, much lower than Volkswagen's proposed 20 per cent reductions. However, officials in German coal mining groups warned at the weekend that the shorter week could only be a transitional measure to overcome the crisis hitting the domestic coal mining industry. Unsold stocks have been piling up at coal mining companies as orders from steelmakers have plunged this year.</p>

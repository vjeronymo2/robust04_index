			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE COAST BALLET AT CURTIS THEATRE  </P> <P> For the past three years, the fledgling Coast Ballet Theatre has been gathering  strength and experience at its San Juan Capistrano studios and several Orange  County performance sites.  </P> <P> Formed in late 1987 out of a merger of three local companies (two of which  dated back to 1981), CBT has undergone several name changes in the interim. But  its repertoire remains dominated by Sarma Rosenberg, the company's co-artistic  director, with her husband, Larry Rosenberg.  </P> <P> In a program over the weekend at the Curtis Theatre here, four of the five  works were choreographed by Sarma Rosenberg.  </P> <P> She made speedy, if not hectic, energetic and challenging demands on the  dancers, and they responded to the running jumps, frequent turns and overhead  lifts with clean lines and security.  </P> <P> Interestingly, in an age in which many choreographers are concerned with  abstract movement pieces, Rosenberg appears to favor works of moral persuasion.  At least, the Friday program opened and closed with such pieces.  </P> <P> Apart from the tempo of its telling, Rosenberg's "Beauty and the Beast," set to  Peter Warlock's "Capriol Suite" and Britten's Variations on a Theme of Frank  Bridge, is an old-fashioned story ballet that uses mime.  </P> <P> It even has a moral: "Love evokes either the man from the beast or the beast  from the man."  </P> <P> Rosenberg tells the story swiftly, deftly, with imagination, but with only  sketchy characterization. She calls to mind parallels with the "Cinderella"  fairy tale but never establishes the two other sisters (Jennifer Freedman and  Betsy Schamet) as wicked characters.  </P> <P> As Beauty, the fine-featured Sara Lane proved poised and secure in the  technical demands but projected little emotional involvement in the drama.  </P> <P> With his matted hair and blackened cheeks, the virtuosic Gary Franco resembled  less a scary beast than the moodily handsome magician David Copperfield, so  Beauty's fainting upon seeing him seemed a bit inexplicable.  </P> <P> Two serious choreographic miscalculations: Despite some bravura steps by  Franco, the central pas de deux remained thin and disappointing. Second, at the  end, Beauty and Beast merely walk forward (a la Fokine's "Firebird"). Before  that, a gymnastic but emotionally flat pas de deux is given to the animated  statues of Venus (Stephanie Balmer) and Cupid (Tyrone Baker). It's not enough.  </P> <P> "Dana's Ocean: Two Years Before the Mast" (set to Bliss' ballet score "Adam  Zero") pits good against evil in emblematic, non-narrative fashion, with an  earnest Richard Henry Dana (John Denniston) aligned with natural forces such as  Oceana (Kaylee Orrell) against the villainous Capt. Thompson (Franco).  </P> <P> Despite some striking visual elements (Dana perched on the ship's rigging), the  work rushes through its elements, verges on Hollywood kitsch and bears little  logical scrutiny about what exactly is happening. The piece doesn't support the  noble program note about protesting "our current inhumanities and our  mistreatment of our oceans."  </P> <P> Completing the program were Rosenberg's "Waltz in Ragtime" (Joplin), a plotless  company divertissement; her facile "Ballerina Girl" (Lionel Richie), danced by  a lithe Lane and a supportive Denniston; and Inese Birzniece's circusy  showpiece "Valsis" (Tangejena Igenberga), danced with stylish vigor and  commitment by Balmer and Bret Rijke.  </P></p>

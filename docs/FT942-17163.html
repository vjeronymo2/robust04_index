			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Investment of CDollars 8bn planned to set up multimedia networks Canada's local telephone companies plan to invest CDollars 8bn (USDollars 6bn) over the next decade to equip the national phone network for multimedia services. The nine companies yesterday outlined plans to pool their resources through Stentor, an existing research and marketing consortium. The centrepiece of the investments will be an upgrade of local telephone networks to provide broad band capability to between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of all Canadian businesses and homes within the next 10 years. The telephone companies are in a race with cable TV operators to establish a dominant position. Rogers Communications, the biggest cable operator, has emerged as the phone companies' chief rival. Rogers is broadening its interests through its takeover of Maclean Hunter, the publishing and cable TV group. Rogers already has a stake in Unitel, which two years ago set up a long-distance network in competition with Stentor. Stentor also announced plans to create a new company to supply multimedia services and co-ordinate the distribution of multimedia controllers and software. Outsiders will be invited to invest in this company, presently named MMI. The company will attempt to marry access devices, such as personal computers and TV controllers, with the broad band communications network. Its services will be distributed through the Stentor phone companies and other 'value-added' resellers. In addition, a venture capital fund will be set up to help companies develop multimedia applications and products. The fund is expected to total about CDollars 50m, with 10 per cent contributed by the phone companies and the remainder by institutional investors and other outsiders.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Owners undivided I OWN THE freehold of the house and would like a friend of mine to have the top floor under some arrangement that would give him a stake in the house. I am reluctant to convert the house into two flats. Would it be possible to assign to him tenants-in-common rights to the top floor? This would be for a sum of money, to be agreed. You cannot effect a tenancy in common which physically partitions the property. The interest of each tenant in common has to be in the whole property. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

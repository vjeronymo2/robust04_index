			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E. Cz: "Will the SLD Leave the Coalition?"] </F>   [Text] If this were a normal Sejm, in which it were clear  what one can expect from which party and it were clear that all  sides would stick to their agreements, the ruling coalition  would not exist today. This is claimed by certain members of the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].    An agreement between the Democratic Union [UD] and the Union  of Labor [UP] would have been enough to push through the vote of  no-confidence in the government and establish a cabinet  supported by the Sejm and independent from the president. If  the SLD were not able to reach such an agreement, the Polish  Peasant Party [PSL] would do that because both partners are  beginning to consider the coalition uncomfortable. Meanwhile,  as unofficial reports indicate, the leftists and the peasants  have independently examined the possibility of taking such a  step in the Sejm, in both cases without any results.  <H5>  Doomed to Themselves </H5>   The difficulty to receive the prime minister's acceptance  regarding personnel decisions put forward by the SLD, as well as  the suspicions that cooperation is blocked with the quiet  consent of the president, were not the only reasons behind the  hitherto discrepancies inside the coalition. These conflicts,  however, have been the most visible to the public. Left-wing  politicians begin to more and more loudly accuse the peasants of  lacking competence, which is predominantly described as a lack  of vision of how the state should function--in both the  administrative and the economic spheres. The draft decree on  the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], which has been  submitted for consultations among the coalition members and  certain voivodship leaders, is supposed to testify to the first  accusation. The first opinions, which are not without  resentments, are that the draft, which has been presented by  Minister Strak, contains only two concrete proposals: First, the  prime minister is the most important person in the government,  and second, the URM chief is next, after the prime minister. As  critics of the draft unofficially claim, numerous articles of  the draft have nothing in common with the reform of the central  administration.    The weakness of the PSL's intellectual potential and the  small number of economic experts working for it are supposed to  be proof of their lack of economic vision. The left wing is  therefore convinced that the PSL will not break the coalition  without support from a party that has a concrete economic  program and people who could implement it.  <H5>  Only the Opposition </H5>   It is also very unlikely that the SLD will decide to suspend  the coalition. Numerous concessions to the PSL indicate that  the left wing wants to remain in power, and it is able to  swallow a lot to achieve this. The only thing that could make  it leave the coalition would be clear and demonstrative  disloyalty of the prime minister. Waldemar Pawlak, as the  conflict over Dariusz Rosatti shows, will not run this risk,  however.    Political alignment determines whether the SLD's place today  is in the government with the PSL or in the opposition. Being  in the government, the SLD becomes a client of the PSL, if it  wants to implement its program. If the SLD ended up in the  opposition, both sides would have to switch their roles. It  would be Pawlak who would have to exert himself to win over the  friendship of Kwasniewski and his club. Apparently, the left  wing is beginning to use this scarecrow more and more often.  The SLD politicians, however, still believe that the conflict  with the president will finally convince both leaders,  particularly the prime minister, that they will manage to  survive the long-dreamed-of four years in the Sejm only in close  cooperation.    If the coalition manages to jointly overcome the political  crisis, for which the SLD is striving, the left wing will  probably further chill its relations with the president.    Given the current majority in the Sejm, we actually do not  need the president, reminds one of the SLD leaders. He also  announces that the coalition can minimize the president's  ability to make political decisions before the next elections.  <H5>  They Will Stay Because They Have No Choice </H5>   Jan Rokita (UD), who indicates that he is not convinced "it  is a good thing in politics to answer the question of what your  political opponents are going to do," does not believe that the  coalition will split in the near future. Arguments in favor of  preserving the coalition are stronger than the controversy over  the program, which is currently dividing and will continue to  divide it.    The PSL and the SLD are primarily divided over  redistribution  of the GDP--whether it should be used to stabilize the  agricultural sector or to fulfill the SLD's election promises to  the budget sector. I am convinced, however, that the willpower  in both the PSL and the SLD is still strong enough to patch this  discrepancy for a long time. I do not believe that the SLD  leadership can allow itself to leave the coalition because this  would mean that thousands of people who are associated with the  communist apparatus would lose the chance to regain their  position, which was endangered during the past four years. They  would probably not forgive Kwasniewski for the rest of his life.    It is hard for Jaroslaw Kaczynski (Center Accord) to predict  how the SLD will react--it can leave Pawlak alone, not  overthrowing him but leaving him with certain responsibilities.  Another two schemes can also prevail--opportunism and waiting  for the presidential elections and adoption of a new  constitution, meaning a situation favorable for the SLD. The  decision of the SLD can also be affected by other factors. I  know nothing about the mood inside the SLD. Is it true that  Oleksy is against Kwasniewski and that Kwasniewski feels beset  by others? Kwasniewski must also reckon with the "retro"  apparatus, which does not want to be in the opposition.    The humiliation of the SLD by the prime minister and the  president, in the opinion of Kaczynski, is a result of an error  committed by the SLD at the beginning. While forming the  government, Kwasniewski should have stated: Either we get the  office of prime minister or a ministry, or we do not join the  government.    The SLD will definitely not leave the coalition, Wieslawa  Ziolkowska (UP) insists. It will feel the pressure of "the  responsibility for the fate of our country."    The SLD will not leave the coalition because it does not  have  any political interest in doing this, Janusz Piechocinski (PSL)  claims. The coalition has not yet begun to implement its  program. It would therefore be hard for them to explain that  they did not manage to do anything in this situation.    I do not expect any significant political movements in the  political arena before the local elections or even before next  fall. If such tensions between the president and the government  recur, however, the SLD may leave the coalition and support a  minority government of Pawlak and the Belweder. In such a case,  however, Pawlak would have to find time and understanding for  Kwasniewski's opinions.</p>

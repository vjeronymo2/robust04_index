			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] No less than 23 babies, most of whom apparently  are in an irregular situation, were discovered during raids  carried out in an Asuncion luxury hotel and in a day care center  in Fernando de la Mora District. A legal expedition, headed by  Judge Nelson Mora, initially discovered seven [number as  published] babies in the day care center. Later, 16 babies were  discovered in the Gran Hotel del Paraguay. It is estimated that  11 babies might be in an illegal situation.    The operation began at noon on 12 April at the "Villa  Esperanza" day care center at the intersection of Libertad  Avenue and 25 de Agosto Street in Fernando de la Mora District.  Three boys and four girls, ranging from three to six months of  age, and a 22-day-old baby were in the day care center.    The woman running the day care center did not have any  documents on the babies. Therefore, the judge banned the babies'  removal from the day care center. The babies' adoption  proceedings are being handled by Judges Jorge Amarilla, Ninfa  Alcaraz, and Juan Angel Bernal.    At the day care center, the court officers discovered the  records of three other babies: Natalia Caballero, Javier Olmedo,  and Maria Elba Ramirez, all of whom are four months old.    According to Norma Saldivar, the woman running the day care  center, these babies were at the Gran Hotel del Paraguay with  their respective adoptive parents. These babies were scheduled  to travel abroad on 12 April. Therefore, the judge ordered the  immediate suspension of their adoption proceedings and went to  the luxury hotel.    At the hotel, the judge, to his great surprise, confirmed  that not only the three babies mentioned by Norma Saldivar were  there, but many more. He immediately ordered an inventory to  determine the number of babies there and if any of the three  babies, whose whereabouts were reported as unknown [as  published], were there. The three babies were actually at the  hotel, along with 13 other babies, all of whom already were with  their adoptive parents. Four of these babies reportedly are in  an irregular situation. The adoption proceedings for the rest of  the babies reportedly are under way or have been completed.    According to the documents carried by the people involved,  it  was learned that all the babies are bound to leave for the  United States, specifically to Michigan, Ohio, Atlanta, and  Minnesota.    Since the babies' origin is doubtful, the judge summoned the  attorneys handling the adoption proceedings to present the  babies' documents by 0800 today at the latest.    Judge Mora ordered that the mothers of the babies involved  present themselves to the court to testify in order to confirm  the conditions under which they delivered their babies for  adoption.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has voiced optimism  regarding the document drawn up by the National Dialogue  Committee to solve the dispute between leaders in north and  south Yemen. The YSP Central Committee declared that the  document, which was prepared with the help of various political  forces, is a document of national consensus.    It appears, however, that implementing the agreement's  clauses will run into some difficulties particularly in light of  a reply message sent by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas  to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih accusing him of squandering  public funds. Another difficulty is that the leaders in the  south have stressed that their return to take up their posts in  Sanaa hinges on the removal of the causes that made them leave  the city in the first place.    Our correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit interviewed Prime Minister  al-'Attas and prepared the following report:    [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The YSP Central Committee held  an  extraordinary session in Aden today under the chairmanship of  Yemeni Vice President and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim  al-Bid. YSP deputies in the Yemeni parliament and the  secretaries of YSP branches in Yemeni governorates attended the  session.    [Al-'Attas] The YSP Central Committee has devoted  considerable attention to this document. This meeting was held  specifically to consider this document in a manner appropriate  to its importance and to enable every YSP member to carry out  his duty in implementing it.    [Jazulit] Therefore the YSP will sign the Pledge and Accord  Document, isn't that right?    [Al-'Attas] The YSP will sign the document, as the National  Dialogue Committee did, during a major ceremony, the date and  venue of which will be agreed upon. This will happen when a  special committee completes clause number seven which deals  specifically with security arrangements and when guarantees are  drawn up that the agreement will be implemented.    [Jazulit] What powers will be given to the vice president in  the amended constitution?    [Al-'Attas] The vice president will assist the president and  will carry out the president's tasks when he is abroad, ill, or  cannot carry out his duties for any other reason. He will also  have the power to supervise the prime minister's work in  connection with local government affairs.    [Jazulit] Is the crisis in unified Yemen over or do some  reservations persist?    [Al-'Attas] To tell the truth, some parties to the dialogue  -- specifically parties within the coalition -- have some  reservations about the document. This casts doubt on the  prospects for implementing it. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Posco to seek London and Hong Kong listings Pohang Iron and Steel Co (Posco), South Korea's largest steelmaker, plans to list on the London and Hong Kong stock exchanges in 1995, following this year's listing on the New York Stock Exchange, writes Our Financial Staff. Posco's listing in New York was the first by a South Korean company. A company spokesman said Psoco's crude steel production was expected to rise to 22.68m tonnes next year from 22.07m this year. It expects net profit to rise 13 per cent to Won332.3bn (Dollars 418.2m) in calendar 1994 from Won294.6bn, and sales to rise to Won7,310bn from Won 6,920bn last year. The spokesman said: 'Our plan for 1995 calls for a net profit of Won340bn on sales of Won7,350bn.' The company plans to spend about Won3,000bn next year, about double this year's amount, to upgrade and expand production facilities. In October, Korea Electric Power became the country's second company to list on the New York Stock Exchange, raising about Dollars 300m in a global equity offering of 14.9m American depositary shares.</p>

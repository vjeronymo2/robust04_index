			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWELRY CHAIN PLANS MOVE TO MONROVIA  </P> <P> In an effort to boost the image of the downtown commercial strip, city  officials will provide a $200,000 low-interest loan to a major jewelry chain  that is moving its corporate offices to Monrovia.  </P> <P> The City Council, serving in its role as the Monrovia Redevelopment Agency, has  authorized the loan to Barry's Jewelers to move its offices to the northwest  corner of Lemon and Myrtle avenues. The firm's current offices are in Duarte.  </P> <P> Barry's will invest about $3.8 million to rehabilitate a portion of an existing  building and build a 50,000-square-foot structure with office and parking  space.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Operates Hatfield, Ringmaker  </P> <P> The firm, which has 226 stores in 19 states -- including Hatfield Jewelers and  The Ringmaker in this area -- acquired the properties in the last year. The  loan was an inducement for the company to expand the scope of its original plan  for the property.  </P> <P> The loan is one of the largest offered by the agency for a downtown project  since the Foothill Park Plaza Shopping Center was built in 1984.  </P> <P> In an Aug. 30 report, Don Hopper, director of community development, said  Barry's 200 employees will increase the daytime population and customer base of  the business area, a longtime goal of the Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3% Interest Rate  </P> <P> "The quality and magnitude of the project and its impact on the central  business district support such a large commitment," Hopper said.  </P> <P> The loan, which will go toward remodeling the 1924 building on Myrtle Avenue,  carries an interest rate of 3% and must be repaid within five years.  </P> <P> Barry's will lease the 13,000 square feet in that building to retail tenants  once the renovations are finished in November. That phase, which will cost  about $250,000, will include installation of new store fronts, canvas awnings  and electrical upgrades.  </P> <P> Construction of the new office complex is scheduled to be completed by the end  of April. The building will have an exterior of vintage brick and feature  canopies and black brick columns.  </P> <P> Barry's decided to move its administrative offices because it needed more  space, said Jay Johnson, a company vice president.  </P></p>

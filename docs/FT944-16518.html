			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Markets 'exaggerate' fears Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, yesterday said he thought bond markets were exaggerating the likely upwards movement in inflation in the industrial countries, including Britain. Mr George told the British-American Chamber of Commerce that financial markets were also probably exaggerating the likely pace and size of the increases in short-term interest rates that might be needed to keep inflation down. As Mr George was speaking, Britain's 10-year benchmark gilt-edged stock was yielding about 8.77 per cent and money markets were anticipating bank base rates of nearly 6.5 per cent in December against 5.75 per cent yesterday. Although the governor said he had learned to be cautious before second-guessing financial markets, his own guess was that the bond markets 'were overdoing it a bit' in their views of inflation. He listed several reasons for supposing that the effect on inflation of the economic expansion would be less than before. There was a policy consensus on the importance of maintaining price stability. Efforts were being made to cut fiscal deficits while central banks were aware of the need to tighten monetary policy before inflation is seen in statistics. Interest rates were high in real terms, while money and credit were growing slowly in the big economies. There is - in Europe at least - a 'huge overhang' of structural unemployment. One result was that upward pressure on labour costs is likely to be weaker than before. Competition everywhere is intense. This was an important reason why inflation in several countries had been lower than expected.</p>

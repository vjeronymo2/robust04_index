			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UAL wants to invest in Chinese airline UAL, parent of United Airlines, said yesterday that it had an interest in taking an equity position in China Southern, the country's leading domestic carrier. But the company stopped short of confirming that it had already held talks with the Chinese airline on acquiring a stake. China Southern, based in Guangzhou province, is one of two airlines selected to be among 22 enterprises traded on overseas stock markets. Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street investment bank, is completing arrangements for the airline's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The Beijing government has placed a 35 per cent ceiling on foreign investment in its domestic airlines. British Airways, which already has established a joint engineering venture and computer services with China Southern, is also believed to be interested acquiring a stake in the carrier. It has earned a reputation as one of the best managed regional airlines in China, with solid prospects for growth. UAL, which operates the second-largest US airline after American, said its talks with China Southern were limited to discussions over a possible marketing agreement, which might also include joint training, maintenance and related technical services. The company, which already has scheduled flights into Beijing and Shanghai, denied published reports that the agenda at its board meeting, held yesterday in Chicago, included a discussion of United taking a stake in China Southern.

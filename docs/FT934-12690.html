			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Hijackers seize Nigerian aircraft ARMED hijackers claiming to be supporters of Nigerian politician Moshood Abiola yesterday seized a Nigeria Airways A310 Airbus with 149 people aboard, and demanded Mr Abiola's immediate installation as president, airport officials at Niamey in neighbouring Niger said, Reuter reports from Niamey. Nigerian officials said there were five hijackers and that the chairman of the National Electoral Commission Okon Uya and former oil minister Jibril Aminu were on the aircraft. The hijackers later freed 125 of the passengers and crew but said they had sprinkled the cabin with petrol and would blow the aircraft up unless it flew to Frankfurt. Aides for Mr Abiola, widely believed to have won presidential elections last June which were annulled by the then-military government, said he had nothing to do with the hijack.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gyula Horn, leader of the Hungarian Socialist Party,  who is the most likely candidate for the post of future  Hungarian prime minister, said that the next Budapest government  will advocate cultural autonomy for national minorities in  neighboring states. In cases where a Hungarian minority is in  effect a majority, the Hungarian Socialist chairman proposes  administrative autonomy. This does not mean, however, we will be  seeking to entice Hungarian minorities in neighboring states to  strive for territorial autonomy or even separation, Horn added.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / The woman who built the Umbrella: Alastair Macaulay talks to Val Bourne, artistic director of Dance Umbrella - Interview BRITAIN'S Dance Umbrella is the world's largest and longest-running festival of modern dance. Audiences go to see new kinds of physicality, and a presentation of the human body that is more 'democratic' or less stylised than that of ballet or other dance traditions. Pointe shoes are almost never seen, Doc Martens and bare feet often. Few of the Umbrella's dances tell stories, and not many respond to music. Virtuoso technique is rarely the point. An average Umbrella will include mixed-media dance theatre, minimalist dance, dance improvisation, multicultural dance, dance inspired by clubs or street dance or just by everyday pedestrian movement. Plenty of it will make a marked effect out of its treatments of women (and, maybe, men); some of it will make other conceptual points; most of it will provoke widely differing reactions. The Umbrella occurs mainly in small auditoria: Riverside Studios, the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Place, the ICA Theatre, and more. Yes, this is the fringe - but, since the festival began in 1978, its influence has percolated through the British arts. Umbrella choreographers have gone on to work for the Royal Ballet, the RSC, the National Theatre, the Royal Opera and English National Opera, and for comparable companies abroad. There is still controversy - where there once were complaints about 'lunatic fringe' experimentation, now there are groans about 'the lack of the new' - but the Umbrella has become a valuable part of the British dance firmament. One woman, Val Bourne, has directed the Umbrella since 1978. She has seen the whole emergence of modern dance in Britain. She was at the Royal Ballet School in the 1950s, danced with Sadler's Wells Opera for three years, and, after a spell of other work, came back to dance as a publicist. 'The company I worked for presented Martha Graham in her seasons here' - these were Graham's mid-1960s seasons that so impressed the British, - 'and Twyla Tharp, when she was very new and radical and walked across the stage and dropped an egg. I was very bemused by that. 'But I really wasn't used to modern dance then. And I remember seeing Merce Cunningham, whose work I brought here last year in the Umbrella, and thinking then that it was awful. Last year, when he and his company appeared for the first time in Northampton, many people in the audience reacted just as I had in the '60s - and I realised again that it just takes time for people to get used to new dance. It wasn't until the '70s that the penny dropped for me and I started to love Merce's work.' Meanwhile Bourne became press officer to Ballet Rambert just at the time it changed identity and became a modern-dance company. 'Martha Graham, Twyla Tharp, and the Rambert really were my first taste of modern dance. It was really the Rambert, with which I worked for eight years, that fired me. I did become very enthusiastic about the modern-dance works the company took in then, and I was enthused by the people. These were the first intelligent dancers I had met] The people who had stayed with Rambert had had a very clear choice. They could have taken ballet jobs elsewhere; but they'd chosen to stay and do new ways of moving.' 'The first Umbrella was to have been just a one-off. I was then working for Greater London Arts, and someone who'd been to New York and seen all the new dance in an Umbrella season there, came back and suggested 'Why don't we do that here?' So I planned a festival that would present just about everyone then making dance on the London fringe. As it happened, the ICA had organised a season of the leading New York post-modern dance choreographers for the same time, so we brought that in too. Anyway, the season was successful enough for people to want another. Since 1980, it's become an annual festival.' It is debatable whether much of the fare presented under Dance Umbrella is dance. Plenty of it involves speaking, some could belong as part of the London Mime Festival, much of it is multi-media. Is this a problem for Bourne? 'No, definition is not a big issue for me really. There are parameters - cases where you think people can't or won't make dances. In one case, a choreographer was to have made a dance piece for us. Only when it came to doing the publicity did we realise that it was basically intended as a play. But if it's on the cusp. I'm fine about that. 'In general, labels frighten me. They talk of post-post-modern dance now] But let's put it the other way - I wouldn't want to be mainstream.' 'I was watching Kurosawa's film Ran - and the way it shows those armies moving across the screen is choreography. Well, if I could have Ran in the Umbrella, I would.' I am curious about her own dance training, which was in the mainstream: ie ballet. 'I began dancing in Calcutta. My best friend, Veronica, who later married the conductor Alexander Gibson, took ballet classes there, and I decided to do the same. I was 11 or 12, and we were taught by a Russian woman who had more passion than teaching ability - she had us do virtuoso steps like fouette turns very early on, I remember.' Why Calcutta? 'I was born just before the War, in Burma; my father was in shipping. When we came to England, I went on studying ballet - and Greek dance. 'I was a serious child, and I was bright, and my parents weren't too keen on the importance I gave to ballet. Going to the Royal Ballet School was a big shock. It was like going into the army. You really were a student there, and very regimented. My two years there were very interesting because I'd been brought up in the Calvinist tradition that if you worked hard enough, you'd get where you wanted. But at the School I suddenly realised that there was another element: talent. I was never going to be anything better than a swan or a wili all my life. I had a friend, who was lazy but talented. I'd watch her, and I'd just realise that I could kill myself with hard work but she could dance me off the stage. That was a very hard lesson to learn.' Is it possible that Bourne's subsequent interest in modern and fringe dance has been some sublimation of her awareness that she would not make it as a ballerina? 'I don't know. To be honest, there wasn't anything else then, there was a huge vacuum. People often ask 'Don't you take classes for pleasure now?' But the answer has always been 'No'. Ballet classes for me were a means to an end. 'When Rambert became a modern-dance company, we found that the loyal ballet audience came for the first year and didn't come back. So we had to find new viewers. We toured a lot to towns with university audiences - Warwick, Oxford, Exeter, Southampton - and we decided that the most positive way was with young people who had as yet no preconceived ideas about what dance was. And we did attract young audiences; they did enjoy it. 'For the first years of the Umbrella, we also attracted people mainly between the ages of 18 and 25. But we've just received the results of our latest survey, which says that our audiences now are mainly between 25 and 40. That's very interesting, but it's also quite a shock. 'Students aren't coming the way they used to. That may be because they can't afford to; but today's students are also more conservative. Just look at the way they dress; they don't espouse causes any more; they want to know 'If I don't like it, can I get my money back?'' And funding? 'In 1978, we funded the whole festival on Pounds 5,000 from the Arts Council, plus a similar sum from GLAA, which also then paid my salary, the postage, and so on. On that we managed to presented 12 companies and four soloists. Today we have a core fund from the Arts Council of Pounds 148,000, on top of which we need to raise a further Dollars 200,000. Well, this year the Umbrella has received the Prudential Award for the Arts, which is Pounds 100,000. How does the Umbrella present itself to the uninitiated? 'A lady from IBM recently pointed out to us 'Most people haven't a clue what to come to. People need to be directed.' That's true, I realise. A boyfriend who educated me in American literature used to say 'You've dealt with Hemingway, now deal with Faulkner.' So we should offer a No 2 route to the Umbrella, as in mountain climbing or skiing - to say 'You've done the blue route, now try the yellow route.' 'I still don't regard Merce Cunningham as a warm bath. And that goes for any of what the Umbrella presents. I still have to pay attention to it. In fact, that's some kind of definition for what we present. I've seen choreography in New York, and here too, that is very well made - but unchallenging. The Umbrella should present work that is stimulating. If it's challenging, then I'm interested and rewarded. 'We're freer now to choose what we want to present, and travelling to look for new work is a large part of what I do. There are festivals here and abroad that I attend, and I visit New York once a year or more. Sometimes I've made the mistake of bringing a company to the Umbrella just because it was the best thing I saw at a certain festival. A worse mistake has been to bring over a dance to London when I've only seen the video. And often I've trusted an artist, mistakenly, when I haven't seen the new work he or she is bringing or making. Almost all of the mistakes are mine, because I'm the one who does most of the travelling to look for work.' Recently Bourne was made an OBE. I asked about the choreography for the presentation ceremony. 'It was quite interesting, yes, but you didn't have much chance to make a mistake. This man kept pushing me in the back, and saying: 'Three steps forward. Turn. Two steps forward'.' Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, has always said 'It takes more than one to make a ballet company.' Bourne stresses that the OBE was given to her as a way of acknowledging the area of dance she has served. 'I honestly think I was awarded it because I've survived, and because this kind of dance has taken root, and because I was a woman. Mainly because of the field, though. People thought that this kind of dance would just go away, and it hasn't. It exists and it's flourishing.'</p>

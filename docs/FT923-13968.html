			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: Debt relief for Russia would be unwise Sir, Your editorial, 'Russia's place at the table' (July 8), is ill judged, in particular the low priority you extend to meeting international financial obligations. Considerable damage has already been done to Russia's creditworthiness as a result of the interruption in payments since the turn of the year. Western governments will have to ask themselves what debt relief might do to the prospects for future private capital flows to Russia. As is well known, private investors tend to have long memories. Following the repudiation of the Tsarist debt, it took the former Soviet Union over 70 years to float a bond issue in the international capital market. The example of Poland is also telling. Unlike Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which have faithfully serviced their external debt, Poland is not experiencing a foreign investment boom. Thus, while it is important to create 'a legal framework to ensure the growth of private enterprise throughout Russia', this alone will not restore Russia's creditworthiness. A country as great, proud and rich as Russia should do everything to avoid the experience of Latin America in the 1980s. Fortunately, debt relief is not required for Russia. With appropriate policies in place and the financing already pledged by the G7, Russia should be able to service in 1992, if necessary, the entire foreign debt of the former Soviet Union and increase its foreign exchange reserves as well.

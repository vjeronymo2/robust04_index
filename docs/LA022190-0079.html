			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MASTER'S SHACKLES DELAVEAGA, CLU, 84-62  </P> <P> Eleven days after Cal Lutheran guard Jeff deLaveaga burned his specially  designed defense for a season-high 44 points, Master's College basketball Coach  Mel Hankinson went back to the basics Tuesday night at Bross Gymnasium.  </P> <P> After watching deLaveaga bombard his version of the box-and-one defense at Cal  Lutheran, Hankinson came out with a basic switching man-to-man that made  deLaveaga look like an ordinary player in Master's 84-62 victory in a NAIA  District 3 game.  </P> <P> "We just pressured him every time he touched the ball," Hankinson said. "We had  four different guards rotating on him defensively and I think it bothered him."  </P> <P> Although deLaveaga scored a game-high 20 points, 16 of those came in the second  half when the outcome was already decided.  </P> <P> The victory improved Master's record to 19-14 overall and 11-6 in District 3  play, and all but officially guaranteed the Mustangs of their first berth ever  in the District 3 playoffs.  </P> <P> The seedings will be announced on Sunday.  </P> <P> Plagued by foul trouble, a cold shooting hand and the Mustangs' hounding  defense, deLaveaga made only two of six shots in the first half as the Kingsmen  trailed, 40-24.  </P> <P> "We weren't pretty offensively," Hankinson admitted. "But I was very pleased  with our defense. I feel we're peaking perfectly for the playoffs. We've got a  team that goes 10 deep now."  </P> <P> Twelve players scored for Master's, led by center-forward Stuart Epperson, who  came off the bench to score 18 points.  </P> <P> Jason Webster had 14 points -- four of which came on two right-handed jams --  and teammates Jeff Newton and Ken Sugarman added 11 each.  </P> <P> With deLaveaga (seven for 13) struggling, Brendon Dillon, a 6-foot-4 freshman  forward from Melbourne, Australia, tried to pick up Cal Lutheran's scoring  slack, but even his season-high 18 points were not enough.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran trailed, 40-24, at halftime, but things could have been much worse  for the Kingsmen. They shot 39% (nine of 23) from the field, committed 12  turnovers and got only four points from scoring ace deLaveaga (two of six), who  entered the game averaging 27.9 points a game.  </P> <P> Leading, 38-17, with 3:23 left in the half, the Mustangs got careless with the  basketball (committing turnovers on each of their last three possessions) and  Cal Lutheran took advantage of the mistakes to key a 7-2 run to end the first  20-minute period.  </P> <P> Dillon led the Kingsmen charge, with a three-point basket and a 15-foot jump  shot.  </P> <P> DeLaveaga picked up his third foul with 5:11 left in the half, and was  ineffective when he was in the game.  </P> <P> Master's was led by Sugarman and Epperson, who each scored nine points.  </P> <P> Sugarman was three of three from the field and two of two from the line, while  Epperson made three of four field-goal attempts.  </P> <P> Leading, 7-4, early in the game, Master's went on a 23-4 run.  </P></p>

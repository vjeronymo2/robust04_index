			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> BURGLARY BARS ARE SYMBOLS OF CHANGE  </P> <P> New steel bars cover the door to Tony's Indian Art Gallery in downtown Ojai.  </P> <P> Owner Tony Moore said they are symbols of change in the resort town, where he  has lived for 25 years.  </P> <P> Within a recent two-week period, both Moore's Ojai home and business were  burglarized. More than $14,500 worth of American Indian jewelry and hand-carved  knives were taken from Moore's gallery at 602 E. Ojai Ave., he said.  </P> <P> It was one of the largest commercial thefts in Ojai Valley in recent years,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Don Cunningham said he is not surprised to see  bars go up on the store. "Ojai could look like downtown Oxnard in five years,"  he said.  </P> <P> The number of commercial burglaries in Ojai rose by 31% last year, nine more  than the 29 reported in 1988, the Sheriff's Department reported. Vehicle  burglaries rose by 60% last year over 1988.  </P> <P> A three-hour vandalism spree in Ojai last week resulted in broken windows at  five businesses and $30,000 in damage to four public schools, said Ojai Unified  School District Supt. Andrew Smidt, who authorized a $1,000 reward for  information leading to arrests.  </P> <P> Ojai authorities said these could be isolated incidents rather than an  indication that a major crime wave is sweeping the city of 7,946 residents.  Residential burglaries were down by 21%, with six fewer than the 29 reported in  1988.  </P> <P> But that is little comfort, Moore said. "People in Ojai need to wake up and  realize we are going to become victims.  </P> <P> "They think we're surrounded and protected by these mountains, but the road  goes both ways," Moore said of California 33, the main link between Ojai and  the rest of Southern California.  </P> <P> Moore, a Lakota Sioux Indian who owns the gallery with his wife, Rosie, of  Chumash Indian descent, operated the shop for five years without bars, an alarm  system or any thefts except occasional shoplifting. He said he occasionally  forgot to lock the door and would find customers inside when he returned, but  nothing missing.  </P> <P> But July 21, he found a display case had been smashed with rocks. Shards of  Southwest Indian pottery littered the floor. About 250 pieces of Navajo, Hopi  and Zuni silver and turquoise jewelry and hand-carved knives were missing,  Moore said, along with several hundred dollars from the register.  </P> <P> "I saw the door all smashed, and when I peeked in, I dropped the hides I was  carrying," Moore said. "I just wanted to sit down and cry."  </P> <P> Ojai detectives said they have several leads but have made no arrests. THIA  BELL  </P></p>

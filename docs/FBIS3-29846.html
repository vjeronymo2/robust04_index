The officials said National Police Agency Deputy Director  General Koji Kunimatsu will sound out possibilities of  cooperation in dealing with such problems as Korean pickpocket  gangs in Japan, some of them armed with knives.    The two sides will also consider security arrangements in  preparation for the South Korean leader's March 24-26 visit to  Japan, they said.    The visit will be the first to South Korea by such a  high-ranking Japanese police official since Kunimatsu's  predecessor went there in 1988 just after the Seoul Olympics.</p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Business urges links with North Korea: John Burton reports form Seoul South Korea's main opposition Democratic party is not normally known for being pro-big business, but this week it publicly voiced what many executives are saying in private about the government's refusal to allow economic co-operation with North Korea until the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme is solved. 'By maintaining the policy of linking the nuclear issue and economic co-operation, the government is losing out on economic interests in the North to other countries like the US and Japan,' the party supreme council said. It was only two months ago that South Korean companies were reviving investment plans for North Korea because of the prospect of improved relations resulting from a proposed inter-Korean summit. South Korean companies, such as Daewoo and Samsung, are eager to enter the North to employ its cheap and disciplined workers for the labour-intensive textile and consumer electronics industries, which are losing their international competitiveness because of rising wage costs in the South. But the sudden death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung in early July post-oned the planned summit and Seoul has adopted a tough stance toward Pyongyang since then. 'South Korea is losing a golden opportunity to establish an early economic presence in the North, while giving a helping hand to the reformers in Pyongyang who want to open North Korea to foreign investment,' said one east European diplomat. 'A conciliatory economic policy would stabilise North Korea and prevent its sudden collapse, which Seoul fears.' South Korean President Kim Young-sam's recent hardline attitude toward the North is seen as an attempt to win the domestic political support of conservatives, while avoiding giving a stamp of legitimacy to the North's new and uncertain leadership under Mr Kim Jong-il. 'The government is facing a dilemma on the economic issue with North Korea. It wants to use economic co-operation as a leverage to win political concessions from Pyongyang on the nuclear question and other issues. But it also fears that if it waits too long, it would allow Japanese and US companies to establish a foothold in North Korea before South Korea does,' said Mr Koh Il-dong, a researcher on the North Korean economy at the state-funded Korea Development Institute. North Korea is soliciting IBM and other US blue-chip companies to invest in the country's first free trade and economic zone in the Rajin-Sonbong region in expectation of improved relations with Washington. Japan already has a presence in North Korea through a number of small joint ventures managed by pro-Pyongyang Korean-Japanese. South Korea has also forged tentative business ties with the North, with inter-Korean trade amounting to Dollars 113m (Pounds 73m) during the first seven months of this year. Lucky-Goldstar and a few other South Korean companies are using North Korean factories to reprocess garments. Seoul is also a big importer of mineral products, such as gold and zinc, from the North, which enjoys a heavily lopsided trade surplus with the South. It is clear the South Korean government is preparing to support a significant economic leap into North Korea if the recent framework agreement between Washington and Pyongyang bears fruit and solves the nuclear dispute. Seoul has heavily lobbied the US to win its support for the supply of South Korean light-water reactors to replace the North's dangerous graphite ones as part of the nuclear deal. Seoul is also studying plans to provide electricity to North Korea to reduce energy shortages during the 8-10 years that it would take to build the light-water reactors. The South Korean conglomerates want to undertake other infrastructure projects in the North. Hyundai has expressed interest in rebuilding the North's poor rail and road networks as well as establishing tourism facilities and a ship repair yard. Several producers of cement and construction materials, such as Ssangyong and Tongyang, have discussed the possibility of establishing facilities in the North to provide supplies to reconstruction projects.</p>

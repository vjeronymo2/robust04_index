			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Item from Vladivostok by Natalya Piskunova: "Will the </F> Pacific Fleet Stand Trial?"]    [Text] If Pacific Fleet navymen do not pay off the  debt to ship repairmen, an action will be filed in court on  behalf of labor collectives of the Far East Ship Repair  Yard.    That was the decision made by a conference of labor  collectives of ship repair enterprises after Fleet debt, in the  opinion of specialists, exceeded R75 billion. Workers have not  received wages for three months, many programs have been  curtailed, and enterprises have been informed that utilities are  to be shut off to the yards for debts. But the Fleet also is in  no position to settle the debt even if the action is filed.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reuters expands with Dollars 125m cash acquisition Reuters Holdings, the international news and information group, yesterday announced the acquisition of Teknekron Software Systems for Dollars 125.1m (Pounds 83.9m) cash. Teknekron, a software supplier and systems integrator based in Palo Alto, California with a workforce of 200, had turnover last year of Dollars 38.7m and pre-tax profits of Dollars 8.2m. Net assets at the end of 1992 were Dollars 3.6m. Reuters said the fact that most of the consideration represented goodwill and intangible assets would allow the group to benefit from US tax benefits over 15 years, cutting the net cost of the acquisition considerably. It is acquiring the shares from management, employees and venture capitalists. Mr Vivek Ranadive, president and chief executive of Teknekron, said the company's business was aimed at enabling workers 'to access all the information assets of their corporate environment.' Mr David Ure, Reuters' executive director for marketing and development, said Teknekron's products were similar to those of Reuters' Triarch, but that Teknekron was supplying markets outside the financial sector, such as the oil and semiconductor manufacturing industries. Reuters would benefit from Teknekron's technology and wider markets, he said. The group would in particular be looking at building operating links between the Triarch and Teknekron systems. Reuters has 212,000 information outlets worldwide, including 350 of the latest digital Triarch systems. Both Teknekron and Triarch systems are designed to allow the user to access digital information from any source. Under the deal, which has to clear both the US and UK regulatory authorities, Teknekron will retain operational control of the company. Two non-executive directors from Reuters will join the Teknekron board. Teknekron's management will also benefit from a stock appreciation plan, similar to a share option scheme. Mr Ure said Reuters considered it was best to leave Teknekron to operate independently, but the company would benefit from the backing of a large group. Barriers to entry in the software market were extremely low, he added.</p>

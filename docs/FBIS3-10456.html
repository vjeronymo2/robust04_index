COB Finance Secretary Carlos Camargo said the bill that has  been submitted to Congress had "an artificial beginning" because  it was not based on a "consensus" with representative Bolivian  institutions. Camargo added: "It does not have the support and  the essence of active participation by civilian society."  Camargo then said he was optimistic that national authorities  will reflect and discuss the bill recently proposed by the chief  of state.    He reminded the government that the COB "was never against  the implementation of a popular participation law; we did it in  1983 with the materialization of regional health programs, which  set the stage for a larger program." Camargo added, however,  that the bill recently announced to the country by the president  of the Republic does not have the support of the great national  majority. The COB leader warned: "It undoubtedly will meet the  peoples' opposition because a law that has this sort of  beginning has no future."    Mining leader Lucio Gonzales, COB social security secretary,  said the popular participation law is nothing other than "evil  for Bolivian labor organizations." He charged that the  government, deep inside, intends to "bury labor unions in  Bolivia to make room for neighborhood and peasant organizations  that have little experience in Bolivia."    Gonzales said: "They have planned this carefully; with the  law's implementation the COB and labor union organization  demands will unavoidably disappear, thus clearing the way for  them to implement their anti-patriotic and anti-popular policy."</p>

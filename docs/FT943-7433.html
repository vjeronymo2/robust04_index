			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Wella expects 20% boost to turnover after deals The Wella haircare group expects recent acquisitions to boost turnover by 20 per cent to DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.3bn) this year, according to an interim report published yesterday. Brands acquired from SmithKline Beecham and Sebastian in the US had already expanded sales 12.5 per cent to DM1.5bn in the first half, it said, when pre-tax profits also surged 14.4 per cent to DM75.5m. While stressing that profits growth had outstripped the rise in turnover so far, the company made no earnings forecasts for the full year, when results from the recently-purchased Muehlens group are expected to be included. The former private owners of Muehlens, best known for the original 4711 eau de cologne brand, traditionally never published earnings figures. Although the company claimed 20 per cent of the German women's perfume market, it is believed family quarrels had led to losses in recent years. Wella said that even excluding the acquisitions, group sales increased 4 per cent in the first half. Economic conditions had affected business in hairdressing salons which are its main outlets. Sales in Germany had fallen 2.4 per cent as a result, although signs of a recovery had emerged after a weak first quarter.</p>

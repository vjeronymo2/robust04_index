			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / The price is all right in America: The fall in the dollar has added to the cost advantage of goods in the US I can get it for you wholesale,' has long been one of New York City's best-known street cries. Today's foreign visitor might be moved to reply in the words of the Rodgers and Hart song: 'I'll take Manhattan.' The recent slide in the dollar has shaken loose a windfall of bargain prices in the Big Apple. Yesterday, the US currency closed in London at Dollars 1.92 to the pound, 21 cents below its high for the year in late March. The good news starts with hotels. A double room at the Plaza, the Fifth Avenue establishment owned by fallen property tycoon Donald Trump, can be had for Dollars 246 a night, including taxes. At Dollars 1.90 to the pound - the exchange rate used throughout this article - that is 28 per cent less than the cheapest double room at London's Savoy. On nearby Madison Avenue, the even more exclusive Carlyle Hotel offers a three-course lunch for Dollars 29. That works out at two-thirds the price of the Pounds 25 set lunch at the Connaught, the Carlyle's nearest London equivalent - though a 20 per cent tip is de rigueur at the Carlyle. For those on a tighter budget, a Big Mac hamburger and french fries goes for Dollars 3.55 on Manhattan, 18 per cent less than the Pounds 2.27 at a McDonald's in London. A similar bargain awaits opera-lovers. One of the best seats in the house at the Metropolitan Opera will set them back Dollars 110, a one-third saving on the Pounds 87 for a front-stalls ticket at Covent Garden. But if musicals are more to your taste, London still has the edge - just. A front-stalls ticket for Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre costs Pounds 31.50, including booking charge, 9 per cent less than for the same show on Broadway. London also scores heavily when it comes to medical treatment. In New York, where doctors notoriously specialise in diseases of the rich, the cheapest private room at the Tisch clinic costs Dollars 893 a night, four-fifths more than the Pounds 215 at London's University College Hospital. A typical upper east side dentist, meanwhile, charges Dollars 175 for a small filling, half as much again as the Pounds 60 demanded by his Harley Street counterpart. However, New York spectacle prices are a snip. Lenscrafters, a US optical retailer, charges as little as Dollars 69.95 for a pair of prescription lenses and frames. But the lowest price at Lenscrafters' outlet in the Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex, is Pounds 60  - a difference of almost two-thirds. There are also wide discrepancies in the prices charged by some other retailers with outlets on both sides of the Atlantic. New York is 21 per cent cheaper than London for a pair of Gucci loafers and 33 per cent cheaper for a pair of US-made Timberland shoes. However, bottles of shampoo and lotion cost almost 50 per cent more at the Body Shop in New York than in London, while there is virtually no difference in the prices of Rolex Oyster Perpetual wristwatches and Hermes ties. Probably the biggest savings of all are on electronic goods. Differences of at least 30 per cent are common in the after-tax prices of products such as computers, consumer electronic products and compact discs sold in New York and London - and in some cases the differences exceed 45 per cent. The prices given in the table were obtained this week from similar types of outlets. For instance, prices for the Apple Powerbook were from authorised Apple dealers in both cities, while those for the Sony Handycam were obtained from retailers which advertise discounts on the recommended retail price. Car prices in Britain, already high by comparison with those in many other European Community countries, look even more exorbitant when set against US levels. Toyota's Lexus luxury saloon, the Japanese carmaker's successful rival to BMW and Mercedes-Benz, sells for 29 per cent less in New York than in London. That is in spite of a recent luxury tax in the US and a cut in the special car tax in the UK. In most other cases, though, New York prices are flattered by an 8.25 per cent sales tax, which compares with Britain's 17.5 per cent value added tax. HM customs also spoils some of the cut-price fun by charging VAT and duty on all imports worth more than Pounds 32 Yet in spite of these obstacles, ingenious consumers can still make transatlantic shopping pay - without resorting to smuggling. Indeed, they do not even need to leave Britain: they can take advantage of bargain US prices by buying from American mail order houses. Many appear already to be doing so, to judge by the growing number of inquiries which UK Customs and Excise says it is receiving about the exact rates of duty payable on different types of mail order products imported from the US. Lands' End, an American mail order house which specialises in casual clothing, recently responded to this growing demand by establishing a heavily-advertised UK sales operation. However, the astute British bargain-seeker would do far better to buy direct from Lands' End in the US (mailing address: 1 Lands' End Lane, Dodgeville, WI 53595). A men's cotton Oxford shirt listed at Pounds 25.50 (plus Pounds 2.95 postal charge) in the British Lands' End catalogue sells for Dollars 23.50 in the US - less than half the price. Even after import duty, VAT and air mail postage to the UK, the shirt costs 25 per cent less ordered from the US than in Britain. Such price differences are only partly due to the dollar's recent decline, which in any case takes time to feed through into market prices. Indeed, as the 'effective' exchange rates in the table show, many products would still be bargains by British standards, even if the dollar rebounded to Dollars 1.50 to the pound - or even higher. In other words, many internationally-traded goods - particularly those produced in Japan - have long been much cheaper in the US than in Britain. The price discrepancies are too big to be explained away simply by customs duties and transport and distribution costs. Unless one believes that many producers have consistently pursued a suicidal policy of selling in the US at below cost, the obvious conclusion is that British consumers are paying over the odds for internationally-traded goods. This may partly reflect superior efficiency and lower margins in the US retail trade. But the recent growth in the UK of 'grey' imports, such as computers, at prices well below manufacturers' recommended retail prices, suggests producers have also sought to segment the market by charging widely varying prices in different countries. EC competition rules prohibit differential pricing of identical products between Community countries. In theory, it ought not to occur on a large scale or over long periods in an efficient global market. Instead of marvelling at how low prices are in the US, perhaps British consumers - and competition authorities as well - should be asking some pointed questions about why they are so high at home. Meanwhile, they can always console themselves by taking a trip to Florida's Disneyworld: a one-week flight and hotel package for two adults and two children costs Pounds 1,900. That is Pounds 700 more than a four-night package trip to Eurodisney, just outside Paris. But the Florida trip works out Pounds 30 cheaper on a daily basis, the cost of living is much lower than in France - and brilliant sunshine is virtually guaranteed.

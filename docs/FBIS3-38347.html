			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [John Carvel report: "Brussels `Trying To Gag MEPs'"] </F>   [Text] The fourth revision of the impending council of  ministers' resolution on how best to protect official secrets in  Brussels makes good a surprising omission from the previous  three attempts.    Senior officials have decided to introduce a top secret  classification to cover material whose unauthorised disclosure  would have "exceptionally serious consequences" for the  essential interests of the European Union [EU].    They had already established the need for classifications of  secret (for information whose leakage would have "serious  consequences"), confidential (where disclosure would be  "detrimental") and restricted (where publication would be  "inappropriate or premature").    Tony Bunyan, director of Statewatch, an organisation which  monitors conduct by officialdom affecting civil liberties in the  EU, said yesterday: "It is fair enough for them to classify  operational details, say about efforts to combat terrorism. But  ministers appear to be making no distinction between operations  and policy.    "The confidential and restricted categories by definition  cover information whose disclosure would not have serious  consequences for the EU. They are questionable because they can  be used to deny national parliaments and MEPs information about  policy which they ought to be debating."    The council documents provide a fascinating insight into  security procedures in an institution which previously did not  have secrets worth stealing.    Article 6 says: "Where a number of items of information  constitute a whole, that whole shall be classified at least as  highly as its most highly classified constituent item.    "Where appropriate, however, a body of information may be  classified more highly than any of its constituent items."    Article 7 says: "Access to and the keeping of classified  information... shall be authorised only for officials and other  servants granted clearance therefore who in addition require to  know or receive such information for the performance of their  duties... Only persons who have undergone security screening may  be granted clearance."    Article 8 says: "The purpose of security screening shall be  to ascertain that an official or other servant provides the  necessary guarantees to be allowed access to classified  information... security screening shall be carried out by and  under the responsibility of the member state of which the person  concerned is a national.    "If that person is not a national of a member state the  member state within whose territory he has his domicile or  normal residence shall be responsible for screening."    Officials needing vetting will have to explain periods of  residence of more than six weeks outside the EU during the last  10 years. The required personal data extends to information  about a spouse's siblings and other people living in the  official's household.    The draft council decision on security classification is  accompanied by a draft on how it should be implemented by the  secretary-general.    "A Classified Information Office shall be set up within  general coordination.... It shall be reponsible for: the  processing of classified information, in particular operations  relating to its registration, reproduction, translation,  communication, dispatch, preservation and destruction," the  paper says.    The rules extend to the strength of furniture in which  secret  documents can be stored. They conclude with a warning to  officials that failure to comply shall expose them to  "disciplinary measures and, if appropriate, criminal  proceedings."    This is puzzling, since it is not clear in which court an EU  civil servant could be tried for an offence against the Union.</p>

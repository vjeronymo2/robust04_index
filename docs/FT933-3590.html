			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Employers' group seeks review of labour laws BRITISH employment law is in urgent need of rationalisation because it has become so complicated that it is imposing an excessive burden upon companies, according to the Engineering Employers Federation. The EEF, the UK's largest industrial employers' group, says in an internal paper that legislation should be overhauled to strike 'a fair balance between the employment rights of individuals and the requirement to promote successful businesses'. It is the furthest a leading employers' group has gone in arguing that UK labour law should be put on a new footing. The government last month passed its eighth important piece of employment legislation since 1980 and the UK is accommodating a growing body of EC employment legislation. Other employers' organisations, such as the Institute of Directors, are pressing for further legislation. The EEF paper reports a shift in employers' attitudes on labour law. It refers to 'widespread feeling that employment law is becoming unduly complicated and is imposing an excessive burden on companies'. The EEF argues that legally backed codes of practice should supersede the mix of statutory provision and case law. Such codes would bring the UK closer to the codified systems of continental European labour law. The paper says laws covering maternity rights, redundancy dismissals and the EC-inspired Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) rules are particularly complicated. Another target is the industrial tribunal system, which, it says, 'is getting bogged down with excessive delays, long hearings and legal complexities'. Mr Peter Reid, head of employment policy at the EEF, and one of the paper's main authors, said simpler and clearer laws would benefit both employees and employers.

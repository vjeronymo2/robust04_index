			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 24 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel, the National Party [NP], the ANC Youth League and  the African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP] on Sunday [24  April] all expressed their "shock and horror" at Sunday  morning's bomb blast in central Johannesburg.    Mr Kriel said in a telephone statement: "Those who believe  that they will prevent or disrupt the election by such terrorism  have completely missed the bus. "Such mindless acts of terrorism  will not stop the birth of democracy in South Africa.    "Those responsible for this outrage will achieve nothing  except strengthening the determination of the people of South  Africa to vote for democracy."    The NP urged police to do their utmost to apprehend the  perpetrators of "this cowardly deed". "South Africa can not  afford this kind of terrorist deed. It is time to ensure  stability."    The ANC Youth League [ANCYL] also expressed its disgust at  the bombing, saying it was a frightening demonstration of the  "disrespect for human life in those who are opposed to the  changes that must be brought about by the coming election.    "ANCYL calls on all the youth and people of South Africa to  hold their hands together and move forward to a peaceful,  non-racial and democratic country.    "This blast is an indication of what will happen to the  country if we don't go beyond apartheid," the ANCYL statement  said.    The ACDP condemned the incident "with the contempt it  deserves". "Too many lives have been lost already and we cannot  afford to lose more lives," it said.    All those commenting extended their condolences to the  families of the victims and wished those injured a speedy  recovery.</p>

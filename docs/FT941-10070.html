			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Promises, promises at gifts' fair About 90,000 trade buyers visited the International Spring Fair in Birmingham to scrutinise the giftware offerings of 4,500 manufacturers, importers and distributors. Generally, they made the exhibitors more cheerful than at any time since the start of the recession. The fair, spread over more than 1m square feet of floorspace at the National Exhibition Centre, finished yesterday with attendance 14 per cent higher than last year. There were about 10,000 buyers from overseas, 25 per cent more than in 1993. It was the biggest trade fair ever held in the UK, although smaller than a comparable event held annually in Frankfurt. The goods on display were mainly designed to attract disposable income, thus making the mood at the fair dependent on retailers' perceptions of future shopping trends. Products available ran from air fresheners to yard-of-ale glasses via icing equipment, diamonds, rocking horses, scarf clips and woks. Although exhibitors were not predicting a consumer-led economic recovery, they displayed a confidence about their trading prospects which was a sharp contrast to the handwringing woe at the 1992 fair. Ms Francine Black, marketing Alice in Wonderland products for Macmillan, the publisher, said there had been steady interest. 'It hasn't been a rush. The last two or three years have been less busy than the 80s.' But Mr Andrew Gregory, sales manager for Bodum, the Cheltenham-based tea and coffee-ware maker, had found that 'year on year, this has been better. We've open far more new accounts. The extra new business generated is up 70 per cent.' The fair has offered promise rather than actual trade. 'We've written less business than ever but I think we have had a better trade fair than ever,' said Mr Ivan Tonder, whose company makes Cally and Co designer linen. Visitors have not had the time to devote to giving orders: 'We do the serious business in the next two months,' he said. It has been a good year for inquiries. Sutherland Health, importing cosmetics from Germany under The Nature Shop and the Soap Shop labels and giving aromatherapy demonstrations, counted 400. Translating those into business is another question. But standing sober-suited against the riotous colour of his imported artificial flowers, Mr Leslie Barnett, chairman of CI Group, was unambiguous: 'We're very happy. Business has recovered.'</p>

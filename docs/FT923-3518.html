			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ocean hit by falling demand for North Sea services OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services company, yesterday reported a fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 20.8m in the six months to June 30. The decline was mainly due to falling demand for offshore oil support services in the North Sea as oil companies cut spending. This knocked operating profits from the company's marine services division, including the better performing tugs business, to Pounds 12.6m from Pounds 15.1m. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, estimated North Sea offshore activity was 25 per cent down, compared with 10 per cent in South-east Asia. Freight and distribution maintained operating profits at Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 10.6m). Environmental services, including UK waste disposal and US laboratory testing, saw operating profits fall to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.1m) as both markets declined. The company's interest bill started to rise again to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 3.4m). First half capital expenditure was Pounds 32m. Earnings fell to 9.4p (11.8p) but the dividend is maintained at 4.71p. The company's shares closed up 2p at 189p. COMMENT As if depressed world trade and falling North Sea investment is not enough, Ocean now has to worry about the dollar's decline too. About 40 per cent of revenues are dollar related, either stemming from the US or from related currencies in South-east Asia. There was no marked effect in the first half, but if present rates continue there could be a Pounds 1.5m hit in the second half, even after taking into account the company's hedging strategy. The company rightly points to its mix of businesses and locations, which guarantee some respite from recession, and steps taken - in the US especially - to control costs and prepare for the upturn. Like everyone else, however, Ocean will just have to wait. Full year forecasts of Pounds 45m put the shares on a multiple of about 10. With currency worries flavour of the month, that looks about right.</p>

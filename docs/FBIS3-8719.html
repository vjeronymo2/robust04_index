			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Smajl Terzic from the 7th South Operative Group </F> Information Center]    [Text] Over the past 24 hours, the chetniks from Bajic  Kamen in the Mt. Ozren region used a B-1 gun to shell the  village of Sijevo. The enemy is continuously regrouping along  the entire 133-km long defense line. Moreover, significant  movements of motorized vehicles have been sighted in the region  of Kokice and Novi Seher. Our reconnaissance units report that  the woods in Sijakovac were ablaze all night, and that it was  Croats and Muslims, mobilized in Doboj and Teslic, who were  forced to set fire to them. As we file this report, the chetniks  are fiercely but unsuccessfully attacking units of the (?111th)  Croatian Defense Council Zepce Brigade.    This has been Smajl Terzic reporting from the 7th South  Operative Group Information Center.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Russian PM vows to hold firm on economic reform Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin has pledged to continue tight money and credit policies, in spite of having reached what he calls 'the trough of the crisis' in the country's economic transformation. Mr Chernomyrdin, writing in today's Financial Times, predicts that his economic policies will produce inflation of between 7 and 8 per cent a month by the end of the year, down from a high of about 30 per cent at the end of last year. He acknowledges that the consequences of reform have been a drop in production in the first quarter of about 25 per cent, compared with the same period last year, but says that this did not, and will not, deflect the government's course. Referring to the intense pressure from ministers to increase spending, Mr Chernomyrdin says that every member of his cabinet 'fully understands that a strong rouble is the indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy'. 'Our common task is clear,' he writes, 'that every Russian citizen should know that everything his government does is directed to protect the purchasing power of the roubles he earns.' He also holds out the prospect of the beginnings of an economic revival in the near future. 'We are now living through the trough of the crisis. In the next few months, we can make a break from the basic negative tendencies which have held back our development in the last two or three years.' However, he makes clear that he does not envisage mass factory closures and a strong rise in the unemployment rate, as that would 'sharply worsen the political and the social situation in the country'. Mr Chernomyrdin presents, for the first time, the outline of an action programme on structural industrial change which divides enterprises into three groups: those which are adapting successfully; those with the potential to do so but which need state help; and those which are 'hopeless enterprises which should be closed down in accordance with a law on bankruptcy'. The third group, however, will only be closed when a social safety net is in place to deal with the employees thrown out of work. It is an issue on which, he says, the government is now working in association with western financial institutions. 'The issue here,' he says, 'is the possibility of channelling the international financial credits towards the resolution of, above all, social problems.' Mr Chernomyrdin, seen in the west as, at best, a reluctant reformer, displays himself in his article as one who revels in the changes ushered in by privatisation and by the transformation of cities and their 'dejected, sombre queues' into places with 'smart advertising hoardings and attractive, lively goods'. He takes grim satisfaction in castigating 'ultra radicals' who warned western institutions not to advance further funds.

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium cuts spread to Mideast Aluminium Bahrain, the Gulf's largest aluminium producer, announced yesterday that it was cutting annual output by 20,000 tonnes a year to help support the market, reports Reuter from Manama. Further reductions would depend to a large extent on a concerted approach by the entire aluminium-producing community, it added. 'Several discussions have taken place among the Middle East smelters on ways of supporting the present international drive to re-establish balance between supply and demand in the primary aluminium market,' according to a company statement. 'Following these discussions, Aluminium Bahrain has decided to reduce production by 20,000 metric tonnes per annum.' Alba produced a record 450,000 tonnes last year, after doubling its capacity in 1992. Western producers have announced output cuts totalling about 850,000 tonnes since agreeing the multinational plan in January, and prices have risen by 8.5 per cent. But analysts have suggested that it will be difficult to reach the cuts target of between 1.5m and 2m tonnes a year without the participation of producers not represented at the January talks, which include those in the Middle East.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Observer: Three cheers for Oleg Oleg Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, is proving to be an indispensable cog in Russia's political machine. As Russia's unofficial minister of apologies, he is the man who has to turn out at short notice to explain away the sudden no-show of his superiors. Three weeks ago he had to explain to Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds why President Boris Yeltsin did not want get out of his plane at Shannon airport. Yesterday, he turned up at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport to glad-hand the Queen because his prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, was having too much fun on holiday in Sochi. The incident confirms the air of improvisation surrounding the Russian government. Yeltsin, who has twice delayed a planned state visit to Ukraine, decided at the weekend to put off a meeting of the Security Council to consider a report by the federal intelligence service on the reasons for the fall in the rouble last week. Next Saturday's high-level meeting of the signatories of Russia's treaty on social accord, promoted as a crucial element of the country's political stability, has just been put off - without explanation - until December. Finally, the parliament's legal committee has postponed Friday's vote of confidence on the government's handling of last week's currency crash - because the finance ministry had been unable to prepare a report on the budget due today. Guess who was due to present that report? The overburdened Soskovets.</p>

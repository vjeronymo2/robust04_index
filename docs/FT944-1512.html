			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / CU fined Pounds 105,000 over tied company Financial services regulators have imposed a Pounds 105,000 fine on the life insurance subsidiary of Commercial Union, one of the UK's biggest composite insurers, over the quality of one of its representative companies, Alison Smith writes. Compensation totalling Pounds 185,000 has already been paid to 58 investors by CU Life Assurance, and the subsidiary has undertaken that other investors will be compensated. It will also pay the regulator's costs of Pounds 25,000. The problems relate to the activities of an appointed representative  - a company 'tied' to a life insurer and selling its products only  - where CU ended the relationship more than two years ago. The penalty was imposed by Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry, now superseded by the Personal Investment Authority, which acts as regulator for retail financial services. Lautro said CU Life Assurance had failed to ensure that one of the representatives was of good character and of requisite aptitude and competence and had also failed to satisfy itself about the good character and competence of the senior management of the tied agent. CU said yesterday that it had improved its procedures.</p>

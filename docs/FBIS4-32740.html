			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- President Berisha  confirmed once more the determination of Albania to set a good  example of the freedoms and rights of the minorities according  to the document of Copenhagen in the meeting he had with the  CSCE high commissioner for the national minorities today. He  also said that Mr. Stoel's visit to Albania serves to prove how  far from the truth have been and are the statements of those who  seek to cause splits between the minority and the Albanians who  are living and will live together in full harmony wherever they  are. Relations between the minority and the Albanians have been  and will be very good. They will not be affected or changed by  manipulations.    Mr. Van der Stoel appreciated the complete transparency of  the Albanian party and expressed his thanks for the great  possibilities offered to him to see the reality in Albania about  which he will report.</p>

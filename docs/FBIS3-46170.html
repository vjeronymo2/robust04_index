			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff correspondent Liu Liping (0491 4539 1627)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 24 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Early in  the year, THE NEW YORK TIMES chose to interview J. Stapleton  Roy, U.S. ambassador to the PRC, on the China issue, sparking  off media interest in keeping track of the White House's actions  on ending China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status five months  from now.    Stapleton told THE NEW YORK TIMES that the last 15 years of  reform had been the best period China had ever had in the 150  years since the Opium Wars. Deng Xiaoping's reforms have made  notable progress in China's march toward a society of greater  freedom and democracy, noting that the United States should take  China's economic and social reforms into account when  approaching the China problem.    The basic theme of U.S. China policy can be very largely  seen  from the role played by China's economic reforms in the MFN  issue -- the touchstone for Sino-U.S. relations. Sources close  to the U.S. Government say that the White House is feeling  pressure on this issue from China's enormous economic reforms.    Experts explained that the pressure from China's economy  comes in fact from demands within the American economy. A  foreign policy report by Secretary of State Christopher toward  the end of last year already hinted that the Clinton  administration was making economic growth a top priority in its  foreign policy. At a session of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, Christopher described economic security as the top  factor in U.S. foreign policy, explaining: "National security  after the Cold War will depend on a powerful economy which will  function much the same as a powerful military force." Moreover,  he stated: "For American businessmen, there is no place as  dynamic as the Asia-Pacific region in terms of economic growth  and export trade opportunities. The region has an intimate  interest for U.S. commerce and employment.    The U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that the volume of  U.S.-China trade in 1993 topped $35 billion. Wang Tianming, a  ministerial-rank attache at the PRC Embassy in the United  States, revealed that in the next seven months, China would  import 210 key technological projects involving 23 industries.  Reports from Beijing say imports over the next seven years will  amount to $700 billion. A commentary by Representative Glickman  in THE WASHINGTON TIMES represents, to a different extent, the  current outlook of the U.S. business sector on China. The  commentary states that future U.S. political and economic  interests are closely linked to the countries of the Pacific  rim. China wields a significant influence in the Asia-Pacific  region. The Chinese market has enormous potential. If the  United States falls out with China, it will not able to benefit  from the opportunities the Chinese market offers to the world.    Messages from the U.S. State Department over the last few  days following the THE NEW YORK TIMES interview with the U.S.  ambassador to China have left the media pondering. In a comment  on Roy's statement, a State Department spokesman said that while  economic liberalization had raised people's living standards,  President Clinton's premise for renewing China's MFN status  carried specific criteria and definitions. China had made  progress in some areas, but whether it meets human rights  requirements depends on the next few months. In an interview  with ABC, Secretary of State Christopher said: "From our  standpoint, China's praiseworthy economic achievements cannot  offset the lack of progress in human rights." He stated that  the position of both the president and himself was that the  United States will not forget to take into account China's  record in human rights due to its excellent economy.    Analysts here believe that Christopher's statement  represents  the U.S. Government's current policies and position, though they  also reflect the State Department's attempt to deflect attacks  from congressmen in support of human rights policy. Analysts  said that on the MFN issue, the White House faces pressure from  economic considerations and human rights groups in the Congress.    The MFN issue will put the White House in a dilemma shortly  after New Year. U.S. Vice President Al Gore has said in media  interviews that the United States still seeks common ground and  a point of balance between its demands on China to improve its  right record and bilateral ties. Against this balance seeking  background, THE WASHINGTON TIMES revealed the view of U.S.  Government officials on Roy's statement: "Mr. Roy's comments  have weakened the administration's position on convincing  Beijing that Washington's strong position on the MFN issue is  not an empty effort."    The views of some U.S. Government officials differ from the  official position and media commentaries on the MFN issue have  heated up in the last few months. THE NEW YORK TIMES says:  Robert Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council, Bowman  Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy,  and high-ranking advisers stated that applying sanctions to  China would harm the United States more than China. The report  also cited a high- ranking government official saying: We  cannot continue to distance, and then patch up with China over  and over again on the MFN issue. There are many more complicated  affairs to take care of than the MFN issue.    THE WASHINGTON POST said in a commentary that the trouble  with the U.S. Government is that when, for reasons of  international security and economic factors it cannot strike at  China with trade sanctions and human rights, President Clinton  chose human rights as the decisive factor in considering the  problem. The article further says that, if as the  administration says, China has not made significant progress in  human rights, the administration will then be in a position of  having to sever economic ties with China, which will also dash  China's wish to cooperate with the United States on the DPRK  nuclear crisis. The report cited (Jeffrey Gordon), deputy  secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce, as saying: We do  want to see substantial progress in human rights, but putting  the MFN issue at the center of the argument between us and China  every year is unhealthy for both sides.    Haig, former U.S. secretary of state, said in an interview  with the media that it was a failure to have introduced the MFN  issue, an economic problem, into the world of policy. In  dealing with important countries, the United States should not  take human rights as a central issue between them. James  Lilley, a former U.S. ambassador to the PRC, said at a seminar  at Princeton University that economic cooperation was not what  propelled the United States to establish diplomatic ties with  China in the first place. However, economic factors account for  80 percent of U.S.-China relations today, and the United States  should stop using MFN status as a means to improve human rights  in China.    There are still several months before China's MFN status is  ended by the White House, and consultations and debates between  the White House and Congress, between Washington and Beijing,  and within the Clinton administration have been "warming up."  Sources here say that in the next few months, China's MFN  status will not be a topic of light conversation in the White  House.</p>

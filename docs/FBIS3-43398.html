			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] and government negotiators have already arrived in the  Zambian capital, Lusaka, where the second round of Angolan peace  talks will be held. Secrecy will still be the strategy of the  first round, following the methods of UN Special Representative  Alioune Blondin Beye. Meanwhile, it has been agreed that  political, and not military issues, will dominate the agenda of  the talks. On the occasion of the resumption of talks yesterday  afternoon, Radio France International, RFI, interviewed Dr.  Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who began by commenting on issues to  be negotiated.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] The first point is the police,  but a modern and democratic police, not a police with a  paramilitary and military organization, but a civil police  force, such as in civilized and highly democratic countries. We  will discuss the police and we can say now that we will not  agree with the so called belligerent and military police, such  as the antiriot police. We want structures which may guarantee  total security for the population and democratic freedom in the  country, not a police force created to oppress the opposition  parties.    Our second point will be the big, multifaceted theme,  national reconciliation, with issues regarding the government,  the status of our President Dr. Savimbi, and the political and  administrative decentralization which is extremely necessary to  create acceptable structures which may unite the Angolan people,  which has been traumatized and divided following the so called  October 1992 Luanda events. Then we shall also discuss freedom  of association, politically, and economically. This means that  we will be dealing with extremely sensible issues, including the  second round of elections, how democratic elections should be  organized to guarantee a free expression.    [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] government [word  indistinct] key ministerial posts?    [Valentim] [Words indistinct] ministerial key posts. We  would like to have one post in the Defense or Interior Ministry,  one post in the Foreign Affairs or Information Ministry and one  post in the Territorial Administration or Economy. We would  like to participate in government in an effective way, not like  in the 1992 [word indistinct] when they gave us the ministry  [words indistinct] not in the context of France, but in Angola's  context, for us to take care of drums; that is not what we want.  We want a participation which is a sign that Angola is truly  heading toward national reconciliation. We also want UNITA's  participation in the management of some economic enterprises,  such as the National Angolan Fuel Company, the railroad company  and others. We are still living in a society of the past, a  monolithic society, in which all workers belong to the party, in  which other parties do not participate in the economic and  political activities, because we did not have time to prepare  the country for an open democracy.</p>

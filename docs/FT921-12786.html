			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Bonn to resist G7 pressure for boost GERMANY will argue that its rising labour costs prohibit any relaxation in its strict economic and monetary stabilisation measures at this weekend's meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised countries. Conscious of the likely pressure from the US and other G7 members for action to revive the world economy, German officials insist that any return to the 'Stop-Go' policies of the past would be more damaging to business confidence than a failure to take action. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, is also likely to defend the Bundesbank's priority of monetary stability, even though Bonn officials feel last month's half percentage point rise in interest rates was excessive. At its fortnightly board meeting in Frankfurt yesterday, the bank took no action to modify its move. The attitude in top German government circles is that the slowdown in the world economy is worrying, but it is not in danger of slipping into worldwide recession. As for the German economy, in spite of a slowdown from 3.2 per cent growth in 1991 to a forecast 2 per cent this year, 'our underlying growth remains robust,' a senior official said yesterday. The principal German worry is the underlying rise in unit labour costs, coinciding with a stormy round of wage negotiations which could lead, next week, to strikes in both the steel industry and banking. They point to the OECD's December forecasts, showing that, of the G7 countries, only Japan and Germany are facing rising unit labour costs. The government's annual economic report, to be submitted to the cabinet next week, forecasts wage rises of around 5 per cent in the coming year in west Germany - although trade union demands are running at up to 10.5 per cent. Including wage rises in the east of between 30 and 35 per cent, overall wage costs could go up 9.5 per cent, it says. Mr Waigel will be arguing at the G7 meeting that confidence and stability remain of paramount importance for the world economy. A crucial factor in maintaining confidence will be success in the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks in the Gatt. Officials also point to the fundamental problems of the US economy - although not so much at the precise budget deficit, but rather at the low level of savings.</p>

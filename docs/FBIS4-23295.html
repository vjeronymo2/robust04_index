			<p>BFN     [Text] Harare June 2 SAPA -- Africa is likely to remain  mired in poverty unless the AIDS scourge is arrested through the  commitment of more resources, the Global Coalition for Africa  (GCA) said in Zimbabwe on Thursday [2 June]. According to the  GCA's African Population Advisory Committee (APAC) report  presented in Harare, nine million adults in Africa were infected  with the HIV virus.    The report was presented by prof H Okoth-Ogendo on behalf of  Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, the current APAC chairman,  the ZIANA news agency reported.    The session was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert  Mugabe, Botswana's President Kethumile Masire and other  dignitaries.    The report said many African countries, including Zimbabwe,  had the highest HIV prevalance among adults worldwide.    AIDS was also increasing health care costs while orphaning  large numbers of children and leaving many elderly people  without protection.    The report said advances made in health and welfare were  being eroded by AIDS and it quoted United Nations Children's  Emergency Fund estimates as showing that under-five mortality  rates were likely to be pushed back to the 1960s level.    "In summary, the epidemic will likely increase the number of  people in poverty and thwart efforts to develop sectors that  rely on skilled or scarce manpower."    The report noted African efforts to contain the virus had  had  mixed results. Zimbabwe, along with six other African countries,  had been successful in changing behaviour through use of condoms.    APAC recommended focusing prevention programmes on the  youth,  making condoms easily available and improving management  programmes to control the AIDS epidemic.</p>

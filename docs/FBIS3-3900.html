			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By MING PAO news team: "Deng Rong Says Her Father Supports </F> `Stability'"]    [Text] Deng Rong, Deng Xiaoping's daughter and PLA  (People's Liberation Army) delegate to the NPC, said yesterday  that her father "strongly supports" the current policy of  attaching importance to "stability" because the relations  between stability and development, which rely upon each other  for existence, are dialectical.    In an interview with reporters in the Beijing Great Hall of  the People yesterday, Deng Rong did not mention Deng Xiaoping's  specific views about the current "two sessions." She only said  that Deng Xiaoping, being an NPC delegate himself, had closely  followed the course of the "two sessions." Apart from reading  newspapers every day, she added, he also read documents on the  sessions and watched special programs on the sessions.    Deng Rong pointed out that her father had all along  advocated  strengthening democracy and the legal system. She said that she  had also worked with the NPC Standing Committee for a long time  adding that, before transferring to the Central Military  Commission, she served on the NPC Standing Committee Legislative  Affairs Commission.    Regarding the impact the current reform has had on the "two  sessions," Deng Rong said that since the 14th CPC National  Congress held two years ago, Deng Xiaoping has maintained that  the current reform is a deep-seated one, which does not only  exercise influence on the current "two sessions," but also  exercises far-reaching influence on China's future.    When asked about China's future priorities, Deng Rong said  China should focus on developing its economy to increase the  national strength and gradually improve the people's living  standards. This, she added, also accords with the three  criteria for judging any principle and policy proposed by her  father. The three criteria are "whether the principle and  policy helps develop the productive forces, strengthens the  overall capacity of the country, and improves the people's  living standards." The "three criteria" were first put forward  by Deng Xiaoping during his 1992 south China inspection tour.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recoups early fall on program buying Wall Street US share prices escaped the freefall some analysts had expected yesterday, closing just slightly easier at the end of an extremely volatile day, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 3.36 off at 3,674.63. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.16 at 449.93, while the American SE composite shed 3.74 to 432.40 and the Nasdaq composite was down 4.51 at 736.70. New York SE volume was a very heavy 385m shares, in advance of today's Thanksgiving holiday. Program trading pushed stocks briefly into positive territory before they retreated to end slightly down. Early in the afternoon, computer-driven trades drove the Dow down nearly 40 points after a morning that saw the index momentarily in positive territory at the opening bell. The index was down for most of the morning, and even news that the Clinton administration had won important support for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade failed to boost shares. Senator Robert Dole, who had been wavering in his support for the world trade package, which is viewed as beneficial to businesses, said he would back the passage of the Gatt. The bond market was a major beneficiary of the morning's drop in share prices as the long bond yield fell below 8 per cent for the first time this month and stayed there as bond trading closed for the day at 2pm before today's holiday. It was one of the first times this year that stock and bond markets had moved in opposite directions. Some analysts believed that Tuesday's plunge in the Dow was simply the blue chip index catching up with other indices that had fallen further. Major cyclicals were mostly down. Aluminum Company of America lost Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 78, United Technologies Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 55 3/8 , Dow Chemical Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 61 5/8 , Motorola Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 55 3/4 and Hewlett Packard Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 95 5/8 . Shares in interest rate-sensitive commercial banks posted increases: Citicorp was up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41 5/8 , NationsBank Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 45 5/8 , Chemical Banking Dollars 2 at Dollars 36 1/4 and Chase Manhattan Dollars 1 at Dollars 35 3/8 . Major investment banks also gained: JP Morgan rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 57 3/4 and Salomon Brothers Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 37. HJ Heinz fell initially after Nestle, the Swiss food group, announced that it was not interested in purchasing the US food company, but by the close Heinz was up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36 1/2 . Pfizer declined Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 72 1/2 after the pharmaceuticals company announced that it would buy the animal health business of SmithKline Beecham for Dollars 1.45bn in cash. SmithKline ADSs, traded on the NYSE, dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 on the news. Brazil Shares in Sao Paulo finished 2.3 per cent lower after light trade as investors remained worried about the prospects for the banking sector. Brokers said a sharp drop in the real against the US dollar had also made the market nervous. The Bovespa index fell 1,018 to 43,930 in turnover of RDollars 233.1m. The central bank had liquidated four small financial institutions over the previous 10 days, bringing the total to seven since the implement-ation of a new currency on July 1. Some small banks faced financial problems after recent central bank measures, aimed at slowing consumption in Brazil, created a sharp liquidity squeeze. Analysts, however, said a measure taken by the central bank shortly after the market closed aimed at helping small banks could provide underpinning at the stock market opening today. Smith Barney said yesterday that it had reduced its Latin American equity portfolio weightings in Mexico and Argentina because both markets were vulnerable to the rise in US interest rates. The broker was raising its weighting in Brazil and Chile, since US interest rate fluctuations had less influence over equity market movements in both countries. Canada A late-session rally was seen in Toronto as it moved in unison with New York, stock prices surging off lows for the day to end only slightly down in moderate trading. After days of losses, buyers rushed in late in the session to give support to equity markets. Some analysts noted that a pre-US Thanksgiving rally is not unusual as traders square away positions ahead of the US long weekend, and strength in the US bond market helped. The TSE 300 index, down 62 points at one stage, lost a net 9.55 points at 4,048.60 and declines led rises by 541 to 265 after volume of 60.6m shares. The Canadian market got some support after the TSE 300 briefly breached the 4,000 barrier; Its 52-week low is 3,935. Eight of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by golds, conglomerates, metals and oil stocks. Banking issues were firm, along with pipelines, industrial products and utilities.</p>

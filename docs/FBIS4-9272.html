			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 20 (CTK) -- The change in the  leadership of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA SR) was  not caused by bad-quality work on the news desks but by the  daily REPUBLIKA which it publishes, the new general director of  TA SR Ivan Melichercik says in an interview for SME today.    The role and character of a news agency was not compatible  with the publication of a paper of this type, Melichercik said,  adding that REPUBLIKA had no place on the agency's soil. Asked  if he was considering the departure of the paper's editors from  the TA SR building, he replied "I think they'll do it  themselves."    Former TA SR director Dusan Kleiman, who was dismissed  yesterday by the Slovak Government, says in today's issue of  REPUBLIKA that he considers his dismissal a "political,  undemocratic act of administrative caprice."    Kleiman attacks the government's decision, which he says  came  before he could appear in front of the Slovak National Council's  Committee for Education, Science, and Culture. It shows that  the government did not need facts and objective investigation of  the paper's publishing to make its decision, Kleiman says,  adding that the act of his dismissal was a politically motivated  purge against the paper.    SLOVENSKY DENNIK publishes a statement by Vladimir Miskovsky  from the National Democratic Party-New Alternative which  analyzes in detail the legal and economic aspects of REPUBLIKA.  He says the weekly TREND pointed last May that in publishing  REPUBLIKA the agency was breaching both the law and Finance  Ministry decrees, but nonetheless the paper continued to appear.  "It is the publication of REPUBLIKA above all which has caused  the agency to owe Danubiaprint 18.5 million crowns, and analysis  of the agency's economic results shows that under its current  leadership the agency has had the worst results of all,"  Miskovsky says.    REPUBLIKA organized a collection to improve its financial  situation, but this cannot be carried out without permission  from the Finance Ministry, which TA SR did not ask for. The  unauthorized collection took place all over Slovakia, and  therefore the publisher could receive a fine of up to 200,000  crowns ($6,600) from each area.    Miskovsky also points out that although REPUBLIKA was  evaluated at 10 million crowns ($300,000), Kleiman agreed on  March 18 with the free transfer of the publishing rights to the  then editor-in-chief of the paper, Jan Smolec. "It is worth  noting that for ten days the agency managed the newspaper of a  private person, without even informing its business partners of  the transfer of publishing rights," Miskovsky said (the rights  were transferred back ten days later).    "If personnel changes take place in the leadership of TA SR,  they cannot be called political purges but an attempt to find  people for the top of the agency who would run it  professionally," Miskovsky added.

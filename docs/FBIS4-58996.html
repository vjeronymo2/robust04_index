			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Jordan, American, U.N. and Lloyds Register  representatives are holding talks in New York on the modalities  of a proposed land-based regime at al-'Aqabah to verify  adherence to the international sanctions against Iraq, official  and other sources said Saturday [7 May].    Although Washington has accepted the Jordanian proposal that  Lloyds Register take charge of the verifications, several key  issues remain to be agreed upon before the arrangement could go  into place at al-'Aqabah, according to the sources.    "For some reason or the other, the Americans are taking  their  own time even on issues that need very little clarification,"  said one source. "At this rate, it could be several weeks if  not months before a final agreement is reached."    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced the  American acceptance of the proposal, subject to "finetuning,"  after a meeting with His Majesty King Husayn in London on April  25.    Prime Minister Abd al-Salam al-Majali said last week that  the  U.S.-led naval force patrolling the Red Sea had not intercepted  and delayed any al-'Aqabah-bound vessel after the King's meeting  with Mr. Christopher.    But, Dr. al-Majali said, this did not mean that the  interceptions had stopped. He added that no progress had been  made in having the onshore verifications regime in place at  al-'Aqabah.    France announced last week that it was withdrawing from the  so-called multinational interception force (MIF) in line with  the Jordanian effort to end the damaging sea-based inspections  of al-'Aqabah-bound vessels.    According to the source, the issues on the table in the  ongoing discussions in New York involve the mechanism for Lloyds  Register's presence at al-'Aqabah, modalities of ensuring  adherence to the U.N. resolutions that imposed the international  sanctions against Iraq and who will pay the cost for Lloyds  Register presence at al-'Aqabah. (The sources could not confirm  reports that Jordan might be seeking a Security Council  announcement that the offshore inspections are being replaced  with an onshore verification regime).    On the first point, Jordan has proposed that a Lloyds  Register representative be included in a team along with port  officials, clearning agents and shipping agents which will  observe Jordanian customs inspection of all incoming and  outgoing cargo related to Jordan, the source said. Such teams  are a permanent fixture of all import and export procedures at  the port in line with Jordanian customs regulations.    "The customs and the port authority are the two sides that  never change," noted a shipping source, noting that other  participants will be a representative of the clearing agent  nominated by the importer and another nominated by the concerned  shipping agents.    Under the proposal, Lloyds Register will join the customs  and  ports officials as standing members of the team until such time  the situation in the international sanctions against Iraq is  changed.    "This agreement will concern cargo coming into and going out  of the Jordnian market," said the source. "Actually this is a  concession that Jordan is making. There is no rule that says  Jordan-bound cargo should be inspected or observed by anyone."    All Iraq-bound cargo in transit through Jordan will be  stored  at a separate warehouse, and will be cleared according to the  guidelines set by the U.N. Sanctions Committee.    "All items other than food and medicine should have the  approval of the Sanctions Committee," said the soruce. "Those  that might arrive at the port will have to await such approval  wherever that is necessary."    Sufian Muhaisan, manager of the Jordan Shipping Agents  Association (JSAA), confirmed that this was the broad outline of  the Jordanian proposal.    "Jordan is abiding by the sanctions against Iraq, and there  is no reason why Jordanian imports or exports should be  inspected or even observed," Mr. Muhaisan told the JORDAN TIMES.    "Lloyds Register can observe what is going on at the port  and  what kind of goods come into and go out of Jordan and file its  reports," he said. "Nothing more, nothing less," he added  without elaboration.    Another point in the New York discussions is payment for  Lloyds Register for its observatory presence at al-'Aqabah.    The Sanctions Committee has refused to accept a Jordanian  request that the United Nations pay the cost, the sources said.  The request was made by Prime Minister al-Majali when he  addressed the committee in New York in December.    Subsequently Jordan proposed that the Amman government pay  the costs and reduce the amount from the Kingdom's annual  contribution to the U.N., the sources said. it was not clear by  Saturday whether the world body had accepted the proposal.  Reports from London said the amount being discussed was between  $2 million and $3 million per year. There was no confirmation  of these reports.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Gallup Institute article: "Voters in Doubt About Europe </F> Election"]    [Text] Only 51 percent of the electorate have decided how  they will cast their ballot on 9 June. The Liberals are well  placed for a good result.    Barely four weeks before the election to the European  Parliament on 9 June, the Gallup Institute conducted a poll for  BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on current support for competing parties and  their candidate lists.    The poll shows that every seventh eligible Danish voter is  still not clear about the fact that an election is to be held  for the European Parliament on 9 June. This is a remarkably  large proportion of the population, and it must be expected that  this will become significantly smaller when the vote placards go  up and the campaign begins in earnest.  <H5>  Every Third in Doubt </H5>   Another interesting result of Gallup's poll is that every  third voter (35 percent) is in doubt as to what he is voting  for. At the same time, every 11th voter (9 percent) has already  decided not to vote on 9 June. This proportion can be expected  to rise somewhat. In any case, the three previous European  Parliament elections have had very low voting percentages. At  the present juncture, every second voter (51 percent) has  decided how he is going to cast his ballot, and -- viewing the  vote distribution among this half of the electorate -- one sees  several clear tendencies.  <H5>  Liberal Party Ahead </H5>   In comparison to the last European Parliament election, the  Liberals are in position to have a good election, with 28  percent of the voters, while the Center Democrats (CD) look as  if they will lose so many voters that the CD will get no seats  in the new European Parliament. At present the Radical Liberals  are poised to gain 6 percent, and if this result holds, then the  party will have a possibility of getting its first seat in the  European Parliament. The People's Movement Against the European  Union [EU] is poised right now to lose two-thirds of its  support, and got only 6 percent, while The June Movement [also  opposed to the Union] would now get 9 percent among those who  have made up their minds, and this means that this list  currently has larger support than the People's Movement.  Together these two anti-EU lists have support of only 15 percent  of those who have made up their minds, which is less than many  had expected. Gallup would like to emphasize, however, that this  is a very early survey, so that the final vote result may turn  out quite differently, since electoral alliances may play a  role. In addition, many people are simply not aware there is  going to be an election, and the election campaign has hardly  started.    Before the European Parliament Election   "Have you heard or read about the election to the European Parliament we are  going to have in Denmark on Thursday, 9 June?"

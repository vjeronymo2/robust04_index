			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL BASKETBAL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> DIVISION V BOYS;  </P> <P> TONY CLARK SCORES 52 AS TARTANS LOSE, 74-52  </P> <P> Lute Olson and the University of Arizona may be ready for Tony Clark, but St.  Margaret's High School isn't.  </P> <P> With Olson in attendance Tuesday night at Granite Hills High School to watch  one of his recruits in a first-round Division V Southern California Regional  boys' basketball playoff game, El Cajon Christian's Clark scorched St.  Margaret's for 52 points.  </P> <P> On a plateau far above Division V, the 6-foot-8 Clark matched St. Margaret's  point for point. His teammates chipped in the rest for a 74-52 El Cajon  Christian victory.  </P> <P> Clark has averaged 44 points and 14 rebounds a game since transferring from  Valhalla.  </P> <P> "We knew Clark was going to get his points," St. Margaret's Coach Rick Bauer  said. "We figured if we could hold him to 30 or 35 points we'd be all right."  </P> <P> Clark had 29 points at halftime, including three first-quarter three-pointers.  </P> <P> Clark showcased his entire arsenal en route to 21-for-33 shooting from the  field -- feather-touch rainbows from the perimeter, soft hooks in the lane, and  rim-rattling, twin-fisted slam dunks.  </P> <P> Amazingly, Clark's 52-point effort was not his season high. That came against  La Jolla Country Day in a San Diego Section playoff game when he scored 64  points.  </P> <P> After a while, all St. Margaret's could do was watch. The Tartans, who won 18  consecutive games this season, finished 21-6.  </P> <P> Ryan Westendorf, St. Margaret's 6-7 center, finished with a team-high 17  points.  </P> <P> But Westendorf, who entered the game averaging 26 points, was slowed by an  ankle injury he suffered in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "I think if we had a healthy Westendorf guarding him, that guy wouldn't have  scored 52 points," Bauer said.  </P> <P> Forward Dann Campaigne added 16 for the Tartans, and guard Trevor Durham added  11, including a pair of three-pointers.  </P></p>

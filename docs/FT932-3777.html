			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Governors to scrutinise BBC performance THE BBC board of governors will spend three days next week assessing the performance of every aspect of the corporation. It is the first of an annual series of performance reviews to be carried out by the BBC and includes in a new-style annual report to be published on July 28. In January Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, outlined his policies for the organisation. He said: 'The annual performance review will be the flywheel that drives the BBC and keeps us alert and self-questioning about everything we do.' At the three-day session being held at a unnamed hotel in the home counties Mr Birt will present a formal assessment of the BBC's programme output, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. The programme targets will not deal in crude audience size but will be measured against how a particular type of programme should have been expected to perform. The BBC has been lagging behind commercial television in the ratings - often taking only between 40 per cent and 42 per cent of total viewing. Some recent BBC dramas, such as A Year In Provence, have not only been critical failures but have also attracted low audiences. In reviewing the efficiency of the corporation the governors will be able to look at the serious potential overspends of the past two years and whether all dangers of a recurrence have now been eliminated. The BBC is declining to say where this year's performance review is being held in the hope of avoiding the arrival of a large number of journalists. Last year the old-style annual conference was at Lucknam Park, near Bath, which led to journalists assessing the quality of the wine and the food being enjoyed by the BBC governors and top management.</p>

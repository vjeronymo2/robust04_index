			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bridgeport Machines tools up in east Asia Bridgeport Machines is to become one of the first UK machine tool builders to manufacture in east Asia following the signing of a memorandum of understanding to create a joint venture in Indonesia. The Leicester-based company, in conjunction with its US parent, is forming a new company with Indonesia's PT Texmaco Perkasa Engineering, which makes textile machinery, and Megatech, an investment company. Bridgeport Perkasa Machine Tools will make a range of machines from the manually-operated Bridgeport turret mill to computer-controlled machining centres for the fast-growing Indonesian, Asean and Australasian markets. Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport Machines, said the company already had a good market in east Asia but would not say how much he expected to increase sales in the region following the deal. The deal was important, however, as it would enable the company to build machines closer to customers, giving it an advantage in a highly-competitive market.</p>

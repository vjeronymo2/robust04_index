			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Striking Ohio Bell telephone workers reached a tentative agreement on a  contract, but picket lines will likely stay up until other strikes against  Chicago-based Ameritech are settled, officials said. After a brief session at a  Cleveland hotel, negotiators returned a few hours later and signed the  agreement -- a three-year contract that covers about 10,100 workers. But the  Communications Workers of America, which called for a strike against Ohio Bell  just after midnight on Aug. 13, urged its Ohio Bell locals to stay off the job  and on the picket lines until five other labor disputes in the Ameritech system  are resolved. Ameritech includes Ohio Bell, Indiana Bell, Illinois Bell,  Wisconsin Bell, Michigan Bell and the regional Ameritech Services Inc. Terms of  the settlement were not revealed.  </P></p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Arts: Paris goes Dutch - William Packer visits an exhibition of 20th century art from the Low Countries La beaute exacte is hardly an exact title for what is yet a fascinating exhibition full of beautiful and exciting things. Its subtitle, from Van Gogh to Mondrian, gives something rather more of its scope, but there again the inference is misleading, partial, imprecise. Van Gogh indeed is there, but only as a presiding and iconic figure, represented solely in a self-portrait, in a grey hat, of 1887. And in a show that is one of a pair specifically addressed to the art of the Low Countries in the 20th century, Van Gogh's presence itself is somewhat equivocal. Certainly there are formal connections to the other artists to be made, if only in the general foreshadowing of expressionism - the clarity and intensity of the colour, the staccato energy of the brushstrokes, with each mark a distinct beat in the total statement. There too is the sheer symbolic force of the image itself, personal and tragic as we know with hindsight its implications to be. Yet Van Gogh spent the later and infinitely more productive half of his short career abroad, and was dead by 1890. The position he holds in relation to French painting of the 1880s is obvious and unquestioned. Quite how well his work was known in Holland within the first few years of his death is another question altogether. The real starting point of the exhibition is the pointillist yet moodily symbolic landscape of 1889 by the lesser-known painter, Jan Toorop, a view across the canals and low fields of the Waterland at sunset, with shadowy figures in a boat in the foreground. It is a work that embraces all that the exhibition as a whole will offer: on the one hand, the formal simplicity and rigour which Mondrian in particular will take to the limits of pure and minimal abstraction; on the other, the symbolist and emotional content, shades of the workers in the fields of Millet and Van Gogh, which will lead to the heightened realism of the Dutch figurative painters of the early 20th century whom we come to later. It is this duality, given the apparent precise simplicity of the exhibition's title, that comes as the surprise. That said, it is Mondrian who remains the central figure and hero of the show. While Toorop veers sharply off at a tangent into bizarre fin-de-siecle graphic symbolism, Mondrian stays with the landscape of sea and dune, tree and church tower, that grows ever more simple and rarefied while losing nothing of its mystical, symbolic charge. Such mystical significance remained as the informing justification of all he did, no matter that by the mid-1910s, under the obscure philosophisings of neo-plasticity, his painting had moved away from anything even remotely representational in its reference  -nothing more than lines and grids and squares of colour. The magnificent sequence of paintings and drawings in the first main room, that takes us from the trees and canals of around 1900 through the sea and dunescapes to the fragmented, quasi-cubist trees and towers of around 1913, is alone worth the visit. With the rational, abstract developments of his next 30 years to follow in the later rooms, set into the context of the work of the de Stilj group in general and such as Bart van der Leck and Theo van Doesburg in particular, the show is irresistible. But between de Stilj constructivism in its origins and later pomp comes a quite separate body of work, and with it the show's greatest surprise. For here, as complement and counter-point to Mondrian and his associates, are those Dutch realists of the 1920s and 1930s, colleagues at a remove of the Neue Sachlikeit in Germany in particular, and realist contemporaries everywhere, with their peculiarly heightened and febrile, all but surreal, clarity of image, and their uncompromising honesty. We are back at once to Van Gogh in his self-image at the show's beginning, and it is hardly by chance that each painter of this later group is represented by self-portrait after self-portrait, rows of them. All are remarkable artists, and their still comparative obscurity merely confirms the rule that even in our supposedly international age, national schools of art, not just in England but everywhere, remain too much the province of a merely national, even parochial interest. Dick Ket, Pyke Koch and Jan Mankes are fine painters by any measure, their work beautifully made, intense in feeling and properly of its time. They are long overdue their place on a wider critical stage. But most remarkable of them all is Charley Toorop, daughter of Jan Toorop and an English mother, Annie Hall. Her sequence of self-portraits, some of monumental scale and as strong and simple in the statement as in the vision, surely mark her out as one of the most important, albeit hardly rated, female artists of her time. 'La beaute exacte: de van Gogh a Mondrian'. Musee d'Art moderne de la Ville de Paris, 11 avenue du President-Wilson, Paris 16, until July 17.</p>

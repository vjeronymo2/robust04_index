This is how Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski  summed up the discussion on Partnership for Peace at Monday's  government meeting, which preceded the Prague summit of the  Visegrad Group.    Olechowski said that the Council of Ministers "welcomed the  Partnership for Peace as an interesting initiative that goes in  the right direction" and authorized the prime minister to  support this program.    The government assessed the decisions that are expected from  the Brussels NATO summit (reassurance concerning the U.S.  presence in Europe, the opening of NATO to new members in an  evolutionary process, Partnership for Peace, and a definition of  new relations between NATO and the Western European Union) as  favorable from the point of view of Poland's interests, but it  has reservations because they are not specific enough.    President Lech Walesa, who took part in the meeting, left  the  Office of the Council of Ministers without making any comment to  the press.</p>

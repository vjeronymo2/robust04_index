			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Economics: Money supply stays on target THE mid-month rush of UK statistics this week includes the October money supply figures. Few will be surprised to see the M4 broad measure fall well within the new target range, announced by the Chancellor in parliament last week. Target growth range for M4 - notes and coins in circulation and bank and building society deposits - will be 4-8 per cent. Conveniently, M4 grew by 5.1 per cent in the year to September, almost bang in the middle of the target range, and is forecast to drop to 4.85 per cent in the year to October. With inflationary pressures subdued, most economists say the upper limit of the target range is unlikely to be breached in the near term. It is more likely to drift to its lower limit. There is also important data on the US real economy. Figures for industrial production today should give President elect Bill Clinton a better idea of the scale of the task of rejuvenating the US economy. Other economic highlights and events follow. Figures in brackets come from MMS International, a financial information company, and are the median of independent analysts' forecasts.

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / BNL probe to subpoena CIA Iraq documents THE HOUSE banking committee yesterday voted to subpoena secret Iraqi-related documents from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other agencies of the US government, in a move that could considerably broaden the investigation of more than Dollars 5bn of unauthorised Iraqi loans made in the 1980s by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Subpoena power was awarded against all of the US branches of BNL. The committee said subpoena authority was also granted against Mr Christopher Drogoul, former BNL Atlanta branch manager. Mr Drogoul claimed last April that the US and Italian governments knew of the BNL loans, which helped to finance the nuclear and chemical weapons projects of Mr Saddam Hussein. The Bush administration has denied any knowledge of the illicit BNL loans. Mr Drogoul, who in June struck a surprise deal with the Department of Justice under which many fraud charges were dropped in return for his co-operating with prosecutors, will be called to testify by the committee in mid-September. His appearance in Congress will come just after he is sentenced by an Atlanta judge. The committee will also subpoena documents about BNL from the National Security Agency (NSA), the secretive electronic surveillance agency that is believed by congressional investigators to have intercepted many of the thousands of telexes between Baghdad and BNL Atlanta over a five-year period. 'This moves our BNL investigation on to a new plane,' said a spokesman for the committee which may also subpoena bank regulators in New York and Texas and at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>

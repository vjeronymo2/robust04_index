			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> BOY SET ALIGHT BY BULLY FIGHTS FOR LIFE  </P> <P> David Aupont spent his 12th birthday fighting for his life in a New York City  hospital after a bully allegedly beat him with a bat, tied him up, soaked him  with gasoline and set him afire in a garage because he refused to smoke crack.  While David couldn't celebrate, former President Ronald Reagan, the White House  and Mayor David N. Dinkins were among well-wishers who showered him with cards,  gifts, balloons, flowers and messages, a hospital spokeswoman said. A suspect  just a year older than David was arrested and charged in the attack.  </P></p>

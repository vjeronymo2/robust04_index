			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / People: Non-executive directors Sir Michael Quinlan, permanent under secretary at the ministry of defence until his retirement in April, has been appointed as a non-executive director to the board of Lloyds Bank from September. He is also set to join the board of Pilkington later this year, and is taking over as director of the Ditchley Foundation as well. The appointment of Sir Michael, a leading authority on nuclear deterrence, also ensures that when Sir Jeremy Morse, the UK clearing bank's formidably intellectual chairman, retires next year there will still be an Oxford double first in Classics on the board.</p>

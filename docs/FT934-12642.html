			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Legal battle launched over Isuzu imports IM GROUP, Britain's largest private motor-import business, is to serve a writ against General Motors and its Vauxhall subsidiary over their plans to take over import and distribution of Isuzu vehicles in the UK from January. Mr Bob Edmiston's IM, whose wholly owned Isuzu (UK) subsidiary has held the Isuzu franchise since 1987, declared its intention to serve the writ after Vauxhall's chairman, Mr Charles Golden, said Vauxhall would 'take up its right' to import Isuzu's four-wheel-drive Trooper model from January 1. IM's dispute with General Motors centres on its allegations that General Motors unlawfully sought to procure the termination of Isuzu (UK)'s contract to operate the franchise in the UK. IM originally filed a suit against General Motors in the US, but a US court ruled last month that any proceedings should be heard in the UK, and that General Motors should make available any documents and witnesses considered necessary. Specifically, it is seeking to retain its right to market the Isuzu Trooper four-wheel-drive vehicle, in spite of the contention of General Motors - which has a 37 per cent stake in Isuzu - that IM had agreed to relinquish the franchise at the end of this year. According to IM, Isuzu (UK) has also instructed lawyers in Japan to obtain an injunction from a Tokyo court preventing the termination of the concession by the Japanese company. Isuzu in Japan has refused to comment on the dispute. Under General Motors' plans, the Trooper will be sold through the Vauxhall cars network from the beginning of next year, badged as the Vauxhall Monterey. General Motors has been selling the vehicle through its Continental European dealer networks, where it is badged as an Opel, since early last year. Mr Golden insisted: 'Any litigation will not delay the launch of the Monterey.' But Mr Edmiston said: 'If General Motors and Vauxhall think they can now brush us aside and carry off the Trooper without a fight they are much mistaken.' In the meantime IM has been negotiating to obtain the concession for further four-wheel-drive vehicles and is understood to be close to a final agreement to import Korean-built Ssangyong vehicles to the UK from late next year. IM has already signed a letter of intent with Ssangyong, whose new off-road vehicle, the FJ, was unveiled at the recent Frankfurt motor show. The vehicles are powered by Mercedes-Benz engines and have been designed by a British designer. IM is also the importer of Japanese Subaru cars and until earlier this year held the import concession for Hyundai, Korea's largest carmaker. However in July it signed a deal with the Lex Service group giving Lex a a 50.1 per cent stake in Hyundai Car (UK), a new joint-venture company with IM which acquired an exclusive rolling three-year contract to import Hyundais from last month.</p>

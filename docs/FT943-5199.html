			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Reinsurance (5): A suspiciously long lull - London and Lloyd's For reinsurers, September brings the Rendezvous in Monte Carlo and the start of the North American hurricane season. Last year, however, proved relatively disaster free and against the background of harder reinsurance rates, much improved results for the 1993 year are already emerging, writes Lee Coppack. The UK's largest reinsurance company, Prudential subsidiary Mercantile &amp; General, transformed a loss of Pounds 143.5m on its general business in 1992, which pushed the whole company into loss in 1992, into a Pounds 6m profit in 1993 and an overall profit of Pounds 104m. For the first time since 1989, members of the London companies group, the London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA), enjoyed a positive cash flow during 1993 - this was the Pounds 549m by which members' premiums processed by LIRMA's processing bureau exceeded claims. To some extent the current situation mirrors the market conditions of the mid-1980s when underwriters took measures to improve deteriorating results. Better rates, together with a year, 1986, which was extraordinarily free of major losses, resulted in a surge of capital into the market. Lloyd's capacity doubled from Pounds 5bn in 1984 to Pounds 10bn in 1987. The effect of the resulting competition on rates and conditions was exacerbated by an unprecedented series of catastrophes. The results are well known, the repercussions still being felt. The spectre of profits slipping has already made its appearance. As Matthew Harding, the chairman of specialist reinsurance group Benfield, puts it: 'There hasn't been a disaster for five minutes, so people think there won't be another.' He believes that for the market to work insurance and reinsurance must retain a sizeable element of fortuity; premiums can only be a relatively small proportion of the potential exposures. Therefore, catastrophe risks which may remain clear for several years before a disaster strikes are particularly vulnerable to misplaced optimism. Competition certainly has returned in some classes, according to John Pelly, group managing director of UK and North American reinsurance at broker Willis Faber &amp; Dumas. For example, Bermuda companies anxious to avoid an accumulation of North American catastrophe risks want to write business from other parts of the world. But reductions have not been sweeping, he says. However, that does not mean that the spate of natural disasters partly responsible for the recent losses is necessarily over. Announcing the company's 1993 results, the chairman of Munich Re, Dr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler, commented: 'The insurance industry's exposure to large catastrophe losses was quickly demonstrated again by the Los Angeles earthquake on 17 January 1994 and the windstorm and flood damage in Germany that also occurred at the beginning of the year.' He added that there were 'no grounds for relaxing our efforts to determine and implement risk commensurate prices'. The problem for reinsurers is to determine and keep to such a price. Because of the nature of reinsurance, by the time it is clear that the rates charged were inadequate, competition may well already have depressed them further. The 10 years of reinsurance statistics published earlier this year by London Insurance and Reinsurance Market Association (LIRMA) reveal that, while in property business the claims picture is reasonably clear after two years, there can still be blips, and even without the complications of asbestos and environmental pollution, in long tail business the account may continue to develop over four or five years and the picture in marine may be more exaggerated. When rates look profitable, there are few real barriers to entry into the market. The shortage in capacity produced by insolvencies and withdrawals brought Dollars 5bn new capital into Bermuda in 1993, and an additional Pounds 2.1bn capacity into Lloyd's. However, other factors may help to slow the pace of competition. The benefits of increased rates and the relatively few insured catastrophe losses in 1993 are unlikely to last long enough to make up more than a small proportion of the funds which haemorrhaged from Lloyd's and the London market companies. Over four years Lloyd's has lost Pounds 6.9bn, including boosting reserves for past years. In 1991 and 1992 LIRMA members lost Pounds 1.4bn net on their reinsurance underwriting, and this does not include now those 13 groups which have become insolvent since 1990. So institutional investors from outside the industry are cautious. Interest rates are now significantly lower than they were in the mid 1980s which should make reinsurance less tempting as a cash flow machine, and economies recovering from recession are offering other investment prospects. The stock market performance of the Lloyd's investment trusts, initially sparkling, has been lacklustre since April and analysts question how much unsatisfied demand there is for corporate involvement in Lloyd's. 'We do not think a lot of new capital will be coming into Lloyd's corporate capital,' says Roman Cizdyn of Smith New Court, an experienced observer of the London insurance market. 'The launch of the trusts this year was probably unique, a once only opportunity.' The Lloyd's market board has just published an estimate of Pounds 10.3bn maximum for Lloyd's capacity in 1995, down from Pounds 10.9bn this year as names have to meet cash calls and a study from Smith New Court issued in August suggests the fall could be larger. Bermuda, now a major competitor, is estimated to have about Dollars 13.7 bn (Pounds 8.8 bn) in capital, excluding captives. A noticeable change in Lloyd's has been a fall in the proportion of its underwriting classed as reinsurance. According to figures collected by Lloyd's Planning Department, from a peak of 58.6 per cent of premiums including brokerage in 1991, reinsurance last year made up 49.6 per cent of the premiums processed through the market. One explanation has been that underwriters have seen greater opportunities in direct business. Between 1990 and last year, total direct business has risen by 39.3 per cent; reinsurance by only 9.1 per cent which, against the background of firmer reinsurance rates, suggests that Lloyd's share of the world reinsurance market is likely to have slipped. The fastest growing class in Lloyd's has been UK motor, which has more than doubled since 1990. Investment in Lloyd's will largely be affected by the success of its plans to create an authorised reinsurance company, NewCo, to take over the US liability risks, such as asbestos and environmental pollution, dating from the 1985 year and before. Lloyd's intends that NewCo should be up and running at December 31, 1995. This problem continues to plague the London market, particularly Lloyd's, because it has gone on so long. Half of Lloyd's loss of Pounds 2.048bn for 1991, the most recently closed underwriting year, was made up of increases in reserves for prior years of account, but its chairman, David Rowland, argues that Lloyd's is almost certainly better reserved than most of its competitors.' The latest estimate by respected rating agency A. M. Best puts the ultimate cost to the US insurance industry over the next 25 years of environmental and asbestos damages in the US at around Dollars 132bn, excluding any meaningful refund of Superfund. This amount is equal to 72 per cent of the industry's current capital and surplus. Yet US liability rates remain soft. What now seems a terrible burden to the London market may eventually provide a significant, competitive advantage, because adequately reserved insurers will be in a strong position if others are forced to raise prices to pay for old losses.

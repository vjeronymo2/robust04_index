			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / News Corp seeks Dollars 3bn and The Post MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation is seeking a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.10bn) revolving loan from a group of 30 to 40 international banks to help refinance outstanding debts at lower interest rates. Although terms of the deal, believed to have a maturity of more than five years, were not available, it is understood that Citibank of the US and Midland of the UK are among the lead banks involved. The Dollars 3bn refinancing is the latest step in the restructuring of News Corp's debt. In late 1990, News Corp was facing severe financial problems with debts of more than Dollars 7.6bn. News Corp was forced into lengthy negotiations with nearly 150 lending banks and after months of talks, it was agreed that about Dollars 7.6bn of debt would be restructured over three years. Separately, Mr Murdoch announced last night that he had signed an agreement with Mr Abe Hirschfeld, a New York car parks magnate, to transfer control of The New York Post, the bankrupt tabloid newspaper, to News Corp. The accord will depend upon the outcome of a joint application to be made this morning by the two before a New York bankruptcy judge. The deal was signed yesterday by Mr Murdoch, who lost an estimated Dollars 150m when he last owned the newspaper in 1988, following a meeting on Friday evening with Mr Hirschfeld, who has controlled The Post since March 12. The offer will involve Mr Murdoch providing operating capital and taking control of the paper for the next 60 days, pending the approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of a request to waive rules that normally prevent cross-ownership of both a newspaper and a television station in one city. If today's hearing goes well Mr Murdoch could obtain operating control of the newspaper from as early as tonight. . He already has the support of Mr Mario Cuomo, the New York governor, as well as the paper's editorial staff, creditors and managers - many of whom have been horrified at the behaviour of Mr Hirschfeld. Mr Murdoch's costs over the next 60 days may reach Dollars 8m and he would then have to provide a plan to bring The Post out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 'Although we are hopeful that we can successfully conclude these arrangements there remain very serious obstacles,' Mr Murdoch said last night.</p>

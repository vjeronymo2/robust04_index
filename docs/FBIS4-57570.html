			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ramon Escovar Salom, former prosecutor general  and current interior minister, said that the trial of former  President Carlos Andres Perez is an example for Latin America.  Escovar spoke at length with reporters after a Council of  Ministers meeting on 18 May. [passage omitted]    As Venezuelans we should be pleased that the country's  institutions behaved in the way they have, that it is possible  to try a president, that we can hold public officials  accountable for their actions, and that the Constitution is not  an insignificant book in practical life, but a set of rules that  have a bearing on the country's life. What has transpired is not  an act of revenge or persecution against a president, but the  result of formal charges filed by a prosecutor general and a  formal and concrete ruling by the CSJ [Supreme Court of Justice].    I have nothing more to add; I only want to urge people who  sympathize with the former president to act responsibly and to  spare the country from actions that might stem from an  accumulation of feelings of revenge and also spare the country  from the use of violence, because neither is in keeping with the  serenity shown by the institutions. Calls to settle accounts  with all those involved in this trial are absolutely  irreconcilable with the country's dignity and the strength of  Venezuelan democratic institutions. I want to talk to them  calmly, because apparently there are already voices that are  trying to distort the court ruling and this exemplary process  that the Venezuelan people have accepted as their own and that  democrats of Latin America and the world view as a reflection of  the strength of Venezuelan institutions.

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Observer: Running rings It would seem, as Observer reported last week, that the British Olympic Association's attempt to gain statutory protection for its use of the Olympic rings follows on from the 'success' of its counterpart in the US. Despite a law being passed in 1978 which gave the US Olympic Committee exclusive rights to the logo, it has been something of a marathon task to police it. One of the latest targets ordered to cease-and-desist was one Spiros Nakos, long-time owner of the Olympic diner in Manhattan. Locals drew up a petition in his support and two regular customers who just happen to be attorneys offered their services free. Now, after two weeks of intense negotiation, Nakos has taken down his interlocking rings but has kept the name. In the bruised corner, the USOC emphasises it has not given Nakos 'permission' to use the O-word and reserves the right to take action at a later date. It maintains that Nakos's 10-table establishment infringes the sponsor rights of McDonald's, which paid more than Dollars 40m to provide the official trough.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has announced  in Montevideo that Uruguay is willing to negotiate [a no  congelar] Havana's debt with Uruguay and to seek a solution that  is favorable for both countries. Robaina made these statements  minutes after his meeting with Enrique Braga, director of  Uruguay's central bank.    Robaina met earlier with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto  Lacalle, with whom he exchanged ideas on, among other issues,  the upcoming Ibero-American Summit scheduled to be held in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia; the changes being made in certain  areas of the Cuban economy; and preparations for the conference  entitled "The Nation and the Emigre Community" scheduled to be  held in Havana this month.    Robaina's agenda included meetings with General Liber  Seregni  Mosquera, president of the Uruguayan Broad Front; a very  interesting meeting with the foreign relations committee of the  Uruguayan Parliament, where Robaina explained our country's true  situation; and meetings with Uruguayan intellectuals and Cubans  residing in Montevideo.    Robaina's agenda for today includes talks between foreign  ministries, a meeting with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio  Abreu, and contacts with several Montevideo television networks  and Uruguay's most important newspapers.</p>

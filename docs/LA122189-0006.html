			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TUNA BOAT DAMAGED IN PANAMA CANAL EXPLOSION; CREW UNHARMED  </P> <P> Crew members on two San Diego-based tuna boats that were docked in Panamanian  waters escaped injury early Wednesday morning when an explosion, reportedly set  by U.S. Navy commandos, hit a nearby Panamanian patrol boat.  </P> <P> One of the tuna boats sustained damage in the 1 a.m. explosion that rocked the  Balboa section of the Panama Canal near Panama City, said August Felando,  president of the San Diego-based American Tunaboat Assn.  </P> <P> Damage to the Samoa Star's hull was first described as "significant," said  Felando, who talked to the crew by telephone Wednesday. However, during a  subsequent telephone call, crew members described the damage as "nothing to be  alarmed about," he said.  </P> <P> Crew members on the Samoa Star and the Odette Therese, which was docked nearby,  "are OK. . . . They feel very secure now," Felando said.  </P> <P> Ben Maughan of San Diego is skipper of the Samoa Star. Anthony Virissimo, also  of San Diego, commands the Odette Therese, Felando said. He did not know how  many San Diegans are on the vessels, which generally carry a crew of 20.  </P> <P> The crews heard "an explosion at about 1 a.m. local time on Wednesday," Felando  said. "It was assumed that it was a Navy SEAL team that caused the explosion,  sinking the Panamanian patrol vessel," Felando said.  </P> <P> Crew members told Felando that Panamanian sailors had spent the previous two  days "putting gun mounts on the patrol vessel." The crews did not know if  Panamanian sailors were killed in the explosion, Felando said.  </P> <P> Col. Douglas Coffey of the U.S. Special Operations Command, which oversees  SEALs and other special combat units, acknowledged that special forces are  operating in Panama. But he declined to comment on whether U.S. Navy SEALs were  involved in the apparent sinking of the Panamanian boat.  </P> <P> "I don't have any special information about damage to the tuna boat," Coffey  said. "I have no way of knowing at this point what the circumstances are."  </P> <P> The crews, who have been ordered to remain on their boats, feel "very secure"  because U.S. soldiers are stationed nearby, Felando said. The Army has parked a  tank next to the Samoa Star, and a Navy vessel is anchored nearby.  </P> <P> The crews were "very proud of the way in which the U.S. military handled  things," Felando said. The Samoa Star crew was "providing cakes, coffee and  sandwiches" to military personnel, Felando said.  </P> <P> The tuna boats docked in Panama several days ago for minor repairs and to take  on supplies. A third ship, the Connie Jean, left Panama on Tuesday, Felando  said.  </P> <P> The Samoa Star, owned by the Sousa family of San Diego, and the Odette Therese,  owned by the Virissimo family, also of San Diego, are about 220 feet long.  </P> <P> U.S.-based tuna boats regularly travel the canal from fishing grounds in the  Pacific to canneries in Puerto Rico.  </P> <P> The last cannery in San Diego closed in 1984, and only one West Coast cannery  -- in San Pedro -- remains in operation. "This is one of the times that  Americans could end up missing those canneries," Felando said.  </P> <P> The ships were returning to the Pacific from Puerto Rico, Felando said.  </P> <P> Wednesday's military action closed the Panama Canal for the first time in 75  years. Any prolonged closing of the canal could affect several San Diego-based  boats that are now unloading their catch in Puerto Rico, Felando said.  </P> <P> Some of those boats "were trying to come home for the holidays," Felando said.  They will evidently remain in Puerto Rico until they can "safely complete"  transit through the canal, Felando said.  </P> <P> Felando was unable to contact the tuna-boat skippers late Wednesday because "we  can't call them. We're dependent upon them calling us from shore."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Nora Zamichow contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family: Irish Life's third growth issue Irish Life has launched a third issue of its guaranteed growth account. For those investing between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 24,999, this guarantees to return a minimum 108 per cent of the original investment after five years; anyone investing over Pounds 25,000 gets a pledge of a minimum 112 per cent. The money goes into the company's managed fund and performance will depend on the success of Irish Life's managers; there is no linking to a particular stock market index. Withdrawals can be made during the five-year period but the guarantee will not apply to funds withdrawn.</p>

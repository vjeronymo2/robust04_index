			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONKEYS OF GIBRALTAR  </P> <P> The Rock is a legend.  </P> <P> Tarry a few hours or a few days and you will get a royal greeting from what may  be the world's most unusual reception. A committee of golden-brown macaque  monkeys, which are known as the "apes of Gibraltar."  </P> <P> As the only simians still roaming wild in Europe, Gibraltar's beloved mascots  live among the gun emplacements in two separate packs on top of the windy  limestone heights of the Rock (altitude: 1,400 feet).  </P> <P> Friendly and playful by nature, the no-tail monkeys love tourists. Visitors  feed them chocolates, candies, nuts, fruits and ice cream cones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pose for Camera  </P> <P> For half of a banana, you will always find one furry animal who'll give you a  handshake or pose for camera shots.  </P> <P> The monkeys are such big hits that one New York City tourist has been sending  them packages of peanuts for many years.  </P> <P> Several universities have dispatched research teams to Gibraltar to find out  more about the monkeys, a type of social animal that lives in family and  community units.  </P> <P> Weighing about 60 pounds at maturity, most of them live to 15 years. Also, no  scientist has yet been able to find out what happens to a dead monkey, since no  one has ever found a body or a skeleton in the 1,000 years of monkey life on  the Rock.  </P> <P> Numbering about 40, the monkeys can be reached by cable car up the west slope,  a rather scary ride that nevertheless offers a stunning panorama of the bay and  the Spanish town of Algeciras.  </P> <P> If you wait until 4 p.m., the animals will come down from their heights to a  lower perch (reachable by taxi) for their daily feeding (provided by the  British Army with an allowance of 15 pence per head per day).  </P> <P> They are fed the usual ration of bananas (which contain hidden vitamin pills),  oatmeal, sweet potatoes and green vegetables. This supplements the wild  berries, roots, seeds and insects that the monkeys eat on their own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manners Are Bad  </P> <P> However, the monkeys -- supposedly pals of humans -- are easily upset by quick  movements or sudden noises.  </P> <P> They also have bad manners. If they see something they want, they'll grab it.  Just ask somebody who has tried to feed them peanuts one at a time only to have  the bag rudely snatched away.  </P> <P> There was one monkey, a female, who stole mirrors and took them to her lair,  where she spent time admiring herself before smashing them to pieces.  </P> <P> During the height of the tourist season, when about 300,000 people visit, the  monkeys also have been known to filch a purse or two and to run off with a  camera.  </P> <P> But don't strike back. Anyone who molests a Gibraltar monkey faces a prison  term or a fine, for the Macaca sylvana species enjoys the protection of the  British government through a special keeper, a sergeant-at-arms whose  responsibility it is to see that they are nurtured and kept in good health.  </P> <P> This latter responsibility includes giving the monkeys whiskey when they catch  colds -- a most delicate maneuver since the frolicsome animals can't be  corraled so easily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Churchill Paid Visit  </P> <P> Even Winston Churchill, though beset in 1944 with crises on all fronts, engaged  in some important monkey business at the Rock.  </P> <P> While on his way to the Tehran Conference, Winnie stopped at the bastion (2 1/4  square miles in area) to see how the frisky quadrupeds were getting along.  </P> <P> Shocked to hear that their numbers had dwindled to under 10, he let it be known  that the survival of the apes of Gibraltar was a matter of concern to the Prime  Minister and that their number thereafter was to be kept above 24.  </P> <P> There's a saying among Gibraltar's 30,000 inhabitants (most of whom are British  subjects), that if the monkeys ever disappear, then the British will also go  away. Thus, whenever a baby simian is born, the army records the birth with a  flourish befitting the glory of the British Empire.  </P> <P> The Barbary monkey is so held in esteem by British officialdom that when the  first decimal coin -- in the denomination of 25 new pence -- was put out in  1971, it contained a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II and Gibraltar's monkey on  the reverse side.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Many cruise lines stop at Gibraltar as a port of call. British Airways has  flights from London (it takes about two hours). From Madrid there is a weekly  flight on British Airways.  </P> <P> The expensive Rock Hotel has 160 rooms, with balconies that overlook the sea,  most with private bath. The Caleta Palace Hotel, with 200 rooms, stands on a  cliff overhanging the village of Catalan Bay. Also expensive. The Montarik  Hotel (87 rooms) has a sun terrace with a fine view of sea and sunsets and is  less expensive.  </P> <P> As for restaurants, La Bayuca, Spanish specialties; Winston's, English fare,  and the Mermaid, seafood, are excellent, though pricey.  </P></p>

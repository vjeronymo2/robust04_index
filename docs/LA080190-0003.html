			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRINIDAD REBELS FREE PREMIER; 40 STILL HOSTAGES  </P> <P> Captive Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson, suffering a festering leg wound and  imperiled eyesight, was released by black Muslim rebels Tuesday, but 40 other  hostages were still being held as efforts to free them dragged into a fifth day  without progress.  </P> <P> The ailing prime minister was led to an ambulance in front of Red House, the  twin-island nation's besieged Parliament building, by one of his captors and  another hostage, according to Atty. Gen. Anthony Smart, a senior member of the  Cabinet team that has been negotiating with the rebels via radio, telephone and  a clergyman intermediary.  </P> <P> Robinson was taken first to the Trinidadian army's Camp Ogden, then to an  unidentified hospital, Smart said.  </P> <P> He said Robinson "is in good spirits," but he is reported to be suffering from  an apparently infected gunshot wound in one leg. Robinson also reportedly is  experiencing eye problems resulting from his lack of glaucoma medication since  the Parliament building was seized by the rebels in a coup attempt Friday  evening.  </P> <P> Smart refused to give details of the talks that led to Robinson's freedom, but  he indicated that the release did not represent a breakthrough in the overall  hostage negotiations, which ran aground after near-agreement Monday. A  government spokesman, Gregory Shaw, said the hostage takers' "demands are  escalating, and some of the demands are clearly impossible to meet."  </P> <P> "This crisis is far from over," Smart declared.  </P> <P> The first hint of the surprise development Tuesday came in an early morning  telephone conversation between the leader of the rebels and journalists.  Speaking from the besieged Trinidad and Tobago Television (TTT) building, the  chief hostage taker, Yasin abu Bakr, offered to release Robinson on  humanitarian grounds, with no strings attached, "because he is sick."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Abu Bakr virtually bombarded local and foreign reporters with phone  calls to the government's temporary press headquarters in the Holiday Inn  Hotel, a few blocks from Red House. The calls revealed a growing tone of  desperation among his estimated 120 armed comrades and at least some captives.  </P> <P> Among other things, Abu Bakr charged that a coterie of Cabinet ministers had  torpedoed a signed agreement to end the crisis, which he contended was reached  Saturday.  </P> <P> "They have now pulled a new coup, and they are holding everyone ransom," Abu  Bakr cried in an anxious, angry voice during one call several hours before  Robinson's release. "They are blocking it because they want Mr. Robinson dead."  </P> <P> The agreement was not spelled out by Abu Bakr or government officials, but it  reportedly included Robinson's pledge to resign; formation of an interim  government including Abu Bakr, and total amnesty for the rebels, who are  believed to have received military training and financial support from Libya.  </P> <P> The 48-year-old former police officer, who founded the black Muslim group  Jamaat al Muslimeen six years ago, called for former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter and the Rev. Jesse Jackson to come to Trinidad so he would have someone  "straightforward" to talk to.  </P> <P> In another call to journalists, Abu Bakr complained that the police and army  troops who have surrounded the two hostage sites are trying to starve his group  into submission. He charged that the army ignored his calls for food and water  until 3 a.m. Sunday, when they placed provisions in the street in front of the  television building and dared the hostage takers to come out for them.  </P> <P> The Trinidad and Tobago Defense Force also had tried to split the hostage  takers by cutting off all lines of communication between the television  buildings, where 25 of the captives are held, and Red House, where 15 remain at  gunpoint, Abu Bakr contended.  </P> <P> The Defense Forces spokesman, Maj. Dave Williams, acknowledged that all lines  to the two buildings have been cut and expressed astonishment that the rebel  leader had secured a phone line to the press hotel. Abu Bakr explained that he  had "a genius" in his group who engineered the calls.  </P> <P> Two of the hostages, television news director Jones P. Madeira and reporter  Raul Pantin, seconded Abu Bakr's agitated complaints when he passed the  telephone to them.  </P> <P> "When I spoke to the army yesterday afternoon, I said, 'Everybody's dying of  starvation in here,' " Madeira recalled Tuesday. "What are they trying to do,  get me killed?"  </P> <P> "Our lives are threatened here, but not by the imam," said Pantin, using Abu  Bakr's title as an Islamic religious leader.  </P> <P> When a reporter asked Abu Bakr if he is fearful of the outcome of the siege, he  replied only: "Everyone will die at some time in their lives."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Charles A. Gargano provided some insight into the  situation for five American journalists who visited the American Embassy on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Describing his own contacts with the Trinidad and Tobago government concerning  the crisis, Gargano said, "The last communication we had with the government  (early Tuesday) is that they are still discussing the situation, and it has  been going up and down." He expressed hope that a peaceful solution would be  found.  </P> <P> Although declining to provide details of his conversations with local  officials, Gargano said the Americans already are "looking at programs where we  might be able to assist with such things as emergency food shipments."  </P> <P> After a weekend of widespread looting, virtually all supermarkets and food  shops in Port of Spain have been stripped bare, and a severe food shortage has  developed.  </P></p>

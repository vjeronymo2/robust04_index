			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / More charities submit accounts NEARLY half of Britain's registered charities submitted accounts to the Charity Commission last year in response to its drive to improve administration of the sector. The commission said yesterday that 46 per cent of registered charities submitted accounts last year compared with only 11 per cent in 1989. Under the new Charities Act, financial controls will be strengthened and the commission believes a target of obtaining accounts from 80 per cent to 90 per cent of charities can be achieved by 1994. The commission said in its annual report that at the end of last year there were 166,503 charities on its database, and that 1,168 inactive organisations were removed from it. The number of new charities registering last year was 4,042. The commission concluded 397 inquiries into charities last year as a result of public complaints and its own monitoring, and irregularities were discovered in 129 cases. Maladministration was the most common problem, covering 40 per cent of cases. But 10 per cent involved fund-raising abuse and 3 per cent involved charities engaging in political activities. The new changes in the law will add to the responsibilities of charity trustees. The report says the commissioners have decided that there is no objection to trustees being insured for personal liability at their charity's expense for acts 'either properly undertaken or undertaken in breach of trust but under an honest mistake'. The report says the commissioners were asked by the Law Society whether it would be appropriate for solicitors employed by charities to draft wills of prospective benefactors. The commissioners say drafting of wills is unlikely to be a proper activity. 1991 Report of the Charity Commissioners. HMSO. Pounds 8.75</p>

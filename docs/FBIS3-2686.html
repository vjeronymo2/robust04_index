			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Zhao Wei (6392 5898) and Zhang Sutang </F> (1728 1372 1016)]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Second Session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] officially opened in  Beijing on 10 March. Observant people have noticed that this  year's NPC session had been moved up five days from last year's.    The opening date of the annual NPC session has been moved up  for several years in a row. According to Zhou Chengkui,  spokesman for the NPC Standing Committee's General Office, this  reflects the continuous improvement of the people's congress  system.    During an interview, Zhou Chengkui said: The first session  of the eighth NPC was held seven days earlier than the seventh  NPC, and the opening date of the current session was advanced  five days from that of last year. If possible, the opening date  may be moved up progressively in the future.    It is understood our country's fiscal year coincides with  the  calendar year, commencing on 1 January and ending on 31  December. According to our country's legally prescribed  procedures, the government implements the state's annual budget  only after the NPC has examined and approved it. In the past,  if the NPC session was held in March or April, it would be  considered early. Under such circumstances, budget plans were  implemented long before they were approved.    Zhou Chengkui stated: To redress this situation, the NPC  Standing Committee decided to move up the NPC session  progressively, following a period of deliberations and  preparations and against the backdrop of the country's gradual  standardization and modernization of its statistical work and  other endeavors. The decision was aimed at achieving an ideal  date for the session--holding the NPC session in January of each  year. He explained: We have to go through a certain process  before attaining this goal. One of the reasons is that it is  still quite difficult, due to technical and other reasons, to  complete the compilation of statistics on the previous year's  national economic performance by January of each year.    Chengkui added: This problem will be solved in a  step-by-step manner after the market economic system has been  established, and as the method of compiling statistics becomes  increasingly modern. Also, our country's statistical work will  become more perfect if the opening date of the NPC session is  gradually moved up.    These correspondents were advised of the growing  institutionalization, standardization, and codification of the  NPC system in recent years. This point is corroborated by the  formulation and implementation of the rules of procedure for the  NPC Standing Committee and for the NPC, by the annual briefings  given by relevant State Council departments to the NPC Standing  Committee on issues of public concern, and by supervisory  efforts in the wake of the implementation of various laws.  Constantly moving up the NPC session also symbolizes the  improvement and refinement of this system.</p>

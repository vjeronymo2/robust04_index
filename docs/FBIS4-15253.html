			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Stepanov report: "The Deputies Have Found a Field </F> of Miracles (reference to a popular TV quiz program of the same  name). Now They Only Have To Find the Fools"]    [Text] Some citizens think in vain that they can escape  the consequences of the deputies' activity in their homes. The  State Duma has already decided on a master plan to stir the  Fatherland. A law has been drafted whereby the deputies and  their brothers from the upper chamber of parliament can stay on  TV screens practically for an unlimited time.    This draft can satisfy the most fastidious deputies' tastes.  For instance, it forbids news programs (ITA, Vesti, Inform-TV)  to comment on events that have happened in the upper echelons of  power. News bulletins, regardless of their duration, must  contain information about absolutely all developments in the  three branches of state power (Articles 6 and 7). But this is  not all: Article 9 defines who a news or other (!) program  journalist may interview, as well as the minimum length of a  parliamentary report in TV news broadcasts.    Yet this part of the brilliant document contains one obvious  slip: It does not specify which questions journalists may put  to their interlocutors. The draft contains numerous  absurdities; for instance, presidential statements may be  broadcast only with the permission of unspecified "federal power  bodies" (Article 6, Section 2), while the responsibility for  disseminating statements by top statesmen is imposed on  journalists. Although experience shows that this process rather  depends on the mood of communication workers, power supply  operators, and so forth.    If the draft comprised only the above, it could be taken for  a toast because its main essence boils down to the fact that  journalists must provide still better coverage of what they are  covering already. Nonetheless, the draft includes two more  types of articles.    The press must be delighted with the provisions of Article  4,  Section 1, promising to wrest ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA from Viktor Chernomyrdin's control and launch them along  the waves of the free market. In addition, the draft promises  that no officials will be exerting pressure on correspondents,  and audio and video recordings may be made wherever permitted by  accreditation rules.    The president, by the authors' logic, should gratefully  support the draft because the deputies, in corresponding  articles, make believe that they are equally concerned about all  the branches of power. A careful comparison of the "powers,"  however, fatefully proves to be not in favor of the head of  state. Under the draft, acts of amnesty adopted by the lower  chamber of parliament or laws passed by both chambers are  subject to immediate promulgation. As for the president's  signing a federal law (whereupon a legislative act comes into  force), an edict, or an act of pardon, or presentation of  Russian Federation state awards, and so forth, this should not  be announced to the citizens. Incidentally, the same kind of  treatment has been meted out to the judicial branch. To top it  all: even the mention of the president has been expunged from  an article on obligatory analytical programs which, by the way,  are to be inserted into the broadcasting schedule only at the  discretion of the parliamentary press service. But this must be  for considerations of economy.    And finally, yet another peculiarity. The draft speaks in  detail about the various types of regular programs on Ostankino,  Russian, and St. Petersburg TV in which deputies will appear in  groups or alone. These articles provide for everything except  the source of financing and, most important, the total air time  limit that the deputies may claim without cost.</p>

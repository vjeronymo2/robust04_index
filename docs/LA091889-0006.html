			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERIC WHO? RAMS TAKE TO THE AIR, RIP COLTS, 31-17  </P> <P> The real star of Sunday's game, Henry Ellard, stood on his tiptoes and tried to  get a peek at him. A nod would have been fine. Ellard leaned over the backs of  reporters who crowded the losing team's running back at the 15-yard line.  </P> <P> Showing some of the moves he used against the Indianapolis Colts for 12  receptions, 230 yards and three touchdowns, Ellard found an opening, slipped  between two cameramen and touched the runner's fingertips.  </P> <P> It was some scene, watching Eric Dickerson leave the arena.  </P> <P> The game went to the Rams, 31-17, before 63,995 at Anaheim Stadium. But one  moment was Dickerson's. In the context of the game he was a footnote, rushing  for 116 yards in what turned out to be a quarterback shoot-out.  </P> <P> In the context of the week and the final scene, Dickerson remained at center  stage.  </P> <P> As the final gun sounded, several Rams dropped their scowls and surrounded  Dickerson near the northern end zone, hugging him openly as their own fans  jeered Dickerson from the stands.  </P> <P> "We just wanted to let Eric know that, no matter what, you're our friend," Ram  cornerback Jerry Gray said. "He gave the Rams the best years he had. And he's  still a friend of ours."  </P> <P> Cameras and reporters followed Dickerson off the field. As the boos grew  louder, Dickerson hoisted his helmet in the air. As he lowered himself into the  visitors' tunnel, the crowd above littered him with play money.  </P> <P> "It should have been real money," Dickerson said. "We would have stopped to  pick it up."  </P> <P> In the end, Dickerson would have only changed the final score. For lost in his  return was a show of offensive power from the Rams, who amassed 449 total yards  against a defense that never quite got the message.  </P> <P> The Colts guessed wrongly that the road to victory would begin with all feet  running toward Ram quarterback Jim Everett. The Colts blitzed Everett  relentlessly and didn't seem to mind that he was tearing through their  secondary and the Ram record book.  </P> <P> The Colts stubbornly insisted on playing wide receiver Ellard with single  coverage, using tag-team cornerbacks Chris Goode, Eugene Daniel and John  Baylor.  </P> <P> "They had four different guys on him," Everett said. "But only one at a time.  That was the key."  </P> <P> Ellard had 112 receiving yards and two touchdowns at the half. Everett had  thrown for 200 yards in two quarters.  </P> <P> Still, the score was 17-17, so the Colts decided not to change the game plan at  halftime. Big mistake.  </P> <P> The Rams dominated the second half. Ellard's 230 total receiving yards were the  third-highest total in Ram history. Everett completed 28 of 35 passes for 368  yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Everett, who completed his final eight passes to close out the first half,  continued his streak into the third quarter, when he drove the Rams 77 yards  for what turned out to be the winning touchdown, a six-yard pass to Ellard.  </P> <P> Everett set up the score by connecting on passes of 21 and 30 yards to Ellard.  Would the Colts ever learn?  </P> <P> "They had Henry Ellard in single coverage," Everett said. "I don't think you  can do that with him."  </P> <P> You can't. Ask the Colts.  </P> <P> "We tried to take as much away from them as possible," Colt Coach Ron Meyer  said. "We tried to put pressure on Everett. But they were just very good  today."  </P> <P> Everett ran his consecutive completion streak to 12 with the touchdown pass and  stretched the streak to 14, breaking the club record of 13 by Pat Haden. The  streak was broken when receiver Flipper Anderson dropped what should have been  a 67-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> Everett said it was like playing catch, especially with Ellard, who was nothing  short of unstoppable.  </P> <P> "You almost can't wait till the next play," Ellard said. "Especially when it's  a pass route. You can't wait to get your hands on the ball."  </P> <P> Everett's only mistake almost turned out to be disastrous. The Rams had  first-and-goal at the four-yard line early in the fourth quarter when an  Everett swing pass intended for Damone Johnson was intercepted in the flat by  Michael Ball, who might have gone 90 yards for the tying score had Johnson not  wrapped him up from behind.  </P> <P> But the Rams escaped unscathed. Then they extended the lead on Greg Bell's  two-yard scoring run with 1:34 left. And the celebration began. They flashed  Dickerson's picture on the big screen and the crowd loved it. They flashed a  banner shortly before Bell's leap into the end zone: Dickerson, that name rings  a Bell.  </P> <P> The fans whooped and hollered, far more than usual for an Anaheim Stadium  crowd.  </P> <P> "They were into it pretty good," Ram defensive end Doug Reed said.  </P> <P> "It'd be nice if they could keep it up."  </P> <P> Of course, it's not every day that Dickerson comes back to town.  </P> <P> On his first carry, Dickerson ran into his old friend Reed, who offered a quick  hello before wrestling his buddy for a three-yard loss. Dickerson would have  his moments, although his return became somewhat muddled as the arms race  between quarterbacks Everett and Chandler escalated.  </P> <P> Chandler completed 20 of 33 passes for 266 yards in the game, but didn't reach  the end zone in the second half when it mattered.  </P> <P> Everett started the shoot-out late in the first quarter when he broke a 3-3 tie  by driving the Rams 79 yards on four plays, finishing off the series with a  29-yard scoring pass to Ellard, who had beaten Goode over the middle. Ellard  beating Goode would become a familiar theme.  </P> <P> The Colts blitzed Everett on all four plays, later wishing they hadn't.  </P> <P> While the Rams dogged Dickerson's every move, it was Chandler who cut up their  secondary, hitting the speedy Clarence Verdin in stride for an 82-yard scoring  pass to open the second quarter. That tied it, 10-10.  </P> <P> The Colts took the lead, 17-10, with 7:52 left in the half on a two-yard  Dickerson run, capping a 10-play, 50-yard drive.  </P> <P> Everett responded with the drive of the half, a 90-play march that consumed  6:22 on the clock and led to a 17-yard scoring pass to Ellard with 1:30 left.  Everett was masterful on the drive, completing eight consecutive passes for 78  yards, including a fourth-down, 11-yard toss to Ellard to the Colt 27.  </P> <P> Everett was 15 for 18 in the half for 209 yards and two touchdowns. Chandler  threw for 170 yards.  </P> <P> Dickerson rushed for 69 yards in 14 carries in the half, dispelling any myths  about the Ram defense shutting him down completely.  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson, who is glad to have this game out of the way,  afterward tried to patch things up with his former star runner.  </P> <P> "I think Eric Dickerson is the best runner I've ever seen," he said. "I used to  think that. I still do. I want to put to bed some of the second-rate things  that can go on."  </P> <P> Dickerson was appreciative.  </P> <P> "It's a compliment," he said. "I've had other compliments, but thank John for  that."  </P> <P> There were never many hard feelings among Dickerson and his Ram teammates.  </P> <P> "He's good friends with a lot of guys on this football team," veteran tackle  Jackie Slater said. "Him leaving was something we'd rather not have had  happen."  </P> <P> But it happened. And that's what made Sunday's game so difficult.  </P> <P> "We didn't know whether to slam him down or kiss him," Reed said of Dickerson.  "So we did a little of both."  </P> <P> </P> <P> EVERETT'S STREAK  </P> <P> A breakdown of Jim Everett's 14 consecutive completions against Indianapolis.  </P> <P> SECOND QUARTER  </P> <P> 1.

Jim Everett's team record of 14 consecutive passes was eight short  of tying the league record of 22, held by San Francisco quarterback Joe  Montana. . . . Sunday's game fell 2,353 tickets short of a sellout. . . .  Tailback Greg Bell finished with 68 yards in 22 carries. . . . Flipper Anderson  had three catches for 79 yards.  </P> <P> * CATCH THIS PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Everything added up for Henry Ellard, who had one of the best games of his  career.

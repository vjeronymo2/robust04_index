			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Statoil improves to NKr2.7bn Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, saw net profits rise to NKr2.7bn (Dollars 380m) from NKr1.9bn in the first half, driven by higher net financial revenues and a modest rise in operating profits. Oil prices were lower than a year ago, averaging NKr110 per barrel, compared with NKr126, and refinery margins were down sharply. But the group's North Sea oil production reached a record 441,000 barrels a day  - up from 412,000  -and gas volumes and prices were both higher. Statoil said it needed to continue cutting costs to improve results further. 'Although oil prices have risen recently, uncertainty persists about future price developments and the exchange rate for the US dollar,' it stated. It expects to maintain high oil production levels during the second half. Operating revenues climbed to NKr41.4bn from NKr40.2bn, with operating profits NKr300m higher at NKr7bn. Operating profits within exploration and production fell NKr1.1bn to NKr3.9bn, partially offset by a NKr670m increase to NKr2.3bn in natural gas. Oil trading and shipping profits rose to NKr649m from NKr308m. Net financial revenues rose to NKr1.5bn from NKr26m, due mainly to unrealised currency gains.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Russian U.N.  Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov today questioned NATO's decision to  establish "military exclusion zones" around the Bosnian towns of  Bihac, Srebrenica, Tuzla or Zepa if they were attacked.    "The reply goes beyond the request" of U.N.  Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali for air strike threats around Gorazde,  Vorontsov told reporters after an informal Security Council  session, which he required to convene, on possible NATO air  strikes and the current situation around Gorazde.    He said his country was "in full agreement" with the U.N.  chief's request to NATO. "We are of the opinion that the human  tragedy at Gorazde should be stopped and if it cannot be stopped  by political means it should be stopped by other means."    But he said there are some elements in NATO's decision that  the U.N. chief did not request. There are some paragraphs of  threat of "striking the infrastructure, striking all kinds of  important economic areas. We do not understand why it is  needed," he said.    According to NATO's North Atlantic Council decisions on  Friday [22 April], "If any Bosnian Serb attacks involving heavy  weapons are carried out on the U.N.-designated safe areas...  [ellipses as received] These weapons and other Bosnian Serb  military assets, as well as their direct and essential military  support facilities, including but not limited to fuel  installations and munitions sites, will be subject to NATO air  strikes... [ellipses as received]"    The Russian ambassador said the Security Council would  continue to discuss the Bosnian problem on Monday.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Fashion: . . .with a hint of tasteful deconstruction - Fashion has been invaded by the sociologist. No wonder younger, brighter designers have become self-conscious Designers tend to have an identity problem. Are they artist or artisan? Are they truly creative, their work an illuminating commentary on humanity in general and its current condition, struggles and preoccupations in particular? Or are they strangers to the world of ideas, mere makers of ultimately inconsequential practical things which may well be beautiful but are hardly important? When the spring merchandise is delivered to the shops this month it will become obvious that this confusion particularly afflicts fashion designers. Nor is it restricted to what goes on in their heads; it is made manifest in their work. For fashion itself seems confused, unsure of the direction it wants to take. It is almost as if some designers have decided they are artisans, some aspire to art and some are reaffirming the truth: they are an exceptional and valuable hybrid. Archaeologists and historians will insist that the work of the artisan is just as important as that of the artist when it comes to understanding a dead culture but that is cold comfort for the modern designer who, training alongside fine artists, rarely manages to graduate without a sense of being on the second team. The fashion designer is particularly vulnerable to intimations of inferiority. Unlike the architect, the goldsmith or the cabinet-maker, the dress designer's pedigree is exceedingly short. Until the end of the last century, the makers of clothes were obscure, more interpreters of the whims and vanities of their clients (a very small, very rich elite) than creators in their own right. Yet few artefacts are capable of shedding brighter light on a society than the clothes it wore. Over the last two decades dress has become a hot and crowded area of study. No longer the private fief of a few art historians, it has been invaded by sociologists, semioticians, the occasional novelist and fashion journalists. A profession which once merely described is now given to instant analysis of the social and political implications of the swings of fashion. It is little wonder then that the younger, brighter fashion designers have become self-conscious. Instead of instinctively reacting to the mood of the times, they employ their intellects and use their work to embody ideas, theories, critiques. They function as artists are supposed to. For some time these designers - Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Rei Kawakubo, Yohji Yamamoto, Marcel Marongiu, Ann Demeulemeester, Jean Colonna and Koji Tatsuno - have been practising their own version of deconstruction. Essentially, this involves taking recognisable shapes, styles, fabrics and motifs from history and re-ordering them so that their associations and social meanings are both utilised (what were grunge frocks but the hard-worn, ill-fitting hand-me-downs of the great depression?) and undermined (unbuttoned over jeans or leggings, the frock is a victim's badge worn ironically). For spring Westwood, the movement's heroine who is exploring traditional ideas of elegance and the ability of a garment's engineering to reshape the body, sculpts taffeta into rococo bodices and late Victorian crinolines and puts a gigantic, silly and beautiful net and straw petticoat beneath it while asking her models to teeter on 7in platform soles. The wearer becomes a doll, but a very imposing doll. Many of the Deconstructionists go a step further and literally expose the structure of a garment, turning it inside out, taking a conventional garment apart and putting it back together so that the proportions are subtly wrong, the layers disconcertingly untidy, the fabrics twisted, scrunched and bedraggled. In doing this, they claim, they have developed a new aesthetic which aspires to supplant the ideals of harmony, perfection, neatness, richness and newness which they regard as bourgeois, banal and inappropriate. Left simmering on the back burner are the artisans, the fashion designers who are still operating in the tradition of the couturiers, making expensive-looking clothes for conventionally minded women who wish to look glamorous in a way which the men in their life will understand. They still operate instinctively so the work being done by their more attention-getting, cerebral peers has influenced theirs. So there is a much-needed freshness to the work of almost-stale 1980s names such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Muir, Christian Lacroix, Claude Montana, Sonia Rykiel, Gianni Versace, Gianfranco Ferre, Caroline Charles, Martine Sitbon. The clothes they have designed for spring are much more relaxed. The flaunt-it, overly-structured styles of the late 1980s and early 90s have given way to a much easier look which is all about softness, fluidity and richly textured fabrics. They do not necessarily droop and draggle but these clothes are infinitely more forgiving of figure flaws and much more comfortable than what went before. But in between are the hybrids, the designers capable of an intellectual analysis of their medium but who possess a sharp sense of utility and convenience. Artistic statements on the catwalk are wonderful, they would say, but can they be worn with confidence by rather short, slightly plump Ms Average? If not, then the true designer will jettison the outfit. Among this number are most of the British designers - Katharine Hamnett, Betty Jackson, Jasper Conran, Edina Ronay, Ellis Flyte and Richard Ostell, Workers For Freedom, Helen Storey, Ben de Lisi and a raft of newcomers - and most of the Americans - Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein. At their head, however, are the disciplined creative geniuses, Issey Miyake and Giorgio Armani, effortlessly reflecting the zeitgeist while offering comfort, flattery and confidence. Out of the confusion it is possible to identify some continuity and some novelty. The key piece for day is the new softer jacket, narrow on the shoulders and upper chest, then flaring gently to skim waist and hips. Beneath that options open up: a long narrow skirt, slit or wrapped; a long primitive-pleated skirt which looks narrow but allows plenty of stride; a gently flared permanently crumpled silk or cotton skirt; a short, flaring skirt in taffeta pleats or layered chiffon; wide palazzo pants; flare-from-the-knee loon pants; narrow cigarette trousers either front-pleated or jeans-cut. Informal evening wear provides a wide choice this summer. For the leggy there is the new-again mini dress which is cut like the little frocks of the mid-1960s, with spaghetti straps or a halter neck, a high narrow bust and a swirly little skirt. But satin, chiffon or lace trousers, particularly in cream or white, look wonderfully fresh particularly when teamed with a top of complete simplicity: knitted silk, light cashmere, chiffon or string. Transparency, or at least the illusion of it, is a strong theme for summer, achieved with lace, layers of chiffon or coarse mesh. Many designers toyed with string vests of varying looseness of weave. Some are very flirtatious indeed; others just hint at the summer-gold flesh beneath. More formal evening wear also depends for its air of ingenue ethereality on floaty, diaphanous fabrics often layered. The bias-cut slip dress in satin, crepe or silk jersey is doubtless the sexiest frock of summer 1994. Fashion cognoscenti are already snapping up Marks and Spencer's full-length, untrimmed, satin nightie for summer parties. The improvised-looking and second-hand, the unironed and slightly frayed, layered and apparently haphazard serve as a nod to deconstruction. Colours are subdued, non-aggressive neutrals and naturals: white, cream, ecru, 100 shades of beige, soft safari brown, dark navy, slate and black. The new aesthetic calls for interesting texture and a softness which denies all hard edges. This summer you will believe a woman can float.</p>

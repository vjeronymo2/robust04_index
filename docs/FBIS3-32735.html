After the arrest of a cell that planned to "unleash" a  strong  wave of violence in Tarapoto, the Shining Path continued its  attempt to occupy the vacuum left by the Tupac Amaru  Revolutionary Army (MRTA) in the Huallaga region after the  defeat by the Army.    During a recent tour of the region, EXPRESO listened to  testimony that confirms that the Shining Path has managed to  extend its area of action in San Martin Department. With their  latest actions, SL members have reached northern San Martin,  control some areas in the Lower and Middle Huallaga Valley, and,  what is more worrisome, they have managed to hold on to their  old areas of influence in the region.    The recent Shining Path actions were concentrated in areas  abandoned by MRTA. In Tarapoto, SL members attacked two Upper  Huallaga Development Program (PEAH) officials, killing one and  injuring the other at the beginning of last December. The attack  took place at kilometer 22 of the Marginal Highway when the PEAH  officials were returning from supervising work in Ponaza Valley.  Two weeks before the attack, the SL had threatened the PEAH  officials who operated in Aypena, Shamboyacu, and Alfonso Ugarte.    PEAH officials who operate in other regions apparently have  received the same threats. For example, PEAH engineers in Junjui  have not gone to the fields in months as a result of SL threats.    A few weeks ago in the town of Santa Clara, located in Mayo  Medio -- where the MRTA had great influence -- 150 SL members  gathered residents together and appointed some delegates. "We  did not know what to do. We did not have weapons with which to  defend ourselves," a peasant patrol member in the area told us.    In La Banda de Shicayo, a populous neighborhood in Tarapoto,  located three blocks from the local arms square, 20 people  hailed the SL on the evening of 8 December.    In the hamlet of Pasarrya, located near Saposoa, a group of  SL members attempted to hold a meeting of residents and appoint  delegates a few weeks ago.    A short time later in Sisa Valley another group entered the  towns of Nauta and Agua Blanca and burned the local municipal  files.    In Ponaza and Biavo, the SL arrived to control some hamlets  and strengthened their presence in the region's capital in the  past few months.    The SL apparently is concentrating on turning this strategic  area of the Huallaga region into its most important bastion  because it has not suffered many casualties there and has made  much progress.    The fast spread of the SL in the region represents serious  danger. Until January 1992 the Shining Path and MRTA had divided  control over San Martin Department among themselves: The  territory from Juanjui to the north was controlled by MRTA and  the territory from Huicungo to the south was controlled by the  SL. Now with the MRTA out of action, things have changed.    The SL currently operates freely in the area previously  controlled by MRTA. Its new operation areas are located in the  extended territory between Tocache and the Lower Huallaga. The  SL still maintains strong influence in its old area of influence  between Huicungo and southern San Martin Department.    In Huanuco, the group still controls the provinces of  Huacaybamba, Huamalies, Huanuco, Leoncio Prado, and Maranon.  Military sources guarantee that in these areas several  subversive groups operate under the name of T-1, T-2, Astro  Rojo, and T-4, which work with the "local force" of the Regional  Huallaga Committee, which is the top SL organization in the  region. It is thought that 200 SL members operate in those  provinces to indoctrinate members.    The "main force" operates in Ucayali, forming companies the  subversives have named "Conquistar," "Atreverse," "Tormenta,"  and "Mar Rojo," or "ZB," "JR," and "AQ." These groups control  Padre Abad Province and the towns of Aguaytia, Santa Ana, and  San Alejandro. The Army believes these columns are "mobile" and  are made up of 200 other SL members who are always armed.    According to some intelligence reports, the hamlets of Costa  Rica, Ledoy, Pajarillo, La Banda, Huayabamba, Barranca, Muralla,  Gonzalez Prada, Alfonso Ugarte, and Rocafuerte, among other  hamlets in San Martin Department, are the new "red zones" while  La Morada, Cuchara, Pendencia, Paraiso, and Primavera continue  being areas in which the SL has its "basic force" dedicated to  production and surveillance.    "Open people's committees" are thought to have been set up  in  several of the aforementioned places.    Local residents and authorities -- like General Alfredo  Rodriguez Rivero, the new commander of the Huallaga Counter  Subversive Front, who replaced General Eduardo Bellido Mora --  have voiced concern about the spread of the SL in the San Martin  region.    During a ceremony at the "Leoncio Prado" military post at  the  end of last year, Gen. Rodriguez declared his concern about the  SL's spread in the presence of several reporters from Tarapoto.  Intelligence contends that SL's Regional Committee in Huallaga  has kept its structure nearly intact.    According to police, the Tarapoto cell had planned major  attacks and the murder of the city's leading authorities. The  cell was made up of 10 SL members, six of whom were captured in  Tarapoto. Police reported that the subversives had been  entrusted with several missions, including that of recruiting  new members from Tarapoto schools and institutes and  propagandizing SL ideology in the city.    The dismantling of the cell was a severe blow to the SL, but  there are no indications that it was a mortal one.</p>

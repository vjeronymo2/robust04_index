			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Observer: Alpine heights Another Anglo-Saxon ventures into the higher reaches of the Swiss banking community, a domain where the climate, for the non-Swiss, is not noted for its clemency. Australian-born Phillip Colebatch, who has just been named chief financial and administrative officer of CS Holding, parent company of the financial group built around Credit Suisse, has survived since 1984 at CS First Boston in London, latterly as chief financial officer. But will he fare better at head office than did, say, Andrew Large? Now chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, Large stayed for little more than a year among the Swiss Bank Corporation gnomes in Basle. Walter Frehner, chief executive of SBC when Large was on the executive board, later insisted that the bank was open to foreigners, but that they had to speak German - preferably Swiss German. CS, being a holding company, may prove easier to penetrate than the banks themselves. English is spoken at executive board meetings and Colebatch will have American John Hennessy, chief executive of CSFB, as well as his former boss in London, German Hans-Jorg Rudloff, for company. Anyway, despite his exalted title, Colebatch will attend meetings without, initially, being a board member himself. 'There is a quota for foreigners, it is not so easy,' explains Rudloff, who was moved to Zurich in March from his position atop the London operation. Rudloff judges Colebatch to be progressing well with his German lessons: 'high German; no one learns this little (Swiss ) dialect unless they are born with it.' Ach so. And how about the quota? Must one of the foreigners move over before Colebatch gets his seat?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Leonid Kravchuk was in Donetsk oblast  on a working visit today. He was met at the airport by his  representative Yuriy Smyrnov and by Vadym Chufrun, chairman of  the oblast council. Leonid Makarovych stressed that the Donbass  is a special industrial region which together with the other  industrial oblasts of Dnepropetrovsk, Lugansk, and Zaporozhye  defines the state of the economy in our country.    The president of Ukraine held talks in Yenakiyevo with the  heads of the state administrations of these oblasts and also  with directors of metallurgical, coke oven, and coal industries.  First, though, the inhabitants of this town surrounded Leonid  Makarovych. Obviously, people are primarily concerned with  social issues: prices, wages, housing, and medicines. As the  president noted, they may be fully resolved when our state's  economy begins to work as it should.    The directors asked the president to adopt decrees that  would  solve the problems of credits, exports, and mutual nonpayment.  The miners alone owe their subcontractors more than 5 trillion  karbovantsi. Ilyushenko, director general of the Donetsk  Vuhillya production association, said that these are the results  of the unsuccessful actions of Kuchma's government. Hrihoriy  Pyatachenko, Ukraine's minister of finance, and Viktor  Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine,  explained to the directors that the present government is  tackling precisely these problems and invited them to come to  Kiev as a group next Monday in order to adopt a final decision  aimed at pulling the Ukrainian economy out of the economic  crisis. [passage omitted]    [Begin Kravchuk recording] Ukraine was one of the first  countries in the CIS to suffer the biggest economic shocks,  above all, with regard to prices of energy sources, taking into  account the great dependency of our industrial sector on energy  sources. At the end of 1993, as you remember, we simply had a  terrible rate of inflation, prices increased, and everything  negative followed from this.    Because of these shocks, Ukraine's economy sank very low.  Thanks to the steps that were taken by the government,  regardless of your criticism of it, we succeeded in holding out,  although I should honestly tell you that in December I had some  terrible feelings that we could lose control over the economy  and even the situation.    This is not a positive aspect which one should be proud of  but, nevertheless, we could say that Ukraine held out. And now  we are standing on the ground. The time has come when we,  standing here on this ground, should now start a new stage in  our economic activity and should build a foundation on it.  Well-considered steps and extremely radical steps are required.  We must therefore combine considered actions with radicalism  and executive activity, discipline, order, and organizational  ability.

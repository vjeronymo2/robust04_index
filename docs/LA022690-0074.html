			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHS WILL DEFEND FREEDOM, HAVEL SAYS  </P> <P> President Vaclav Havel on Sunday addressed a cheering crowd in Prague's  Wenceslas Square and vowed that Czechoslovakia will defend its new-found  freedom after more than four decades of communism.  </P> <P> "We haven't had freedom for a long time, but I assure you we are going to  defend it this time," Havel said.  </P> <P> "Our weapon is that right and justice are on our side."  </P> <P> During the rally, held to mark the 42nd anniversary of the Communist takeover  of Czechoslovakia, Havel spoke from the same balcony where then-Prime Minister  Klement Gottwald proclaimed the victory of the Communist Party.  </P> <P> Said Havel: "A predecessor we cannot be too proud about announced that the  overthrow had taken place. This is a happy opportunity to announce from the  same place that we can say the truth without being punished."  </P> <P> He said the state of the country after the ousting of the Communists late last  year was very sad -- unbreathable air, undrinkable water, the land covered with  "rabbit hutches" as houses. He said this will take years to change.  </P> <P> Havel leaves today for Moscow, where he is scheduled to meet with Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> One of the issues will be the Soviet troop pullout from Czechoslovakia. Soviet  and Czechoslovak negotiators agreed last Thursday on a total withdrawal, the  first of which begins today with a tank division near the Polish border. It is  apparently timed to coincide with Havel's trip.  </P> <P> The pullout is due to be completed by 1991.  </P></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / German Elections: Where the only tax promises are to pay more The benighted German taxpayers have good reason to feel confused. Every party competing for their votes in the general election next Sunday is adamant that their welfare is of paramount importance. Yet the one certainty facing every taxpayer is that next year their bills will rise. If the present government is re-elected, they know they will have to pay a swingeing 'solidarity surcharge' of an extra 7.5 per cent on income tax to finance the soaring costs of German unification and the resulting debt burden. They have already had to pay a sharp increase in oil taxes this year, and there will be another increase in insurance taxation, property taxation and a new social security charge to pay for nursing care insurance from January. In the past four years, since the general election in 1990, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's liberal-conservative coalition has raised the revenues from taxation and social insurance by DM116bn (Pounds 47.5bn) to a record DM750bn. The exchequer has been hit not only by the costs of unification, with massive transfers from west to east of around DM150bn a year to pay for unemployment benefit, pensions, subsidising local government, and a huge investment in new infrastructure. Its tax revenues have been simultaneously squeezed by the sharp recession in the German economy over the past two years. And it now faces an accumulated debt burden which is absorbing 24 per cent of available tax revenues each year in interest payments alone. The resulting series of sharp tax rises is what Mr Oskar Lafontaine, the finance-minister-in-waiting of Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), describes as 'the great tax lie'. For Mr Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union (CDU) had promised that German unification could be financed without any tax increases at all. Mr Lafontaine and his party leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, have deliberately raised the issue of taxation to the top of the election agenda in an effort to persuade the voters that they will be more responsible with the public purse than Mr Kohl and his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel. They describe their own plans modestly as 'the biggest tax-cutting programme for normal income-earners and families in the history of the federal republic'. Their aim is to shift the tax burden from the lower-paid to the wealthy, without any overall increase in the tax take of the state. They would scrap the plans for a 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' and replace it with a 10 per cent charge on the top one in five income-earners. They would raise monthly cash payments for each child in a family to DM250, instead of the present system of tax allowances. And from 1996, they would raise the income tax threshold to a new 'subsistence level' of DM13,000. For a party traditionally associated with high taxation, and high welfare payments, it is a gamble. And the indications are that in spite of the government's sorry record, it may not pay off. Both sides are adamant that the other's figures do not add up. They are probably both right. For a start, Mr Lafontaine and his allies accuse Mr Waigel of cooking his budget books, with secret plans for further increases in value added tax and oil tax in the pipeline. The government has promised to take further action next year to reduce taxation on the business sector, as part of its drive to make German industry more internationally competitive. But Mr Waigel refuses to say how he will finance the new deal. He simply denies that he has any plans to increase VAT. 'We fear that the facts are so bleak, the government would rather say nothing until the election is over,' says Mr Heribert Juchems, chief executive of the association of independent entrepreneurs. As for the opposition, Mr Waigel maintains that in replacing the solidarity surcharge alone, Mr Lafontaine will be creating a financing gap of DM7bn. If he is to produce the same revenue as the government's 7.5 per cent tax increase, he will have to levy his 10 per cent charge on all incomes over DM44,000 a year, the finance ministry maintains. And that means hitting a large number of average income-earners, rather than simply the relatively wealthy. The irony is that in seeking to be as precise as possible in spelling out his tax plans, and by insisting that he will not raise the government's net borrowing requirement, Mr Lafontaine appears to have frightened off as many voters as he has attracted. Both sides know that the pressures on the public purse can only get worse in the coming years. Social spending in particular is in urgent need of reform because of the growing numbers of old people and the young, in relation to the working population. That will be the greatest challenge for the next German government. The taxpayer only knows it will cost more before it costs less.</p>

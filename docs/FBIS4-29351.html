			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  acknowledged Friday that Japan has the capability to produce  nuclear weapons but said it has not done so in line with its  international treaty obligations. "It's certainly the case that  Japan has the capability to possess nuclear weapons but has not  made them," Hata told reporters inside the Diet building.    He said Japan has abstained from doing so in line with its  obligations as a nonnuclear power under the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Hata made the comment in  connection with an alleged remark he made in a House of  Councillors Budget Committee meeting earlier in the day.    The prime minister was quoted by parliamentarians as having  said he "agrees absolutely" with an interpellator's view that  Japan should confirm to other nations that it can indeed produce  nuclear weapons, though it is refraining from doing so for  political reasons. The interpellator, Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) Hiroshi Oki, cited the NPT and Japan's so-called three  nonnuclear principles -- to not possess, manufacture or  introduce nuclear weapons on its territory.    Hata denied to reporters that he made the alleged remark,  though Oki insisted the prime minister "roundly affirmed"  Japan's potential for producing nuclear weapons. It is believed  to be the first time for the Japanese Government to directly  acknowledge such potential in the Diet or publicly.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai called Hata's  remarks  a somewhat insufficient explanation of the government's true  position. He told reporters that Japan "limits its use of  nuclear energy to peaceful purposes, abstains from military  utilization and does not endeavor to possess nuclear weapons  technology or know-how."</p>

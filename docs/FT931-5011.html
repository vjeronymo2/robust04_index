			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Verdict put off on Ilva state aid THE European Commission has postponed indefinitely a decision on whether to outlaw state aid to Ilva, Italy's loss-making steel company. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, wanted Rome to recover L350bn (Pounds 160m) paid to Ilva in 1991 in the form of a capital increase, and freeze a planned second tranche of L300bn. But senior Brussels aides agreed yesterday that the proposal should not be discussed at today's full European Commission meeting in Strasbourg. Mr Van Miert has withdrawn the proposal because the Italian authorities have promised to submit a new restructuring plan for Ilva by the end of April. But he was also under pressure from his colleagues to consider controversial Italian and Spanish state aid plans as part of the EC's overall proposals to support the west European steel industry. Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the Italian industry minister, threatened 10 days ago to block the overall EC plan if the L650bn recapitalisation was not approved by Brussels, and Madrid has also warned that it will protect its domestic industry if necessary. Mr Van Miert yesterday met Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the Spanish industry minister, to discuss Madrid's proposals to subsidise the Spanish industry in exchange for capacity cuts. The Commission has already indicated that aid will have to be reduced or more capacity cut. Mr Aranzadi is now said to be suggesting that the cost of building a new steel mill in the volatile Basque region of Spain could be borne by private investors. Mr Van Miert's spokesman refused to comment yesterday on the outcome of the discussions, but confirmed there would have to be other meetings between the two men. EC ministers backed an outline Commission plan to give commercial and financial support to the west European steel industry in exchange for restructuring at a meeting two weeks ago.</p>

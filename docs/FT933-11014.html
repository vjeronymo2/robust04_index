			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing deal secured for FNFC as losses fall FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group which earlier this year found itself in breach of banking covenants, has narrowly avoided collapse by clinching a refinancing deal for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to 107 international banks. Had the refinancing not been agreed, the group could have been forced to call in administrators. This is the second time in 20 years that FNFC has come close to collapse. It was rescued by the Bank of England after the banking crisis in the mid-1970s. The deal was finally signed late Thursday night, after the company gave written assurances to a US bank that all creditors would receive equal treatment. Agreement opened the way for FNFC to resume dividend payments after two years and report its interim results, showing a reduction in pre-tax losses from a restated Pounds 39.6m to Pounds 3.35m for the six months to April 30. FNFC has won a five-year breathing space for repayment of its Pounds 1.1bn debt. The banks are not providing any new funds. In return, FNFC has agreed to wind down the lossmaking First National Commercial Bank, which provides term lending to property orientated businesses. It has also agreed to tighter covenants on gearing ratios. Mr Tim Ingrams, finance director, said the deal put the company on a firm financial basis. Borrowing costs were expected to be 0.8 per cent higher. The group's difficulties stem from the breach of one covenant in 1988 which was discovered this year. This related to a ban on loan guarantees between subsidiaries and the parent. Cross default agreements meant all creditors could call for immediate repayment of debts when it was discovered that this ban had been breached. Although FNFC had not defaulted on its repayment obligations, discovery of the breach following two years of heavy losses is thought to have made creditors nervous. FNFC's debt can be split into three parts - loans to First National Bank of Pounds 788m, loans to FNCB of Pounds 236m, and loans to the parent of about Pounds 90m. The group intends to repay the banks largely through securitising the assets of its main operating subsidiary, FNB. This, in effect, means packaging parts of the loan portfolio and putting them into an off balance sheet vehicle. This then raises cash by issuing notes to investors. Part of the refinancing agreement calls for 90 per cent of First National Bank's future business to be 'securitiseable'. FNCB's debt will be repayable as its loan book is run down. Loans to the parent will be repaid with cash from January's Pounds 45m rights issue and property sales. Costs of negotiating the refinancing are expected to be about Pounds 5m. In its results, prepared in accordance with FRS 3, the group declared a dividend of 0.5p. Mr Ingram said that restrictions on pay-outs by subsidiaries to the quoted parent meant there would be no great increase in dividends from FNFC for a few years. Losses per share fell to 2.5p (21.7p). FNFC's core consumer credit business showed a Pounds 10.4m profit (Pounds 12.8m losses). Commercial lending, earmarked for closure, incurred heavier losses of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.5m).</p>

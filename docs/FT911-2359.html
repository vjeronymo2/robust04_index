			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: French mail order bid unconditional Redoute Catalogue, the French mail order company, has declared its 125p per share cash bid for Empire Stores Group, the UK home shopping business, wholly unconditional, writes Maggie Urry. Redoute owns or had received valid acceptances for 50.1 per cent of Empire's share capital. It had already announced on Thursday that it owned or had acceptances for 52.6 per cent of the group, but was waiting for 'valid cover' on 4.7 per cent of shares. As yet Gecos, the Italian food retailer which has 24.2 per cent of Empire, has not decided whether to accept the offer or to remain as a minority shareholder. It has said it intends to clarify its position by tomorrow.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Business 'pulls aid strings' Business interests are increasingly shaping the content of official aid programmes to the detriment of the poor, according to a report by aid agencies from 22 donor nations. The practice of tying aid to the purchase of goods and services in donor countries is growing, obliging developing countries to pay more than necessary for their supplies, it says. Tied aid also results in purchases of inappropriate goods suited to the donor rather than the recipient and holds back development of Third World industries debarred from competing for aid-funded projects. Tied aid has been running at about Dollars 15bn in each of the past five years, rising to nearly Dollars 18bn in 1991, the report claims. It estimates developing countries are paying on average 15 per cent more than necessary for tied aid supplies, amounting to a subsidy to exporters in donor nations of more than Dollars 2bn a year. This compares with total development assistance by OECD countries of Dollars 60bn in 1992. Governments tend to favour projects that serve the interests of their own industries because they are visible, easy to administer and relatively quick to implement. Projects designed to reduce poverty often centre on slowly building up local capabilities, using local resources rather than importing goods, services and know-how from outside. The growing use of aid to promote enterprise and investment in developing countries also appears to be driven more by the desire to give donor country industries a toe hold in developing markets. More broadly the rich industrial nations are sharply reducing development assistance. Only about 10 per cent of aid goes directly on reducing poverty.

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Inco to sell its 62% TVX Gold holding INCO, the international nickel producer, is severing the bulk of its gold interests by disposing of its entire 62 per cent stake in TVX Gold of Toronto. Inco yesterday raised about CDollars 386m, before commissions, by selling its 81m TVX shares at a price of CDollars 4.65 each to an underwriting syndicate led by Wood Gundy and Burns Fry of Toronto. An official at Burns Fry said the shares were re-sold to outside investors within an hour of being put on the market yesterday morning. About 40 per cent were distributed in the US and Europe. The US tranche was privately placed with institutional investors. Until last week, Inco gave no indication that it was interested in selling the TVX stake. But depressed world nickel prices have increased pressure to raise cash by disposing of peripheral assets. Inco suffered a USDollars 22.6m loss in the first three months of this year and has long-term debt of close to Dollars 1bn. It is expected to post a CDollars 300m gain from the TVX sale, which is due to close next month. TVX has interests in six gold and silver mines in North and South America. Their production totalled a record 406,000 ounces of gold and gold equivalent in 1992. Alcoa, North America's largest aluminium producer, is to cut its US primary aluminium production by 268,000 metric tonnes within the next three weeks and lay off 750 workers at five locations in a dramatic effort to reduce world aluminium overcapacity, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. The cuts represent nearly 25 per cent of its 1.3m tonnes US smelting capacity. Analysts lauded Alcoa's action as a means of boosting flagging aluminium prices, but said reductions of at least 600,000 tonnes are needed before world aluminium supply and demand return to balance. The states of the former Soviet Union have flooded world markets with primary aluminium in the last two years. London Metals Exchange stocks have risen to nearly 2m tonnes since 1990, and hundreds of thousands more tons sit in unregistered positions. Mr. Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said the plant shutdowns and job losses were the direct result of a 'lack of any mechanism to deal with the economic consequences of the dissolution of the former Soviet Union'.</p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Look before you leap - How to . . . invest in the BE / There's value to be had but caution is necessary IT COULD just be a marketing ploy. This year, as every year, the word is that the business expansion scheme is due for sweeping changes. But some of the BES schemes being marketed seem to have reduced the risk involved to an extent never imagined by the government. John Harrison, of Investment and Tax Publishing Services, points out that changes to the scheme could be made in the Budget with immediate effect, stopping the marketing of some schemes even before the end of the tax year. The combination of tax incentives and a possible deadline could lead investors into a headlong rush. This is dangerous, as many of this year's most attractive schemes have sold out already. This does not mean that there is no value to be found anywhere, but investors should exercise caution. The rules of the scheme, in outline, are quite simple. You can invest a maximum of Pounds 40,000 during a tax year. This need not necessarily all be in the same BES company. You then receive tax relief on this at your top marginal rate of tax. If you are a top-rate, 40 per cent taxpayer, you will receive a rebate for 40 per cent of the sum invested in the BES company. You hold on to this tax relief only if you keep the BES shares for at least five years. At the end of this period, providing the company remains in existence, you are allowed to dispose of the shares (not always an easy job) free of capital gains and income tax. Most BES companies buy properties and then let them as assured tenancies, following a change in the rules in 1988 designed to stimulate the private rental housing sector. When should you consider investing in a BES company? David Wells, of chartered accountant Binder Hamlyn, says the scheme is useful only to people paying 40 per cent tax. The benefits are much less worthwhile for 25 per cent taxpayers. And, of course, you should never invest for tax reasons alone. It is important not to go overboard. If, for instance, you have already paid the maximum into pension contributions, you might find that your gross income no longer exceeds the threshold for top-rate tax by enough to receive top-rate relief on all of the BES investment. Wells says an accountant can work this out for you, but you should view the BES only as part of end-of-tax-year planning. A decision also will depend on your liquidity. If you cannot afford to shelter the money and forego any income from it for five years, something more flexible could suit you better. You can combine a BES investment with a temporary annuity for five years, but this is cumbersome and adds to the expense. Assuming you have decided to go ahead, which type of scheme should you choose? Judged as pure tax-planning tools, the most attractive offerings are precisely those thought to have the most endangered future - the 'buy-back' or covenanted schemes. They work by bringing in a second party, as well as the BES company. The latter will buy assets in return for a covenant from the second party to buy them back at a fixed price after five years. The convenants are binding legally, so the investor should be safe unless the 'guarantor' goes out of business. Most of them buy assured tenancies on behalf of either housing associations or higher education colleges. Such institutions do not have massive financial clout, though. Therefore, both shareholders and sponsors have tried to find third party guarantors, even though the legislation does not allow for a direct guarantee to shareholders from a third party. Some schemes have attempted to lessen risk further by making the 'buy-back' self-financing. This can be done by arranging fixed-rate loans for the buy-back company, and then setting up separate cash deposit accounts ear-marked specifically for BES investors. Normally, this still works out as cheap finance for the housing association or unversity. In some cases, no new accommodation is either bought or built  -a university can sell its accommodation to the BES company, bank the proceeds, and still make a nice profit on the deal. These cash-backed schemes usually offer a lower level of return than schemes which have not attempted to arrange pre-payment. Also, some schemes will have a relatively strong covenant because the buy-back company has a strong balance sheet, while others may face an awkward financial stretch to make their repayment. Another variation is that some schemes will take longer to pay your tax relief than others, and to complete the sales at the end of five years. Either could lower the effective return you get. Anthony Yadgaroff, of Best BES Advice, says strength of covenant should be the first consideration, followed by the projected return. Two other options allow for BES tax relief: trading companies which raise risk finance; and assured tenancy companies, which aim for growth but do not attempt to offer a guarantee. Rental companies aiming for high growth try to take advantage of the recession by buying properties on the cheap, renovating them, and then letting them. The more squeamish investors might wish to avoid the growing number of companies which specialise in buying repossessed properties at auction. If you believe that the market for residential property will stage a significant recovery over the next five years, these schemes may make sense. Wells recommends them to clients who have a large portfolio already. While, generally, he recommends buy-back companies, he adds: 'The risk is lower, but I don't think people should be blinded by the 16 per cent rates on offer.' Finally, there are trading companies. These should not really be regarded as items of personal finance at all but as speculations. Many small companies fail. But if they succeed, you could do very well indeed - for example, present offerings allow you to buy into breweries, lager importers, or film production companies.

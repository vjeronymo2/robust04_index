			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Federal child welfare initiatives are being implemented that have enormous potential for the field. The publication of the final rule for the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), and interim final rules for the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information Systems (SACWIS), in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 22, 1993, paves the way for the collection, aggregation and analysis of child welfare data to inform and improve policies, programs, and practices at the Federal, State and local levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Private philanthropy continues to make a major investment in responding to the needs of the child welfare system. Numerous foundations are underwriting the costs of major reform efforts at the State and local levels and funding more targeted demonstration grants on specific topics to governmental units and private agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This period of promise and opportunity for child welfare comes at a time when a mix of social, cultural and economic forces are placing pressures on children and families as well as on child welfare professionals and agencies. Sweeping transformations in the domestic labor market, rising rates of child and family poverty, numerous health care crises, greater numbers of teen pregnancies, the AIDS and substance abuse epidemics, and increasing levels of interpersonal and community violence are cumulatively taking a toll on child and family well-being. Steadily rising caseloads, consisting of much more complex cases involving more severe presenting problems, are confronting service programs for children and families at the State and local level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Throughout the country child welfare agency administrators, practitioners, and university-based personnel are demonstrating resiliency and creativity in response to these circumstances. Skilled and knowledgeable child welfare professionals are devising innovative and exemplary solutions to these numerous challenges, more often than not, in the face of insufficient human, material and financial resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to more fully meet the promise and potential the current period offers, and more fully compensate for and overcome existing resource deficiencies, State and other publicly supported child welfare agencies are in need of capacity-building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Resource Centers for Child Welfare Services Programs are vital to making the most of this opportunity for progress and accomplishment by providing States and other publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare agencies the quality training, technical assistance and consultation they need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the current opportunity to revitalize child welfare, the role and responsibilities of National Resource Centers assume strategic importance. The Children's Bureau seeks to fund five National Resource Centers for Child Welfare Services Programs which individually and collectively can make a meaningful contribution to the revitalization effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These National Resource Centers are expected to build collaborative working relationships with relevant programs and other training and technical assistance providers funded by Federal agencies and foundations. They are to establish effective linkages and appropriate coordination with the Community-Based Family Resource Program, the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's (NCCAN) Emergency Services Technical Services Contractor, and with three statewide Family Resource and Support model projects funded by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB). They will also play major roles in support of the Training and Technical Assistance Resource Coordination Contract to be funded by the Children's Bureau in FY 94.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This network of National Resource Centers possessing the expertise, knowledge and skills to provide quality resources, training, technical assistance, consultation, and related services is to have a central role in improving and strengthening child welfare. Support for this network of National Resource Centers reflects a commitment by the Children's Bureau to enhance the policy environment and the continuum of services for the benefit of children, families and agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4.

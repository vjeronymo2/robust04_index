			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares drift nervously in thin trading volume - Market report The prospect of the August holiday beaches, or perhaps of the extended rail strike which starts in the UK this afternoon, appeared to take the heart out of the London stock market yesterday. Trading volume was down by nearly one third from Friday and shares could do little more than drift against a background of weak bond markets. In early trade, the FT-SE Index lost the 3,100 mark regained so painfully last week and for most of the day the market traded just above this benchmark level. A firmer trend in the US dollar helped the stock market rally towards the close, and the final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,106.1 for a net loss on the day of 8.6. The picture was little different across the broader range of shares, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shedding 6.9 to 3,624. Many of the big securities houses were rearranging their trading portfolios ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2bn UK government bonds, and this doubtless inhibited their activities in the equity market. Bond markets were also digesting the reminder from the chairman of the Federal Reserve chairman that further rises in US interest rates could yet be needed to curb inflationary pressures. But the most accurate picture of UK equity trading came from the total of Seaq-reported shares which at only 431.4m was around 30 per cent down on the total for the previous session. Friday's retail business in equities was worth Pounds 1.21bn. The market opened cautiously, keeping a close eye on the US dollar and also influenced by the latest survey of business opinion from the Confederation of British Industry; this indicated that British companies are not convinced that domestic inflation will be kept within the targets set by the UK government. But, in keeping with the poor trading volume, the market largely failed to develop a convincing trend during early dealings, when it was left to special situation stocks to provide the highlights. This week is light on economic news, with the latest US gross domestic product statistics, due on Friday, likely to provide the sole focus of attention. The Bundesbank, now into its summer recess, has effectively put its interest rate policy on hold for three weeks. The initial fall in the Footsie, which took it down by 15.7 to 3,099, reflected a downward lead from stock index futures. Later in the session, the futures contract settled comfortably above the 3,100 mark, thus underwriting the market at that level, for the time being at least. The general absence of enthusiasm opened the way for profit-taking in those sectors which have performed well in recent weeks. Media stocks, in particular, gave ground in relatively narrow markets. Among the blue chips, dollar stocks found little to encourage them until the very end of the session. Oil shares made little response to the continued firmness in crude oil prices as the Nigerian supply stoppage showed no signs of solution. Although Wellcome continued to respond favourably to last week's trading statement, other pharmaceutical stocks remained nervous, as investors assessed the signs of tightening competition in the drugs industry. Bank stocks, although generally expected to benefit from the improved trading results confidently expected this week, slipped lower yesterday as investors took their lead from the German stock market where financial issues suffered further losses. A lead for the market is likely to come from the interim statement due from ICI on Thursday. The market expects a good increase in profits from ICI, which is still, in spite of the sale of the pharmaceuticals divisions, regarded as an important leader of industrial Britain.</p>

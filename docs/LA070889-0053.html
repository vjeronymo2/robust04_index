			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FBI RECOVERS 3 F-16 ENGINES STOLEN AT BASE  </P> <P> The FBI has recovered three F-16 jet engines that were missing at least four  days ago from this base in northern Utah, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> "The latest we have on the theft and recovery of the missing jet engines is  that they've been found, they've been located and are in the possession of the  government. They were recovered by the FBI," said Air Force spokeswoman Maj.  Donna Pastor in Washington.  </P> <P> But CBS News reported Friday that the engines were never actually missing and  that the entire mystery was part of a "Pentagon sting" designed to uncover  evidence against a major military theft ring.  </P> <P> NBC News also reported a "sting operation," adding Friday that members of a  theft ring may have thought they were selling the expensive engines to "boat  enthusiasts" to power speedboats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Details Provided  </P> <P> Pastor said she could not provide any details, such as where the engines were  found and whether there were any arrests.  </P> <P> "We have recovered three jet engines stolen from Hill Air Force Base," said Tim  Screen, with the FBI's Salt Lake City office, which handled the investigation.  "Due to the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation, we cannot say more.  The FBI recovered them."  </P> <P> Sgt. Louis Arana-Barradas, spokesman for Hill Air Force Base, about 35 miles  north of Salt Lake City, said: "The engines were discovered missing during the  normal course of business."  </P> <P> The engines used to power F-16 Fighting Falcons are 16 to 20 feet long and  weigh about 3,500 pounds each, Arana-Barradas said. They are valued at about $2  million apiece.  </P></p>

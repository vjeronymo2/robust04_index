			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / US trade gap widens as exports fall A slowdown in US exports in September helped push the US merchandise trade deficit from Dollars 14.1bn (Pounds 8.5bn) in August to Dollars 14.6bn, its second highest level since 1987, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Exports of goods and services declined during the month, dropping from Dollars 59.9bn in August to Dollars 59.7bn. Merchandise imports also declined slightly - from Dollars 58.2bn to Dollars 58.1bn, and service imports rose from Dollars 11.4 to Dollars 11.7bn. Although economists attribute the growing deficit to macroeconomic factors, members of Congress will seek to use the trade gap as ammunition to attack the Uruguay Round legislation when it goes to a vote later this month. Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat and an opponent of the Gatt deal, yesterday called a press conference to complain 'the current trade strategy is producing lost jobs and lower incomes for American workers.' The US Chamber of Commerce said exports to US partners in the North American Free Trade agreement were growing at a rate of 14.4 per cent. 'Unless the Congress gives the US and world economies a shot in the arm by passing that Gatt Uruguay Round Agreement, future trade data reports will just be more of the same,' the chamber said. The Clinton administration has made exports the centre of its economics and trade policies. While exports of goods jumped by 9.9 per cent in August, they have declined in two of the past three months. Exports of semiconductors, computers accessories and telecommunications are booming - up almost 22 per cent in last year - but imports of these products grew at a rate of 26 per cent. The deficit with Japan showed a rare decline, from Dollars 5.8bn to Dollars 5.4bn, as imports of cars and car parts declined by Dollars 1.2bn. Japan and China still made up the bulk of the trade deficit although their share over the past year has shrunk from 70 per cent to 63 per cent. Most economists expect an improvement in the trade gap next year. In a commentary, Merrill Lynch said: 'Countries like Germany and Japan are emerging from a period of economic malaise and should continue to grow. That global pickup in economic growth rates will allow US exports to rise while our domestic demand slows.'</p>

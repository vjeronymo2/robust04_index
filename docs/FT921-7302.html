			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: NHL in last ditch talks as chairman goes NATIONAL HOME LOANS, the troubled mortgage lender, has started last ditch talks with four syndicates of banks to reschedule its debts in a bid to stave off administration. At the same time, its subsidiary, National Mortgage Bank, is to run down its business and then surrender its banking license. Mr Ian Hay Davison, a veteran City trouble-shooter, will act as chairman of the bank during its run-down. The moves were announced late last night, along with news of the departure of Mr Kevin Milner, NHL group chairman. Mr Jonathan Perry, a director of NHL since last June and a former director of Morgan Grenfell, becomes executive chairman, replacing both Mr Milner and Mr John Darby, the NHL chairman who announced his resignation in November. Mr Darby's resignation followed the announcement of a pre-tax loss of Pounds 47.9m by NHL in 1991 after bad debt provisions of Pounds 88.7m. 'We are talking in advance over the next few days with the banks about situations which may arise for the group,' an NHL spokesman said. He declined to comment on suggestions that the Bank of England was co-ordinating the latest moves to resolve NHL's problems. However, he revealed that 10 banks, headed by Barclays, which organised a Pounds 200m cash lifeboat for National Mortgage Bank last July, may provide further cash if necessary. NHL's core mortgage business operations have now been split from the bank and if negotiations with the four banking syndicates are successful, the group could continue as a mortgage administration company with a view to eventually returning to the market as a lender. At present it is doing only tiny amounts of mortgage lending. Mr Hay Davison's task at National Mortgage Bank will be to preside over the orderly disposal of its assets, including leasing assets and commercial mortgages. The process could take several years to complete if buyers cannot be found at acceptable prices. Mr Milner became NHL chairman in February 1990 after a spectacular boardroom coup ousted Mr Richard Lacy, NHL's founding chief executive. He received a salary of Pounds 350,000 in 1991. The company confirmed that he had been given a package of resignation benefits, but declined to give details. NHL has sold about Pounds 3.5bn of residential mortgages, but most of these have been sold off through securitisation and it has currently about Pounds 700m of mortgages on its books. A group spokesman said last night that NHL's 70,000 mortgage customers would not be affected by the company's problems.</p>

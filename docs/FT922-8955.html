			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (12): Concorde - a hard act to follow / Prospects for supersonic travel THIRTY YEARS ago the British and French governments finally gave the go-ahead for the world's first supersonic airliner, the Concorde project. But it was January 1976 before Concorde's first commercial flight and another 10 years shuttling backwards and forwards over the Atlantic before British Airways was able to report that the aircraft was making a healthy profit. Despite all the initial optimism of the 1960s, when the project's cost was put at Pounds 80m and Britain and France were hoping to sell more than 400 aircraft, only 16 were actually built and the overall cost eventually reached Pounds 2bn. Nevertheless, Concorde came into its own in the 1980s economic boom as captains of industry and finance, pop stars and sport personalities climbed aboard the 100-seater aircraft to cross the Atlantic in style and on time rather than worry about the cost. For them the premium New York return fare of Pounds 5,000 is justified by the savings in travelling time offered by Concorde. With mid-morning departures from London and Paris the busy senior executive has time to sort out his desk before departure and still be in New York's JFK airport at 9.30am the same day (or 9am on the Air France flight) after a flight of just 3 1/2 hours. Inevitably, the recession and the cost-cutting plans of the 1990s have forced some companies to reconsider the expense of flying senior executives by Concorde. But Concorde still attracts its regular fliers, of whom some travel every week, and those individuals who are willing to pay the supersonic premium to arrive fresh. In addition, Concorde continues to attract a busy charter business. Mr W. D. (Jack) Lowe, BA's director of flight crew for Concorde says the airline remains 'very happy with our Concorde operation; it has a beautiful niche.' In spite of Concorde's age, Mr Lowe says BA 'has every intention of keeping it flying well into the next century'. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that it will be necessary to replace Concorde one day. Since the benefits of supersonic flight are 'enormous', he has no doubt that Concorde will be superseded by a second generation supersonic aircraft. 'It took just over 60 years to get from the Wright Brothers to Concorde. It is not a case of 'if', it's a case of 'when', and it's 'when' that will decide what we end up with,' he says. His enthusiasm appears to be shared by others, in particular by the informal seven-nation group of companies which has quietly been examining the feasibility for a successor to Concorde - dubbed rather unflatteringly, the High Speed Commercial Transport (HSCT). For several years, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US, Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) of Germany have been studying the possibility of such an aircraft. More recently, they have been joined by Italian, Russian and Japanese industry representatives in the Supersonic Commercial Transport International Co-operation Study Group, or more informally 'the supersonic club'. The group has been concentrating on three main issues, the technological requirements for a second generation supersonic airliner, environmental considerations and finally the potential market for the new jet. Mr Bob McKinlay, who heads BAe's Airbus programme, says that although there are still technical and other unresolved issues, the group's preliminary conclusion 'is that there don't seem to be any show stoppers'. Like the airlines, the aerospace industry believes the only real questions are when a new supersonic aircraft will be built, and who will be in the final consortium. The study project is being pushed forward in stages, but the consensus view is that, providing no insurmountable technological hurdles are encountered, the go-ahead could be given soon after the end of the decade and that the aircraft could be in service somewhere between 2005 and 2010. Convincing others outside the industry, especially environmentalists and the governments that will probably have to subscribe most of the Dollars 5bn-plus cost, is likely to be as difficult as agreeing on a design in which the manufacturers can share. But time is running out if the option of travelling at supersonic speed is to be continuously maintained. By the turn of the century Concorde will have been in regular service for nearly 25 years. That is normally about the maximum life-span for an airliner, although Concorde's annual usage is much lower. Nevertheless, if any HSCT is to enter service in the early part of the next century, much of the preliminary research and development must be undertaken in the current decade. Perhaps the most critical factor in the final decision on whether to go ahead with a 'son of Concorde' is the likely market for supersonic travel. Concorde, with its payload of only 100 seats, has always been viewed as a 'top persons' airliner', with a premium fare which has limited its market. But there is now a wider appreciation of the benefits of faster travel, as more people fly longer non-stop distances. By 2000, it is believed that long-distance traffic will have doubled in volume, stimulated by such new-generation subsonic long-range airliners such as the Airbus A-340, Boeing 747-400 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. There are differing views about the size of the potential market. Some believe that demand in the first quarter of the next century could justify up to as many as 1,000 new supersonic aircraft, worth some Dollars 200-300bn, collectively carrying up to as many as 600,000 passengers a day. But European analysts, with the reality of Concorde behind them, tend to be more cautious, assessing the market at no more than a few hundred or so aircraft. To be commercially viable, the next generation of supersonic airliners will have to be much bigger than Concorde, fly slightly faster and have a significantly longer range. Although he emphasises no formal decision to go ahead has been taken, Mr McKinlay believes any new supersonic aircraft would need to seat 250 to 300 people in several classes, fly at between Mach 2 and Mach 2.25 and have a range in excess of 5,500 miles compared to Concorde's 3,500 miles. The range is critical because it would open up new high density routes such as the trans-Pacific routes from America's west coast to Asia, for instance Los Angeles to Tokyo. But to achieve ranges of that order, the new aircraft will need to utilise high technology, low weight materials and a specialised power plant - probably a form of variable cycle engine which would help it meet some of the environmental noise objections while flying at subsonic speeds. Such an aircraft could cut many long distance journey times in half and help attract new travellers to supersonic flight. Nevertheless fares, although perhaps not as high as Concorde, will probably still reflect a technology premium for supersonic travel. The HSCT will be expensive to build and is likely to face even more severe environmental demands than Concorde in terms of noise levels and pollution. Meeting those demands will be difficult technologically and financially - far beyond the capabilities of any one company. There is no doubt that the HSCT, whenever it is built, will have to be a consortium venture.</p>

			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Mortgage interest rate predictions MORTGAGE INTEREST rates should fall in 1992 according to some banks and building societies, but others think there may be little overall change during the year. Halifax, the largest UK mortgage lender, expects rates will drop by a full percentage point during the year to stand at 10.5 per cent by December. Bradford &amp; Bingley, the eighth-largest building society, also forecasts a 10.5 per cent mortgage rate by December. Others are more cautious. Abbey National, the second-largest lender, is forecasting a slightly higher mortgage interest rate than Halifax. It expects a rate around 11.15 per cent at the end of this year. Woolwich Building Society and Household Mortgage Corporation both say mortgage interest rates at the end of the year will be back where they are today: 11.5 per cent.</p>

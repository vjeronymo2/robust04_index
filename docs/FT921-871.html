			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (3): More call for change - Stock Market CALLS for radical change in the structure of the Japanese stock market are no longer the preserve of foreign analysts. The persistent weakness of stock prices is leading even those close to the heart of the system to question whether a rally can be sustained without a change in the attitude of Japanese companies and investors towards equity investment. Last year, many market participants were anticipating a cyclical upturn in equity prices as lower interest rates fed into an improved economic outlook and increased buying of equities by domestic investors. Foreign investors shared this view, pumping Dollars 46bn into the market last year at a time when most domestic investors remained on the sidelines. Yet even though short-term interest rates have been cut to 4.5 per cent, from 6 per cent in 1990, equity prices remain in the doldrums. The Nikkei index closed below 20,000 on March 16 for the first time since February 1987. There is a perception that the equity market has never found a level at which an equilibrium of buyers and sellers provides a foundation for recovery. 'Tokyo stock prices were never allowed to hit bottom,' argued Mr Gilles Piard, president of Societe Generale in Tokyo. 'We are now caught in the silt.' The main target for domestic criticism is the low level of dividends paid by Japanese companies. Even after a near 50 per cent fall in share prices since 1989, the Tokyo stock market yields just 0.7 per cent. The Japanese Securities Dealers Association recently issued guidelines which would prevent companies which pay out less than 30 per cent of earnings in dividends from issuing more shares raising equity-linked finance. In the absence of dividend income, the only incentive to buy Japanese equities is the prospect of a large capital gain. Since there is now deep uncertainty about the prospect for share price appreciation, domestic buying of equities has almost ceased. Daily turnover on the Tokyo stock exchange now averages around 200m shares, well below the peak of 1,700m shares a day in June 1988. Yet the low level of dividends may only be a symptom of a deeper malaise. Low dividends are partly the result of the system of equity cross-holdings between Japanese companies. Analysts estimate out of a total market capitalisation of Y340,000bn, only Y150,000bn is ever likely to be traded. The rest comprises long-term strategic stakes which cement relationships between corporations. In addition, many companies diverted surplus cash into the equity market in the 1980s as a way of boosting profitability. The money was mostly invested through tokkin funds, which allow the companies to account separately for financial assets and convert the capital gain from rising stock prices into a cash dividend. Until recently, pension funds and life assurance companies have also not demanded dividend growth. Most face only limited competition and fixed liabilities rather than pay-outs linked to inflation. Investment strategy has been geared to security rather than real dividend growth. However, even if Japanese companies paid out all of their forecast 1991 earnings in dividends the Tokyo stock market would still yield only 2 per cent. Inflation is forecast to run at about 2 per cent this year. Such figures have prompted calls for a change in industrial objectives away from the pursuit of market share and towards higher margins. 'Japanese companies must start to concentrate on return on equity rather than market share,' commented Mr Atsushi Saito, executive managing director at Nomura. 'This should be reflected in accountability and the treatment of shareholders.' Until these kinds of structural changes are achieved, the only factor likely to support stock prices is anticipation of economic recovery, a further expansion of global market share by Japanese companies and a resulting rise in share prices. A favourite analogy among analysts is that the Japanese economy and stock market is like a bicycle: it can only remain in balance when travelling fast. It remains to be seen whether the authorities can generate sufficient economic momentum to restore confidence. Monetary easing alone has yet to provide sufficient stimulus and many economists see the need for a substantial fiscal boost. Yet there is little prospect of an expansionary fiscal policy while government remains preoccupied with the recent succession of financial scandals. The budget before the upper house of the Japanese parliament will increase government expenditure by a modest 2.7 per cent. Meanwhile, analysts are forecasting a 15-18 per cent decline in corporate earnings for the year to the end of March. A 6-8 per cent decline is expected for the year ended March 1993. The squeeze on corporate profits could multiply into further stock market weakness. Liquidation corporate sector financial assets was a key factor in the fall of the Nikkei average below 20,000 as tokkin funds were wound down ahead of the year end. Mr Peter Tasker, equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, estimated that Y6,000 to Y8,000bn equity investments held by tokkin funds could be liquidated this year. This amounts to around 5 per cent of liquid market capitalisation. If it comes, the impact of such a liquidation will depend on whether other buyers have returned. Anecdotal evidence suggests the consistent buying of equities by overseas investors has now ceased. Against this, Japanese retail investors bought a net Y50bn equities in February, the first month of net buying since April 1991. Many analysts do see long-term value in Japanese equities at present levels. Mr Peter Norton, head of research at Baring Securities in Japan, predicts profits growth of up to 25 per cent in the year to March 1994 as Japanese companies benefit from a cyclical upturn in the world economy and greater efficiency, particularly in the service sector. Mr Norton's biggest concern is that the domestic focus has swung too far towards gloomy introspection. 'The weakness of the equity market is in itself distorting perceptions of the fundamental strengths of the Japanese economy,' he said.</p>

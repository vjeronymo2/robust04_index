			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Life insurance and you - Fifth in Anthony Bailey's series on the true costs of investing Much publicity about the life insurance industry in recent years has been for the wrong reasons. In particular, there have been worries that some endowment policies taken out to pay off mortgages may not provide enough. Then, too, there is evidence of widespread mis-selling, with many investors getting very poor returns when they surrender policies before maturity. Despite this, investment-based life insurance plans continue to be held widely. Why? Perhaps there is no mystery. Much of the life insurance industry's malaise can be put down to the pressure on sales staff to sell their wares, regardless of suitability or investment potential. For this, they can earn huge commissions. A 10-year policy with a monthly premium of Pounds 100 could earn a salesman Pounds 400, and Pounds 850 on a 25-year policy - possibly a lot more. Yet, paradoxically, commission is not the way to measure the cost of this form of investment. What matters just as much is a policy's overall costs - the money which is not working for you. In this context, you need to look at a company's overall expenses (of which commission might form a part) or tot up specific charges (from which commission is just one of the expenses paid). Unit-linked polices With unit-linked polices, at least charges are stated explicitly. But, invariably, they are in the small print of the documents you get, and may require close reading to discover exactly what they mean. Then, too, in practice there is wide variation. Here are some of the things to look for The bid-offer spread is reasonably straightforward. The bid (selling) price of a unit is usually set at 5 per cent lower than the offer (buying) price. This is the price of entry into the fund - an initial charge. The annual charge is also fairly easy on the brain. A percentage of the value of your fund is deducted throughout the life of the policy. A typical charge is 1 per cent a year. The allocation rate complicates things. This shows how much of your money is used to buy units and might vary during the life of the policy. A rate of 102 per cent sounds like a deft sleight of hand: can a company credit you with more money than you invest? Not really. This rate is a way of varying the initial charge implied in the usual 5 per cent spread. For example, Pounds 100 is used to buy units. An allocation rate of 102 per cent leaves about Pounds 97 invested. A 95 per cent rate would leave about Pounds 90 invested. Not surprisingly, a nil per cent allocation means nil invested. And that is just what you get with some policies - nil allocation for the first year or two. Your money is used to pay for setting-up expenses, such as commission. Capital units are not as capital as they may sound: they cost you more. The annual charge deducted from those units could be 4 per cent instead of 1. You could get capital units in the first year or two of a regular premium policy. Before your money is used to buy any units at all, there are two other deductions. First is what might be called policy fee, deducted each month. Because it is a flat-rate fee, it bites harder on lower premiums. A Pounds 2 fee on a Pounds 50 premium is a not-insignificant 4 per cent. Then there is a mortality charge, the cost of the investment's life insurance element. This will vary depending on your age, sex, whether you smoke, and on the life company running the plan. With-profits policies There are no explicit charges on these plans, which makes it impossible to compare costs with unit-linked policies and other investments. The best you can do is to find out the reduction in the annual yield. This is an imprecise figure which can give only an approximate idea of how expenses and costs may affect your returns. A reduction of 3 per cent means that a projected annual return of 10 per cent would fall to 7 per cent because of costs. The reduction in annual yield excludes the cost of life cover - the mortality charge. How costs reduce pay-outs Two well-respected insurance companies provided figures on how costs reduce returns. Both relate to Pounds 50 monthly premiums for a male aged 30 next birthday. Equitable Life quoted for a with-profits policy and an assumed rate of growth of 8 per cent. A 10-year policy would be worth Pounds 9,048 if all the premiums were invested, but that drops by about 8 per cent after expenses to Pounds 8,355. The difference on a 25-year policy is about 11 per cent: Pounds 40,837 instead of Pounds 45,833. A Standard Life unit-linked policy with an assumed rate of growth of 7.5 per cent would be worth Pounds 8,829 without charges, but that falls by 14 per cent to Pounds 7,544. Over 25 years, a return of Pounds 42,425 falls by 21 per cent to Pounds 33,320. New rules on disclosure of costs From January, life insurance companies and financial advisers will have to provide much more information. This will show the effect of any costs on cash pay-outs, both at maturity and if you cash in the policy early. The result of this new regime could be to force down costs (including commission) as companies seek ways to become more competitive. It could also mean that many investors are deterred from buying life insurance-based investments altogether as they discover more flexible, cost-effective ways to make their money work for them. Tax This is not normally considered an investment cost but it is a factor for some investors. There is no tax on so-called qualifying policies (but that is more of interest to higher-rate taxpayers and those who pay capital gains tax). Basic-rate tax and some capital gains tax is met by the life company before an investor is paid out, and cannot be reclaimed.  -------------------------- COST CHECK  -------------------------- Service charge         Cost  -------------------------- Commission              ...

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Balance of payments eases City fears Fears that economic recovery might create a serious balance of payments problem were eased further yesterday by figures showing a significant improvement. The Central Statistical Office said the UK current account deficit was Pounds 0.7bn in the second quarter of this year, down from the previous quarter's figure of Pounds 1.3bn. The deficit was considerably smaller than the City had expected, and economists welcomed it as evidence that the UK recovery was proceeding at an increasingly healthy pace. Mr Paul Turnbull, UK economist at brokers Smith New Court, said: 'A year ago a lot of people were forecasting that the balance of payments would spiral out of control. In fact the opposite has happened.' One reason for the improvement was that exports grew steadily in the second quarter while imports fell slightly. Most analysts expect this trend to continue, not least because of the rapid recovery in continental Europe and other big export markets. The other reason for the improvement was that the surplus on 'invisibles' remained at the same high level in the second quarter. Invisibles cover services, investment incomes and financial transfers. Although the invisibles account is considered to be notoriously volatile, most City analysts had expected it to fall back in the second quarter after surging suddenly in the first three months. The surplus on invisibles was Pounds 1.7bn in the second quarter, unchanged on the first quarter and sharply up from the same period a year ago when the surplus was Pounds 0.2bn. This flat overall figure, however, concealed a significant shift in the different sectors. The surplus on services fell to Pounds 0.8bn, down from Pounds 1.2bn in the first quarter, mainly because of a fall in the surplus on financial services. This drop reflected a lower surplus in the insurance sector and some weakening in activity by security markets, the CSO said. The surplus on investment income, by contrast, rose to Pounds 2.4bn in the second quarter, up from Pounds 1.9bn in the first quarter and sharply higher than the same period a year ago when the surplus was Pounds 0.4bn. The main reason for the increase, the CSO said, was a large inflow of investment into the UK in the second quarter after a large flow of investment abroad in the first three months. Mr David Hellier, UK economist with NatWest Markets, said: 'This reflects instability in the financial markets. A lot of people have been repatriating funds and that has dominated the flows.' Meanwhile, the deficit of lending and borrowing by UK residents other than banks and the government fell considerably to Pounds 1bn in the second quarter, down from the high level of Pounds 1.7bn in the first quarter.</p>

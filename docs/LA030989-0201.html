			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITES WIDEN INCOME GAP, STUDY SHOWS;  </P> <P> MEDIAN PAY SLIPS FOR BLACK, LATINO FAMILIES  </P> <P> Southern whites who have been to college and now live in the suburbs of a small  city are likely making the most progress in bettering their financial standing,  a Census Bureau analysis indicated Wednesday.  </P> <P> Overall, white families increased their median income by 1.1% from 1986 to  1987, while the incomes of black and Latino families slipped, according to the  report "Money Income of Households, Families and Persons in the United States:  1987."  </P> <P> The 1987 median income of white families was $32,274, up from $31,935 a year  earlier, the report said.  </P> <P> By comparison, median income for blacks was $18,098, down from $18,247. For  Latinos, the median fell to $20,306 from $20,726, according to the study, an  expanded version of an analysis released in August that found nearly one-third  of all black Americans living in poverty.  </P> <P> While the earlier report detailed the poverty status of various segments of  society, the new edition contains extensive detail on income for differing  groups.  </P> <P> Among family groups, the highest incomes were reported for white married  couples at $35,295, up from $34,647. Black married couples saw their median  income fall from $27,554 to $27,182; for Latino couples, the figure dropped  from $24,786 to $24,677.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some College Helped  </P> <P> White families maintained by a woman with no husband present had an income  increase from $16,290 to $17,018.  </P> <P> Black female heads of households reported an increase from $9,640 to $9,710.  Among Latinos, the median for this group edged up from $9,777 to $9,805.  </P> <P> The biggest income gain by education was for people with from one to three  years of college. Families headed by people in this category saw their incomes  rise from $35,455 to $36,392.  </P> <P> Ranked by education, families headed by people with more than five years of  college still had the highest income at $54,491, but that was down a bit, from  $54,595. And for those with four years of college, income fell from $47,269 to  $46,533.  </P> <P> High school graduates saw an 0.6% increase from $29,765 to $29,937, while  income for families headed by those with some high school education climbed  from $20,854 to $21,265. Family income for those with no high school education  fell from $14,616 to $14,547.  </P> <P> Regionally, Southerners led in income gains, with median family income rising  from $27,684 to $28,250, up 2%.  </P> <P> Despite having the largest gain, Southerners continue to have the nation's  lowest median income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drop in Inner Cities  </P> <P> In the Northeast, the rise was 1.8%, from $33,335 to $33,938, and, in the  Midwest, 1.1%, from $30,665 to $30,991. In the West, median income slipped 0.2%  from $32,096 to $32,026.  </P> <P> By residence, the greatest gain was 3.6% for families living in the suburbs of  cities with less than 1 million people. Their income rose from $32,034 to  $33,192.  </P> <P> Rural residents were next, increasing their incomes 1.3%, from $24,078 to  $24,397. Large-city suburbanites had income growth of 1.1% from $39,850 to  $40,270.  </P> <P> Inner-city residents of large cities had an income drop from $27,654 to  $27,458, while families in smaller inner cities saw their income dip from  $27,614 to $27,294.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>   [Text] East London April 4 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk  should tell kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi to stop  his nonsense because the African National Congress was not  prepared to postpone the election, Major-General Bantu Holomisa  said on Monday. Gen Holomisa, who heads Transkei's Military  Council and is also a senior ANC candidate for the National  Assembly, was speaking to about 4,000 people at an ANC rally in  a sports stadium at Duncan Village, East London. The rally was  shifted at the last minute from a venue in a community hall when  it became clear that the hall could not accommodate the number  of people who wanted to hear him.    Gen Holomisa said kwaZulu was under President de Klerk's  jurisdiction. "He must not create an impression that kwaZulu is  an independent state. It is him personally who must see there  is stability in that area."    The ANC was not impressed by Mr de Klerk's attempts to draw  its president Mr Nelson Mandela and other people into the  conflict. "All he must do is to tell Buthelezi that the nonsense  must stop now, and it must stop as soon as possible, because we  are not prepared to postpone the elections in South Africa  because of one man."    Gen Holomisa also said under a new government, all weapons,  which had been handed over by the state to whites "under the  pretext of self defence", would be confiscated and returned to  armouries. This included weaponry issued to SADF [South African  Defense Force] Citizen Force Commandos. It was these weapons  which had been used to kill people in Bophuthatswana. There  were also people in the community who owned illegal weapons.  "We must come up with a campaign to make sure we demilitarise  our population," he said. Ordinary citizens who had licensed  private firearms would be allowed to keep them.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Unions stress block nature of delegates' single votes The leaders of the largest unions inflicted a severe embarrassment on Mr Tony Blair last night by insisting that the abolition of their block votes did not mean their delegates could vote as individuals at Labour's annual conference. They stressed that the delegates were mandated collectively by their unions to vote in line with union policy. Under new rules which came into force this year to modernise the party, the block vote has been abolished. Every delegate to the conference, including those in the unions, is now entitled to vote individually. A party circular released yesterday said: 'There will be no block voting at this year's conference; it will be a matter for individual delegates to decide how they cast their vote. For the first time every delegate to conference will be issued with a separate bar-coded voting card for card votes.' Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, said last night: 'This is a major and dramatic breakthrough', but he added: 'The intention was not to preclude mandating delegates where they are bound by a union policy.' The 27 unions affiliated to Labour still have 70 per cent or 4m of the votes to be cast in the party conference. Senior union leaders made clear last night that their delegates might all have individual voting cards, but they would vote to back the collective decisions of their unions. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said that his union's delegates were at the conference 'to represent the views and policies of the GMB. They have no mandate to do anything else'. He added: 'It would be unthinkable for somebody to come here and cast a vote against GMB policy.' Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'We will expect every delegate to cast their votes strictly in line with the policy of our union. We have decided collectively how the individuals on our delegation will be voting. Nobody here for the TGWU represents themselves as an individual.' The same view was also expressed by Mr Paul Gallagher, the rightwing general secretary of the AEEU engineering union. He said: 'Our delegates will be free to vote any way they wish unless the issue being debated is a matter of union policy, already decided by a much wider democratic process, a conference of lay members.' Later his union backtracked when Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU president, denied that the delegates were mandated and said they would be allowed to vote individually. Mr John Maples, Conservative party vice-chairman, attacked the move as showing that in spite of the reforms, 'the union bosses are back controlling the conference'.</p>

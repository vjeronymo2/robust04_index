			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Nupe to ballot on Labour elections THE Nupe public service union yesterday became the first big union to agree to ballot members in the election for leader and deputy leader of the Labour party, David Goodhart writes. The EETPU electricians' union decided to seek the opinions of a random sample of 10,000 members who pay the political levy and of its delegates to local Labour parties. The refusal of several big unions - particularly the TGWU general union and the AEU engineering union - to ballot their members reflects growing friction between Labour and the unions. Some officials believe the tension could help speed up a radical reform of union-Labour links. Yesterday Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, insisted that the union block vote at Labour conferences must be reformed, but not abolished. Mr Morris said yesterday he hoped many TGWU branches would ballot on the Labour leadership. On Monday the union's executive rejected Mr Morris's preferred option of a union-wide ballot.</p>

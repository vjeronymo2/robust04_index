			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / More strategy, less small print: European Union leaders should concentrate on leading, not on following every shift in public opinion For politicians and political analysts, election results are irresistible. Even when the direct consequences are insignificant and the turnout low, you still get a much bigger sample of public opinion than in any mere opinion poll. So we eagerly weigh the results of last weekend's elections to see whether German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is now sure of re-election in October, or whether UK Prime Minister John Major can survive. Fair enough, so long as one remembers that many more people will vote in national elections, and that those who did vote would not necessarily vote the same way if they were choosing a government. Since they were actually choosing a European Parliament, and since the results were released in all 12 European Union member states on the same day, it is even more tempting to draw conclusions about the political future of Europe as a whole. More tempting, but also more hazardous. The low turnout suggests that many voters either had no strong feelings on pan-European issues, or were not convinced that this election offered an effective way to express those feelings. Among those who did turn out, significant minorities in France and Denmark voted for lists whose main plank was opposition to the Maastricht treaty. Elsewhere, the vast majority voted for candidates whose position on European issues was only one feature, and usually not the most prominent, in their general political profile. The parliament itself may be less single-minded, and therefore less effective in seeking a further increase in its own powers, than was its predecessor. But its views on that subject tend in any case to be discounted by governments, which still wield most of the real power. More significant will be the French prime minister's need to look over his shoulder at Mr Philippe de Villiers, the Euro-sceptic leader whose supporters will have to be wooed by anyone hoping to be the standard-bearer of the right in next year's presidential election. And all 12 governments, in preparing their positions for the 1996 Maastricht revision conference, will have to bear in mind the extreme difficulty of winning the Danish electorate's assent to new measures of European integration - though after the gruelling saga of Maastricht ratification, they should hardly need reminding of that. Public opinion within the EU is clearly going to be an important factor in determining its future, and the Maastricht saga well illustrates the perils of neglecting it. But the task of European leaders in the next few years is not to respond slavishly to every perceived shift in public opinion, but rather to use the institutions of the EU, and to adapt them where necessary, to deal with problems that call for a common European response. If they do this, and if they can show clearly that this is what they are doing, they should not find it too difficult to carry public opinion with them. What are those problems? It is almost a knee-jerk response to say that the first and direst is unemployment. High unemployment is indeed something of a European disease, but it is not certain that the remedies for it are best adopted at the EU level. Most of the suggestions in the recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report on the subject are still within the competence of member states. Consensus on the precise policy mix will be hard to achieve, and there is a lot to be said for letting individual states experiment with different approaches, and learn from each other's successes and failures, so long as these different approaches do not constitute non-tariff barriers to trade or to the free movement of capital and labour. The contribution the EU can make to reducing unemployment lies precisely in demolishing such barriers, and preventing new ones from being erected. Internally, it must preserve and improve the single market. Externally it must build on the success of the Uruguay Round, and above all encourage the growth of central and east European economies, where geography should give an edge to west European exporters and investors over their global competitors. Expanding its market to include central and eastern Europe is clearly in the EU's economic interest, even if there are short-term costs such as accelerated job losses in so-called 'sensitive' sectors, meaning those where the west European workforce is anyway shrinking rapidly. As with employment, so with the environment. Some aspects of the problem can best be dealt with at national or even sub-national level, others on the scale of the planet. But there is an obvious task for the EU in preserving natural resources which are used by residents of more than one member state, and in combating pollution which spills across state frontiers. That also implies planning the transcontinental infrastructure, especially the transport networks, in ways which preserve rural tranquillity as far as possible. At present the EU is perceived by public opinion in many member states as eco-hostile, not least because of the incentives it gives to maximise agricultural productivity with intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, and with little concern either for the quality of the product or for the effect on the countryside. That can, and should, be changed. But probably the EU's most urgent task lies in the area of security. Conventional British wisdom has it that security should be left to Nato, and that for the EU to meddle in it would risk weakening the all-important link with the US. That wisdom is out of date. President Bill Clinton, during his D-day tour of Europe, positively egged on the creation of separate European defence structures. He promised that the US would 'remain engaged' in Europe and honour its Nato commitments, but added: 'We also want Europe to be strong. That is why America supports Europe's own steps so far toward greater unity - the European Union, the Western European Union and the development of a European defence identity.' There is an important subtext here. Mr Clinton was elected to give priority to US domestic problems and economic interests, and if anything his determination to do that has been strengthened by the vicissitudes of the last year. His 'presidential decision' on multilateral peace operations, issued last month after a full year's gestation, sets tight limits on the operations the US will support and even tighter ones on those it will participate in. In Europe, Mr Clinton claims to be committed to deploy ground troops in Bosnia, but only after a full peace agreement is reached, and if Congress agrees. Likewise he claims to be committed to expansion of Nato eastwards, but at some unspecified date in the future. For today there is only 'security co-operation everywhere in Europe'. Unless Russia begins again to look seriously aggressive, that will not mean much more than joint military exercises. His message to Europe is very clear, and can be paraphrased thus: 'If you are attacked, we are still with you. But for the moment, thanks to our past efforts, you are not in danger and we have other fish to fry. For God's sake organise yourselves, bring central Europe within your fold while the going is good, and deal with the problems on your frontiers so that Europe does not again become a major worry for us. We will give you logistical and air support, but we will not expose our troops to casualties on the ground.' That is the agenda Europe has to deal with in the next few years. To do so effectively will require a pooling of sovereignty in the very sensitive areas of defence and foreign policy - for which, according to today's wisdom, public opinion is not ready. Yet it is a task which should be much easier to explain to public opinion than the need to standardise electric sockets, or to spray fields with weedkiller to prevent anything growing in them. If the EU had been able to save Bosnia, its citizens would have a clearer idea of what it was for.</p>

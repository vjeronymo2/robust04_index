			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Take-home pay gulf broadens The gulf between the take-home pay of chief executives and that of other employees has broadened markedly in the past 15 years according to figures released today by a leading employment researcher, Richard Donkin writes. Comparisons published by Incomes Data Services in its latest management pay review also demonstrate that recent government figures recognising that the tax burden had shifted conspicuously from high to low earners did not show the full extent of the earnings gap that had developed. While the take-home pay of employees on average earnings has grown fourfold since 1978-79, chief executives' pay after deductions has increased on average more than sixfold, according to the report. The differences in the rate at which earnings have multiplied become apparent when comparing gross earnings of both income groups. In the period from 1978-79 to 1994-95, the average gross earnings of a chief executive rose by nearly six times from Pounds 18,333 to the Pounds 106,168 that would be earned in the coming financial year. The gross pay of those on average earnings increased by just over four times from Pounds 4,826 to a projected Pounds 19,463 in the same period. Changes in the tax regime only served to compound the effect on differentials, says the report. IDS Management Pay Review. IDS, 193 St John Street, London EC1V 4LS. By subscription.</p>

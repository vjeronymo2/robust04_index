			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid falls 1.7 per cent after Socialist victory BOURSES demonstrated more volatility than of late yesterday, on political swings, on profit-taking and on technical grounds, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID took its losses mostly in the banking sector as the general index dropped 4.42, or 1.7 per cent to 256.82. The Socialist election victory reduced the prospect of interest rate cuts. Among banks, BBV fell Pta75 to Pta3,090 and Central Hispano by Pta100 to Pta3,400. Turnover eased by Pta3bn to Pta20.1bn. Rationalisation measures in the energy market left most utilities flat, and relatively strong but Endesa, perceived as the loser in this situation, fell Pta110 to Pta4,365. FRANKFURT accelerated its rate of advance, the DAX index closing 17.76, or 1.1 per cent higher at 1,655.61 as turnover rose from DM5.1bn to DM5.2bn. Dealers said that trade was mainly chart driven. In the automotive sector, BMW rose by DM8.80 to DM464.50, Daimler by DM11.80 to DM573.80 and Volkswagen by DM6.80 to DM331.50. There were reports of a number of 'buy' recommendations for carmakers from major German banks. The 'big three' banks, however, did not speak in unison. DB Research was optimistic for Daimler, but it saw sales volume problems at Volkswagen. At Dresdner, Mr Lothar Weniger said that the bank had reduced the underweighting level of Daimler in mid-May, and that it was about to go up to market weight. Commerzbank said that it was recommending banks, insurance companies and the major chemicals as equity investments, and carmakers - particularly VW and Daimler - for trading purposes. PARIS was lifted mainly by futures driven trading in the absence of major corporate news. However, overall sentiment was helped as a number of international fund managers lifted their market weighting on France. Nomura, for instance, has recently issued an upbeat comment on French equities, noting in particular that domestic interest rates are likely to continue falling, while weakness of the DM is expected to slow down, 'if not entirely halt', the pace of German monetary easing. The CAC-40 index rose 28.17 to 1,887.86, but off the day's best level of 1,894. Turnover was FFr3bn. The oil sector featured ahead of today's Opec meeting in Geneva: Total gained FFr4 to FFr272 and Elf Aquitaine FFr5.70 to FFr380.30. MILAN suffered as investors gave a broadly negative reaction to the news, announced after Friday's close, that Ferruzzi had appointed five banks, including Mediobanca and BCI, to draw up a restructuring plan for the group. The banks are the group's major creditors and some analysts have suggested that a debt-for-equity swap may be arranged. Ferruzzi finished down L47.90 or 4.5 per cent at L968.10, but off a year's low of L956, while Montedison slipped L52 or 4.6 per cent to L1,080. The Comit index closed down 10.74 at 520.68 in low turnover estimated to be around L200bn. Mr John Stewart of Milan brokers Pastorino commented that a number of factors had been exercising a brake on the market recently: the euphoria following the change of government had now died down; the privatisation programme remained confused; and corporate results over the last couple of weeks had underlined the debt burden of many major groups. Another strong influence on the market yesterday was Sunday's first round voting in municipal elections which showed waning support for the main parties. ZURICH celebrated a second consecutive record high with the SMI index closing 24.6 higher at 2,308.9. Banks led the market, SBC rising by SFr6 to SFr381 and CS Holding, ex a SFr75 dividend and ex rights worth SFr67 a share, ending a net SFr42 higher at SFr2,580. AMSTERDAM showed a strong finish helped by a strong dollar and German market. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.0 to 105.7. Among the day's best performers, Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.70 to Fl 167.60 and Unilever, up Fl 1.20 to Fl 194.30, advanced on the currency theme. HELSINKI fell 1.8 per cent in thin trading, the Hex index off 21.7 at 1,143.3, as investors awaited the publication of interim results. ISTANBUL, closed last week for a religious holiday, put on 2.5 per cent on expectations of good half year results, and ignoring a rise in monthly inflation data. The 75-share index improved 208.19 to 8,583.94 in turnover of some TL800bn. TEL AVIV climbed in active trading on optimism over Middle East peace prospects, the Mishtanim index rising 4.59, or 2.3 per cent to 205.05 in turnover of Shk226m. WARSAW dropped 9.5 per cent, 15 of its 17 stocks hitting their limit down of 10 per cent as the WIG index dropped another 319.7 to 3,034.2. Turnover was only 82bn zloty, after 371.9bn last Thursday. The following notice was issued last Friday by the FT-SE Eurotrack indices committee: The FT-SE Eurotrack indices committee has today approved, following the announcement that the Bearer and Part Certificated lines of Nestle will be converted into the Registered Stocks, that both Nokia (Finland) and CRH (Ireland) will become constituents of the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 and 200 indices.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- June 7                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1161.47    1162.17    1163.03    1163.81 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1213.65    1214.39    1215.16    1216.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1164.46    1165.84    1167.41    1167.78 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1216.04    1217.01    1218.96    1219.66  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          June 4    June 3    June 2    June 1    May 28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1159.95   1160.81   1155.78   1153.22   1161.58 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1214.21   1217.28   1215.58   1215.43   1224.85  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1168.30 ; 200 -  1220.45 Low/day: 100 -  1161.41  200 -  1213.51 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

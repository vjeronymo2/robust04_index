			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart L_Targeted Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 400.310 establishes that the basis and scope of this subpart is to set forth requirements concerning grants to States under 12(c)(2) of the INA for targeted assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.311 establishes a definition for ``targeted assistance grants''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.312 requires that a State must provide any individual wishing to do so an opportunity to apply for targeted assistance services and determine the eligibility of each applicant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.313 requires that a State must use its targeted assistance grant primarily for employability services designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs with less than one year's participation in the targeted assistance program in order to achieve economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible. Targeted assistance services may continue to be provided after a refugee has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. Targeted assistance funds may not be used for long-term training programs such as vocational training that last for more than a year or educational programs that are not intended to lead to employment within a year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.314 establishes client priorities for targeted assistance services in the following order of priority: (1) Cash assistance recipients, particularly long-term recipients; (2) unemployed refugees who are not receiving cash assistance; and (3) employed refugees in need of services to retain employment or to attain economic independence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.315 establishes that the same standards and criteria that are applied in the determination of eligibility for refugee social services under &sect;&sect;400.150 and 400.152(a) shall be applied in the determination of eligibility for targeted assistance services. Section 400.315 limits the provision of targeted assistance services to refugees who have been in the U.S. for 60 months or less, except that refugees who are receiving employability services, as defined in &sect;400.316, as of September 30, 1995, as part of an employability plan, may continue to receive those services through September 30, 1996, or until the services are completed, whichever occurs first, regardless of their length of residence in the U.S. As of the effective date of this requirement, the time-limitation on services will apply regardless of which fiscal year of funding is used to provide the services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.316 establishes that a State may provide the same scope of services under targeted assistance as may be provided under refugee social services under &sect;&sect;400.154 and 400.155, with the exception of &sect;40&sect;.155(g). Since the purpose of the targeted assistance program is to direct resources to localities that have large refugee populations and high use of public assistance by refugees, our intent is to focus the use of targeted assistance funds on employability services aimed at economic self-sufficiency, while providing States and counties some flexibility to use the funds for nonemployment-related services. Thus, we have included the nonemployment-related services that are allowable under &sect;400.155, but have not included the new category of services that has been added under &sect;400.155(g), which includes services to strengthen family and community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.317 establishes that a State must adhere to the same limitations and restrictions in the provision of targeted assistance services as are applied to the provision of refugee social services under &sect;400.156. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.318 establishes that eligible grantees under the targeted assistance program are those agencies of State governments which are responsible for the refugee program under &sect;400.5 in States containing counties which qualify for targeted assistance awards. Section 400.318 also establishes that the use of targeted assistance funds for services to Cuban and Haitian entrants is limited to States which have an approved State plan under the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program (CHEP). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 400.319 establishes that a State with more than one qualifying targeted assistance county may allocate its targeted assistance funds differently from the formula allocations for counties presented in the ORR targeted assistance notice in a fiscal year, only on the basis of its population of refugees who arrived in the U.S. during the most recent 5-year period. Section 400.319 also establishes that a State must assure that not less than 95 percent of the total award to the State is made available to the qualified county or counties, except in those cases where the qualified county or counties have agreed to let the State administer the targeted assistance program in the county's stead. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Effective Dates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The anticipated effective date for &sect;&sect;400.152(b), 400.315(b), and 400.319(a) is October 1, 1995, while the anticipated effective date for all other sections is October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome while still achieving the regulatory objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

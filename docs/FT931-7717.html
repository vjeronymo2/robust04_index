			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Personal View: Getting the benefit out of a job Most people greatly prefer to work for pay rather than receive government support for remaining idle. Nevertheless, the present UK government - like many of its predecessors and others elsewhere - discourages people from working, by paying them when they are unemployed and then removing these benefits and imposing taxes when they become employed again. The most straightforward way out of this unemployment trap is to introduce a policy that encourages employment. My proposal, the benefit transfer programme (BTP), is designed to do just that. It would give the unemployed the option of transferring all the funds that finance their benefits - unemployment benefit, income support, and the associated rebates and provisions in kind - to provide wage subsidies to the companies which hire them. The size of the subsidy would depend on the length of each worker's latest unemployment spell. Companies could qualify only if they increased their workforces or provided the newly hired workers with training at least equal in value to the subsidy. Thus, companies would have an incentive to expand employment, rather than replace employees with subsidised ones. Since the BTP would be voluntary, unemployed workers would transfer their benefits only when the resulting wages would make them significantly better off. Companies would hire these workers only when this raised profitability. Since the total amount spent on the wage subsidies is equal to the amount that would have been spent on unemployment support, all this could be achieved at no extra cost to the government. The programme would give the government an instrument for tackling head-on the problem of long-term unemployment. When people fall into the unemployment trap, their skills erode, they lose their motivation to find jobs, and employers become wary of hiring them. The current unemployment benefit system provides little countervailing incentive for the long-term unemployed to find work. To give workers with different unemployment histories a level playing field, the BTP provides progressively larger incentives for companies to hire workers with longer unemployment spells. People who have been unemployed for two years or longer would be entitled to the maximum subsidy upon finding jobs. As their period of employment proceeds, their subsidy would gradually fall, reaching zero after two years of continuous employment. Those unemployed for a shorter period would receive a correspondingly smaller subsidy over a shorter time span. Since the long-term unemployment rate has no significant effect on wage growth, reducing the number of long-term unemployed would not be inflationary. The BTP is unlikely to affect real wages markedly: although a tightening of the labour market would improve employees' negotiating positions, the subsidies would improve companies' positions as well. The programme may, however, be expected to have a substantial impact on unemployment. The average unemployment benefit package amounts to about 40 per cent of the average UK wage, corresponding to a 40 per cent wage subsidy, on average, in the BTP. Assuming half the funds financing the current unemployment benefit package were used to finance the wage subsidies, the average subsidy would be 20 per cent. Given that the subsidies would have no pronounced effect on the real wages received by workers, standard estimates of UK employment equations lead us to expect that a 20 per cent reduction in the real wages paid by companies would increase employment by about 6-8 per cent, thereby reducing unemployment to about a half or even a quarter of its present level. This would still leave half of the funds financing the current unemployment benefit package to cover a variety of possible slippages: subsidies claimed, say, by unemployed who would have found jobs anyway. Needless to say, the BTP would be no panacea. But it provides a mechanism for unemployed workers to find work voluntarily at the prevailing wages and for companies to reduce labour costs and increase profitability - all without stimulating inflation or raising government spending.

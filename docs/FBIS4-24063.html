			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michel Bellemare: "France's Image Tarnished"] </F>   [Text] New York -- "What can one do against all these  powers which have united? There is a complicity, we have seen  this. We feel frustrated, but we are not for this reason going  to commit suicide." Faustin Twagiramungu (a Hutu by race), the  prime minister-designate as stipulated in the Arusha accords  (footnote) (peace agreement signed in August 1993 at Arusha in  Tanzania which provided for a transition period until general  elections) and seen as a moderate, lacked his full verve as he  waited yesterday morning in his New York hotel room for the  Security Council decision on France's plans to send a  humanitarian intervention force to Rwanda. "UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali told me on Monday [20 June] that, even if it  were the devil, he would send him to Rwanda to save people from  the situation prevailing right now. As France is presenting  itself while no other Western capital seems ready to get  involved, it appears that France will go to Rwanda."    Just like the supporters of the Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), Faustin Twagiramungu and his party, the Democratic  Republic Movement, are against the sending of a French force to  Rwanda, without however approving the use of force against  French Blue Helmets sent to his country. He has been repeating  this position since his visit to Montreal on Sunday. The fact  is that he suspects Paris of having a hidden plan which seeks to  support the Rwandan military. "These soldiers and the  presidential guard have been trained by France," he said. "They  have made life difficult for us since the beginning of April and  are massacring us. Personally, I cannot forget that I only just  escaped death. The presidential guard came knocking at my door  to assassinate me, but I had been warned. All my colleagues  have been killed. I must fight everything which could put these  soldiers in a position of force."    The prime minister-designate's idea was to convince Canadian  Prime Minister Jean Chretien, whom he was due to meet this week,  to take the initiative instead of France. Convinced that he had  lost his battle against the Security Council, however, he  dropped the idea. "Why is France suddenly interested in  Rwanda, after three months of fighting? It would be much better  if countries like Canada, the Netherlands, or Italy, which have  not been caught up in these neocolonialist stories, were to  become involved. France does not inspire confidence. It could  have intervened, with international consent, from the start. It  could have saved lives. But, now, its image is tarnished and it  wants to show the rest of the world that it is not the bad guy."    In addition to these reasons, which he advances to justify  his opposition to the deployment of French soldiers in Rwanda,  Faustin Twagiramungu complains that France did not consult him:  "Of course, we would have liked to have been consulted. We  would have asked for explanations. But we learned that the  French soldiers are going to leave, and that they are already  stationed somewhere in Zaire. This is a little abnormal. We  should have been informed... But if the French go there to halt  the massacres as they say, by attempting to bring to heel the  soldiers who are doing the killing and trying to gain control of  the presidential guard which they themselves trained, that would  finally be a positive step. Obviously, this is a high-risk  operation. But for us, the important thing is that UNAMIR-2 [UN  Assistance Mission in Rwanda] be put into place, as well as the  democratic institutions provided for in the Arusha accords.</p>

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Better than a slow handclap - London / The Budget's effect in the City If Kenneth Clarke was expecting the markets to give his second Budget the same rapturous reception as his first he will have been disappointed. After a yawn the City quickly picked up where it left off. For the share market this meant worrying about Wall Street and interest rates. London shares started the week in a more cheerful mood, in line with New York, but following the muted reaction to the Budget started to fret about rates again. In the US, there were fears that the Federal Reserve may increase rates again before Christmas. Back home Clarke did nothing to help by using the threat of higher rates as a whip to corral potential Tory strays. Short sterling contracts, which reflect the immediate interest rate outlook, fell steadily through the week with some traders predicting a rate rise following Wednesday's meeting between Clarke and the governor of the Bank of England. The consensus is that Clarke will want to wait, at least until January. In the gilts market short-dated issues weakened slightly but at the long end prices firmed on the grounds that the tone of the Budget improved the longer-term outlook for rates. Sceptics suggested Clarke was being less tough than he looked, and predicted he would cut and run when the election loomed. But even they had to admit the sharply falling budget deficit presents a bright background for gilts. On the chancellor's forecasts, he will have to sell around Pounds 18bn of gilts next financial year and less than Pounds 10bn the year after. With UK institutions' appetite for gilts increasing they should continue to outperform other bond markets, pulling equities along in their wake. But shares found little excitement in the Budget apart from Clarke's decision not to cut advance corporation tax further - yet. The impact on particular stock market sectors was also undramatic although Clarke could not resist the temptation to introduce another new tax. This time it was a proposed levy on all waste going into landfill sites. Due to be introduced in 1996 it seems bound to hit the profits of companies such as Shanks &amp; McEwan, the shares of which fell 5p to 85p over the week. The hard-pressed construction sector also felt aggrieved with a sharp cut in the government road building budget to add to its woes. But the changes to amusement machine duty will hardly be noticed by market leaders such as Bass. Last year, a popular Budget (at least with the markets) was marred by a string of disappointing results from leading companies. This time the picture was reversed. Among the welcome corporate news the UK's two leading conglomerates, Hanson and BTR, both issued reassuring trading statements, though in BTR's case it did not have quite the desired effect. A year ago Hanson failed to accompany its final results with an increased dividend for the first time in its history. While the company blamed the dull short-term earnings outlook the move renewed concerns about flagging long-term prospects. But six months later Hanson stepped up the rate of its quarterly dividend, as its highly cyclical businesses started to turn, and this week it was brimming with optimism. Over at BTR the City's main worry has been the pressure on its high margins from rising raw materials costs. The shares tumbled in September when it disclosed a small decline in margins in the first half. In this week's trading statement it said that margins had improved in the second half thanks to successful purchasing policies (that is, sharing the pain with its suppliers) and some price increases. But the statement failed to prop the shares which were further unsettled by news that it had appointed an outsider as chief executive at Australian subsidiary Nylex. Seeboard got the electricity reporting season off to a cracking start with a 21 per cent increase in its interim dividend and a Pounds 22m package of rebates for customers. It also promised customers some of the benefits of next year's Pounds 4bn flotation of the National Grid. Electricity stocks had already been boosted by Clarke's decision not to crack-down on tax efficient share buy-backs. One of the companies that disappointed last year did so again this time. Shares in Argyll fell 17p to 255p after it revealed that its Safeway chain had seen a 0.8 per cent fall in underlying sales in the past six weeks in spite of an aggressive marketing campaign. The City decided this was a reflection of Safeway's particular circumstances rather than a warning signal for the other leading supermarkets. The week's nastiest shock was delivered by T &amp; N on Budget day (always a bad sign). Once a leading supplier of asbestos T &amp; N announced a Pounds 100m provision against future asbestos-related legal actions, just three months after a US court ruling that indicated a declining trend in claims. The shares took it very badly, falling by more than a quarter to 159p over the week. One of the clouds hanging over London equities is the threat that US mutual funds will be forced to sell UK shares to meet a flood of redemptions from unit-holders. On Thursday, Emerson Electric of the US agreed a Pounds 204m takeover of Powys-based electronic drives group Control Techniques. The terms represented a 36 per cent premium to the market price before takeover discussions were announced. Yesterday, US waste group Browning-Ferris won control of Attwoods in spite of a bizarre last-minute intervention by an obscure Canadian rival. For Attwoods the white knight arrived too late. For Tory back-benchers Clarke refused to play the part at all and might have expected slightly more applause from the City in return.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Markets exact revenge for policy vacuum: Treasury stays silent as sterling suffers early free fall; Equities slump; Construction jobs going 'at rate of 580 a day' FINANCIAL markets began to exact their revenge yesterday for the vacuum in UK economic policymaking. Sterling seemed in free fall before stabilising somewhat in the afternoon. UK equities slumped. Throughout all, the Treasury remained silent, commenting neither on the pound's weakness nor shedding any new light on government economic policy. In the City, the mood among analysts and economists was one of increasing despair. When Britain proved incapable of maintaining the old DM2.95 central rate in the European exchange rate mechanism last month, the government chose to float the pound in the belief that it would permit a 'British monetary policy' geared to British needs. After sterling's steep decline to below DM2.40 from its ERM floor of DM2.778, there are still some advocates of lower interest rates to help stimulate the domestic economy. But there are also suggestions for sharper-than-planned cuts in public spending, increased taxes and even higher interest rates. In large part, the confusion reflects the overlapping of two crises. There is the continuing recession at home, which advocates of lower interest rates are above all anxious to address. Superimposed on that has been the slump in sterling's value, which has raised old fears of inflation. How policymakers respond to those two difficulties will ultimately depend on how Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and his advisers assess the inflationary pressures prevailing in the UK. But, in the meantime, financial markets have to make their own calculations about which policy option will form part of the government's economic strategy. Lower UK interest rates were until recently a widely expected consequence of Britain's decision to float the pound. The bigger-than-usual cut of 1 percentage point in base rates to 9 per cent from 10 per cent on September 22 was meant to underline the new freedom that Mr Lamont had secured for UK policy. Some City economists, such as Mr Roger Bootle and Mr Simon Briscoe of Midland Montagu, believe further cuts in interest rates are necessary for recovery. They are seeking base rate reductions 'to 8 per cent soon and 6 per cent by next spring'. However, expectations of an early cut in interest rates have fallen with sterling's value. Opponents of lower rates point out that sterling's decline has eased domestic monetary conditions. By yesterday evening, sterling was 12.3 per cent lower than its average for August, against the Bank of England's trade-weighted basket of currencies. A rule of thumb based on the Treasury's model of the economy suggests that a devaluation on that scale is equivalent to a drop of 3 percentage points in bank base rates. Since floating, the UK has therefore achieved the equivalent of cutting interest rates from 10 per cent to 6 per cent if the pound had stayed in the ERM. Some economists, such as Mr Bill Martin, the chief economist of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, say that the government should 'lie back and enjoy' the effects of the pound's fall. A weaker pound will encourage exports by making them cheaper and in the long term help to correct the UK's main economic trouble of too small a manufacturing base. But such a philosophy depends crucially on the belief that inflationary pressures are so weak that the sharp fall in sterling's value will not pass through quickly into retail prices and pressure for higher wages. Until late last week, many City economists thought that the price impact of the devaluation would be limited and that the average annual growth of retail prices was unlikely to rise above 5 per cent in the foreseeable future. Sterling's subsequent fall has dented those hopes to some extent. According to Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities: 'It probably means that the devaluation is now past the 'free lunch' stage.' Indeed, there are some who would say that the pound's fall merits hairshirt treatment. One government economist, who declined to be identified, said yesterday that sterling's fall justified a move back up in base rates to 11 per cent. Advocates of such a move argue that the government must take steps to stabilise and strengthen the pound not only to prevent a lift-off in inflation but to bolster the current-account balance of payments. Devaluation, they argue, is not enough to solve the difficulty of monthly current-account deficits of more than Pounds 1bn. What is required is more saving in the economy, so that resources are channelled into exports. But higher interest rates would be politically devastating for the government and would doubtless have a deeply negative impact on consumers and industrialists. Many city economists also point out that on Black Wednesday, two interest rate increases to 15 per cent from 10 per cent failed to bolster the pound. The troubles surrounding monetary policy have caused the government and the City to turn their attention back to fiscal policy. Shortly after sterling floated, Mr Lamont made clear that departure from the ERM would add to the pressures on the government to keep planned public spending within the Pounds 244.5bn total targeted for 1993-94. More recently, there have been hints that taxes may have to be raised and that spending will have to be kept unchanged in 1994-95. Higher taxes would represent a humiliating climbdown for the government from its election manifesto promises and would almost certainly be a last-resort measure. But their appearance in the policy debate gives some idea of the pressures being placed on ministers in spending departments to settle the current public-expenditure round within the pre-set target for next month's Autumn Statement. Next month is a long way away for financial markets and the slump of sterling underlines their impatience with the government's failure to spell out its policies. Pressure is therefore mounting on Mr Lamont to clarify his monetary plans. The worry that must be haunting the chancellor, and which certainly is preoccupying the City, is that when he does so, there will be no respite for sterling or UK financial markets because Britain's departure from the ERM has so completely shattered the government's credibility.</p>

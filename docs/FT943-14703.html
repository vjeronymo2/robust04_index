			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Three into one might go: FT writers examine the integrationist agenda of Ukraine and Belarus and Russia's possible response In choosing their new presidents, the citizens of Ukraine and Belarus have indicated two preferences. First, they have opted for relatively fresh faces as head of state, who might plausibly offer release from economic and political collapse and who can claim not (yet) to be corrupted by power and its pickings. Second, they have indicated that they favour a strategy of integration with Russia. The terms of this approach have yet to be defined but, if pursued, a union of the three former Soviet Slav states could emerge. This idea has been lurking in the background since their leaders created the nucleus of what became the Confederation of Independent States in December 1991. Its time, many believe, may have come again. Though President-elect Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine and President-elect Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus may prefer this agenda, it will be Russia which sets the pace. It is not yet clear how strong is Russia's desire for union. While the first two countries can claim - and sometimes do claim - to be central European, Russia's concerns sprawl out to the east. It is deeply committed economically, politically and militarily in central Asia and the Caucasus to its south and east. The Russian political class is divided. Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, appears to want a union with at least Belarus at almost any cost. On a trip to the capital, Minsk, two weeks ago to support Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the head of parliament whose bid for the presidency, regarded as a foregone conclusion, crashed to humiliating defeat on Sunday, he promised that a draft treaty on economic union would be ready by the end of this month. But Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy premier for the economy charged with producing this text, has been cautious and ambiguous. He has emphasised the 'many problems' in aligning the two states' currencies and in concluding a union of the two central banks, which would see Belarus again become, economically, the north-western province of Russia it was in Tsarist and Soviet times. Belarus baulks at destroying the core institutions of its economic sovereignty, and wants to exchange its currency, trading at one-tenth of a rouble, to one to one. Russia's harassed economic managers know that to cede these demands would drive a hole through their hard-won achievement of relatively low inflation. The choice for Russia is between economic reform at home and concentration on the emotive national feelings which find a focus in the 25m ethnic Russians outside Russia's borders, many of whom want to be reunited with their homeland. Dr Alexei Arbatov, a strategic specialist, says the present Russian ruling elite is vulnerable because 'it came to power as a result of the break-up of the Soviet Union which made millions of Russians homeless against their will'. Eleven million of the 25m expatriate Russians live in Ukraine and make up the majority in the Ukrainian province of Crimea  - where they are agitating for a status close to independence. Russian polls continually show the popularity of integration, and of those politicians who speak for it - from radical economic reformer Gregory Yavlinsky on the democratic side, to Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist deputy, on the totalitarian one. Ethnic and religious closeness, disbelief in the independent statehoods of Ukraine and Belarus, great-power pride - all have a part to play in the Russian mood. But Russian advocates for reunion could be disappointed with Ukraine's new president. Although Mr Kuchma campaigned for a friendlier co-existence with Russia, along the lines of Austria's relationship with kindred Germany, he is no supporter of an Anschluss. Nonetheless, Mr Kuchma's election is likely to usher in a honeymoon in the often querulous relations between Moscow and Kiev. For a start, Mr Kuchma is on kissing terms with his fellow former industrialist and Kremlin power-broker, Mr Chernomyrdin. Their friendship should get a further boost from Mr Kuchma's conciliatory stance on the issues which have most deeply divided Ukraine and Russia over the past months: the contested Crimean peninsula, whose citizens backed the new Ukrainian president, and the Ukrainian half of the Black Sea fleet, which Mr Kuchma is willing to sell to Russia. Other hard edges in the Ukrainian-Russian relationship, particularly Kiev's economic policies, which dictate that exporters must surrender half of their earnings to the state at an artificially low rate of exchange, are also likely to be softened with Mr Kuchma's victory. The shift is likely to be one of style as much as substance. In contrast to Mr Kravchuk's administration, which had an unfortunate tendency to view Russia as a hungry wolf ever plotting to devour vulnerable Ukraine, Mr Kuchma sees a warm relationship with Russia, upon which it is utterly reliant for gas and oil, as his nation's only way out of its economic duress. But for all his goodwill, Mr Kuchma is likely to discover that drawing the Russian bear into too close an embrace is a risky business. For one thing, he must take care not to alienate fiercely nationalistic western Ukraine, an effort he has already begun with his increasing use of the Ukrainian language in public appearances and initial conciliatory calls for 'unity' upon his electoral victory. Moreover, despite his desire for closer economic links with Russia, Mr Kuchma himself has made clear he will not pay the price of surrendering real sovereignty. On the campaign trail, he rejected the idea of abandoning Ukraine's separate currency in favour of joining the rouble zone, 'because that would mean the end of our independence'. The danger is that Mr Kuchma, and many of his supporters in eastern Ukraine, have a perilous inclination to want to have their cake and eat it. In the depressed industrial cities of the east, Mr Kuchma's winning slogan of closer economic ties with Russia tapped into nostalgia for the halcyon days of the Soviet Union, when cheap Russian oil and Soviet factory orders made Ukraine's industrial heartland a relatively prosperous region. But those days are over; if it is to prosper, Ukraine, too, must reform its own economy rather than look for a saviour from the east. The outlook for integration is different in neighbouring Belarus, once the most biddable of Soviet states but now ruled by a firebrand. Mr Lukashenko, most of whose professional life has been spent managing collective farms, was a member of parliament who, as head of a commission on corruption, made a series of allegations against leading ministers that they were corrupt. In the course of his campaign, he claimed there was an assassination attempt against him which the police said he had staged himself. His one public appearance in Moscow was under the auspices of Mr Zhirinovsky, whose Liberal Democratic party yesterday congratulated the Belarussian people on their good fortune for having him as a leader. On Russia he has been super-integrationist, unlike Ukraine's more independent-minded Mr Kuchma. He was the only deputy to vote against the creation of the CIS in 1991 because it destroyed the Soviet Union, and he has said that an economic union with Russia should be complemented by a political one. At the same time, his programme says he will 'substantially increase' the independence of the central bank of Belarus, and initiate a 'regime of direct economic management of state enterprises' - moves wholly out of kilter with the economy's submission to Moscow. Mr Lukashenko, in short, has either no idea what to do, or too many ideas. He expresses the very common disgust of Belarussians over their inert and allegedly corrupt government - but he gives little indication how he means to do better. He would seem to be an exotic post-communist flower - produced suddenly, with the hectic bloom of the ultra-reformer, claiming the mandate of an aggrieved people. His programme and campaign were unconstrained and vivid against the greyness of Belarussian politics: but he, like Mr Kuchma in Ukraine, inherits one of the most constrained posts of any contemporary state.

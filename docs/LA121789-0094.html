			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TINY TURTLE MAY HOLD UP RAILWAY PLANS  </P> <P> Conrail's plan to park its cars in protected wetlands may be derailed by the  yellow-spotted turtle.  </P> <P> The 4-inch-wide reptile was once the most common turtle in Massachusetts. Now  the state considers it a species of "special concern."  </P> <P> Environmentalists say that seasonal pools favored by the turtle could be  damaged if Philadelphia-based Consolidated Rail Corp. goes ahead with a plan to  expand its 1,000-car terminal to 2,600 spaces.  </P> <P> The arguments evoke the dispute in the 1970s over the snail darter, a species  of tiny fish whose protectors held up construction of a Tennessee dam for a  decade.  </P> <P> To soothe concerned residents of this Boston suburb and state  environmentalists, Conrail has hired two zoologists to study the spotted  turtle. They are to draft a plan for moving the turtles to a suitable new  habitat.  </P> <P> "There is a legitimate concern about the environment in this country," said  Bruce Wilson, a senior vice president for legal affairs at Conrail.  </P> <P> "I believe in the need to balance our concerns for preserving the environment  with the commercial demands that result from man himself being a domesticated  animal," Wilson said.  </P> <P> The spotted turtle is far better off than the snail darter, which was  threatened with extinction.  </P> <P> A species of "special concern" in Massachusetts is two notches above those  considered "endangered." Species of special concern are declining in numbers  and may disappear from the state, said Tom French, assistant director of the  state Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program.  </P> <P> Conrail's plan for the turtles must pass muster with French's office. If the  research and plan are satisfactory, the next step will be to draft an  environmental-impact report, then to obtain permits for the project from the  state Department of Environmental Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers.  </P> <P> But Conrail's road is unlikely to be that easy. The fight has already begun.  </P> <P> The Westboro Conservation Commission approved the terminal expansion, but that  was before the turtle problem turned up.  </P> <P> Community activist Michael Hachey, an engineer, has joined in a lawsuit seeking  reconsideration of the commission's action.  </P></p>

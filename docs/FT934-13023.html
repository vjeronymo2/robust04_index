			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Abacus raising Pounds 15m via placing ABACUS is coming to market through a share placing which is expected to value the franchised distributor of electronics components at between Pounds 35m and Pounds 40m. The placing, sponsored by NatWest Markets, will raise about Pounds 15m, including Pounds 3.6m net of new money. Mr Brian Murdoch, managing director, said the new funds will be used to pay back Pounds 3m of debt and position the group for future growth, both organic and, if appropriate, through acquisitions. Abacus was the subject of a Pounds 3.4m management buy-out led by Mr Murdoch and three colleagues in February 1989 and backed with funds from Ensign Trust, a company controlled by the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. Since then it has grown quickly through two small acquisitions and organic expansion. Turnover in the year to September 30 increased to Pounds 30.9m (Pounds 23.4m) and pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.98m (Pounds 1.76m), equivalent to earnings of 7.4p (4.3p) per share. Following the flotation roughly 35 per cent of the equity will be in the hands of institutional shareholders, a similar proportion will remain in the hands of the management team and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund will retain the remaining 30 per cent stake.</p>

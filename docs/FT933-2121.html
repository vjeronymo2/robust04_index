			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / New universities fail to fill places FORMER polytechnics have been left with unfilled places following an unexpected expansion in the numbers of students recruited by the older universities. The new universities, which acquired their status last year, have not been in direct competition with traditional universities before and many are disappointed by this year's distribution of students. The figures are in stark contrast to earlier predictions that older universities would reject far more applicants than usual and the former polytechnics would find it difficult to accommodate extra demand. The former polytechnics say that older universities have reduced A-level requirements, but provisional figures suggest that the new universities have not shed their image as 'second-class' institutions. The Polytechnics' Central Admission Service, which is launching an inquiry into the problems its members have faced, says total acceptances are still about 10,000 short of last year's final figure of 130,000. It said: 'We are reasonably happy we will be up on last year's figure, but not by as much as the other universities.' Enrolment for the older universities, handled by the Universities Central Council on Admissions has already increased by about 6,000. The figures appear to vindicate the view of Mr John Patten, education secretary, that the effect of a government cut in funding for extra arts places had been exaggerated. Universities predicted trouble because the cut was announced only in December, when many institutions had almost completed giving conditional offers. Mr Leslie Wagner, chief executive of the University of North London, said: 'A government call to stem the flood of students into higher education was given such hype in the media that many sixth formers decided they would not stand a chance of admission unless they obtained high-grade A-levels.' He said high figures for graduate unemployment had also depressed demand. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals said the government's attempt to regulate places this year had failed because it had been announced too late, but predicted a much tighter squeeze next year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic  today received Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British  Foreign Office. On this occasion Silajdzic said that a limited  cease-fire could be significant for the resumption of  negotiations. He stressed that the aggressor was buying time  with his acts -- such as bringing in soldiers dressed in police  uniforms in and around Gorazde, and settling its people in other  people's houses.    We have established a federation of Bosniaks and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, and we are still offering the  federation to those who want to live with us, Silajdzic said.    Asked by Hogg what kind of relations would be established  with the Serbian entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Silajdzic said:  Whatever kind of entity they choose, they can join the  federation. However, we cannot allow the people of Banja Luka  to not be able to return to their homes. The international  community has to guarantee them this right. All this would  imply that the Serbs will have relations with Serbia, but not to  the disadvantage of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We believe that the contact group has a lot to do. We are  taking it seriously, and we think that it is important for all  of us, Silajdzic added.</p>

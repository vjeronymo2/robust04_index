			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Japanese 'ignoring' laws on outsiders Japanese companies are largely ignoring a new law requiring them to appoint at least one outsider to their boards, according to the US-based Investor Responsibility Research Center. Last year, largely as the result of pressure from US trade negotiators, Japan passed laws requiring all corporations to appoint at least one outsider to their boards of so-called statutory auditors, non-voting board members whose role is to ensure that Japanese companies are run in a legal manner. Normally, boards of directors at Japanese companies are composed entirely of each company's top executives, according to earlier surveys by IRRC, a non-profit group which monitors issues affecting corporate governance. IRRC surveyed 911 candidates for the role of outside statutory auditor. Some 80 per cent of Japanese companies have scheduled annual shareholder meetings for June 29, at which the individuals are set to be approved. According to Mr John Taylor, senior analyst specialising in east Asian companies at IRRC, Japanese corporations are exploiting a loophole in the law to allow them to classify as outsiders those who are actually employees. While employees are paid out of a company's profit and loss account, board directors are paid bonuses out of profits. Thus, a director who has not been on the payroll for the previous five years can be technically classified as an outsider. Mr Taylor said that out of the 911 individuals surveyed, some 17 per cent, or 156 candidates, fell into this category. 'One out of six of Japan's 500 biggest companies - including international giants Sony and Mazda - appear this month to be nominating individuals to outsider slots who are really employees of the company,' Mr Taylor said.</p>

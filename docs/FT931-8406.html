			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Management: Office work-out - Staff fitness is to be encouraged The offer - a generous rent reduction in return for surrendering a small amount of office space - was too tempting to refuse. But as the head of the London-based services company who negotiated it explains, the deal with his landlord involved sacrificing an in-house gym. 'I can't remember any other issue on which our employees felt so strongly,' he now admits. 'It was only when we secured corporate membership of a nearby health club that the rebellion was finally quelled]' The story is perhaps a salutary one for companies tempted to cut the size of their financial contributions to staff sporting, recreation and health facilities. Such perks are often justified on the grounds of improved employee motivation - but by the same token managements which take the benefits away risk a disgruntled workforce. There is little evidence that head office accountants are seeking to prune their employee sports and health budgets (as distinct from sports sponsorship budgets). A poll of 10 randomly selected large British companies this week revealed that boardrooms are certainly seeking to get better value-for-money and better usage of corporate facilities - especially those lavish sports grounds for traditional team games owned by the big banks and oil companies. If anything, though, the trend towards encouraging staff fitness and providing 'lifestyle consultation' packages seems to be growing. Fitness for Industry, a London-based specialist consultancy 51 per cent owned by the Forte hotel group, says demand for its corporate fitness centres has seldom been greater. In the last six months FFI has opened five new in-house fitness centre projects, including one for the international oil group Conoco at Warwick and one for Vauxhall Motors at Luton. Many companies are either reluctant, or unable, to disclose the overall cost of their employee sporting and fitness amenities. Exceptions include BT, whose annual sport and recreation budget is about Pounds 1.25m, and Prudential Assurance, which reckons it spends around Pounds 200,000-Pounds 300,000 in the London area. BT says its spending on employee sport and recreation has fallen in the wake of job cuts and general cost reductions; the Pru has stopped using a west London sports ground because of low attendances (due to staff concentrations elsewhere); while National Westminster Bank, which owns two vast sports grounds in south London, wants to make one of them more cost effective through non-staff membership and more extensive outside use. Underlying different corporate strategies is the realisation that employee needs are changing. The leisure revolution has opened up numerous opportunities in the last few years for individuals to pursue their own interests, with the result that company regattas and sports days - with prizes presented by the chairman's wife - now seem anachronistic. Boardroom thinking increasingly reflects the view that a fit workforce is potentially more productive. Such a philosophy is much more widely accepted in North America, where groups such as Du Pont and the Canadian Life Assurance company have reported reduced absenteeism and lower staff turnover in the wake of corporate fitness programmes. Pacific Railroad found that 90 per cent of its workforce believed their exercise programme made them more productive. FFI's marketing-manager David Parks believes that companies are moving from the position where they know the health and well-being of their workforce is important to doing something about it. In part he attributes recent demand to industrial relocation projects planned in happier times which are being implemented as part of a corporate cost cutting exercise. 'A health centre is often an integral part of a relocation package', he says. Most of FFI's programmes incorporate a strong medical dimension; in Vauxhall's case Parks says the company found a latent demand for more health-related activity, as opposed to traditional social pursuits like darts and snooker. Team building and better internal communications are useful spin-offs from corporate fitness programmes, adds Parks. 'There is nothing better for breaking down barriers than a director and a secretary working side by side on different pieces of equipment,' he suggests.</p>

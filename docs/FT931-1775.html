			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Not an open and shut case: The EC-US dispute over public purchasing rules could escalate into a tit-for-tat trade war We have not sold a steam turbine in Europe since the Marshall Plan,' protests Mr Michael Gadbaw, vice-president for international policy at General Electric, the US manufacturing and services conglomerate. 'No US supplier has succeeded in penetrating the EC heavy electrical equipment market in any country with indigenous manufacturing.' The reason, GE says, is that protectionist public purchasing rules have effectively closed the market, shutting the door on potential orders for steam turbines worth about Dollars 1bn a year. The complaint, echoed by other leading US utilities groups, particularly AT&amp;T in the telecommunications sector, is at the heart of an EC-US dispute over government purchasing practices which threatened to spill over into trade sanctions on Monday. In the event, President Bill Clinton told Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, he would suspend sanctions - which would have amounted to a token Dollars 40m on EC exports - to facilitate a temporary ceasefire. The US is not alone in feeling aggrieved. EC exporters insist they are barred from the US market, in particular by state-level procurement rules that favour local manufacturers. The French telecommunications group Alcatel, Europe's biggest, has so far not been able to penetrate the US market, while the German electrical group Siemens and Sweden's Ericsson telecommunications company have only made limited inroads. One thing that both EC and US officials agree on is this: if the clash over procurement - a long-ignored area of commerce which accounts for an estimated 8 per cent to 12 per cent of global gross domestic product  - had happened in isolation, it would have been 'one of those normal skirmishes'. Unfortunately, the disagreement has not occurred in isolation. It coincides with friction over steel exports - the US last month imposed 'dumping' duties of up to 110 per cent on steel exporters from 19 countries, charging them with exporting at below prices in home markets  - and over Europe's subsidies for Airbus. It has also added to confusion over the overall trade posture of the US administration - not just towards Europe, but towards the Uruguay Round of Gatt negotiations on global trade. As with the EC-US row over farm subsidies which came to a head in Washington last November, the procurement dispute has been simmering for many years. It has its roots in the 1970s when US negotiators agreed to a procurement code drawn up as part of the Tokyo Round of world trade liberalisation. It has erupted now because the EC's Utilities Directive, which came into force in January, includes small but formal discrimination against US competitors for utilities contracts - particularly in the power and telecommunications areas. US officials concede that the directive is, nevertheless, a significant market-opening initiative because it forces EC governments to open thousands of contracts for public tender that were previously notified only to local companies. Article 29 of the directive lies at the heart of the row. This gives a 3 per cent price preference to EC bidders for any government contract and allows an EC purchaser to ignore a bid completely if the bidder has a European content of less than 50 per cent. So a cheaper US bid may fail on domestic content grounds alone. 'The two combined create a tremendous deterrent even to bidding,' said Mr Gadbaw, who argues that few US companies would commit the time and funds (up to Dollars 1m) on preparing a bid if they saw price preferences and local content rules blocking the chances of success. It was the EC's refusal to delete Article 29 after the start of the year which triggered the US threat to impose trade sanctions last week. A resolution now rests in the hands of Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, his EC counterpart, when they meet in Brussels next week. The bilateral procurement negotiations have become muddled largely because the two have different definitions of public purchasing. For the US, procurement means nothing more than purchasing by central government and publicly owned utilities in telecommunications, power and water. By this definition, the US is strikingly open, and the EC virtually closed. But the EC defines procurement to include purchasing by local government authorities (such as US states), and by private companies in government-regulated sectors which have 'special and exclusive rights', such as mass transit systems, airports or ports. By this measure, the US comes out less well, in particular because state governments apply 'buy local' price preferences of 6 per cent to 60 per cent. At present, the procurement code regulated by the Gatt since the mid-1970s covers only a small part of the market being argued over - basically, goods purchased by central governments. In 1990, these were worth Dollars 62.15bn worldwide, according to figures notified to the Gatt. The market would be much bigger if utilities, such as telecommunications and power, and mass transit systems, were included. For example, the EC says the world market for telecommunications equipment alone amounts to Dollars 128bn a year, with the US accounting for Dollars 44.8bn (35 per cent), and the EC for Dollars 30.7bn (24 per cent). EC officials agree that buy-local policies across Europe have kept markets closed. But they insist that the recent trend is towards openness. Gatt figures endorse this claim. Procurement opportunities notified to the Gatt by the EC have risen from Dollars 7.45bn in 1987 to Dollars 18.66bn in 1990. Meanwhile, US notifications held steady at Dollars 28.8bn. The EC claims that the Utilities Directive opens the entire procurement market to foreign bids. They say 1,000 contracts worth Dollars 17.5bn have been announced in the first 10 weeks of this year that would not previously have been open to foreign bidders. US negotiators generally agree with this view, but are seeking reassurance that standards and other technical requirements are not being used in place of preferential bidding systems to keep foreign manufacturers out. US officials echo the view of Mr Gadbaw: 'We welcome the EC effort to liberalise in the procurement area, but they have used Article 29 of the directive to close us out.' EC negotiators have been perplexed by recent developments. 'We knew where we were moving, and saw evidence that we were getting close to a solution,' said one negotiator. They are also concerned that what they regard as a significant market-opening reform should have been condemned by US try. The solution to the dispute, according to the EC, is for the US to bring rights to bid for transport sector contracts to the negotiations - including mass transit systems, ports and airports. They are also seeking access to state utilities contracts. The US might be close to accepting some of these demands once Article 29 is dropped. Though the US constitution prevents the federal government from imposing curbs on the 'buy local' practices of state governments, negotiators say they are in the process of getting voluntary commitments from the states to open up their markets. Such commitments account for 65 per cent of total local purchasing. A serious stumbling block to any resolution of procurement policy is the tangled argument over the numbers being used by both sides. 'We say the disagreement is due to different kinds of statistics,' says an EC procurement expert: 'We are not saying the statistics lie. It's just the nature of the statistics. Neither is right or wrong, but to compare them is folly.' US officials agree statistics can be interpreted in conflicting ways, but have baulked at the EC proposal for a jointly funded study to settle the dispute. This smacks of 'yet another EC effort to drag its heels on an issue', one said. No negotiators are forecasting a procurement deal will be reached in Brussels next week. But pressure is mounting on Sir Leon and Mr Kantor to lay the foundations for agreement - not just on procurement, but on steel and Airbus too. If they fail, a deluge of tit-for-tat trade retaliation looks increasingly likely - with ominous consequences for world trade.</p>

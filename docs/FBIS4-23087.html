			<p>SUMMARY                                         Japan's ruling coalition government has recently come under  attack from elements of the Japanese bureaucracy and the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for its handling of the  24 May U.S.-Japanese agreement on resuming the stalled framework  talks on bilateral trade problems.  Bureaucrats have expressed  concern that Washington may attempt to turn the objective  criteria that both sides agreed to use to measure Japan's trade  performance into numerical targets, and are seeking to narrow the  definition of these criteria--a stance that could complicate  upcoming U.S.-Japanese talks.  Judging by media reporting, the  LDP, for its part, may be planning to exploit this issue to  weaken the ruling coalition.                                       END SUMMARY     In the days since the 24 May announcement of the U.S.-Japan  agreement to restart the framework talks, Japanese bureaucrats  involved in the trade negotiations and elements of the opposition  LDP have criticized the government in the Japanese press for its  handling of the talks that led to the agreement.     -- The 28 May Sankei Shimbun, a conservative newspaper whose  views are often close to those of more conservative elements of  the LDP, quoted an unidentified government official as expressing  concern that the government, under political pressure to reach an  agreement with Washington, may have compromised too much over how  to define the objective criteria that will be used to measure  Japan's trade performance.  Warning that Washington might still  try to turn the criteria into "something similar to numerical  targets," the official commented that the coalition "might have  given priority to reopening the trade talks in an attempt to earn  diplomatic points" to strengthen its weak domes tic political  position.     -- The 28 May issue of Sankei Shimbun reported that another  official argued that "it is very questionable whether Japan  should have made such large concessions" on the issue of  objective criteria.  He predicted that the two sides would  continue to sharply disagree on the issue in the upcoming talks.     --  In addition, the 28 May Sankei Shimbun cited a third  unidentified official as criticizing the 24 May agreement because  it "includes only demands on Japan and makes few references to  what the United States should do" to improve its competitiveness  in Japan.     -- The 27 May Asahi Shimbun quoted unidentified officials as  complaining that the 24 May agreement was "hasty," "inadequate,"  and "open to misinterpretation by the United States."     -- According to the 25 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun, unidentified  sources in the LDP have also criticized the coalition's handling  of the trade talks, asserting that the coalition had "only  narrowly averted the worst situation that could trigger a trade  war between Japan and the United States."  The paper reported  that the LDP plans to cite the coalition's poor handling of the  negotiations surrounding the resumption of the framework talks in  a no-confidence motion it is considering against the government  after the Diet passes the 1994 budget.     Bureaucracy's Criticism     Japanese bureaucrats who have criticized the 24 May agreement  appear to be planning to work to limit the scope of the objective  criteria as much as possible during the upcoming negotiations,  seeking to avoid, wherever possible, any standards that might be  interpreted  as targets, involve future goals, or affect sectors  that the government claims are beyond its control.  Yosihiro  Sakamoto, director general of the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry's International Trade Policy Bureau, told a press  conference on 24 May that although Tokyo understood that the  objective criteria would include "a set of measuring yardsticks,"  they would be used "on a sector-by-sector basis to gauge only how  Japan has done in the past" (Kyodo, 25 May).  Similarly, an  unidentified MITI official told Kyodo on 27 May that Japan would  reject any criteria that it regarded as numerical targets.  The  official added that Tokyo defines such targets as any  "quantitative pledges by the government regarding future trade  performance and trade areas beyond government control."   In  addition, the 29 May Mainichi Shimbun reported that a senior  unnamed MITI official stated that Japan would reject anything  that "comes close to numerical targets" (Mainichi Shimbun, 29  May).  Other unidentified government sources quoted in the 29 and  30 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun indicated that Japan would refuse to  set any future goals, such as pledges to increase the number of  dealers or outlets selling foreign products.     The bureaucracy appears to be particularly concerned about  limiting the scope of objective criteria in the automobile  sector.   Officials commenting on the upcoming automobile sector  talks have used many of the standard arguments marshalled by  Japanese officials in the past to resist monitoring of Japan's  import performance in this area.   According to the 27 May Asahi  Shimbun, a MITI negotiator involved in the framework talks stated  that Japan would agree to adopting criteria, such as the number  of dealers handling foreign cars, only if they are used to  measure current conditions or past performance.  He said Tokyo  would reject any criteria that involve "future commitments" for  specific levels of imports.  He also argued, as Japanese  negotiators have in the past, that the automobile sector was an  "industrial field run by the private sector" over which the  government has little control and for which it cannot set  targets.  The 27 May Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Japanese  negotiators would also refuse to comply with any U.S. demand to  guarantee targets set voluntarily by Japanese automakers.     Ruling Coalition Response     The politically weak ruling coalition has attempted to play the  24 May agreement to its best advantage and head off criticism  from the bureaucracy and the opposition.  In the days immediately  following the announcement of the 24 May agreement, for example,  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa sought to portray the agreement in  the best possible light for the ruling coalition, suggesting that  the government had averted potential U.S. sanctions and secured  Washington's agreement to drop demands for numerical targets.  On  24 May, he reportedly told a news conference that, as part of the  agreement, the two sides had decided to introduce "qualitative  and quantitative criteria " to measure imports into Japan and  "not to use a single criterion to judge" Japan's performance  (Kyodo, 24 May).  This situation, he said, would avert the  possibility of Washington imposing sanctions on Japan.  On 25  May, he reportedly told an opposition member who questioned him  during a Diet Budget Committee meeting that the "objective  criteria" to be determined in the upcoming negotiations would not  be numerical targets (Kyodo, 25 May).     MITI Minister Eijiro Hata has also sought to head off criticism  by signalling that Tokyo would remain firm in rejecting numerical  targets after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was  reported in the Japanese media as saying that Washington would  continue to pursue "results-oriented" objectives in the upcoming  talks (Kyodo, 27 May).  On 27 May, Hata reportedly told a news  conference that failure to define objective criteria in the 24  May agreement had left a "source of contention" for the talks.  He reiterated Japan's longstanding position that it would not  accept numerical targets (Kyodo, 27 May).  On 31 May, according  to a Kyodo report the same day, Hata made similar remarks at  another press conference, asserting that "Japan could not swallow  any U.S. proposals that would lead to numerical targets."  Hata  may also have been seeking to signal to Washington that Tokyo  would remain firm on the issue of numerical targets.     Outlook     Japanese bureaucrats involved in the trade talks will probably  make every possible effort to keep the objective criteria adopted  in various sectors as vague and as limited as possible.  This  will almost certainly slow progress in the talks, particularly in  more contentious areas, such as the automobile sector.  Because  of its weak political position, the ruling coalition will  probably have problems dealing effectively with the bureaucracy's  position.  On the one hand, the coalition will probably want to  avoid pushing the bureaucracy to compromise with the United  States, for fear that this would provide fuel for critics of the  government to attack the coalition for giving in to Washington.  On the other hand, if the talks collapse again or proceed very  slowly and acrimoniously because of disagreements over objective  criteria, the coalition could open itself to criticism from the  LDP for mishandling Japan's relationship with the United States.

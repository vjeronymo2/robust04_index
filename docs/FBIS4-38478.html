			<p>BFN     [Text] In accordance with agreements, from May 30 Russia  will no longer have strategic missiles aimed at the U.S. and  Britain, Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Missile Troops,  Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev told Interfax today.    He repeated that Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S.  President Bill Clinton had reached an agreement to this effect  on January 14, 1994. Great Britain joined this document on  February 15.    By May 30 the U.S. and Great Britain must also change the  flight task of their strategic nuclear missiles formerly aimed  at Russian territory. However, the Strategic Missile Troops  Chief Headquarter has not as yet received any confirmation that  this has been carried out, Sergeyev said.    Sergeyev emphasized that now Russian nuclear missiles had no  particular target. He added that these measures had increased  the level of nuclear safety. Even if someone tries to carry out  a non- authorized launch, strategic missiles will not fly since  they have no flight program, Sergeyev stated.</p>

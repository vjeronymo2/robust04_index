Jibril said the radio will urge Libyans to escalate  the struggle to topple al-Qadhdhafi and set up a democracy in  Libya. He appealed to concerned international organizations to  rescue the life of Colonel (Muftah Qurdum), a Libyan opposition  figure whom the Libyan Television presented on Monday [7 March]  as a spy working for the United States.    Qurdum introduced himself as a former Army colonel. He  admitted that while residing in Switzerland he contacted Libyans  living abroad, who supplied the Americans with information. He  added that the Americans sought information on the Libyan Armed  Forces and the Libyan missile program. They were planning to  attack Libya with the help of their spies, who would then seize  power.    Muhammad Fayiz Jibril said Qurdum made these false  confessions under duress.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ ESCALATES VERBAL WAR, TELLS BUSH: 'NO GOING BACK'  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein vowed Thursday that Iraqi troops will not  withdraw from occupied Kuwait, declaring in a televised "open letter" to  President Bush: "There is no going back."  </P> <P> In a personal lecture laden with prophesies of disaster, Hussein told Bush that  "you, the President of the United States, have chosen to be a liar like the  band you have selected and consider to represent the Arab nation."  </P> <P> He warned that U.S. support of the Kuwaiti regime -- "backward oil emirs," he  called them -- puts American soldiers in peril.  </P> <P> "We pray to God that the two sides will not clash," he said, "because if they  do, thousands of Americans whom you have pushed into this dark tunnel will go  home in shrouded coffins."  </P> <P> Hussein's message, advertised hours in advance, was read by a studio announcer  as Jordan's King Hussein traveled to Maine for talks with Bush. It contained no  new initiatives but reflected President Hussein's smoldering anger at Bush's  charge in a Pentagon speech Wednesday that the Iraqi leader had lied when he  promised not to invade Kuwait.  </P> <P> "The man you hate the most," the message said, "is Saddam Hussein, because of  his truthfulness to his principles, to himself, and to his people and nation. .  . ."  </P> <P> Since the rapid buildup of U.S. troops and hardware in support of Saudi Arabia,  Hussein has sought by means of broadcasts and diplomatic maneuvers to turn Arab  opinion in his favor. He has repeatedly denounced the Persian Gulf intervention  by foreign governments but has rarely mentioned his conquest of Kuwait on Aug.  2.  </P> <P> At a news conference in Kennebunkport, Me., Bush said he had not reviewed the  entire speech but had seen some excerpts.  </P> <P> "I think it's clear that what we need to do at this point is to enforce the  international law. The statements at the United Nations from many countries  really say it all. So there's no point in me responding. . . ," the President  said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, on Thursday, the Iraqi leadership sought to put the best face on the  peace concessions it offered to Iran a day earlier.  </P> <P> But Iraq's Arab enemies said that Hussein's vaunted army has blinked. In Saudi  Arabia, the daily Al Jazira commented: "Saddam Hussein has entered a stage of  weakness and confusion which has reached the point of humiliation and  disgrace."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Iraqi government remained defiant and threatening. The Iraqi  air defense force warned that it is "prepared to repulse the aggression" and  cannot guarantee the safety of foreign pilots bailing out of damaged planes  over Iraqi territory.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, government and ruling-party newspapers said that peace with Iran  will "give Iraq added strength and more resources for victory," permitting the  military command to withdraw 30 divisions -- at least 300,000 men -- from the  eastern frontier to confront the American, European and Arab forces deployed to  the south in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> At the same time, Iraqi press organs moved to motivate political opposition to  foreign intervention in the Middle East, an issue potentially more powerful  than 30 divisions.  </P> <P> A Defense Ministry statement called for "a popular Islamic consensus which  rejects this Crusader pollution of Islamic holy places . . . to eliminate this  American intervention and free Mecca and the tomb of the Great Prophet from  this disgraceful filth."  </P> <P> This message was aimed particularly at Iran -- and may have touched receptive  ears. In Tehran, where the United States continues to be the "Great Satan,"  officials have adopted a split policy on the Kuwait crisis.  </P> <P> Tehran rejects the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait, ostensibly on principle but also  because of the greater territorial and oil power it gives Iraq in the Persian  Gulf region. It also fears that the invasion and Saudi Arabia's acceptance of  foreign troops on its soil have introduced a third force that will be hard to  dispel.  </P> <P> Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, in a telephone conversation with Turkish  President Turgut Ozal, expressed Iran's concerns.  </P> <P> According to the Iranian news agency IRNA, Rafsanjani drew a line between peace  with Iraq, which has been received with enthusiasm in Tehran, and the invasion  of Kuwait. He also alluded to foreign intervention, a political plague among  the ruling clerics in Tehran since the days when the United States delivered  Western ways along with support for the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.  </P> <P> "Peace with Iraq is a different issue," Rafsanjani reportedly told Ozal, whose  government is supporting U.N. sanctions against Baghdad. "We hold to our view  that Iraq must evacuate from Kuwaiti territory so as to create the necessary  conditions for re-establishment of peace and tranquillity. We believe that the  problem which has been created in the region must be solved by the regional  countries in cooperation with one another."  </P> <P> Most Arab nations agree with Iran that the Kuwaiti invasion and annexation is  unacceptable and that the crisis can be resolved only by an Iraqi withdrawal or  war.  </P> <P> Whatever the Iraqi leader's motives in offering peace to Iran, officials in  Tehran have been quick to portray it as capitulation.  </P> <P> "We are happy that Iraq finally accepted the principled view of the Islamic  Republic of Iran," Morteza Sarmadi, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said when  Baghdad Radio announced the offer.  </P> <P> Iranian newspapers on Thursday hailed the surprise announcement as a "great  victory for the Iranian revolutionary nation."  </P> <P> Sadegh Khalkhali, a cleric who is anti-American, said that "all countries" must  press Hussein to withdraw and added that Saudi King Fahd "has become like the  governor of Alabama, but on Hijaz (Saudi) soil." Islamic nations and Arab  countries, he said, "should try at any cost to make the world-devouring America  leave the Persian Gulf."  </P> <P> Late reports from IRNA said the top political and military leaders of Iran's  National Security Council have taken "appropriate decisions" in response to  Hussein's offer.  </P> <P> The Iraqi leader, telling Rafsanjani that "everything you wanted . . . has been  realized," promised an immediate exchange of prisoners of war, withdrawal of  Iraqi troops from Iranian territory and acceptance of a 1975 accord that gave  Iran sovereignty over the eastern half of the Shatt al Arab, the waterway that  forms a section of the frontier between the two countries.  </P> <P> IRNA reported that officials of Iran's Red Crescent Society have gone to the  Iraqi border to receive Iranian prisoners. Hussein had said that the first of  the Iranian POWs will be turned over today.  </P></p>

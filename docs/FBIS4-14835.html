			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Tigran Liloyan and </F> Sergey Ostanin]    [Text] Yerevan April 1 TASS -- Members of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly's peace-making delegation expressed  satisfaction with the results of their meetings with  Azerbaijanian leaders, including President Heydar Aliyev, on  Friday.    "I counted on a candid conversation about the  Nagorno-Karabakh crisis. Such a conversation did take place,"  Medetkan Sherimkulov, head of the delegation, told ITAR-TASS.    Asked about a meeting between Azerbaijanian, Armenian  parliamentaries and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh slated  to be held in Bishkek next May, Sherimkulov said, "it is  premature to say whether the meeting will differ from other  meetings in principle. If it takes place, it will be held at due  level, and major interests of all the parties will be taken into  account."    The delegation flew in Yerevan on the same day to meet with  members of the presidium and deputies of the Armenian Supreme  Soviet (parliament).    According to Parliament Speaker Babken Ararktsyan, "a new  constructive approach to the Nagorno-Karabakh problem is  beginning to show in Russia's initiatives."    One can hardly overvaluate the significance of Russian  initiatives, he noted. The involvement of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly will contribute to a peaceful  solution of this problem.    Ararktsyan confirmed that the Bishkek meeting between the  parties involved in the conflict would take place.    The delegation is to meet with Armenian President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan on Friday night and to leave Yerevan for  Stepanakert in the morning on Saturday.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Israel's hopes rise after ceasefire deal: Agreement to end bombardment may help revive Mideast peace process ISRAEL'S government was quick yesterday to claim success for its seven-day bombardment of southern Lebanon aimed at curbing rocket attacks by Arab guerrillas against the country's northern towns. However, as Israel continued withdrawing tanks and troops from its self-styled security zone in southern Lebanon after a US-arranged ceasefire at the weekend, Israeli politicians and military officials were left wondering how solid any gains will be in the long term. Despite severe international condemnation and the threats posed to the already stalled Middle East peace process by Israel's devastating onslaught against Lebanese civilians, optimistic Israeli politicians and analysts believe they can turn the crisis into an opportunity. Much depends on the details of the secret deal arranged by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and the reaction of Arab states to Israel's latest military action during Mr Christopher's current visit to the region. For its part, Israel believes the unwritten agreement involving Syria, Lebanon and Israel can pave the way to a more permanent and durable solution in the Middle East. What is known about the deal is that Israel has ceased its offensive in return for vague assurances that Syria will rein in the pro-Iranian Hizbollah guerrillas and Lebanon will increasingly restrict the Islamic militia - demonstrated yesterday as the Lebanese army mounted increased checkpoints on roads into the south, stopping cars carrying armed Hizbollah. But the agreement does not provide for the disarming of Hizbollah or an end to their attacks against Israeli troops and their proxies in the security zone and so leaves the underlying security issues unresolved. In the short term Israel claims it has stopped Katyusha rocket attacks from Hizbollah and has committed the governments of Lebanon and Syria to restrict Hizbollah's ability to launch further attacks. For their part, Lebanon and Syria have halted a military onslaught that threatened to destabilise Lebanon and derail the considerable gains made by the nine-month-old Lebanese government towards a restoration of law and order, security and economic rehabilitation. It is also immediately clear that the hand of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria has been strengthened. Last week US President Bill Clinton praised 'Syrian restraint' during the Israeli operation and even Israeli leaders have softened to the man who has been their enemy for more than a quarter of a century. Gen Ehud Barak, chief of staff, said: 'President Assad is a tough and bitter rival but we can't ignore the fact that he is a very serious, responsible and highly reliable leader.' The new-found Israeli praise for Mr Assad has fuelled speculation that the ceasefire agreement could have deeper aims than merely stopping the latest conflict and be the start of a broader agreement capable of reviving the moribund Middle East peace process. Certainly this is Israel's hope. 'This is a deal which is the first of its kind between the triangle of Israel, Syria and Lebanon,' said Mr Evyatar Manor, foreign ministry spokesman. 'If it holds, it can create an atmosphere of wheeling and dealing between the three sides which could break the deadlock in the talks.' But the deeper details of the deal remain obscure. Israeli commentators believe Mr Assad has extracted a price for his 'restraint' which involves, as a minimum, a US promise to consider favourably removing Syria from the blacklist of countries which support terrorism - opening the way to US finance and investment. After 20 months of talks the peace process remains deadlocked and each side accuses the other of stalling. Israel says Mr Christopher will focus his visit on how to unblock this deadlock and use the unwritten ceasefire agreement as a springboard to speed up Syria-Lebanon-Israel talks. Israel hopes that Mr Christopher will have emerged with enhanced status by chalking up his first success as a peace broker in the Middle East and that he will step up US involvement in the peace process, make bolder initiatives and bring all sides closer to an agreement. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said the ceasefire agreement deal should be conducive to peace because Mr Christopher had opened new channels of communication between leaders in the region.</p>

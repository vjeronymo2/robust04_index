			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Book Review: What a pity about the city - A New London By Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher A New London By Richard Rogers and Mark Fisher Penguin Pounds 8.99 To judge by the activities of the Paul Hamlyn Fund and the Labour party's arts spokesman, Mr Mark Fisher, the general election turns upon rival policy prescriptions for London. This is the second London book inside a year to bear the stamp of the fund - a private donation by Mr Hamlyn to the shadow arts ministry for policy research - the red rose and Mr Fisher. Given that on this occasion Mr Fisher's co-author is Richard Rogers, an architect of genius, the latest offering has a strong claim to attention. In reality, it is hardly a joint work. Pressures from Rogers' practice - he is best known for the Pompidou Centre in Paris and London's Lloyd's building  -frustrated an intended unitary structure. Instead, we have the Fisher building and the Rogers wing. The Rogers thesis is that Europe is witnessing the rebirth of the city state. Urban planning policies have shifted from population dispersal towards more intense but ecologically sustainable concentrations. Rogers is the prophet of this new city. He doesn't just like squares, he finds that 'scarcely any pleasure compares' with them. The disfiguring of Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square into 'just two more jammed roundabouts' causes him pain. For Rogers, the motor vehicle is driving us all towards a 'traffic-dominated, segregated, non-place, unjust city'. Leaping in one undebated bound from effect to cause, he notes that London, having once enjoyed 'the first modern, democratic metropolitan government in Europe' (the London County Council), is now Europe's only capital without an elected overall government. London, he says, 'needs a co-ordinated, interventionist policy'. The favoured overseas model is Paris. Not only does Paris have overarching government, it has architectural grands projets by the dozen, and public architectural competitions as a matter of course. I M Pei's glass pyramid outside the Louvre is hailed as a masterstroke both of self-confidence and internationalism. Alongside Rogers' bold strokes, Fisher's manifesto prose flags. He develops the case for making the revitalisation of the Thames London's grand projet for the 1990s, an idea with which no Londoner could disagree. The fact that the river remains so inaccessible to pedestrians at so many points in its swaggering course, not least through the City, is indeed a serious planning failure. Fisher also attacks the cash-primed laisser faire of Docklands, whose ill-designed transport system is another primer in how-not-to-do-it. After visiting some of London's more desperate council estates, he praises re-furbishment based upon close community consultation. The argument that binds, or should bind, the two parts of the book together is the critique of the capital's planning processes. Here, however, the reader will be disappointed. It is not at all clear what is proposed. Rogers speaks of transferring powers from the London boroughs to 'a number of boards' made up of councillors, specialists and 'lay citizens', a category in which he includes, bizarrely, architectural journalists. There's a whiff of the professional's secret garden in his arguments about aesthetics. Fisher trots out the party line - a lightweight city-wide authority in charge of strategic planning, public transport and promotion. As with Labour's other constitutional reforms, the devil is in the detail of precise powers, boundaries and ripple effects; such detail is evaded. Not that any Londoner, indeed any citizen in a democracy, would deny the desirability of 'strong political leadership' such as the authors admire in the reconstruction of Barcelona. But how to get it? London has had, in many of its boroughs, decades of single-party government; is that strong? When it had a Greater London Council, that body did go in and out with the political tide, but was that strong? Fisher notes that the period 1965 to 1986 was the only time in London's history when the capital had a strategic, metropolitan planning body. This was hardly London's golden age of planning and transport policy. Indeed, it was the period when the de-industrialisation of the Thames made that particular grand projet do-able, but left it undone. Londoners, however, will mostly rejoice at the spirit of this book. Of course we should have competitive airports, a voice for London and a government which sets an architectural example in its own building projects, making more use of architectural competitions along the way. Personally, I'll also sign the petition for Rogers' 'linear park' from Westminster to Blackfriars, not to mention the wonderful idea of excluding traffic from the north side of Trafalgar Square and so creating a great, pedestrianised apron between the National Gallery and the square. We need, however, to remember that London's political realities are more complex than here allowed. If reformers misjudge them, history shows that debilitation or paralysis will ensue.</p>

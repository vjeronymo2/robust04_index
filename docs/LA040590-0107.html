			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KING SALMON ARE CAUGHT NEAR NEWPORT HARBOR  </P> <P> King salmon, generally targeted by fishermen in northern waters, have shown up  in fairly impressive numbers recently just outside Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> Fishermen have been catching the game fish on an incidental basis in recent  days.  </P> <P> The 11 aboard Newport Landing's Reveille each caught his two-fish limit in just  a few hours Wednesday, which may indicate a lasting bite similar to one in the  same area two years ago.  </P> <P> "It's not unusual that they are down there in the spring, because the water is  usually at its coldest at this time," said Dave Parker, a biologist with the  Department of Fish and Game. "It was unusual two years ago because of the  magnitude. They were catching them down there for a month, maybe longer."  </P> <P> Skipper Jim Watts said he came across the fish Tuesday -- his passengers  hooking three and catching one -- after spending most of the day fishing for  rockfish.  </P> <P> He decided to try specifically for salmon on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "We went out looking around, about a quarter-mile off (Newport) Harbor, and we  saw some birds, then some salmon flashing through some bait," Watts said.  </P> <P> In a few hours his passengers had boated their legal shares of salmon weighing  between 10 and 18 pounds.

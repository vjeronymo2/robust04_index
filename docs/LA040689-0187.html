			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A FEMINIST WITH FUNNY FIRST NOVEL  </P> <P> Willis Jane Digby wears a tuxedo and rabbit ears to get into the mood for  reading the letters-to-the-editor at SIS magazine, "a bimonthly cross between a  feminist Time and a liberated Ladies' Home Journal."  </P> <P> Digby wears her ears for a newspaper photographer in poet Carol Muske-Dukes'  wacky first novel, "Dear Digby," newly out from Viking. But her creator isn't  about to follow suit.  </P> <P> Muske-Dukes owns a pair of wired-together rabbit ears someone gave her as a  joke, but she blushes at the idea of putting them on. Instead, she offers the  ears to her 5-year-old daughter, Annie, who wears them willingly.  </P> <P> A picture of herself in rabbit ears "is the sort of thing that could follow you  for the rest of your life," the writer says. "I don't think I'd ever live it  down."  </P> <P> Muske-Dukes draws clear lines between herself and her character in every way.  "I really dislike the idea that when you write a novel, you're writing  autobiography," she says. That idea "gives no credence to the transformative  power of the imagination."  </P> <P> At 42, Muske-Dukes seems both self-assured and somewhat demure. Married for six  years to actor David Dukes, she lives in a light-filled house on a quiet street  in Hancock Park. She teaches fiction and poetry writing at USC, where she's an  assistant professor.  </P> <P> David Dukes puts in an appearance to say hello, then takes Annie and the  5-year-old family dog, Digby, for a walk. ("I figured if you name your dog  after your novel, it'll embarrass you enough to make you finish" the book,  Muske-Dukes says.)  </P> <P> Well-respected in literary circles (she's won praise from Pulitzer  Prize-winning poets Carolyn Kizer and Donald Justice, critic Marjorie Perloff  and others), Muske-Dukes has published three books of poetry and continues to  publish poems and essays under her maiden name.  </P> <P> She reviews poetry for the New York Times Book Review and her fourth book of  poems, "Applause," is due out from the University of Pittsburgh Press in May.  Although she's published under the surname Muske all these years, the writer  added her husband's last name for her novel because "the novel felt so  different." The part-time name change "doesn't really make sense but it does to  me in some writerly way," she says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed Reviews  </P> <P> Early reviews of the book have been mixed. Publishers Weekly called the novel a  "silly, sentimental valentine of a book saved by Dukes' natural flair for  comedy" while Library Journal tagged it "funny, sad and highly recommended" and  Kirkus Reviews described the book as "something of a Miss Lonelyhearts for the  liberated Eighties." Several film companies, including Bette Midler's All Girl  Productions, have expressed interest.  </P> <P> Like her character Digby, Muske-Dukes was a tomboy. She grew up in St. Paul,  Minn., with four brothers and a sister, attended Catholic schools, studied  English and journalism at Creighton University in Nebraska and earned a  master's degree in creative writing from San Francisco State University.  </P> <P> Also like her character, the writer is a strong feminist. "I was always a  feminist, from the time I was a kid, actually. I thought certain things that  are considered masculine would be open to me, and I was quite shocked to  discover they weren't," she says. "I expected to have no obstacles in my path,  the way young men expect. I was quite a happy child but an unhappy adolescent"  when, at puberty, she began encountering societal expectations that women be  "fragile, and weak, and indecisive."  </P> <P> After she finished school, Muske-Dukes went to Europe for a year and stumbled  into a job singing in the French stage production of the musical, "Hair."  </P> <P> "I was disastrous," she remembers. "My French was inadequate, so when they said  'stand up' I'd sit down."  </P> <P> Back in the United States, she lived in New York City for 12 years,  free-lancing articles to Ms, the Village Voice and other publications, teaching  part-time at Columbia University, working as an assistant editor for the  literary magazine Antaeus and founding a writing program for Rikers Island  prison inmates, "Art Without Walls." For a few years she was married to Edward  Healton, a neurologist; metaphors drawn from the human nervous system run  through some of Muske-Dukes' poetry. She also taught writing at the University  of Iowa Writers Workshop, UC Irvine, George Washington University and  elsewhere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Numerous Grants  </P> <P> Muske-Dukes has won numerous grants, including a 1981 Guggenheim fellowship in  poetry that paid her way for a year in Italy. There she met David Dukes while  he worked on the television miniseries, "The Winds of War."  </P> <P> "We traveled all over the Italian countryside together. It was like a fairy  tale. It was very romantic, I have to admit," she says. Back in the United  States, they were a bi-coastal couple until her pregnancy, when she moved to  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I think our marriage works because we're from different worlds and we can  teach each other a lot about what we do," she says. "We have friends in both  worlds. It's invigorating."  </P> <P> David Dukes is "a very good critic" of her writing, Muske-Dukes says. When she  reads things to him "he'll give me his instant feedback, which is uncannily and  annoyingly right. He's a natural editor, I guess." The two have written a  screenplay together, and "I'm trying to get my husband to work with me, to  write a (stage) play. I don't know why I keep trying these projects that  terrify me!"  </P> <P> The idea for Muske-Dukes' novel originated in her New York years, from  conversations with a good friend who worked as letters editor at Ms. But SIS,  the author hastens to add, "really isn't Ms. It's just a mythical feminist  magazine."  </P> <P> At first, Muske-Dukes and the letters editor planned to write the novel  together. The editor, however, lost interest, and Muske-Dukes also found  herself losing steam. She put the manuscript away for six years.  </P> <P> But the idea stayed with her, and she returned to it in the summer of 1987,  when she and her husband lived in London while he acted in the Eugene O'Neill  play "Strange Interlude," with Glenda Jackson.  </P> <P> "I guess I had been writing (the novel) all those years in my head, because (in  London) I found myself sitting down at 9 or 10 at night and writing" steadily,  Muske-Dukes says. "It was a remarkable experience; it just came all of a piece;  it just flowed."  </P> <P> "I don't know if I'll ever write another novel," she adds. "I'm not a natural  fiction writer. I feel poetry comes much more easily. In poetry I feel like I'm  working on long-term themes, life themes. With fiction, there's that linear  release, that sense of a door closing" once an event is described.  </P> <P> "I think poetry can save the world. I'm a real believer in its power of healing  and transforming. I wish more people read it. . . . Poetry is probably as close  as I would get to religious feeling. I think poetry makes the world stand  still," Muske-Dukes says.  </P> <P> Yet she turned to fiction, she says, because "there's a point at which you feel  poetry is so cut off from the majority of people in the world, or the majority  of people in the world are cut off from it. (With fiction) you at least have  the illusion people can pick up your words and understand them."  </P> <P> Her first book of poetry, "Camouflage," was published in 1975 by University of  Pittsburgh Press. Muske-Dukes' poems, particularly those of "Skylight"  (Doubleday: 1981) and "Wyndmere" (University of Pittsburgh: 1985) and the  coming "Applause" "are probably a lot closer to my self" than the fiction, she  says. "They draw on my life; they're closer to the voice I cannot use in  everyday life to express what I feel."  </P> <P> These days, much of the writer's energy goes into teaching her USC classes and  taking care of her daughter.  </P> <P> Annie appears in a number of the writer's newest poems. "I'm not consciously  trying to include her, but she's part of my psyche and she just keeps turning  up. She functions as a kind of touchstone in the poems.  </P> <P> A writer who seems to have everything -- work she loves, enough money, critical  acclaim, charming husband and child -- Muske-Dukes asserts that she's worked  hard to reach this point in her career, but she also feels "there's a special  blessing in my life; there's an angel.  </P> <P> "Guardian angels, I believe in those. There's something out there, something  that's kept me safe and blessed me. I think if you leave yourself open to  possibility, the world is filled with miracles."  </P></p>

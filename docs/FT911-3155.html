			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Greek workers stage privatisation protest MORE than 30,000 workers from a group of Greek companies due to be privatised staged a one-day strike yesterday to protest against plans to speed up closures of plants that are failing to attract buyers. The workers say the government should instead adopt a proposal by the Greek Industrialists' Federation to offer some companies to the private sector on short-term leases. Only two out of 28 debt-burdened industrial companies due for privatisation this year have been sold. The state-controlled Industrial Reconstruction Organisation, which makes payments on their accumulated debts of over Dr200bn (Dollars 1.05bn), plans to liquidate another 14 companies shortly. Among them are several textile plants, white goods manufacturers and a paper mill. All are considered unlikely to find buyers. Last year about 6,000 workers from IRO companies were offered a year's retraining on full pay, but no such provision was made for the remainder. Just over 8 per cent of the Greek workforce is unemployed. But the Industrialists' Federation says that one in three workers in the 18-23 age group cannot find a job.</p>

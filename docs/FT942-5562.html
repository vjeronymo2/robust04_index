			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: CCA to take over Polish interests of Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), the quoted Australian soft drinks group which is 51 per cent-owned by the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company (CCC), is to expand its presence in central and eastern Europe by buying out its parent's interests in Poland in a cash deal. No financial details have been disclosed. CCC made its first direct investment in Poland three years ago. It is one of three franchise owners for Coca-Cola brands in the country - the others being Ringes, a Norwegian bottler, and Brau, an Austrian brewer. Ringes also owns a 51 per cent interest in a Warsaw bottling joint venture, with CCC holding the rest. CCA declined to say how much it expected to pay for its parent's interests, which cover brands such as Fanta, Sprite and Bonaqa as well as Coke and Coke Lite. It said only that total investment in the Coca-Cola 'system' in Poland had amounted to around Dollars 300m, of which Coca-Cola had contributed 'a fair amount'. CCA said the purchase would give it access to 22.4m consumers, plus a further 6m through the 49 per cent interest in the Warsaw joint venture. In volume terms, the parent company's Polish interests represent the supply of around 700m 8oz bottles a year. Assuming the deal goes ahead, CCA would own four of the seven manufacturing plants in Poland and add around 1,000 employees to its payroll. CCA, despite its Antipodean base, has been steadily amassing Coca-Cola franchises in Austria and eastern Europe, as well as the Asia-Pacific region. However, it has only bought directly from its parent on two previous occasions: New Zealand and Indonesia. The company said it expected further overseas expansionary moves in the future - which could involve either parent-owned or independent franchises and would not necessarily be concentrated in eastern Europe. Mr Dean Wills, Coca-Cola Amatil's managing director, yesterday announced that he was stepping down. CCA will appoint two joint managing directors - Mr Bill Gibson, currently deputy managing director, and Mr Norborne Cole, at present chief executive officer of Coca-Cola Beverages in France. Mr Wills stays on as chairman.</p>

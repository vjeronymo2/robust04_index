			<p>BFN     [Text] Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN envoy to Yemen, arrived in  Cairo today from Geneva after meeting with UN Secretary General  Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who is currently in Geneva to discuss  the Yemeni problem. Ibrahimi will also discuss the events in  Yemen with Egyptian officials. He will travel to Yemen  afterward, in an attempt to convince the two sides to the  conflict to adhere to the Security Council resolution issued  last week that called for an immediate halt to the fighting in  Yemen.</p>

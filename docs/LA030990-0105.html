			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SETON HALL: WHAT A DIFFERENCE YEAR MAKES  </P> <P> The NCAA Final Four shirts were piled high, unsold and seemingly unwanted, in  the corner of the bookstore located in the basement of Duffy Hall. They were  marked down, reduced, and still they remained on the shelves; hundreds of them,  it seemed. "Seton Hall, NCAA Final Four," "Battle in Seattle" and "NCAA  Championship Game, Seattle" they read.  </P> <P> "I don't know why they don't get rid of these shirts," said Leslie Allen, an  employee at the bookstore. "We don't sell any of them, I don't think. I've  never seen anybody buying them, at least not since it turned 1990."  </P> <P> "What about when the alumni were here?" one of the counter clerks, Ellen Davis,  said. "What was that, about a week, no, two weeks ago?"  </P> <P> "Yeah," Allen said.  </P> <P> "How many did we sell then?" Davis said. "We sell a lot?"  </P> <P> "One, I think," Allen said. "Two, at most. It's not like we have to go and  stock them back up all the time. I don't know why they just don't throw them  all out. I think the problem is (the team is) losing all the time. Doesn't that  team ever win anymore?"  </P> <P> Welcome to Seton Hall University, 1990, less than one year after the Pirates  took the campus, and a nation, by storm. They had begun the '88-89 season  picked seventh in the Big East and finished it with an 80-79 overtime loss to  Michigan in the NCAA Championship Game in Seattle. This year, Seton Hall comes  to the Big East Tournament as just another also-ran.  </P> <P> The Pirates (12-15) just missed making an appearance in Thursday night's  dreaded last-place game when they beat St. John's Saturday in the  regular-season finale. Still, Seton Hall holds faint hope it will find a way to  sweep through the tournament, thus earning an automatic bid to the NCAA  Tournament. Friday at Madison Square Garden, the Pirates play a first-round  game against this year's dark horse -- eighth-ranked and second-seeded  Connecticut. Anything less than a Big East Tournament title and the Pirates  will be without a postseason berth -- either NCAA or National Invitation  Tournament -- for the first time in four seasons.  </P> <P> "It's been difficult," said Coach P.J. Carlesimo, the two-time Big East coach  of the year who just last April threw out the first ball of the season at  Yankee Stadium and was offered a job as coach of Kentucky in the same week.  "But this is inevitable. It's a different team from that one; there are so many  new kids and different expectations. We didn't know what our potential was, how  good or bad we would be. I'm not saying we did a great job, but we do have nine  first-year players, two of them walk-ons, and we have been competitive, been  entertaining for the most part. I still think this team is better than the NIT  team we had three years ago. This team doesn't have the numbers to back it up,  but this is a pretty good team."  </P> <P> But not good enough. Where last season Seton Hall always seemed to find a way  to win, this team, with five new starters -- has been the opposite, losing 10  of 16 games decided by fewer than 10 points, six of those by five points or  fewer. In February, Seton Hall lost six of seven games, although all but one --  a 78-65 loss at Boston College -- were to ranked teams. This season, the  Pirates have fallen to Oklahoma (89-84) and North Carolina State (65-62), to  Syracuse (74-65 and 71-69), St. John's (90-81, OT) and, yes, also to Michigan  (91-86).  </P> <P> "It's been very tough," swingman Michael Cooper, one of only two scholarship  seniors on the team, said last week after the Pirates had fallen to Syracuse on  a last-second tip-in by Derrick Coleman. "It hasn't really sunk in yet what has  happened this season; that come the tournament, our next loss will be our last  game. The toughest part is we've been right there. We've played all the  top-ranked teams in the nation on national television and we're right there all  the time. But we can't seem to grab it."  </P> <P> Seton Hall is led by freshman guard Terry Dehere, who has averaged 16.5 points,  3.4 assists and 2.1 rebounds, but who has been pressing of late -- his shooting  percentage is down to 39.1 percent in the league after a brilliant early-season  stretch. Cooper, meanwhile, has been the most consistent player on a team that  has been erratic at best. He has averaged 13.6 points and 6.3 rebounds and shot  57 percent from the field. The Pirates have been plagued by the sporadic inside  play of Frantz Volcy, a 6-8 senior who has averaged 12.2 points, 6.5 rebounds  and 3.9 fouls per game. Center Anthony Avent has been a solid rebounder with  9.3 per game, but has not produced much offense -- he has averaged 10.7 points  -- and has also averaged 3.9 fouls per game. The Hall has lacked depth and a  true point guard who can run the offense. It has won some games and remained  close in others mainly because of aggressive man-to-man defense.  </P> <P> "Last year, we went into the Big East Tournament knowing that no matter what  happened we were going somewhere in the NCAA Tournament," Volcy said. "Now, all  that has changed. We know we can beat these teams; know we've been so close.  But we also know it's do-or-die."  </P> <P> That desperation, it seems, is reflected on campus. Where last year there were  parties, parades and celebrations for a team that captured both the heart and  imagination of the community, now, it seems, there is little interest.  </P> <P> "See Your Pirates Versus Syracuse, 7 P.M. In The Game Room," read the sign  outside the Bishop Dougherty Student Center one day last week. And below,  "Confessions all day in chapel."  </P> <P> "It's not like it was last year," said Kim Lecardo, a sophomore working the  information desk in the student center who said a crowd of about "20 to 25" was  expected for the telecast that night. "People on campus just don't care that  much about the team now."  </P> <P> Which, perhaps, is why so many of those shirts still remain on sale at the  bookstore in Duffy Hall. "You know," Cooper said, "I don't think they sell many  of those shirts, but it's probably because of the price." Maybe, it's because  they only serve as a reminder of how far the team has fallen.  </P></p>

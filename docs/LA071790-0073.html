			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS REDUCE USE OF WATER 11%  </P> <P> Camarillo residents cut water consumption by 11% during May and June, but  overall water use rose 5% in the 1989 fiscal year that ended June 30.  </P> <P> Residents began to use less water after the City Council adopted a conservation  ordinance in April that makes it illegal to hose down sidewalks or wash  automobiles with hoses that do not contain automatic shut-off valves.  </P> <P> The ordinance also prohibits lawn watering between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m.  </P> <P> During May and June, the Camarillo Water Department pumped 489 million gallons  of water, compared to 538 million gallons during the same time last year,  producing a savings of 49 million gallons, Elwell said.  </P> <P> "This shows that people are very aware of the water shortage and have begun to  reduce wasteful practices," said John Elwell, city director of community  services.  </P> <P> Since the ordinance was adopted, the city has issued 282 citations. Of those,  four were to second-time offenders, who were fined 50% of their most recent  water bills, Elwell said. The remaining 278 citations were warning notices.  </P> <P> To encourage people to save even more water, the council has decided to bill  customers monthly and introduce a tiered pricing system.  </P> <P> Starting Oct. 1, customers who reduce water use by 10% will notice no change in  their monthly rate, said Anita Bingham, city finance director. Those who use  more than the average 11,968 gallons a month will pay more depending on how  much water they use, she said.  </P> <P> The average water bill, which is sent every two months, is $34.40, Elwell said.

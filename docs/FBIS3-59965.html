			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by correspondent Manuel Cabrera] </F>   [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 4 December--During an air  operation, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic  [PGR] detected 100 clandestine landing strips in the  Juarez-Ojinaga region (an area adjoining the border), used by  South American aircraft to refuel and to smuggle cocaine into  the United States. This announcement was made today by the  Federal Judicial Police regional commander, Javier Norona  Guerrero.    The operations, associated with a program to curb the  international drug traffic, were concentrated on the border  between Mexico and the neighboring country to the north. There  the forces, promptly backed by helicopters and ground units,  began destroying the runways.    The Federal Judicial Police first commander, Jose Maria  Barragan, explained that the counternarcotics operations have  been supported with over 135 flight hours logged during the past  15 days. He remarked that the air units have flown over both the  Rio Grande shores in Valle de Juarez and extremely dense  sections of the Tarahumara sierra. These areas have been used by  the drug cartels for refueling their planes and moving drugs to  the United States.    Norona Guerrero, in turn, noted that backing has been  requested from the Communications and Transport Secretariat, for  the purpose of identifying the specific runways that have  permission to operate.    In the future, to prevent the drug traffickers' aircraft  from  evading the blockade, which they could do by flying at low  altitudes, several PGR planes will engage in constant patrolling.    The commander also announced that reinforcements of  machinery  would be requested, so as to totally destroy the airstrips.  However, he indicated: ``This work will be strenuous, because of  the rugged terrain selected by the `narcos' for constructing  this type of access.''</p>

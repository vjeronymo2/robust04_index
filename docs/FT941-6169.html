			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Bank sets telecom aid rules: 'No intention to reform - no money' The World Bank will make the promotion of competition and private-sector investment a condition for supporting telecommunications modernisation in less-developed countries. Dr Bjorn Wellenius, the World Bank's principal telecommunications specialist, told an FT conference on Asia-Pacific telecommunications that aid and loans had to be 'closely tied' to policies of liberalisation if they were to succeed. 'No intention to reform: no money - that's likely to be World Bank policy in future,' he told the conference in Hong Kong. Dr Wellenius said less-developed countries needed to invest Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn) a year until the year 2000 to build basic networks, up from Dollars 10bn a year in the 1980s. In the 1980s, only about 15 per cent of investment came from the private sector; that proportion would need to rise to half, from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 20bn a year, to meet investment requirements. 'The role of government is to regulate market-oriented solutions,' he said. The World Bank statement comes at a critical juncture in the development of telecommunications policies in less-developed countries. Latin American governments have pursued privatisation, but most telecoms operations in less-developed Asian countries are still state-owned, with limited opportunities for the private sector. Only 1.5 per cent of World Bank outlays (about Dollars 300m a year) is devoted to telecommunications, but its advice has a strong bearing on the stance of the private sector and other international lending institutions. Mr Robert Morris, partner of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said government attitudes to privatisation were 'critical' to their ability to raise funds. 'If governments just want to raise a few bucks to reduce the national deficit, that's not a compelling reason to invest in the industry when there are lots of other privatisation opportunities available worldwide.' Mr Simeon Kintanar, head of the Philippines telecommunications commission, said his country, which has barely 1m lines for its 70m population, was creating a 'conducive policy environment' for overseas investors. 'Our vision is that applications for phone connections should take 10 days, not 10 years,' he said. However, Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecoms group which wants to boost its investment in the region, cited the Philippines as one country with restrictions on foreign operators, making investment less attractive.</p>

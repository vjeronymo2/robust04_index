			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FISCAL STRAITS PERIL LA JOLLA DRAMA SEASON  </P> <P> The La Jolla Playhouse announced Monday that its 1990 theater season is in  jeopardy and that the organization needs to raise $500,000 by the end of the  year "to assure that there will be a 1990 season."  </P> <P> The playhouse released the statement detailing a $1-million fund-raising  program in the wake of rumors of wobbly finances and an unfavorable financial  report from the California Arts Council last month.  </P> <P> The theater plans to raise $500,000 by Dec. 31 and another $500,000 by June 30,  1990, as a cash reserve to offset an accumulated deficit of $703,000.  </P> <P> Playhouse Managing Director Allan Levey said the 1990 season cannot happen  unless that initial $500,000 is raised. "It would not be prudent," Levey said,  "which is why we want to broaden the base of our contributed income by going to  the community at large."  </P> <P> Widely considered a major theatrical force locally and nationally since its  rebirth in 1983 under artistic director Des McAnuff, the La Jolla Playhouse has  suffered financially from short seasons that have made high running and  production costs difficult to offset.  </P> <P> "I fully expect we'll raise the money," McAnuff added. "It's our obsession and  our focus at the moment," he said, acknowledging, however, that, if they don't,  "there will have to be a backup plan."  </P> <P> Levey said, "We have the shortest playing time and smallest number of seats of  any LORT (League of Resident Theaters) theater," adding that, because of the  playhouse's tie-in with UC San Diego, on whose campus it resides, "we have a  fixed move-out date every year. It can't change because the university needs  the theater."  </P> <P> The deficit, which began in the third season, accrued drastically in 1987 by  $500,000. In fiscal 1988 it grew by $200,000. This was due, Levey said, to a  shortfall in contributed income and poor single-ticket sales -- a condition  that appears to have persisted.  </P> <P> According to Levey, McAnuff and board president Mason Phelps, the situation  will be alleviated once two new projected on-campus theaters are completed: the  $5-million, 400-seat Weiss Forum (expected to be ready in May, 1991), and a  400-seat black box to be built within the next three years.  </P> <P> "Those will allow us to expand to a nine-month season and to generate more  funds," Levey said.  </P> <P> Money for construction of the Forum is available, but, according to Phelps and  Levey, construction bids came in over budget, forcing the university to  redesign the theater and reopen the bidding, in compliance with state  procedure. This has delayed completion by a full year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Full Solution to Problem'  </P> <P> The third theater, which Phelps and Levey say represents "the full solution to  the problem," will be funded by a $6.8-million capital campaign, to be kicked  off by the current fund-raising effort.  </P> <P> "When the Forum is complete," Levey said, "we'll be able to earn an additional  $300,000 a year, based on the income potential of 150 seats more than we now  have at the Warren Theatre (the playhouse's current second space). In addition,  he said, "There will be no accumulated deficit in 1989. In fact, we will reduce  the deficit by $60,000. We'll end this season with a balanced budget."  </P> <P> "Without that third theater," McAnuff said, "we can't have the access we need.  That access will enable us to operate year-round. It will give us the ability  to extend hit productions, something we don't have at the moment."  </P> <P> Both Levey and McAnuff insist that producing fewer plays a year will not solve  the problem. "Administrative overhead remains the same," Levey said. "We can't  hire staff seasonally. Reducing the number of plays is not a solution. There's  no way to operate a LORT theater on this basis. We're the only theater that  does that -- for good reason. It can't be done."  </P> <P> McAnuff said, "It's been a huge strain. We know we cannot realistically expect  these sums of money from the same small group of people. We have to expand our  contributed income base."  </P> <P> Despite criticism, sometimes from some of his own board members, that he spends  too much on lavish productions, McAnuff doesn't think he should have done it  any differently.  </P> <P> "If I could have 10 'A Walk in Woods' and 10 'The Fool Show' (low-expense,  high-income productions), maybe. But the solution is not two-character plays,"  he said. "With special projects come certain kinds of underwriting. When we do  larger shows, we always try to identify funds that will take care of those  (larger) expenses.  </P> <P> "The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund gave us a grant of $126,000 to help  bring in 'The Grapes of Wrath.' Expenses on 'Dangerous Games' were shared with  the Spoleto Festival USA, and Philadelphia's American Music Theatre Festival.  The key is getting through 1990 and, frankly, we'll do whatever it takes.  </P> <P> "Giving birth to an arts institution in the 1980s is a very daring  undertaking," McAnuff added. "I think it's a miracle that we've done as well as  we have."  </P> <P> The new money raised by the playhouse will be used to match a three-year,  $250,000 National Endowment for the Arts challenge grant awarded the playhouse  in February for the specific purpose of stabilizing its base.  </P></p>

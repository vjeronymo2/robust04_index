			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Disposals help Suez surge 54% Suez, the French financial services and investment group, yesterday announced profits of FFr795m (Dollars 149.7m) for the first half of 1994, up 54 per cent on the same period last year. The result included an exceptional gain of FFr317m, compared with FFr381m last time, which the group said also took into account losses realised on the disposal of Groupe Victoire, the insurance company sold to Commercial Union of the UK earlier this year. These losses - as well as other provisions - were offset by various exceptional gains, including the sale of its shares in Compagnie Fonciere Internationale to Unibail earlier this year. Operating profits more than doubled, to FFr478m compared with FFr135m in the first half last year, and full-year 1993 operating losses of FFr1.3bn. The company said the rise reflected the solid performance of subsidiaries against a background of difficult markets and banking conditions and heavy property provisions.</p>

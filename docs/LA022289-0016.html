			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SDSU GETS BREAK FROM WAC, PLAYS FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL  </P> <P> The San Diego State men's basketball team, new occupant of last place in the  Western Athletic Conference, gets a respite from league play tonight at 7:30  when Florida International visits the San Diego Sports Arena.  </P> <P> The WAC break couldn't have come at a better time for Coach Jim Brandenburg's  team. SDSU (10-14, 4-10) has lost 10 of its past 12 WAC games and 24 of 25  conference road games, including eight in a row.  </P> <P> "I think a break from the WAC is good for us right now," Brandenburg said. "It  will be ood for us to be back home again and see if we can't get on the winning  track and gain some momentum."  </P> <P> A season that was so promising as recently as early January, when the Aztecs  won their first two WAC games, has turned sour. The Aztecs have outrebounded  opponents in 19 of 24 games but have more turnovers in WAC play (210) than  opponents (180) and a poorer free throw shooting percentage (63% to 71%).  </P> <P> One of the few bright spots has been the play of Shawn Bell. The 6-foot-6  forward led the team in Saturday's 71-67 loss at Wyoming with 16 points, nine  rebounds and four assists.  </P> <P> Florida International's best all-around player is 6-7 forward Dwight Stewart,  who is averaging 16.7 points and 6.2 rebounds. Doug Johnson leads Florida  International in scoring with a 17.4-point average.  </P> <P> Florida International (9-15) averages 84.4 points. SCOTT MILLER  </P></p>

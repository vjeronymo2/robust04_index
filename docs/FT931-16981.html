			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wall Street double act goes solo but the song remains the same - Stephen Friedman has lost his co-chairman at Goldman Sachs but there will be no change in the firm's strategy A rare Wall Street double act has just become a solo performance, though the song seems likely to remain the same. For the past two years Goldman Sachs, one of the leading and most profitable New York investment banks, has been presided over by co-chairmen: Mr Stephen Friedman and Mr Robert Rubin. It is a management structure unique among top Wall Street firms, though it has been used twice by Goldman over the past two decades. However, last month Mr Rubin, one of the top Democratic party members on Wall Street, left Goldman to become President-elect Bill Clinton's special assistant on economic affairs, and Mr Friedman became sole chairman. It is the end of an era for Goldman: the two men, whom colleagues say have a remarkable rapport, had worked closely together in senior positions since the mid-1980s. They were appointed co-chief operating officers in 1987 and took over the joint chairmanship at the end of 1990 when Mr John Weinberg, the previous incumbent, stepped down from day-to-day management. The change invites two questions: who is Mr Friedman, a man with a reputation for shunning publicity? And will Mr Rubin's departure mean any shift in Goldman's strategy? On the latter point, Mr Friedman gives an emphatic no. In a memo to staff when Mr Rubin's White House appointment was announced, he stressed that 'apart from normal evolution, you should not expect any departures from the managerial or strategic courses we have been on'. Central to that strategy is the continued expansion of Goldman as one of the world's few strongly international investment banks, with important operations in the US, Europe and Asia. 'We want to be a truly global firm,' Mr Friedman says. 'That doesn't mean trying to imitate the local firms in each market we're in, because unless we bring something different to the party, there's no particular reason to use us.' Aged 54, but looking younger, he is a slim, fit man who likes to run - 'exercise is the best relaxer I know' - and has a low-key manner but a reputation for crisp yet thoughtful management. With an ivy league education and a training in law - Cornell University and the Columbia University Law School - he joined Goldman in 1966 and was fortuitously thrust into the then small, but rapidly expanding world of the takeover advisory work. 'When I joined the merger department we were primarily selling family-owned or relatively small companies, but during the next few years we pioneered many of the techniques now standard in the industry,' he recalls. One of these was the defence of companies against bid raids, out of which grew a reputation, which Goldman retains today, for not acting on behalf of hostile takeovers. Takeover work became a key feature of Goldman's growth in the 1970s and 1980s, allowing it to build up strong relationships with corporate clients: there is nothing closer to the centre of power than advising a chief executive on group strategy. In the mid-1980s, the firm moved into the European take-over market with considerable success, though its sometimes brash tactics in the British market have irritated some local investment banking rivals. Mr Friedman became co-head of Goldman's investment banking business in the early 1980s and helped build up the firm's strength in equity underwriting, where it now usually ranks first or second in the US league tables. With Mr Rubin, he revamped the firm's fixed income department from 1985 to 1988, taking the un-Goldman-like step of bringing in fresh talent from outside, including some from much brasher rival Salomon Brothers. After that, he shook up the firm's information systems and operations areas. All this has given him broad exposure to Goldman's businesses and firm views on how to preserve the group's particular culture, with its strong emphasis on collegial teamwork, at a time of rapid international growth. 'The business is becoming increasingly inter-departmental and intricate,' he says. 'You must have very short lines of communication and you must avoid debates about transfer pricing (between departments) and turf. An enormous amount of our management efforts have been directed to maximising teamwork in these areas.' Roughly 30 per cent of Goldman's 7,000 employees work abroad and Mr Friedman says he wants an increasing proportion of managerial staff to be local nationals, though this will have to be achieved within the 'one-firm Goldman Sachs culture'. It is a culture which has long placed great emphasis on the primacy of relationships with corporate clients - and Mr Friedman's conversation is peppered with references to this. However, some Wall Street critics question whether in recent years Goldman has, like several investment banking rivals, subtly shifted its focus towards greater trading on the firm's own account. Critics have accused Goldman of being slow to react to market changes. Retorts Mr Friedman: 'I think historically that was a valid criticism, but certainly not in recent years, since we have been at the forefront of innovation. We're a dramatically different firm than we were then.' He and Mr Rubin had no formal division of responsibilities, though they both say the joint chairmanship worked well. 'It's an approach I would only recommend for people who have extremely good chemistry and are secure in themselves, so they are not keeping score about who won how many debates,' says Mr Friedman. Mr Rubin, with his work for the Democratic Party, tended to be seen as the public face of Goldman and his partner as the private face. However, Mr Friedman tended to spend the greater time of the two in Washington lobbying on securities industry issues and he insists that 'in terms of client relationships we criss-crossed the globe roughly equally'. Nor will the departure of Mr Rubin mean any significant change in the way the firm is run, with executive decisions bounced around its relatively young, 11-member management committee. 'I will certainly miss Bob,' says Mr Friedman, 'but its not as if either of us was the other person's only sounding board.'</p>

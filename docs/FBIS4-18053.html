			<p>BFN     [Text] Only 16 out of every 100 Russian young men aged 18  are called up for army service. In 1988 the figure was 70. All  the rest are relieved because of poor health or are deferred.  Last year the Russian Army had only half of the prescribed  strength. The spring-time call-up is also having problems.    These facts were reported on Thursday at a joint meeting in  Moscow of the leaders of the medical service of the Army, the  conscription group, the parliamentary committees for defence and  health protection, the interior and education ministries and the  Russian Academy of Medical Sciences.    Participants accounted the current miserable situation with  conscription to the actual decline in health standards among  young people. Last year 26.4 pct [percent] of young men were  relieved of army service on account of poor health. Diseases of  internal organs ranked first, mental diseases second. However,  speakers felt that the outdated system of medical examination  allows to call up actually sick people and simultaneously  permits various forms of fraud. The conference formed a working  group to draft a plan to improve health care and prepare young  people for army service.</p>

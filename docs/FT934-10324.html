			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar rises ahead of jobs data THE DOLLAR picked up against the D-Mark and Japanese yen yesterday as banks fine-tuned their strategic currency positions ahead of today's all-important US employment figures, writes Peter John. Most economists expect the October figure for all employment except agriculture to rise by between 145,000 and 175,000. If the increase is significantly higher, say around 200,000, that could help the dollar break through its recent range against the D-Mark. However, according to Mr Adrian Cunningham, economist with UBS, any strength in the US currency yesterday had little to do with a shift in fundamental investor perception. 'The dollar perked up a bit on the latest data for jobless claims and factory goods orders, but it was really a reflection of day-to-day interbank movements,' he said. In Tokyo, the dollar was caught in tight ranges against the yen and D-Mark, held in by mild short-covering on one side and interbank offers on the other. However, a 430-point fall in the Nikkei stock index underlined the worries over the Japanese economy and fuelled calls for a further reduction in interest rates from their already low level of 1.75 per cent. In Europe, the dollar closed at Y108.30, up from Y107.25 previously. Against the D-Mark, it rose to DM1.6960 from DM1.6930. New York trading finished with the dollar at Y108.15 and DM1.6956. Its movement against the German currency was also underscored by D-Mark weakness. Following changes to the European exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of August, the importance of Germany as a financial anchor has diminished and investors have been selling the currency. Dealers added that fund managers with a calendar year end were already beginning to balance their books and take profits after a volatile year in the foreign exchange market. The decision by the German Bundesbank to leave its discount and Lombard rates unchanged at 5.75 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively was already factored into investors' calculations and had no apparent effect on the currency. The D-Mark was soft against the Danish krone in spite of the possible impact of Wednesday's cut in the Danish discount rate. It also gave up earlier gains against the French and Belgian francs. It even failed to make significant inroads against the Italian lira, overshadowed by a corruption scandal, and only rose to L968.90 from L965.30. Late on Wednesday Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian president, made a surprise address on television denying involvement in illegal activities. Sterling continued its recent trend of weakness against the dollar and firmness against the D-Mark as the debate over whether interest rates will fall maintained centre stage. The pound finished at Dollars 1.4795, down from Dollars 1.4805, and at DM2.51, up from DM2.5075.</p>

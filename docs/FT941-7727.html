			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: ASX upholds one share, one vote Mr Laurie Cox, chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), said yesterday that it had decided not to allow companies to issue shares with differential voting rights but would adhere to the 'one share, one vote principle'. Whether the ASX should relax its listing rules became controversial last year after Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation said that it wanted to issue a tranche of new shares with multiple or 'super' voting rights. News Corp is one of the biggest and most heavily traded stocks on the ASX and there were fears that, if the ASX did not meet its request, the company would move its listing to another international exchange where the rules were less constricting. Companies are able to issue shares with differential voting rights on the New York Stock Exchange. However, News Corp's request for a change was fiercely opposed by local institutional investors, who feared that it could encourage dubious practices and undermine shareholder rights. Although News Corp withdrew its scheme voluntarily, the ASX said it would still make a decision on the principle involved. 'In deciding not to change its listing rules, the ASX board had taken into account that the present listing rule providing for one share-one vote for ordinary shares, coupled with the ASX's power to administer the rule flexibly, had served the need of the Australian capital market well,' said Mr Cox. Mr Cox added that the ASX will issue an exposure draft, available by June, setting out guidelines for the criteria it will use in administering the relevant listing rule.</p>

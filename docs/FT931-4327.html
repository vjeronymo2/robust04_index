			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The need to take a firmer grip on financial controls / A look at the difficult task facing the incoming chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi MR CHARLES Scott faces a difficult task when he takes over as chief executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi next month. He has to tighten further the financial disciplines imposed on the world's second largest advertising group by his predecessor, Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, when he salvaged the company. On Monday Saatchi wrote off Pounds 600m of goodwill associated with highly-expensive acquisitions made by the group in the 1980s. That attention-grabbing figure represented another purge of the financial excesses built up by Saatchi during its headlong expansion. But there is still more for Mr Scott to squeeze out of the group if it is to fulfill the recovery potential it now has. Much of the written-off goodwill is from the Ted Bates agency which Saatchi bought for Pounds 450m in 1986. As with WPP, such acquisitions were financed through debt in the belief that the 1980s boom in advertising spend would continue forever. That boom did not last, however. Mr Louis-Dreyfus, who is moving on to try to turn around the Adidas sports show company, was pulled in to rescue Saatchi from looming financial disaster in January 1990. He inherited 18,000 staff and the threat of having to redeem Pounds 211m of Euro-preference shares in 1993. He will leave behind him a successful recapitalisation in March 1991, which gained Pounds 60m in new equity, and staff levels brought down to 12,000. But problems remain and some analysts feel that Mr Louis-Dreyfus is departing with the task only half completed. There are some problems remaining from the excesses of the 1980s - not least the estimated Pounds 20m annual cost of the holding company, which has scarcely been trimmed at all since Mr Louis-Dreyfus first arrived. The first main problem concerns debt. Average net debt at the end of 1992 was Pounds 194m, down from Pounds 225m a year ago but which will rise slightly this year - the last year of heavy earn-out payments, amounting to some Pounds 18m. 1994 will see the last earn-outs, at Pounds 1m. Losses on surplus office space will amount to Pounds 15m this year, falling to an expected Pounds 14m in 1994, Pounds 12m in 1995 and Pounds 9m in 1996. Mr Scott has said that debt reduction will be a priority; the first repayment of Pounds 20m falls due in December this year. But Saatchi's ability to repay debt is largely dependent on substantial revenue growth; given indications that the US is pulling out of its recession and that almost half of the group's revenues derive from the US, there are well-founded hopes that the group will benefit late this year from a general upturn in global advertising expenditure. However, while analysts forecast pre-tax profits growing from 1992's underlying figure of Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 23m this year and Pounds 45m in 1994, the recovery needs to be strong in order for Saatchi to be able to reassure its bankers that it will not breach its covenants, which Mr Scott says has not happened so far. The second concerns salaries, which account for some 60 per cent of fixed costs - an annual bill slightly less than Pounds 300m. A year ago Saatchi had 300 executives earning a minimum basic salary of Pounds 150,000; today there are 250. They will gradually be introduced to a system of variable remunerations, dependent on performance. That will be a painful experience and already some senior Saatchi employees are murmuring rebellion against Mr Scott. As Mr Louis-Dreyfus will continue as a non-executive director, Mr Scott will have some supporting muscle. But perhaps Mr Scott's most difficult task is more intangible. He needs to inculcate his senior staff with his own emphasis on the importance of sound financial controls, even if that means losing clients who are not prepared to pay at levels profitable for the group. In another effort to tighten financial controls, Mr Scott has said that Saatchi will no longer take on loss leaders. He was asked at the group's results presentation on Monday whether that meant Saatchi would in future decline handling the Conservative party's advertising account which is thought to be something of a loss-leader. He replied: 'We will not take on new clients if we do not see that we will make money from them.' If Mr Scott intends taking a firmer line with his own group, he also seems willing to take on those of its clients deemed unprofitable. He has signalled that if Saatchi thinks it is 'over-servicing' clients, or if clients are unwilling to pay sufficient to ensure group profitability, then the group will either seek to renegotiate fees or, failing success with that, break the relationship. If he is true to his declarations so far, shareholders may raise their hopes, though as one analyst put it, 'this is not a stock for grannies and widows.' Certainly analysts are feeling more confident about Saatchi's future than for several years. They expect small dividend payments to restart in 1995 or 1996, by which time the group is expected to be making annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 65m.</p>

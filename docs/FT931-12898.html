			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / SIB is told to reduce demands on new unit THE Securities and Invest-ments Board will have to soften its demands for strengthening the planned Personal Investment Authority if it is to earn the acceptance of the industry, Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, warned yesterday. Sir Gordon, who is also chairman of the new authority's board, said he broadly welcomed a recent letter from SIB's chairman, Mr Andrew Large, stating that the authority would not be approved unless it delivered significantly better investor protection. However, several points raised by Mr Large would require negotiation, he said. 'Whether we (the authority's board) can reach agreement is anybody's guess. And even if the board members can agree among themselves, they will still need the support of the 75 per cent majorities of Lautro (the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry) and Fimbra members. This is no easy task.' In particular, Sir Gordon questioned whether independent financial advisers should, as Mr Large has said, be required to have Pounds 10,000 in capital in order to be allowed to operate. Fimbra members have objected to the requirement, and the industry trade association estimates that such a rule could put 50 per cent to 60 per cent of independent advisers out of business. Mr Ken Bignall, managing director of Barclays Financial Services and a member of the authority's board, said the new tougher standards proposed by Mr Large go a long way towards satisfying some of his concerns about joining the body.</p>

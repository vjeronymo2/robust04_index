			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Cable groups'telecoms link will rival BT and Mercury The backbone of a national telecommunications network to rival those of BT and Mercury in the UK will be in place by mid-1995, following a move by cable television and telephone companies to create six regional networks. The networks will cover London, the Midlands, the north, East Anglia, the south coast and Scotland, bringing together the combined telephone and television operations being set up in 62 urban areas by 20 cable companies. Fibre-optic and microwave links will permit the companies, mostly US owned, to engage in joint programming and send regional telecom traffic across each other's networks without having to use BT or Mercury. Payments to BT and Mercury are the largest telecommunications outgoing of the cable companies. They want to cut their interconnection requirements to a minimum. Cable telephone subscriber numbers have grown from 109,000 to 300,000 this year, and are rising by about 20,000 a month. A regional network covering the London area will be the first launched, early next year. It will connect the networks of six operators within the M25 area. Mr John Sheridan, chief executive of Encom, a subsidiary of Bell Canada Enterprises which is building networks in east London, said 'very considerable' savings would result. The Midlands region will be the second to become operational, linking Birmingham Cable's network, the country's largest, with that of Southwestern Bell in the Black Country. A northern regional network, linking the networks of Yorkshire Cable, Southwestern Bell in Liverpool and Nynex in Manchester, is likely to be operational within a year, with the other three regions following afterwards. Mr Richard Woollam, director of the Cable Television Association, said: 'I think all six will connect up, though it may not be the cable companies that do it.' An option, he said, was to use microwave links or leased lines from existing operators and new entrants to cover long distances between regions. Birmingham Cable already has a microwave data link with south London, leased from National Transcommunications, the former transmitting and engineering arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority. No regulatory hurdles prevent the cable companies from linking their networks. Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, said granting the necessary licences would be a 'formality'. The cable companies are reluctant to talk openly about trans-regional links for fear of souring relations with Mercury, which carries most of their long-distance traffic. However, they have already taken steps to cut interconnection payments.</p>

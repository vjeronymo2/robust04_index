			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, June 21 (AFP) -- Italy favours international  humanitarian intervention in Rwanda but has no intention of  taking part in a French-led military mission on a unilateral  basis, Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said Tuesday [21 June].    Martino told parliament that the government opposes the  action "the French would have wanted, with or without us,"  because it would constitute a "major factor in the conflict" in  the Central African country.    In Brussels, a diplomatic source had earlier said that Italy  was prepared, on certain conditions, to send troops to join  soldiers France wants to send to Rwanda to halt the ethnic  bloodletting there.    The diplomat was speaking after some nations in the Western  European Union (WEU) had declared readiness following an  ambassadorial meeting to provide logistic support for the French  move if it receives backing in a new UN Security Council  resolution. A draft resolution drawn up by France was on the  table in New York on Tuesday.    Italy was ready to take part in "humanitarian intervention"  at the initiative of the WEU, the United Nations or the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Martino said, "provided above all  that the concerned parties agree to it."    The mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)  have warned that they will fight any French intervention because  they consider that Paris armed the Rwandan army, which in turn  trained extremist Hutu militias accused of killing hundreds of  thousands of Tutsis and opposition Hutus.    Intervention by "one or two white countries would be  considered an act of neo-colonialism," Martino said, adding that  "if we send a contingent now, they will finish up like the  Belgian soldiers" in a reference to 10 UN peacekeepers massacred  when the ethnic bloodbath began early in April.</p>

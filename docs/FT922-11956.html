			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Burma's refugees await their fate as camp conditions worsen ON THE EVE of negotiations to determine the fate of more than 200,000 refugees who have fled from Burma to Bangladesh, United Nations officials say the refugee camps are in crisis. More than 2,000 refugees are flooding across the border daily and 96,000 people have inadequate shelter. Aid workers warn of a cholera epidemic when the monsoon arrives shortly. Burma's foreign minister, U Ohn Gyaw, is due to arrive in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, tomorrow as part of a six-day visit to resolve the refugee problem. The government of Bangladesh has proposed a tripartite commission combining the UN and the Burmese and Bangladeshi governments to return the refugees. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN Secretary-General, has said that 'an agreement in principle has been obtained' to repatriate the refugees. However, many refugees say they will die in Bangladesh rather than return to Burma under the present military regime. Most come from two districts of Arakan state just beyond the Bangladeshi-Burmese border, where Rohingya Moslems are in the majority. The refugees say they are fleeing because soldiers of Burma's military junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), have forced young men into slave labour, raped Rohingya women and transferred Rohingya land and possessions to Buddhist Burmese in Arakan. A recent survey by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees showed that 86 per cent of the male refugees said they had been conscripted into forced labour. Forty-six per cent of female family members reported they had been raped, 52 per cent of the refugees could name persons killed by the Burmese military and 80 per cent said their property had been confiscated. The 12 refugee camps are squeezed into only 670 hectares of dry land south of Dhaka.</p>

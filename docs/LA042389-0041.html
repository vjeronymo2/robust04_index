			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVES  </P> <P> MAHLER: Symphony No. 5. Vienna Philharmonic, Lorin Maazel, conductor. CBS  compact disc, MDK 44782. With the plethora of fine Mahler performances of the  last 20 years, it is understandable that some have been overlooked. This should  not be one of them. On this fully digital 1983 release, now on CBS' budget  "Digital Masters" series, Maazel adopts deliberate tempos in the second and  third movements, after a true funebre opening. There is no sense of bogging  down, however; greater instrumental detail and structural insights are the  listener's rewards. The Vienna Philharmonic is at its best, the engineering  spacious and intimate, as appropriate. With 15 tracks indexed and the bargain  price, this is highly recommended.

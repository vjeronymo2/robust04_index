			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 50m European buy for Hillsdown HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food group, is paying Fl 157m (Pounds 50m) for the European chilled foods activities of Beledia, a private Dutch company. Hillsdown shares rose 2p to 106p. Mr John Jackson, deputy chairman of Hillsdown, said that the purchase provided the ideal start for the group's aim of building a European chilled food business. He said that chilled foods was a fast-growing sector of the food market throughout Europe, and that Hillsdown's UK chilled food business had been expanding quickly. The acquisition should at least cover its interest costs in its first year, he added. Sales in the year to the end of September 1991 were Fl 500m for operating profits of Fl 14m. The acquisition is the latest in a number of deals following a Pounds 281m rights issue a year ago. At the time Hillsdown said it wanted to make a number of purchases in its existing product areas in its chosen regions of the UK, continental Europe and North America. Mr Jackson said that so far about Pounds 140m had been spent. The largest deal before this was the Pounds 37m purchase of JP Wood, the UK poultry company bought from Unigate. He added that there were no other sizeable deals under discussion at present. The businesses Hillsdown is buying include the Johma group in the Netherlands and Belgium, Kobenhavns Salat in Denmark and Nadler in Germany. Each have leading market positions and together they comprise the largest chilled salad producer in Europe. The operating margin of 2.8 per cent was low, Mr Jackson said, because the German business was less profitable than the others. However, after six months negotiating the deal and getting to know the business, Hillsdown believed it could tackle trading problems. The assets being bought have a net value of Fl 50m (Pounds 29m). Mr Jackson said that heavy investment over recent years had given the business 'superb' production facilities.</p>

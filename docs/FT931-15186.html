			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The shape of things to come / A look at the problems of designing packaging that appeals to consumers across Europe If sales rise after a new packaging design is introduced, everyone gets the credit except the designer. If sales decline, the design is at fault. That highlights a problem that has dogged packaging designers: their inability to quantify the value of their work. But in the last few years companies have cast aside such doubts and increasingly turned towards design services as they standardise their products across Europe. But how valid is the belief that one packaging design can appeal to consumers? In 1991 Galbani, the Italian cheese producer, set out to double turnover in Europe and hired the London design company Minale Tattersfield to harmonise 10 different packaging designs. A design was created which depicted the Tuscan landscape, Gingham table cloth and appetising dishes for each particular cheese. The project, including research, cost Pounds 100,000. Sales increased by 22 per cent in the UK, by 33 per cent in Germany and 50 per cent in France in six months without any advertising. 'At least 65-70 per cent of the sales increase can be linked to design,' claims MarcelIa Minale, chairman of Minale Tattersfield. Campbell Biscuits Europe, a division of the Campbell Soup Company, faced a more ambitious task. It decided to standardise the packaging design of five brands, three logos and 100 products under the well-established Belgian Delacre brand, which it wanted to position as Europe's premium biscuit brand. It hired Milan design company Break to modernise the logo and create a single packaging design, intended to emphasise the skill and tradition of the French pastry chef. According to Joel Oberman, vice-president of marketing at Campbell Biscuits Europe: 'Of all the ways to market, design is one of the most important'. Campbell Biscuit's redesign was completed in three months, but it took nine months to implement the rationalised product line across Europe. With any redesign there is a risk of confusing consumers. The dangers are multiplied if it involves relaunching a product under a different brand name. Oberman expected a '30 per cent annual decline in those products we modified  -that's normal. We would have had to do a lot of spade work to build the brands back up. But there was no sales decline in any of the products we changed'. To minimise the risks, Campbell Biscuits retained the Dutch brand Nobo in the Netherlands, where consumer awareness of Delacre was just 0.8 per cent. Similarly the Belgian biscuit Bichoc was renamed Deli-choc for the European market. For other product lines the modernised Delacre logo and revamped packaging was introduced. Sales increased by more than 20 per cent in Germany and by 10 per cent in France in the year to July 1992. It was impossible to isolate the impact on sales of the new design from the advertising and public relations effort, but Oberman says: 'Packaging will have as great an impact on overall image as advertising. For new products and new design approaches, it has a much greater impact.' Common designs can also be particularly cost-effective for new product launches, as packaging accounts for a significant share of the company's cost structure, 'Management decision-making in terms of design is streamlined and overall development costs are diminished,' says Oberman. Household detergents are a product which is, in theory, easier to harmonise across Europe, as consumer needs are similar. In 1991, when Unilever decided to launch a new dishwasher powder across Europe it hired London design consultancy Design Bridge. The brief was to design packaging which would capture qualities such as efficacy, modernity and authority and stress the environmental friendliness of the product. Within six months Sun Progress achieved a 22 per cent share of the German market where the Tengelmann supermarket chain dropped all other dishwasher powders. Although the product was developed for the European market and the lettering, lay-out and basic design is the same throughout Europe, research in France, Germany, Italy and the UK revealed different consumer priorities. This resulted in Unilever promoting different product claims on the package, such as environmental qualities in Germany and its compatibility with fine porcelain in the UK. 'One pack design for Europe is unrealistic because of different language requirements,' says Philip Lawder, marketing director of Design Bridge. 'The local language must come first in France and in the UK.' But the benefits for Unilever of standardising European packaging are not restricted to economies of scale. Intense competition in the industry means that speed is of the essence in new product development. Design Bridge advises clients to carry out consumer research to evaluate packaging design. Questionnaires can be devised to assess how well a new design is communicating a brand's values compared with the old one. With new launches similar studies contrast the brand design with that of rival products. Like the vital initial consumer research, studies into effectiveness need to be carefully devised and monitored. 'There isn't a consumer vocabulary for design and consumers don't rationalise design. But by asking the right questions you can gauge the effect of design,' says Lawder. Given the high level of interest in pan-European brands, it is not surprising that design industry executives are reluctant to disclose details of cases in which a common European design is found to be inappropriate. But Jan Hall, chairman of London design consultancy Coley Porter Bell, believes that a high degree of commonality can be achieved in only about 20 per cent of cases. She estimates that in 5 per cent of cases national consumer differences or problems associated with national brand positioning prevents harmonisation.</p>

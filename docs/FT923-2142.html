			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (7): Good designers and technicians needed - Textile makers recognise their flaws, and how to mend them / Even if the textile industry were to benefit from a recovery in world trading conditions, it would still be essential to raise the quality of its products MANY Pakistani businessmen believe their country is set to play a greater role in the world textile market. But they are also concerned about dull prospects, at a time of worldwide recession and the need for Pakistani exports to become more competitive. Pakistan's cotton production rose by 35 per cent last year, (from 9.6m bales to nearly 13m) largely due to fresh incentives for farmers. There has also been a significant rise in the spinning capacity. Pakistan had 3.8m spindles five years ago. It now has 6.2m and could have 7m next year. Cotton related products are of increased significance for the economy, accounting for almost 58 per cent of exports. The higher cotton output has convinced many businessmen that there is a big potential to produce more higher value items, including clothing. However, there is still concern at falling profitability due to weak demand for yarn exports. Many leading textile producers have become increasingly aware not only of the need to move into higher value goods, but of the problems associated with it. Pakistan's leading representative body of textile manufacturers, the APTMA (All Pakistan Textile Mills Association), has recently demanded fresh measures to increase profitability, including the removal of a local excise duty. Its members have also decided to cut back production by 14 per cent to cut lower surplus stocks. Mr Tariq Saigol, chairman of APTMA, voices long-term optimism but says that 'at the moment, we are faced with imbalance in supply and demand; we have too many goods and not the domestic market which is big enough to absorb the increase'. According to the APTMA, Pakistan produces approximately 1.3bn kilos of yarn annually, of which 600m kilos are consumed locally and the remainder available for export. The association estimates that at present, there is a surplus of between 15 to 25 per cent. The industry's problems were recently highlighted in a study by the Japanese international development agency, based on a year long examination of growth prospects. The study is reported to have found that in the eyes of many US importers Pakistani garments are priced and of low quality with late delivery times. The report warned that other countries such as Bangladesh, Mauritius, Morocco and Sri Lanka are catching up quickly with Pakistan, thanks to their own rapid expansion and growth. It suggested that Pakistan's government and textile industry should try to satisfy the garments trade. Apart from market conditions, the industry also suffers from a shortage of technically trained manpower and lack of good design. Time and money for training are needed to rectfiy both problems. The domestic market has a limited exposure to imported fashion garments, which would influence the designing of marketable export goods. The future of Pakistan's textiles industry will depend partly on international economic conditions. But even if it benefited from improved world trading trends, it would have to raise its own standards.</p>

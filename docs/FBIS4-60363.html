			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says Yasir 'Arafat  must reaffirm his commitment to all the components and  appendixes of the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles. In  addition, 'Arafat must reiterate his opposition to the use of  force or violence in the relations with Israel. Thirdly,  'Arafat must reiterate his pledge to resolve conflicts  peaceably. Shim'on Peres says 'Arafat made a declaration in  this spirit during their meeting in Oslo some 10 days ago, in  the wake of the public disclosure of the first passage of the  Johannesburg tape.    Shim'on Peres says 'Arafat must make all these  pronouncements  for all the world to hear, and not only in a talk between  politicians.    Mr. Peres made these remarks after his meeting with the UN  secretary general in New York.</p>

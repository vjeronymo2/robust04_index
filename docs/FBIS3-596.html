In his column "Barskyk" [Close Up] in the latest edition of  the Afrikaans independent intellectual journal DIE  SUID-AFRIKAAN, he writes: "My interpretation is that the central  government is ultimately going to have over-arching power."    Further aspects that Dr Slabbert, a former leader of the  opposition in the South African Parliament and now policy  director of the Institute for Democracy in South Africa, finds  disquieting are:     -  The lack of proper entrenchment of the Bill of Rights.  "For me Clause 33 is unclear and simply sinister when it says  that entrenched rights may be limited by legislation. On both  the points communist Party Chairman) Joe Slovo and his comrades  have won hands-down."; and    -  The electoral system on which the constitution is based. "The  particular form of proportional representation tends itself to  party-rigidity, domination and rivalry. It hampers  alliance-forming and the promotion of electorat tolerance."       Dr Slabbert says when this is further blurred by "populists  who use democretic rhetoric like `everything can be rewritten by  the democratically-elected representatives of the people'," in  which the people have virtually no choice about for what and for  whom voting takes place, "there is trouble."    Taking everything into account, the conclusion can hardly be  avoided that if the interim constitution remains as is, and  becomes the final one, "the politics of the country will be  reduced to a simple rivalry of power monopolies between parties".    On the constitutional process, Dr Slabbert writes that the  question is: Can the problems of government be divorced from the  problems of constitution-writing?    "Particularly if it is the same bunch of people grappling  with the same problems. How long is the good faith going to  continue?"</p>

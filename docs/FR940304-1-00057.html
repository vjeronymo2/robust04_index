			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that collecting monthly composite samples will ensure that BSC's stabilization process is not adversely affected by the potential variability in concentrations of chromium, lead and nickel. The data obtained from the annual recharacterization of the petitioned waste will assist EPA in determining whether the petitioned waste is more variable than originally described by the petitioner. The Agency also believes that the annual recharacterization of the petitioned waste is not overly burdensome to the petitioner and notes that these data will assist the petitioner in complying with &sect;262.11(c) which requires generators to determine whether their wastes are hazardous, as defined by the Toxicity Characteristic (see &sect;261.24).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Future delisting proposals and decisions issued by the Agency may include different testing and reporting requirements based on an evaluation of the manufacturing and treatment processes, the waste, the volume of waste (including whether there is a fixed volume of waste), and other factors normally considered in the petition review process. For example, wastes with variable constituent concentrations, discussed in previous delisting decisions (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 56 FR 41286, August 20, 1991, and 56 FR 67197, December 30, 1991), may require more frequent and more extensive continuous batch testing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Waste Holding and Handling <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : BSC must store, as hazardous, all stabilized filter cake generated until verification testing (as specified in Conditions (1)(A) and (1)(B)) is completed and valid analyses demonstrate that the delisting levels set forth in Condition (3) are met. If the levels of hazardous constituents measured in the samples of stabilized filter cake generated are below all of the levels set forth in Condition (3), then the stabilized filter cake is non-hazardous and may be managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable solid waste regulations. If hazardous constituent levels in any weekly or monthly composite sample equal or exceed any of the delisting levels set in Condition (3), the stabilized filter cake generated during the time period corresponding to this sample must be retreated until it is below these levels or managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of Condition (2) is to ensure that stabilized filter cake which contains hazardous levels of specific constituents is managed and disposed of in accordance with Subtitle C of RCRA. Holding the stabilized filter cake until characterization is complete will protect against improper handling of hazardous material. The stabilized samples must be analyzed for the appropriate parameters, and must meet the appropriate delisting levels in Condition (3), in order for the waste to be excluded from the hazardous waste regulatory system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency selected the set of constituents specified in Condition (3) after reviewing information about the composition of BSC's unstabilized and stabilized F006 filter cake and descriptions of BSC's manufacturing and treatment processes. The analytes in Condition (3) include TC metallic constituents currently regulated under &sect;261.24 and nickel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency established the delisting levels by first back-calculating the maximum allowable leachate concentrations (MALs) from the health-based levels (HBLs) for the constituents of concern using the EPACML DAF of 96 for BSC's maximum annual stabilized waste volume of 1,100 cubic yards,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , MAL=HBL &times; DAF. The calculated MALs were then compared with the maximum contaminant concentrations for the toxicity characteristic ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , TC levels) shown in &sect;261.24, as &sect;260.22(d)(3) precludes delisting any waste that exhibits a characteristic. The delisting levels established in Condition (3) are the lesser of the calculated MALs and the TC levels. Delisting levels are set at the TC levels for selenium, barium, chromium, and silver.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Delisting Levels <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : All concentrations must be measured in the waste leachate by the method specified in 40 CFR 261.24. The leachable concentrations for the constituents must be below the following levels (ppm): arsenic_4.8; barium_100; cadmium_0.48; chromium_5.0; nickel_9.6; lead_1.4; mercury_0.19; selenium_1.0; silver_5.0. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Condition (4) given below allows BSC to alter the stabilization process ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., the stabilization reagents) from the process conditions identified during the initial verification testing under (1)(A). The Agency believes that this condition allows BSC a reasonable amount of flexibility to change and improve its process, but still requires BSC to notify EPA and to confirm that the process remains effective.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Changes in Operating Conditions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : After completing the initial verification test period in Condition (1)(A), if BSC decides to significantly change the stabilization process ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , stabilization reagents) developed under Condition (1), then BSC must notify EPA in writing prior to instituting the change. After written approval by EPA, BSC may manage the waste generated from the changed process as non-hazardous under this exclusion, provided the other conditions of this exclusion are fulfilled.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Condition (5) given below outlines the procedures BSC must follow in submitting data collected under the conditional exclusion to EPA. The certification statement that BSC must sign provides added assurance that data provided are accurate and complete.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

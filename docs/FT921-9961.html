			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Arts: The price of Venice is eternal vigilance ITALY WOULD be always with us, or so we thought. But in 1966 the great floods that devasted Florence and Venice alerted the civilised world to so much that, for too long, it had taken too much for granted. Out of the disaster the foreign and restoration committees, French, German, American and the rest, besides the British, were born and in time acquired a more particular focus. By the end of the 1960s, when the immediate first-aid had been achieved, the underlying and long-term precariousness of the position of Venice was realised and, in 1971, on the initiative of Sir Ashley and Lady Clark, the British Venice in Peril Fund established. Since then much has been done, much changed - and much remains the same. Venice is no longer sinking, since water for the city and hinterland no longer comes from the artesian wells beneath the lagoon; the work on the barriers across the entrance to the lagoon goes on, so that soon the city will be safe from acqua alta coming in from the Adriatic; and the industrial pollution of the atmosphere at last begins to moderate. But still the churches and palazzi crumble and decay, and always there is too much to be done. The international intervention and achievement have been remarkable, not least in the competitive example and encouragement offered to the Italians themselves who, once roused to the shared task of preserving and restoring their unique treasures, have performed the lion's share. But still the political scandals and disputes continue, with the Italian money committed often as hard to grasp as the mist itself that rolls in across the water. Local political ambitions too - the theme-park mentality and vaulting ambition of such grandees as Gianni de Micheles, for example - must be watched and scotched. The price of Venice is eternal vigilance. All this work, of the first 20 years at least, up to 1986, and setting the British involvement in the context of the national and international effort, is now documented in a fascinating exhibition that has ben touring the world. It is now at the Royal College of Art, until February 15, complete with an excellent catalogue, Venice Restored, Pounds 25, most beautifully published by Electa. Citalia, the Italian tourist firm, has just raised Pounds 9000 for the Fund. Please go and see the show, to read, admire, worry, and above all to contribute in however small a way.</p>

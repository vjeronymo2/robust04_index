			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japanese banks step up action to rescue Kumagai THE Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan will send the head of its London branch back to Tokyo to oversee the restructuring of international operations at Kumagai Gumi, the Japanese contractor and property developer, burdened by about Y700bn (Dollars 6.3bn) in debt. LTCB's move follows the transfer of an executive at Sumitomo Bank to assist in the restructuring of Kumagai's domestic operations, hurt by the collapse of Japanese property prices and by its own financial exposure to unsuccessful resort developments. The joint effort by the two leading Japanese banks highlights the seriousness of the situation at Kumagai, which has struggled in domestic and international markets to meet a goal, set last year, of selling Y300bn in properties over five years to reduce its debt. Mr Yasunori Fujii, general manager of LTCB's London branch, is expected to return to Japan at the end of this week and be formally appointed senior managing director of Kumagai, responsible for international business, at a board meeting next month. LTCB officials said the bank became involved because it backed some of Kumagai's ventures and has a small stake in the company, which had an envied reputation in Japan in the 1980s as a successful international contractor. But the company has begun to retreat from the international market, and over the past three years overseas receipts have fallen from 25 per cent to 8 per cent of sales. Kumagai has already been forced to sell cherished assets, including a self-developed office complex in Reading, Berkshire, sold in late March for a reported Y7.7bn. It has also raised funds by reducing a stake in the increasingly independent Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong), which is particularly successful in the Chinese market. Three years ago, Kumagai held 35 per cent of the Hong Kong company, but that will be to just over 6 per cent under a deal announced last month.</p>

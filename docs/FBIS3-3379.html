Zhou Jue, the spokesman, said that some NPC deputies of the  Guangdong provincial delegation raised a bill suggesting that  the National People's Congress make a decision to organize the  legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)  and its district organizations in 1997 after the termination of  the political structure of Hong Kong established by the British  government.    The Third Meeting of the presidium of the NPC Second Session  decided to submit the bill to the NPC Law Committee first for  deliberation, he said.    Zhou said that Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's  1994/95 electoral arrangements broke down because of the  sabotage of the British side. Under such circumstances, the  last political structure elected according to British Hong Kong  government's legislation will come to an end with the  termination of the British jurisdiction over Hong Kong. "It  cannot extend beyond June 30, 1997," he said.    The preliminary work committee for the SAR will unite with  Hong Kong compatriots, and make preparations for the SAR, its  first government and legislature in accordance with the NPC  decision on organization methods of the first government and  legislative assembly of the SAR, Zhou said.    "No matter what happens, the Chinese government and people  have the determination and capacity to resume the exercise of  Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, realize smooth transition of  power and maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability and  prosperity," he said.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-GANG CHIEF CONVICTED OF MURDERING 2 IN 1982  </P> <P> The waiting ended for former gang leader Virgil Byars on Monday when a jury  convicted him of separate drive-by shootings that left two people dead and  three injured eight years ago.  </P> <P> After a week of deliberations, the six-man, six-woman jury found him guilty of  two counts of second-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly  weapon. The prosecution had sought first-degree murder convictions with special  circumstances that would have sent Byars to prison for life without possibility  of parole.  </P> <P> Byars, 27, has been held without bail since the fall of 1982 -- four months  after the shootings -- when he turned himself in. He was not a suspect and was  not being sought, authorities said.  </P> <P> He faces 35 years to life in prison, although it is possible that he could  receive a sentence that would make him eligible for parole in less than three  years. He rejected a proposed plea bargain when his trial began last month.  </P> <P> "Mr. Byars has always wanted to test the system," Deputy Dist. Atty. Loren  Naiman, who prosecuted the case, said afterward, noting that Byars refused to  return to the courtroom after the verdicts were read. "It appears now that he's  unhappy with the verdict."  </P> <P> Wearing wire-rimmed glasses and a business suit and looking more like a  mild-mannered librarian or accountant than the tough gang member he admittedly  was, Byars showed no expression as the jury's decisions were read. However, he  refused to return to the courtroom for clarification of a verdict on one of the  lesser charges.  </P> <P> "I think he perceived the gist of the verdicts," defense attorney Victor  Salerno, standing in for Byars' ailing lawyer, told Los Angeles Superior Court  Judge Jacqueline Connor. He will be sentenced May 29.  </P> <P> The case might have gone unnoticed as just another gang shooting, but for the  fact that it is believed to be the oldest active criminal court case in Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> On the surface, it appeared simple: after telephoning police to surrender  "because God told me to," Byars was charged with the shooting deaths of  Cornelius Harris and Jody Hayes, allegedly members of a rival gang, and the  wounding of three other people. He showed police where the shootings happened  and provided details in a six-hour confession.  </P> <P> The delay was caused by Byars' firing five of six attorneys appointed to  represent him, his lengthy but unsuccessful battle to keep his confession from  being admitted as evidence, and a trial that ended with a hung jury last year.  </P> <P> In some ways, Monday's verdict was neither a victory nor a loss for either  side.  </P> <P> Naiman said he was "disappointed . . . but satisfied that the case got to  trial. It is a fair verdict. "It's about time. The victims died eight years  ago. Their families sit in utter amazement that the system could drag out so  long.  </P> <P> "This is not yet final," he said. "The appeals process could take years."  </P> <P> Defense attorney Joel Isaacson, who was ill and unable to be in court Monday,  said by telephone that he was "relieved" that his client had not been found  guilty of first-degree murder charges. He said he had hoped for a manslaughter  verdict if not acquittal.  </P> <P> "I'm surprised that, given the gang hysteria that prevails today, a jury was  able to judge the case on the facts," he said.  </P> <P> Byars had been charged with two counts of first-degree murder and three counts  of attempted murder. He was convicted of lesser charges of second-degree murder  and assault with a deadly weapon. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty in  the special circumstances allegations.  </P> <P> "We didn't believe that he intended to kill, but that he was going to go out  and shoot 'em (rival gang members) up," said jury foreman Michael  Abbatecola,49, of Monterey Park, a postal worker.  </P> <P> He said the jury did not believe Byars was high on PCP, a mind-altering drug,  at the time of the crimes, as he claimed. Nor did the jury base its decisions  on the detailed confession Byars gave to police that was played in court, he  said.  </P> <P> "The confession in and of itself didn't hang him," Abbatecola said. "It was all  tied in . . . the evidence was there."  </P> <P> Several jurors leaned toward manslaughter verdicts at the beginning, the  foreman said. But at least one pushed, right up until the end, for first-degree  murder and attempted murder verdicts.  </P> <P> "I had to do a lot of meditating about it over lunch," explained Burbank nurse  Sandy Shirley, 48, who held out for the harsher verdicts. She said she finally  relented "because I didn't want to hang the jury."  </P> <P> The prosecutor said he doubts that Byars will "do well" in the state prison  system, given his history of violence. Since his surrender eight years ago, he  has been convicted of the attempted murder of another inmate and sentenced to  12 years in prison.  </P> <P> He has also been involved in more than 20 jail fights, Naiman said. Court  records show that several of Byars' attorneys asked to be removed from his case  after he allegedly threatened them.  </P></p>

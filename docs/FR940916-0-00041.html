			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Rulemaking Text  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The discussion that follows summarizes the comments submitted to MARAD by 28 commenters on the interim final rule, notes where changes have been made to it and the rationale therefor and, where relevant, states why particular recommendations have not been adopted. In addition to soliciting comments on the interim final rule amendments to the Title XI regulations, MARAD requested public comment on two additional topics: (1) The issuance by the Secretary of a Letter of Interest prior to an applicant's submission of a complete application and the subsequent issuance, if any, of a Letter Commitment, and (2) the establishment of a deadline, such as 60 days, by which the Secretary would act on a Title XI application considered complete by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Almost all commenters responded favorably to the proposal that the Secretary exercise discretion to issue a Letter of Interest prior to the applicant's submission of a complete application. Commenters noted that the procedure could be particularly useful if the shipbuilder could use the document as a marketing document to compete effectively against foreign yards that may be able to offer firm financing on the satisfaction of simple conditions. Some suggested that if MARAD were also to preapprove ship designs, Letters of Interest would be very effective indicators of MARAD's interest in a proposed financing. One commenter suggested that Letters of Interest could be used by applicants to forecast the cost of a transaction and the expertise that will be needed to complete a proposed transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters proposed that requests for Letters of Interest should contain information about (1) the type and design of the Vessel to be financed and its intended trade, (2) the approximate cost of the Vessel and its proposed builder, (3) the amount of the requested Guarantee, (4) recent financial information on the prospective shipowner or bareboat charterer, (5) a description of the collateral to secure the Secretary's Guarantee, and (6) identification of the country in which the vessel would be owned and documented. A commenter recommended that there be no charge or fee for the issuance of a Letter of Interest, that the letter be issued prior to the filing of an application, and that the letter be issued within ten days of the request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters raised two concerns about Letters of Interest. First, they argued that requests for such Letters must be treated confidentially because a request for a Letter may come during the negotiating process and the requester shipyard would not want its competitors to be aware of the negotiations or potential prices. A second concern raised was that the formalization of a Letter of Interest procedure could slow down the expeditious approval by MARAD of loan guarantee applications by increasing the burden on MARAD or by effectively duplicating the formal application process. It was suggested by one commenter that MARAD could substitute preapplication meetings for the Letter of Interest. Additional concern was expressed that the conditions contained in a Letter of Interest should not be deemed by the agency to be binding if the applicant later demonstrates that it can meet alternative, but equivalent, conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters thought that the 60-day processing period for completed applications was reasonable, appropriate, and adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

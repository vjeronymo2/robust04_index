			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Wise-eyed and legless: Peter Norman says the UK Treasury's independent economic panel is eminently disposable The UK Treasury's panel of independent forecasters was probably doomed to ignominy the moment some bright spark dubbed its members the 'wise men'. But not even the most hard-boiled cynic, versed in the ways of economists and government, could have supposed that this group would so quickly lose all influence over UK economic policymaking. True, the group added fleetingly to the gaiety of the nation last summer, when one of its number - Professor Tim Congdon - triggered an unseemly squabble among its members about who produced the best forecasts. Since then, however, the wise men's panel has become something that would be best forgotten. This is not to denigrate its individual members. All of the original seven - Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research; Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research; David Currie, the head of economic forecasting at the London Business School; Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist for Goldman Sachs in London; Wynne Godley, professor of applied economics at Cambridge; Patrick Minford, professor of applied economics at Liverpool; and Andrew Sentance, economics director of the Confederation of British Industry - have their merits and have, over the years, contributed to the diversity of economic debate in the UK. This observation is just as true since the panel has shrunk to six from seven, following the departure of Sentance to work with Currie at the LBS last December. But the experiment of putting a mixed bag of economists together with the Treasury's forecasters three times a year to prepare reports on the current position and future prospects of the UK economy has added little to the sum of human knowledge. If anything, it has curbed economic debate by turning true iconoclasts such as the monetarists Congdon and Minford and the neo-Keynesian Godley into halfway establishment figures. This, no doubt, was at the back of the mind of former chancellor Norman Lamont when he created the group in late 1992, as part of the moves to patch up an economic policy for Britain after the fiasco of sterling's exit from the European Monetary System. At that time, the Treasury's reputation for policymaking was at an all-time low, and that of its forecasters little better. The idea of the forecasting panel was a minor stroke of genius. The panellists could be flattered by being told that they would provide policy recommendations: they never were to meet Lamont but have met Kenneth Clarke twice, although to what effect no one knows. The innovation could be sold to the public as an example of government openness. But most attractive of all, the panel's forecasts could be shown to be as fallible as the government's. The press played along with the wheeze. 'Treasury calls in a clutch of flamboyant forecasters' was the breathless headline in the Financial Times on the day after Lamont's announcement. For a while, no piece of economic news could be complete without one or the other - or preferably all seven - adding their two penn'orth of comment. Such celebrity would have been difficult to sustain at the best of times. But the decline of the group's influence has undoubtedly been hastened by the intervention of the unknown scribe who coined the phrase 'wise men'. This was bound to lead to a slow seepage of authority and prestige in a country so hostile to intellectuals as Britain. The idea of 'wise men' also had a faintly Teutonic air. And, indeed, Germany has a panel of 'wise men' who produce a report on the economy for the government once a year. But at least they have a role to play in the carefully choreographed creation of a national consensus on wage setting and the state of the economy. The routine is that Germany's leading economic research institutes produce a forecast for the following year in October. Their wise men follow up with a thicker tome in November which usually echoes the points raised in the institutes' report. All other forecasters then fall into line. By the time the government produces its annual report on the economy early in the new year, wage bargainers know how much pay increases should be. The contribution of Germany's wise men to the nation's welfare is not great, but it is significant. It is certainly more than the Treasury's panel can hope to achieve. The only consolation to UK taxpayers from present arrangements is that they will not break the budget. The panellists each receive Pounds 125 plus expenses for attending meetings. If nothing else, the 'wise men' come cheap in a Whitehall riddled with highly paid consultants.</p>

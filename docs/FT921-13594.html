			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / India has the pluses Watch India. It stands a far better chance of becoming an important new industrial power than Russia, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and all the other states of the former Soviet Union put together. This does not mean that it will do so. Delhi's history of economic mismanagement is discouraging. Its tradition of heavy-handed planning was established when Stalin was a hero to the world's socialists. As to political risk, the persistence of inflation in the low double-digits could bring India's minority government down at any moment deemed suitable by the opposition. It is not only Mr Boris Yeltsin's regime that is threatened by price increases. Yet when you list pluses and minuses India seems to have more going for it than the ex-Soviet states. It is well-placed to follow Indonesia, Mexico and others into a period of high growth and rapid industrialisation, financed by a strong inflow of foreign capital. The former Soviet state is not. Let us tick off the top three items. First, Russia is trying to build a market economy on the crumbling ruins of a communist polity. There has been no systemic failure in India, although last summer's teeter on the brink of financial collapse was a close-run thing. Second, the Russians are starting from scratch. Everything must be changed. The new government in Delhi has a far lesser task. It is merely trying to open up a formerly closed economy, restrain the growth of the public sector, and put an end to the Soviet-inspired system of licensing and regulation that has led many Indians to describe the four decades since independence as wasted years. Third, the Commonwealth of Independent States is mystified by capitalism. India is the home of some of the brassiest capitalist buccaneers on the face of the globe. The Russians are searching for an understanding with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund; many of Delhi's leading economic advisers have served time in either the Bank or the Fund. They speak the language of international lenders. Several other factors favour India. The newly liberated ex-communist states are struggling to learn financial management. India has rapidly growing stock exchanges, sophisticated (if constrained) capital markets, and an urban public accustomed to the trading of goods and services in the hustle and bustle of huge permanent marketplaces like the streets of Calcutta and Bombay. It also has a working if uneconomic railway system, improving telecommunications, and goods in the shops. Russia's Gosplan-designed infrastructure is an obstacle to its progress; its shop windows are empty. More to the point, it is not certain that the Russians know what they are doing. The new Indian government is advised by highly sophisticated and knowledgeable economists who are convinced that their programme is the right one. Some of them produce papers written years ago to demonstrate that they were Britain has a direct commercial interest in building a closer relationship with this future India market economists long before the last August's loans-for-liberalisation deals were struck with the IMF and the World Bank. The small coterie of politicians and officials who are managing India's bold programme of stabilisation and reconstruction seems determined to plough ahead, whatever the political difficulties. A phrase familiar to Britain of the early 1980s - 'there is no alternative'  - is ringing round Delhi. All that said, India remains India. The caste system, the commercial and political corruption, and the stifling bureaucracy will not be disposed of easily or quickly. The three-quarters of the people who live in villages, many of them in abject poverty, will not enjoy the trickle-down of any drops of prosperity for many years to come. As the growth rate increases, the existing disparities between the regions will be widened. Yet it is possible to visualise a sort of success, however erratic the pace may be. Britain has a direct commercial interest in building a closer relationship with this India of the future - a greater interest, I suspect, than in trying to purchase or establish businesses in the former Soviet Union. Perhaps this will be recognised after the next general election. During the past three weeks two senior ministers, the home secretary and the foreign secretary, have visited Delhi. Mr Kenneth Baker's talk was of extradition treaties and immigration, Mr Douglas Hurd's of relationships with Pakistan and the desirability of a political solution to the Kashmiri problem. It is probable that both visits were at least partly inspired by domestic British political calculations. The votes of immigrants from India and Pakistan will be important in several marginal constituencies. Rich Indian businessmen resident in Britain are important contributors to both Conservative and Labour party funds. Yet both Mr Baker and Mr Hurd had good departmental reasons for their visits. Both expressed admiration for the courageous way in which the government of Mr P V Narashima Rao is persisting with its new economic policy. If it works, there will be a lot of business to do. Britain should be well-placed to capture some of it. In support of this proposition, I offer just one vignette of a three-week visit to the subcontinent. It is Calcutta, on a Sunday afternoon in January. On the green grass of the huge city-centre park there are hundreds of games of cricket in progress. There is barely space to walk between the pitches; one game melds into another. Everyone is in best Lords whites. Much Bengali is spoken, but much English too. From time to time an English phrase floats across the air. ''Owzat?' is particularly common, challenging the umpire to declare the batsman out. Nehru's socialist, statist legacy is walking to the pavilion. It is time to start taking proper notice of India again.</p>

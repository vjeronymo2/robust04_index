[Text] The most discussed subject in political circles  these days is: What does Kanshi Ram really want? Does he want  the SP-BSP coalition government to serve its five years in the  state or does he want to topple Mulayam Singh's government when  he gets the opportunity and then hold mid-term elections? If we  pay close attention to Kanshi Ram's speeches, we get the  impression that he is committed to the government and, at the  same time, is working against it. The politics of this state  seems to be trapped in this web.    The BSP leaders seem to believe that it was their  cooperation  and support that helped make Mulayam Singh the chief minister of  the state. No one can have any objection to their desire to live  in this delusion. There are 67 BSP legislators now and [the  party] is in the third position in the state. If we look at the  pre-election climate and analyze it , it would not be  inappropriate to say that while the BJP was trying to get back  its old seats, the strong support was for Mulayam Singh. He had  the support of farmers, students, the youth, minorities, and  even traders. There were two reasons for this. First was  Mulayam's clear plan. People general believed that there was no  difference between what he said and what he did. The second was  that the voters who were disappointed with the BJP saw Mulayam  Singh as the only alternative. The Congress and Janata Dal  leaders failed to win people's trust. The BSP already was  working with the SP.    One quality of Mulayam Singh is that when he trusts someone,  he trust that person fully. He excuses all his crimes. Mulayam  Singh also recognizes favors done for him. Whatever goals the  BSP had in mind when it cooperated with Mulayam Singh, the  important thing for Mulayam Singh is that this party helped him  when he needed strong support. The cooperation between the two  parties actually started during BJP rule when Kanshi Ram had ran  for Lok Sabha election from Itarsi, Mulayam Singh's home  constituency. At that time, observers had said that Mulayam  Singh had secretly endorsed Kanshi Ram instead of his own  party's candidate for future political reasons. Kanshi Ram's  efforts to become a lawmaker finally were successful and he  began to shine like an important star in the political horizon.  The SP-BSP coalition was formed later during the governor's rule  in the state, and Mulayam Singh and Kanshi Ram addressed their  joint rallies. As said earlier, this time around, Mulayam Singh  let BSP candidates run from their desired election districts  that included many areas of northeastern Uttar Pradesh. The SP  workers and an influential group of backwards worked as hard to  help BSP candidates win as they did for their own candidates in  order to get their leader appointed to the highest position in  the state. Mulayam Singh himself toured the whole state several  times to glean support. In the end, the SP-BSP coalition won 175  seas and the BJP won 176 seats in the vidhan sabha. The Janata  Dal, the Congress Party, and the communists faired very badly.    The comments that the BSP leaders and legislators made in  public soon after the coalition government was formed, suddenly  heated the political atmosphere in the state. This became a  cause of concern for Mulayam Singh who favored socialism.  Finally, Mulayam Singh had to announce in dozens of meetings and  in the vidhan sabha that he is a socialist and did not support  caste politics. He said that his goal was always to build the  society and not break it. He believed in breaking up the caste  system and building the social structure. He also had to repeat  again and again that he was not the chief minister of SP-BSP  coalition but of the 140 million people in the state. He  believed that his first duty was to get justice for every group  and would not let unfair treatment to anyone because of his or  her caste. Mulayam Singh also tried to put salve on the wounds  of the state's bureaucracy which was disgusted by the statements  issued by BSP leaders.    The political dilemma for Mulayam Singh is that he is not in  a position to say anything openly. He also tries to admonish BSP  legislators and cabinet members as a good friend. At times, he  becomes a prey of these legislators' mistakes. One such mistake  was made by V.R. Verma when he presented the thank-you  resolution at the end of the governor's speech. He made a  comment on Govind Ballabh Pant, the first chief minister of the  state and great freedom fighter. Actually this comment was not  his own; it was a statement made by Dr. Ambedekar.    This was what happened in the House. Outside the House, Ms.  Mayavati, the national general secretary of the BSP, used the  kind of language while talking to newsmen in Lucknow that not  only hurt the feelings of the Congress Party but of the whole  nation. She called Mahatma Gandhi, whom the people call Bapu  [father] with love and devotion and whose love for scheduled  castes and tribes is known to all, the greatest enemy of this  group. Mayavati said that Mahatma Gandhi had insulted this group  by giving them the name of Harijan and tried to undermine this  group. She gave a strange reasoning in this context and asked if  Gandhi liked the word Harijan so much then why did not he add  the word Harijan to his name. She said that time was not far  when Gandhism in this country will be replaced with  "Ambedakarism."    Mayavati, just like her leader Kanshi Ram, attacked the  state  government in which her own party is also involved. She alleged  that the BSP cabinet members were not allowed to function  independently. What is more, she said, the minister did not have  the authority to replace the officials in their departments. She  also said that the chief minister must change his habit of  forcing SP ministers on the BSP ministers. Mayavati said that  most of her and Kanshi Ram's time is wasted listening to  complaints made by the BSP legislators, ministers, and workers  while the goal for the BSP is not just to have a government in  this state but take control of the whole nation. At the same  time, Mayavati also says that she is satisfied with the chief  minister's work!    Mayavati's above statement perhaps is influenced by her  leader Kanshi Ram's speech given in Allahabad. Kanshi Ram had  openly expressed his anger at Mulayam Singh in his speech in  Allahabad on 5 March. He said that the chief minister did not  pay any head to the BSP ministers and legislators. This had made  the position of BSP ministers lower than the office peons (the  BSP has no responsibility). Kanshi Ram openly said that if the  promises that were made at the time of SP-BSP coalition were not  followed up then this government will be uprooted. He said that  he was not a follower of such a government. Perhaps, Mayavati  had kept this in mind and told the newsmen that if Mulayam Singh  did not change his attitude, it will not take much time to  implement what Kanshi Ram had said in Allahabad.    The BSP leaders say two different things in the same breath.  They criticize Mulayam Singh's style of administration and also  express satisfaction at his achievements. Kanshi Ram also says  that he will not let the Mulayam Singh government fall and that  the coalition government will rule for full five years of its  term. The most interesting aspect of this is that Mulayam Singh  was present on the stage when Kanshi Ram had made that  announcement in Allahabad.    The BSP people have a thick bundle of complaints against  Mulayam Singh. They say that the BSP minister given district  responsibilities have only one or two districts under them  compared to five or six districts given to the SP ministers. The  officials do not give as much serious attention to the BSP  ministers as do they to the SP minister. They also say that the  BSP ministers of state that are working with the SP cabinet  level ministers have been given tasks that are done by deputy  ministers.    The BSP believes that the Yadav caste has control over the  backward votes, and the number of Kurmi voters is only slightly  less then the Yadavs. Therefore, the BSP is looking at the  voters in this group. Perhaps, that is why the BSP has appointed  Kurmi caste persons to the positions of state general secretary  and the legislative group leadership. The president of the BSP  is Jang Bahadur Patel, its general secretary is Sonelal Patel,  and the leader of the legislative group os Ramlakhan Verma. The  Kurmi conferences have been held in Bareilly, Benares, and  Sonbhadar districts. The BSP is planning similar conferences in  other districts also.    It is not that Chief Minister Mulayam Singh is unaware of  all  these developments. He has given the responsibility to lure the  Kurmi voters and officials to Beni Prasad Verma, the legislative  program minister.    Another BSP action has become a subject of discussions in  political circles. This action is related to criticism of top  Congress Party leadership. This is not limited to former  leaders; present leaders are also included in it. They have been  attacking Prime Minister Narasimha Rao from the very beginning.  It is a known fact that Congress legislators support the  government and defend it from the sharp attacks by the BJP.  Mayavati attacked Pramod Tiwari, the leader of this group, very  strongly. This is neither timely nor an appropriate strategy for  the coalition government that has the majority in the House  because of the support from the Congress Party and the Janata  Dal. It is especially wrong at a time when the budget session is  in progress and the government had to struggle during each  budget hearing.    We will see now what kind of shrewdness Mulayam Singh  demonstrates in keeping the Congress Party with him. At the same  time, the chief minister has to satisfy the BSP leaders,  ministers, and legislators.</p>

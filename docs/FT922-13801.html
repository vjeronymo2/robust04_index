			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Letter: Matchsticks, a spending mess and the Union Sir, Your leader ('Labour and the economy', April 8) deserves recognition for a most ingenious defence of inequality. Forget the interests (and spending) of pensioners on Pounds 50 per week and others who would benefit from Labour's plans for redistribution. Higher taxation of the better off is apparently bad for all of us because they are the people who can borrow most against their post-tax incomes and spend the rest of the economy out of the recession. Apart from all other considerations, wasn't this just how we got into the present mess? Andrew Glynn, Corpus Christi College, Oxford OX1 4JF</p>

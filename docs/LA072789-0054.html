			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> DIVINE INSPIRATION ATTRACTED KYMAN  </P> <P> Coley Kyman is 6-foot-5, 200 pounds, handsome, gregarious and one of the top  young volleyball players in the nation.  </P> <P> He also is painfully honest. Even when spilling the truth gets a bit painful.  </P> <P> "The truth is," he said, pausing to prepare his words, "what drew me into  volleyball was girls."  </P> <P> Following basketball practice on a recreation team he was playing with four  years ago, he caught his first glimpse.  </P> <P> "They were all playing volleyball -- I mean really cute girls -- so I talked to  the coach and they needed another guy so I figured I'd try it," Kyman said,  grinning sheepishly at the memory.  </P> <P> "It looked like fun and the basketball coach said he didn't care. He said it  might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to play."  </P> <P> Or, as it turned out, the first of a lifetime of chances.  </P> <P> Kyman has since advanced from the rec leagues to the big leagues.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, he was selected most valuable player at the junior nationals in  Toledo, Ohio. This week, he is a starting middle blocker for the North team at  the U. S. Olympic Festival.  </P> <P> His has been a whirlwind climb up the competition ladder, starting with that  co-ed game in 1985.  </P> <P> "It was fun, but I never expected anything out of it," Kyman said.  </P> <P> Gifted with size and quickness, Kyman was a volleyball natural. His coach  recommended that he take up the sport more seriously when he enrolled at Reseda  High that fall.  </P> <P> Kyman said he might, only to find out that Reseda didn't have a team. But it  was only a temporary setback.  </P> <P> The following year Reseda added volleyball and Kyman earned back-to-back City  Section 3-A Division Player of the Year awards by the time he graduated in  June.  </P> <P> All of which led to a major decision during April's NCAA signing period. Would  it be football or volleyball?  </P> <P> Football always had been Kyman's favorite sport. He had pictured himself at  quarterback, leading a major college team to championships much as he had at  Reseda, which won the City 2-A title his junior year.  </P> <P> There were offers, too -- from Nevada Las Vegas and Miami of Ohio. "Playing  college football was something I'd wanted to do my whole life," Kyman said.  "But I decided to go with volleyball."  </P> <P> The college he chose was Cal State Northridge, which is a five-minute drive  from his home. Northridge also is regularly located somewhere near the bottom  of the Western Intercollegiate Volleyball Assn. standings.  </P> <P> Oh, there were other schools interested, but Kyman struggled in the classroom.  And many questioned his ability.  </P> <P> "It's just been in the last year or so that he's really become a high-caliber  player," said Rod Wilde, the North coach and an assistant at Pepperdine. "He's  just starting to work at it full-time and he's come a long way fast."  </P> <P> Kyman is hopeful he can take Northridge on an ascent with him.  </P> <P> "At the junior nationals a lot of people were telling me that coaches were  saying that they had no idea I was so good," Kyman said. "People were saying,  'We should have got that guy.'  </P> <P> "But Northridge really wanted me and I can hardly wait to play for them.  Hopefully, if I work hard, I can help Northridge become a better program and  we'll start beating some of those teams from over the hill."  </P> <P> Kyman is familiar with the challenges that teams like UCLA, USC and Pepperdine  pose. He was a linesman at Northridge home games during the past season.  </P> <P> "I'm going to go in there and learn as much as I can and be a leader as much as  I can," Kyman said. "I've always been on winning teams and I'm sure I will be  at Northridge, too."  </P> <P> Wilde, whose Pepperdine team ranks annually among the nation's best, expects  that Kyman will make an impact for the Matadors.  </P> <P> "I think he can be a very good player at the college level," he said. "I'm sure  Northridge will probably put a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and I'm  sure Coley will be up to it."  </P> <P> Certainly he will be coming off a summer of rave reviews.  </P> <P> Kyman followed his dominating play in the junior nationals with a spirited  performance in his Olympic Festival debut Tuesday. He had 18 kills, seven digs,  six blocks and a team-high .531 hitting percentage with only one error in 32  chances.  </P> <P> "We call him 'Machine Gun' because he has such quick arms," Wilde said.  </P> <P> If Kyman has a flaw in his game, Wilde said, it's his jumping ability, which is  only average.  </P> <P> "But he'll get stronger and he'll be a better jumper, too, now that he's  working at volleyball full-time," Wilde predicted.  </P> <P> Exactly how long he will continue focusing solely on volleyball is something he  hasn't decided, however.  </P> <P> "I'm going to play football again someday," said Kyman, who discussed the  possibility with Northridge football Coach Bob Burt. "But for this year,  anyway, I'll be concentrating just on volleyball."  </P> <P> Unless, of course, a few cute girls are seen out by the football field.  </P></p>

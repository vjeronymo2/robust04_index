			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / On the beach, they take it as read What books will Britain's chairmen and chief executives be taking on holiday this summer, asks Charles Batchelor. Political biography, histories and novels head the list. It will probably come as no surprise that management volumes do not make the grade. Clear winners are John le Carre, with his spy thriller The Night Manager, James Clavell's Gai-Jin, and Jeffrey Archer's Honour Among Thieves. The most frequently mentioned title not quite to make the holiday suitcase? Without a doubt Nigel Lawson's The View From No 11. Many executives are 'wading through', or 'dipping into' it, but it appears to be just too bulky to make the trip. A bag of books, most of them 'hefty tomes', accompanies Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI. The subjects are mainly biographical but with what Sir Denys calls 'faction' thrown in. He hopes to finish the Diaries of Alan Clarke, the former defence minister, which he is already halfway through and which he describes as a 'light read'. Next in line is Truman, a biography of former US president Harry Truman by David McCullough, bought in a New York bookshop. Lighter relief comes in the shape of Gai-Jin, James Clavell's 1,000-plus-page account of the European powers' attempts to open up 19th-century Japan. 'Good escapism' is the essential characteristic required by Ewen Macpherson, chief executive of 3i, the UK's largest venture capital company, which has made news in recent months with its on-off plans for a public flotation. Macpherson will be taking Le Carre's The Night Manager and Jeffrey Archer's Honour Among Thieves with him on his annual Scottish fishing break, where he catches up on leisure reading. A book which has attracted his interest is The View from No 11, Nigel Lawson's account of his years as chancellor of the exchequer. 'I've been dipping in and out of it but I have not yet settled down,' says Macpherson. Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, is a fan of the English classic novel, an enthusiasm he shares with his wife. They like to choose a title jointly and discuss it afterwards, with the characters fresh in their minds. Dickens's Hard Times is this year's choice, perhaps an appropriate title for an investment manager at the end of a deep recession. This will be joined by Fatherland, Robert Harris's thriller set against the background of a victorious Third Reich. Ross Goobey will also be taking John Carswell's South Sea Bubble, a recent reissue of the story of the famous stock market scandal. Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons Group, is methodical. He has selected books in three categories - 'political history, popular stuff, and mind-improving' - for his planned three-week break. Under the first category he has selected John Campbell's Edward Heath, a biography, and Portraits and Miniatures, by Roy Jenkins, a founder of the Social Democrats, whose style he admires. The popular selection includes Jeffrey Archer's latest thriller, Honour Among Thieves. In the mind-improving section, Kalms has set aside One People, a study of the different strands in the Jewish community by Jonathan Sachs, the chief rabbi. Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, the merchant banking group, says he 'builds up a pile to be read and then see how far I can get through it'. On his list is Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, which he last read as a schoolboy and which a friend has recommended as a good guide to understanding what is happening in Russia today. He has also chosen Le Carre's The Night Manager for light relief. He looks forward to what he believes will be a 'splendidly convoluted' tale. For a more factual account of recent history he has selected Turmoil and Triumph, the memoirs of George Schultz, former US secretary of state. George Bain, principal of the London Business School, will read books he has set aside specially and others already half completed. There is a strong historical thread to the group, Part-read is Joe Lee's Ireland 1912-1985, an historical work with a personal resonance because of Bain's Belfast mother. This will be joined by Correlli Barnett's Engage the Enemy More Closely, not a reference to Insead, the rival French-based business school, Bain jokes, but a history of the Royal Navy, in which he served. The historical theme is completed by Under an Open Sky, by William Cronon, a collection of essays on the American west. If Sir Simon Hornby, chairman and chief executive of W H Smith, were taking a holiday, a Trollope novel would be in his suitcase. A rapid and voracious reader, Sir Simon, a member of the Trollope Society, is working his way through the author's entire output. Not that such dedication confers unreserved pleasure. The Macdermots of Ballycloran, Trollope's first novel and the most recent on Sir Simon's list was 'a boring book, almost unreadable', he says. Sir Simon reads mainly novels. 'I don't want to be bothered with other things.' An exception is Jean Genet, Edmund White's life of the French novelist and dramatist.</p>

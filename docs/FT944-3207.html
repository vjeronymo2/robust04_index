			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T and Unisource in telecoms services venture AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms carrier, and Unisource, a consortium of European telecoms operators, said yesterday they had established a new company to provide telecommunications services to multinational groups in Europe. The company will intensify global competition in the lucrative market for managed network services, where global 'supercarriers' provide a broad range of sophisticated telecoms services for companies seeking worldwide communications links. The venture, as yet unnamed, will combine the data and business voice services of the two organisations in Europe, and look to give customers improved access to North America and Asia. Given the necessary regulatory approvals, it should be fully functional by mid-1995. Mr Viesturs Vucins, Unisource president, has been named chief executive. Mr John Foster, president of AT&amp;T Communications Services Europe, is chief operating officer. A location for the headquarters has yet to be chosen. The formation of the company had been widely anticipated since the two organisations became associates in AT&amp;T's 'WorldPartners' scheme, an affiliation of telecoms carriers, earlier this year. Some services are already available in Europe through this association. Unisource, a pan-European telecoms services provider, is a joint venture between the national carriers of the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and Spain. It will own 60 per cent of the new venture and AT&amp;T, 40 per cent. The company will have assets of about Dollars 200bn and 2,200 employees  - 500 from AT&amp;T and 1,700 from Unisource. According to Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, president of AT&amp;T Europe, and Mr Lars Berg, Unisource chairman, the new company starts life with revenues of over Dollars 1bn. Profits forecasts were not disclosed, but Mr Falotti said the group would invest about Dollars 1bn over the next few years to strengthen and expand its infrastructure. The principal market for the company is Europe, where it will be the distributor for WorldPartners global services. International companies will be offered a range of voice and data services including messaging and video-conferencing. 'As business conditions and regulatory rules permit,' AT&amp;T said yesterday, 'the new company will consider both service and geographic expansion.' The venture will be subject to the regulatory approval of the European Union authorities, but will not need approval from the US Federal Communications Commission. It represents fresh competition for 'Concert,' an international voice and data service established by British Telecommunications and MCI of the US and for 'Atlas,' a similar service being established by US Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. BT said it would make representations to the European Union and to the FCC. It argues that with the exception of Sweden, Unisource partners are state monopolies operating in unliberalised markets, and can therefore compete unfairly with private companies, such as BT, operating in liberalised markets.

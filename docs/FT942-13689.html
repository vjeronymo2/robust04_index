			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / UK Company News: Le Creuset profits fall to Pounds 3m Le Creuset, the London-listed houseware manufacturer, blamed high interest rates and recession in France for a 16 per cent decline in profits. The company, which makes cast iron pans, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 3.57m to Pounds 3m in the year to December 31. Nevertheless, strong sales in the UK and North America helped turnover increase by 7.2 per cent to Pounds 40.7m (Pounds 38m). Mr Paul van Zuydam, chairman, said the houseware sector had seen volumes decline by more than 10 per cent in France, home of Le Creuset's manufacturing plants, and around 5 per cent elsewhere. The company had withstood the worst of the downturn, but its export business had been adversely affected by 'punitive interest rates' and the strong French franc. It was, however, boosted by strengthening demand for its Screwpull brand, the corkscrew range acquired for Pounds 7m three years ago. This now accounts for more than 15 per cent of turnover. The company has also diversified successfully into the barbecue business. Last year it acquired Wolo, the German distributor of Weber grills, for Pounds 1m. Expansion into such markets had reduced the impact of recession elsewhere in Europe and provided scope for further acquisitions, according to Mr van Zuydam. He hinted that future purchases could be funded with a rights issue - diluting his current 73 per cent holding. Buoyant prospects, he added, justified an increased annual dividend of FFr0.44 per share, up from FFr0.43 last time. Earnings per share fell from 15p to 13.4p.</p>

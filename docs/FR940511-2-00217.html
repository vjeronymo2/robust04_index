Deletion of Appendix L of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Release Into the Environment/Dr. Wivel <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 29, 1994, Dr. Nelson Wivel of the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, requested that Appendix L, Release into the Environment of Certain Plants, be deleted from the NIH Guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA) requests that Appendix L, Release into the Environment of Certain Plants, be deleted from the NIH Guidelines based on the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Section I of the NIH Guidelines allows experiments to proceed that are reviewed and approved by another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval without the necessity for NIH review or approval (52 FR 31849); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee has not reviewed any deliberate release experiment involving recombinant DNA since 1984; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) At its May 30&hyph;31, 1991, meeting, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee recommended that Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 be deleted from the NIH Guidelines; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Experiments involving deliberate release into the environment are currently reviewed within the framework of existing Federal regulations, i.e., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section I of the NIH Guidelines was amended on August 24, 1987, such that any recombinant DNA experiment (other than human gene transfer) may proceed without Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee and NIH approval if it has been reviewed and approved by another Federal agency that has jurisdiction over such a proposal. The amended version (52 FR 31849) of Section I reads as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section I&hyph;A. Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``*&blank;*&blank;* Any recombinant DNA experiment, which according to the NIH Guidelines requires approval by the NIH, must be submitted to the NIH or to another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval. Once approval, or other applicable clearances, has been obtained from a Federal agency other than the NIH (whether the experiment is referred to that agency by the NIH or sent directly there by the submitter), the experiment may proceed without the necessity for NIH review or approval *&blank;*&blank;*.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 6, 1990, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee Planning Subcommittee recommended that the requirement for Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee review of experiments involving deliberate environmental release of organisms containing recombinant DNA be eliminated from the NIH Guidelines. This recommendation reflected the fact that the Federal regulatory agencies, the USDA and EPA, are responsible for the review and approval of environmental release experiments. The Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee reviewed the request and recommended that the following sections be deleted from the NIH Guidelines: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Deliberate release into the environment of any organism containing recombinant DNA except those listed below. The term ``deliberate release'' is defined as a planned introduction of recombinant DNA-containing microorganisms, plants, or animals into the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2&hyph;a. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Introductions conducted under conditions considered to be accepted scientific practices in which there is adequate evidence of biological and/or physical control of the recombinant DNA-containing organisms. The nature of such evidence is described in appendix L. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2&hyph;b. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Deletion derivatives and single base changes not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2&hyph;c. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For extrachromosomal elements and microorganisms (including viruses), rearrangements and amplifications within a single genome. Rearrangements involving the introduction of DNA from different strains of the same species would not be covered by this exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these amendments to the NIH Guidelines, that have previously been recommended by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, and the fact that the principals of planned introduction are now in place which provide a risk-assessment method by other Federal regulatory agencies, the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities requests that Appendix L be deleted from the NIH Guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix L will be deleted as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Appendix L.

Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to NIH, review by the RAC Plant Working Group, and specific approval by the NIH Director. Such experiments also require the approval of the IBC before initiation. Information on specific experiments which have been approved will be available in ORDA and will be listed in appendix L&hyph;III when the Guidelines are republished. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Experiments which do not meet the specifications of appendix L&hyph;II fall under section III&hyph;A and require RAC review and NIH and IBC approval before initiation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

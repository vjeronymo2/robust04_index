			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe voiced support on Thursday [31 March] for Japan's  bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council  [UNSC] with veto rights, Foreign Ministry officials said.  Juppe, who arrived in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day  stay, expressed his support in a meeting with his Japanese  counterpart Tsutomu Hata, the officials said.    Juppe said in a meeting with Hata it is necessary to enlarge  the Security Council and the number of its permanent members to  reflect the current world situation, they said. "In this  context, it is natural for Japan and Germany" to acquire  permanent seats, he was quoted as saying.    Juppe added that France does not want to create new  categories for permanent members such as creating permanent  members without veto power. "France wants to maintain the  current system," he reportedly told Hata, adding it is necessary  to enlarge the council but also to maintain its efficiency.    He also noted the need to take into account regional  allocations when considering enlargement of the permanent  members, the officials said. "In any case, France's position is  flexible," Juppe was quoted as saying.    Juppe's remarks were the clearest support yet by a French  Government official for Japan's bid for a permanent seat,  according to the officials.    Hata said Japan would carry out its responsibilities within  its capacity.    Turning to problems involving North Korea's alleged  development of nuclear weapons, Juppe and Hata agreed on the  need for the international community to take a firm stance to  tackle the issue, the officials said. Juppe told Hata that  France, which currently chairs the U.N. Security Council,  considers the problem very important and is very concerned, they  said.    Touching on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum, Juppe said France wants to have some kind of dialogue  with APEC because it has close relations with the region,  according to the officials. Hata replied that Japan thinks APEC  should be open and wants to promote transparency of APEC's  activities, the officials said.    Also during the meeting covering a wide range of topics,  Hata  urged France to continue to refrain from conducting nuclear  tests, they said.</p>

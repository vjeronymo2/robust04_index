			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bank of East Asia marks anniversary with 47% surge Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's third largest listed bank, yesterday marked its 75th anniversary by unveiling a 47 per cent rise in 1993 net earnings to HKDollars 1bn (USDollars 129m) from HKDollars 685.2m in 1992. Analysts in Hong Kong had expected the bank to present something special for its anniversary, but the results published left analysts gasping. The consensus of expectations was for profits to be about 25 per cent ahead of the previous year. Bank of East Asia said that its earnings were supported by stable interest margins, persistently strong demand for bank loans, and gains in fee-earning business. Mr David Li, chief executive, said operations in Hong Kong and China had put in a very strong performance last year. Offshore operations, with the exception of the branch in New York, had also performed well. Mr Li said he expected growing pressure on margins in Hong Kong this year. He said he expected to see a contraction in interest margins and a commensurate rise in the cost of bank funds. Mr Li said, however, that growth in earnings would be stable for banks in Hong Kong which were expected to rely more on non-interest income than in the past. This would be the case for Bank of East Asia which would also benefit from property sales during the year, he said. Bank of East Asia's explanation of its success over the past year met with some scepticism among brokers who noted that the result was struck after an unspecified transfer to secret inner reserves. According to Mr Steven Li, banking analyst with Jardine Fleming: 'There is no doubt in my mind that their banking results were not up 47 per cent in the year.' He said he thought that earnings from securities trading and property development helped buoy the result. The transfer the bank made to inner reserves in 1993 might have been a lot smaller than in 1992. The bank said it would pay a special cash bonus of 10 HK cents a share. A final dividend of 62.5 HK cents a share took total dividends for the year to 90 HK cents a share - up 35 per cent on 1992. Directors also recommended a one-for-four share bonus.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Salomon net more than tripled in final quarter Salomon Inc, the New York investment banking group with a volatile earnings record, yesterday announced fourth-quarter net income more than tripled as it shared in a record-breaking year for the US securities industry. Net income was Dollars 476m, or Dollars 3.64 a share, up from Dollars 143m, or Dollars 1.06, in the same period of 1992, helped by a strong profits surge in investment banking and a good quarter in proprietary, or own-account, trading. Salomon Brothers, the group's core investment banking business, reported pre-tax earnings of Dollars 862m, up from Dollars 503m. Phibro, the energy and commodity trading division, recorded a loss of Dollars 21m, down from a deficit of Dollars 181m in the final quarter of 1992. Salomon's figures surprised analysts who had been expecting earnings per share around Dollars 1.50 and its shares closed up Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 48 1/4 . 'Client-driven businesses,' which include investment banking and commission income, had pre-tax earnings of Dollars 354m, up from Dollars 115m in the same period of 1992. 'Customer trading activities in the fourth quarter were strong and record investment banking revenues were generated for the third consecutive quarter,' the group said. Salomon's results tend to be more volatile than other Wall Street houses because of its heavy reliance on proprietary trading. In the fourth quarter this business reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 508m, against Dollars 482m in the same period of 1992 and a Dollars 173m loss in the third quarter. In 1993 as a whole, Salomon made Dollars 416m from proprietary trading, down from Dollars 1.4bn in 1992. Client-driven income soared from Dollars 276m to Dollars 1.2bn, which Mr Denham attributed to management changes as well as market conditions. For the full year, Salomon Inc reported net income of Dollars 827m, or Dollars 6.28, up from Dollars 550m, or Dollars 4.05, in 1992. Return on equity, before an accounting charge, was 19 per cent, up from 13 per cent. The fourth-quarter figures also included a pre-tax charge of Dollars 30m by Phibro USA, the oil refining business, to write down the inventories to year-end market prices.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Bill set to become law soon - War crimes THE War Crimes Bill, rejected by peers on Tuesday night, will become law without further debate in the next few weeks, under the rarely-used procedures allowing the Commons to overrule the Lords. A police unit of detectives and support staff has already been assembled to investigate the handful of cases in which further investigations were recommended by the inquiry report which led to the bill. Some Tory MPs, however, yesterday pressed Mr John MacGregor, the leader of the Commons, to provide time for a further debate, giving MPs an opportunity to stop the bill taking effect. Mr Bernard Weatherill, the Speaker, told MPs that following the Lords vote by 131 to 109 to throw out the bill for a second time, the Commons would ask for the bill back, so that it could be certified to receive royal assent. The legislation would allow British citizens alleged to be war criminals, to be prosecuted for atrocities in German-occupied territories during the Second World War. Both the Speaker and Mr MacGregor emphasised that the Parliament Acts procedures, used for the first time by a Tory administration, came into play automatically after the bill's defeat. Mr MacGregor said that the process could stop only if the Commons so decided, but added he did not intend to provide more time for a debate, since MPs had made their views known on several occasions, passing the bill twice with substantial majority. Mr Ivor Stanbrook, and Mr Robert Adley, Tory MPs and opponents of the bill, asked Mr MacGregor how the Commons could direct otherwise unless it had time to debate the question. Mr MacGregor was supported by Mr John Cunningham, the shadow leader of the Commons, who called for the procedures to be followed 'without delay', so that the elected chamber's supremacy would be made clear.</p>

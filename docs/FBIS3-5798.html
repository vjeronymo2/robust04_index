Last week the VP helped to elect Jean-Marie Leye,  candidate of the main ruling party, the Union of Moderate  Parties, president of Vanuatu after two earlier attempts had  failed.    In return for this help in the electoral college vote, the  VP  asked for four ministries in the government, including the  finance and lands portfolios. Later Prime Minister Maxime Carlot  said the opposition party would get "at least two" ministerial  portfolios. But government sources said the offer made in  writing Friday by Carlot contained only one ministerial  portfolio, labour and training -- which was to be created -- and  two parliamentary posts, leader of government business and first  deputy speaker.    VP coordinator Peter Taurakoto told AFP Tuesday that his  party had refused the offer because it was not in line with the  verbal "gentleman's agreement" between Kalpokas and Carlot. "The  door is not closed and we're still ready to help if the  government sees there is a need," Taurakoto said.    The ruling coalition government has 24 members in the  46-seat  house where the VP has nine members.    Leye was elected March 2 by 41 of the 55-member electoral  college.</p>

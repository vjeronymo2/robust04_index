			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 19 Apr (DPA) -- General Luis Alonso  Discua, commander-in-chief of the Honduran Armed Forces,  confirmed today that the Armed Forces want to break the military  assistance treaty with the United States because they consider  it obsolete and, according to military leaders, it does not  benefit the country.    Gen. Discua said the Armed Forces will attempt to submit the  treaty for review by the Honduran Congress Defense Committee.    The United States signed a military assistance treaty with  Honduras in 1954 and, according to Discua, it currently benefits  the United States.    Discua referred specifically to the U.S. military base at  Palmerola in the central department (province) of Comayagua,  noting that it is important to examine whether it is appropriate  to keep the base open in Honduras.    U.S. assistance to Honduras has been reduced drastically in  the past year, and according to Discua, U.S. assistance is  conditional upon various situations and even includes sanctions.</p>

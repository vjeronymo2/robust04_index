			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Cha Man-sun reports from Vienna] </F>   [Text] Three members of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] inspection team have embarked on a visit to North  Korea to confirm whether North Korea's nuclear fuel rods have  actually been replaced and to conduct additional inspections.    The three-member inspection team, led by IAEA inspection  chief (Hainamen), left for Vienna via China on the evening of 15  May, Korean standard time, and is due to arrive in Beijing at  0840 on 16 May.    The inspection team, entrusted with the special mission to  make on-the-spot confirmation of the nuclear fuel rods  replacement, will make a stopover in Beijing and arrive in  Pyongyang via Koryo Civilian Air on the afternoon of 17 May.    During its stay, the inspection team will confirm on the  spot  whether nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon  have actually been replaced. The IAEA will call off its  inspection and pull out its team earlier than scheduled if North  Korea has removed the nuclear fuel rods seals and replaced the  nuclear fuel rods. However, if North Korea has just begun  preparations for the nuclear fuel rods replacement, the  inspection team will carry out inspection activities until 24  May. It will check seals and replace surveillance equipment at  major nuclear facilities, and conduct additional inspections of  the radiochemical laboratory.</p>

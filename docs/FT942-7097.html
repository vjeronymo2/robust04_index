			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Abortion vote in Germany The German parliament yesterday narrowly approved a law which proposes prison sentences of up to two years for people who encourage an abortion. The 264-260 vote in the lower house of parliament marks the latest chapter in the bitter feud about how to reconcile differing abortion regimes in east and west Germany. The new law, which will be debated in the Bundesrat on July 8, allows abortion up to the 12th week of pregnancy if the mother has been to a series of legal, social and medical consultations laid down by the constitutional court last year.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAO PAULO BACKS OUT AS GAMES HOST  </P> <P> Organizers of this year's University Games have asked Seoul, host to the 1988  Olympics, to replace Sao Paulo as host due to Brazil's financial problems, the  South Korean sports ministry said today.  </P> <P> The request was made at a meeting of the International University Sports  Federation in Rome last week, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> "One of our delegates to the meeting received the request, but we have not made  our position known yet," he said, adding that Seoul is likely to reject the  offer.  </P> <P> "If we host the University Games just one year after the Olympics, the people  may not accept it," he said.  </P> <P> "I understand many countries do not want to host the Universiad for fear that  the games, with a small television revenue, will be unprofitable."  </P> <P> Sao Paulo was named to stage the 1989 University Games in a general meeting of  the international federation in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, in August, 1987.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] I am still the president of Haiti. This is a  statement by Justice Joseph Nerette on the afternoon of 7 April  during a news briefing at his home. Hoping to ignore the  parliamentary decree restoring President Aristide to his post,  Justice Nerette said several times: I am the constitutional  president of Haiti.    [Begin recording] [Nerette] Once again, I have not tendered  my resignation.    [Unidentified journalist] For the time being, you consider  yourself the president of the Republic of Haiti even though the  parliamentarians restored President Aristide to his post?    [Nerette] I am the constitutional president of the Republic  of Haiti. Do you want me to repeat the same thing again and  again?    [Journalist] Mr. Nerette....    [Nerette, interrupting] I think that is all, gentlemen.    [Journalist] One small question.    [Nerette] No, no, not half a question.    [Journalist Rotschild Francois] Why [do you make] these  statements today when you kept silent for a long time?    [Nerette] I have the right to say nothing. Are you  contesting  my right to say nothing?    [Journalist Patrick Eliancy] Anyway, there is a [word  indistinct], there are actions undertaken by the Revolutionary  Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH], the  Mobilization for National Development [MDN], the Group of  Citizens of the Greater North [CCGN], and the Action Committee  for National Reconciliation [CARENA] for the disentanglement of  the crisis....    [Francois, interrupting] Do you support this initiative by  FRAPH, CARENA, MDN, and CCGN to try to establish a new  government in the country?    [Nerette] I have already said that the country is in danger.  They can call on a -- I would even say -- honest, loyal, and  worthy citizen....    [Journalist, interrupting] Have they called you?    [Nerette] Whether they have or not, I am president.    [Francois] But, Mr. Nerette, how can you explain that you  are  not at the National Palace?    [Journalist] Must one be at the National Palace to be  president? Namphy was [words indistinct]. He refused to sit at  the National Palace. He said that his office is in the barracks  [previous six words in Creole: se kay jon nan'k kay li]. You  have forgotten all that. [end recording]</p>

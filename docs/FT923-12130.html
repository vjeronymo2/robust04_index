			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Aerolineas Argentinas set to be renationalised ARGENTINA will this week partly renationalise Aerolineas Argentinas, the flag carrier it privatised in November 1990, following weeks of intense negotiations with Spain's Iberia, the largest shareholder in the company. Officials said the government and Iberia had agreed a formula that would end a series of disputes over management and payment for the company. The government is expected to increase its stake in Aerolineas to 32 per cent from 5 per cent, by taking back shares held by the company's undercapitalised local investors. The government blames the Argentine investors for providing neither capital or management in Aerolineas, suggesting that Iberia used them as figureheads in its Dollars 1.87bn cash and debt-for-equity acquisition of the company.</p>

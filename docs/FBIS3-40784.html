			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 15 (UNI)--The Election Commission on  Wednesday ordered that all electors in all Parliamentary  constituencies in the country except Jammu and Kashmir be  supplied with photo identity cards by November 30 next year.    The eleven-page order issued by the commission secretary, Mr  K.P.G. Kutty, made it clear that the commission would not hold  election after January 1, 1995, unless all eligible electors  were supplied with photo identity cards by this deadline.    The order categorically stated that the Chief Electoral  Officers and the State Governments or Union Territories would  not be given any extension beyond the above deadline under any  circumstances.    "It is therefore squarely the responsibility of the State  Governments and Chief Electoral Officers to strictly abide by  the schedule and ensure compliance.    "Any slippage or non-compliance for any reason whatsoever  will be visited with appropriate action by the commission for  which the State Governments and the Chief Electoral Officers  concerned alone will be responsible," the commission warned.    The commission directed all the State Governments and Union  Territories to acknowledge the receipt of this order within a  week from Wednesday.    The following is the schedule fixed by the commission for  issuing photo identity-cards to electorate:    1. Issue of comprehensive instructions to EROs [expansion  not  given] by the ECOs and forwarding of a copy of the compendium of  instructions to the Election Commission by December 31, 1933.  [date as published]    2. Supply of paper to EROS--by January 31, 1994.    3. Award of contract to the agencies--February 28, 1994.    4. Completion of photography and lamination--by August 31,  1994.    5. Completion of distribution of cards to electors and  consignment of duplicates--by November 30, 1994.</p>

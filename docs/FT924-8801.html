			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Interest fall hurts Yamanouchi YAMANOUCHI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese ethical drug manufacturer, yesterday revealed that non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first six months to September were hit by a fall in interest income. Interim taxable profits fell by 4.4 per cent to Y30.24bn (Dollars 247.86m) from Y31.62bn, on a 6.6 per cent growth in sales to Y119.87bn from Y112.42bn.

Operating profits grew 3.1 per cent to Y25.61bn from Y24.85bn, while net profits fell 4.8 per cent to Y15.62bn. Profits fell because of a Y1.2bn fall in interest income. However, Yamanouchi is to increase its interim dividend by Y1 a share to Y6.50. For the full year to March, Yamanouchi expects pre-tax profits to edge up 0.7 per cent to Y61.5bn on an 8.5 per cent rise in sales to Y245bn.

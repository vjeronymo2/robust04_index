			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Cash futures jump GERMAN, French and UK financial futures contracts jumped higher for the first time in two weeks reflecting hope that lower interest rates might be back on the agenda. writes Peter John. The most heavily traded contracts for three-month money, those expiring in December, all broke through recent trading ranges. In the case of Germany, a decision by the Bundesbank to move from a fixed 14-day repurchase agreement to a variable repo prompted hopes that the Bundesbank might be about to ease rates. Liquidity is tight in Germany at the moment so the rate is likely to remain at least at 6.7 per cent but could fall next week. German cash futures rose 6 basis points to 93.79 with 44,000 contracts traded. Three-month franc futures traded on Liffe responded to comments by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French minister for the economy, that he saw signs of growth in French economy. His remarks were taken as an indication that French officials might be taking a softer line on monetary policy. The French December contract leapt some 14 basis points by the official close and was trading at 93.44 later. The break-out for short sterling, on the other hand, gave rise to some surprise in the money markets, The December contract has been stuck in a tight range between 94.34 and 94.38 for a fortnight with few dealers prepared to buy or sell and turnover lingering just above 10,000. Yesterday saw the volume for December leap to more than 52,000 as the price lifted 9 basis points to 94.46 with no obvious spur driving it forward. Some dealers suggested that a second assessment of Monday's economic data on the trade gap and producer prices had led to a more optimistic view on lower interest rates. However, most sterling observers are looking towards today's retail prices index data. A more plausible view appeared to be that a slight rise triggered a bout of stop-loss buying, trading based on a contract hitting a pre-determined level. That slight early gain was set off by easier than expected conditions in the money markets. At the start of the day's dealings the Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of Pounds 1bn but most of that shortage was taken out when the Bank bought Pounds 750m of bills at 5 29/32 per cent followed by a further Pounds 150m at 5 7/8 per cent. The forecast was later revised to Pounds 1.1bn and an additional Pounds 214m of help provided which brought total assistance to Pounds 1.114bn.</p>

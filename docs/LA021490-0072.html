			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW PUTS HART ON OUTSIDE LOOKING IN  </P> <P> Hart High's inside game was no match for Ocean View's outside game Tuesday  night in the opening round of the Southern Section 5-A Division basketball  playoffs.  </P> <P> Ocean View made seven three-point shots, including a game-clincher by freshman  Jimmy Harris with 3 minutes 21 seconds left, and defeated Hart, 76-67, in an  up-tempo game.  </P> <P> Ocean View (15-10), which trailed at the half, 33-31, before erupting for 26  points in the third quarter, advances to the second round Friday night against  Moreno Valley.  </P> <P> Hart (18-8) used a 1-3-1 zone defense and failed to adjust to Ocean View's  perimeter shooters, who repeatedly let fly uncontested three-point shots.  </P> <P> "They didn't do anything that surprised us, we just didn't adjust to their  shooters," Hart Coach Greg Herrick said.  </P> <P> Forwards Marty Downen (18 points) and Keith Halcovich (19 points) gave Ocean  View problems through three quarters, but Hart appeared to tire in the fourth  quarter.  </P> <P> Herrick played his starters most of the game and the lack of depth appeared to  hurt Hart down the stretch.  </P> <P> "Their forwards took our front line apart," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said.  "They made us look as if we never played defense before. But, yeah, I thought  they got tired at the end of the game."  </P> <P> Hart, which averages 80 points a game, showed that kind of explosiveness,  scoring 11 consecutive points at the end of the second quarter to go ahead by  two at halftime.  </P> <P> But Ocean View put on the brakes by utilizing a four-corner delay game. Ocean  View held a 61-56 lead with 6:09 remaining when guard Greg Evans stole a pass  and scored on a layup. Hart never got closer.  </P> <P> "We made them come out of the zone and play us in the fourth quarter, and that  turned the game around," Harris said.  </P></p>

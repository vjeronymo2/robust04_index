			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Minister agrees to study CBI demands on policy MR TIM SAINSBURY, the industry minister, said yesterday the government would give serious consideration to a call by the Confed-eration of British Industry for a white paper setting out its industrial objectives for the recovery. Responding to CBI demands for a more 'co-ordinated and coherent policy', Mr Sainsbury said the government's main objective in industrial policy was to maintain low inflation and steady growth. 'The overriding need to keep inflation down means that we will have to take tough and unpopular decisions on public spending and taxation,' he told business leaders in Birmingham last night. The CBI's call on ministers to publish industrial objectives comes against a background of government efforts to develop a new partnership with business. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, told the dinner of industrialists that he was not calling for the old industrial strategy of picking 'winners and losers'. Instead, he said he is seeking a middle approach between old-fashioned intervention and a minimalist government role towards industry. Businessmen need to hear what government industrial policy is, he argued, in order to understand how it affects ministerial decisions towards public spending and taxation. His call to Mr Sainsbury follows the CBI's publication yesterday of a new policy document. The document said industrialists 'are not convinced that the current structure of decision-making in government is ideally suited to the creation of a coherent approach to competitiveness'. The paper concludes by calling on the government to take a more direct role in representing the interests of British industry in Europe and other markets. Mr Sainsbury, meanwhile, said the government had already pursued that role through its increased commitment to export promotion. He said that over the past 18 months the government had increased the extent of export credit cover by Pounds 2bn.</p>

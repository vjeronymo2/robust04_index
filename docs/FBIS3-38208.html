In an address to journalists, he acknowledged that the  European Community lacked vision in dealing with the region and  that its executive intended to embark on a process of  "self-criticism" to map out a new policy.    "The Community must delve into the roots of its history," he  said, adding that "Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw and other cities are  as much poles of our cultural identity as Berlin, Paris,  Brussels, Amsterdam or London."    The European Community has negotiated association agreements  with Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania  and Bulgaria which are supposed to prepare the way for these  countries to enter the European Community.    But the applicants have been given no timetable for entry,  or  any assurance that they can expect to enter the Community before  the turn of the century.    The European Community has also been blamed for holding up  the economic development of these countries by maintaining  barriers to some of their most vigorous exports such as steel  and agricultural products.    The European Community's chief executive said the Commission  intended to launch an analysis of all existing EC aid,  particularly economic and technological, to East Europe.    Delors is to give up his post as European Commission  president at the end of this year. He has occupied the post  since 1985.</p>

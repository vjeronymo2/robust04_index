			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse earnings down by 29% to Dollars 65m WESTINGHOUSE, the diversified US group which has been struggling to recover from heavy losses by its financial services division, yesterday said that poor performances by its core businesses had contributed to a 29 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings. The company, which has interests ranging from nuclear power to radio stations, said net income from continuing operations was Dollars 65m, or 15 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.06bn. In the corresponding period of 1992, net income was Dollars 91m, or 22 cents, on turnover of Dollars 2.27bn. 'Obviously the third quarter's financial results are disappointing,' said Mr Michael Jordan, who was named chairman and chief executive in July. His appointment followed the departure of Mr Paul Lego, who had faced pressure from institutional shareholders to stem losses from the group's property market activities. Earnings for the nine months to end-September - down 25 per cent from a year earlier - showed a similar rate of decline as the quarterly results. Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 208m, or 48 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 6.23bn. This compares with net income of Dollars 278m, or 77 cents, in the same period of 1992, on revenues of Dollars 6.67bn. In the latest quarter, the performances of environmental services and electronic systems were particularly weak, with revenues 'down substantially' for both divisions. Westinghouse does not provide specific figures for its segments. The company said the environmental arm had suffered because of sagging demand for its hazardous waste clean-up and incineration services. Sluggish trading conditions in Europe had been a contributing factor, it added. Westinghouse attributed the decline at its important electronic systems division to reduced spending by the US defence department. The company recently converted some of its military hardware for use in law enforcement and home security, but it is uncertain whether the extended product range will prove a success. Westinghouse's broadcasting operation was another lacklustre area. The company blamed a downturn in operating profit at the division on a weak performance in the west coast television market. The power systems segment, meanwhile, showed a sharp decline in operating profit because of reduced shipments and other factors. In September, Westinghouse warned investors that it expected a 50 per cent drop in net income in the third quarter. With the results not quite as dire as had been forecast, Wall Street reacted calmly to yesterday's announcement. GE shares closed Dollars 1/8 lower at Dollars 13 3/8.</p>

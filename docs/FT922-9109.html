			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / International Company News: Hoare Govett arm to close Tokyo office HOARE Govett Japan, the Japanese arm of the London-based broker, will close its Tokyo branch, becoming the seventh foreign-affiliated brokerage to withdraw from Tokyo. The sluggish Tokyo stock market forced Hoare Govett to close down its Japanese equities operation last March. Hoare Govett started its Tokyo securities operations in 1986. However, the prolonged slump in the Tokyo stock market has forced smaller foreign houses to close or scale down their operations, and Hoare Govett's closure of its Japanese equities operations follows houses such as Chase Manhattan Securities and BHF Securities. Hoare Govett is currently partly owned by BankAmerica, the US bank which merged with Security Pacific in April. ABN Amro Bank, based in Amsterdam, signed a letter of intent this year to buy Hoare Govett from BankAmerica.</p>

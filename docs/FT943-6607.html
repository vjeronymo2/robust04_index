			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Arts: A tragic Oresteia and fantasy on the Fringe - At the Edinburgh Festival our critics spend an insufferably long time at an ice rink and find comedy a few steps from the office How come the director Peter Stein can be presenting a version of Aeschylus's trilogy The Oresteia that is almost without any saving merit? His revived stagings of Falstaff and Pelleas et Melisande (Welsh National Opera) have been among the highlights of the last 12 months in Britain. His account of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar last year was flawed, but had some first-rate solo acting, some colossal crowd effects, and a lucid and serious reading of the text. The Oresteia, however, is badly acted and sluggishly paced throughout. And in the last play, The Eumenides - where Aeschylus turns the colossal family tragedy into a political drama - Stein resorts to ludicrously camp and frivolous effects. The Stein Oresteia began life in Germany over ten years ago, and I would guess that it was then freshly conceived and potently acted. Yet could anyone even then have been impressed by his use of the chorus? (Presumably yes, since I have seen subsequent Euro-stagings of Greek tragedies whose choruses - I now realise - were cast in this mould.) In Agamemnon, the trilogy's opening play, the chorus of Myceanaean elders is played like a collection of shuffling old gents, in brimmed hats, heavy coats and walking sticks who are based around a long office table whose desk lamps they switch on and off from time to time. (Halfway through they move office.) Aeschylus's choral odes, whose rhythmic force is all-important, are turned into conversational mutterings without pulse or metre. In The Libation Bearers, the female chorus - 11 modern women dressed in black suits and high heels - has fitful bouts of tepid lyricism; but in the final play, the chorus of female Eumenides (furies) is a shrilly expressionist coven of white-haired black-faced crones who shriek and shout their lines. (The surtitles remind us that some of their words mean 'Moderation and discretion are always the best policy'. Hrumph.) But most modern stagings of Greek tragedies blunder in their use of the chorus. Stein, however, sinks further. Athena is played (rather well, actually, by Elena Maiorova) as a slinky longhaired glamourpuss. She presides over the big trial scene like a game-show compere, pacing briskly around the Furies as if filling in time before one of them came up with this week's prize-winning answer. Apollo, in a double-breasted white suit but without a shirt, is a comedy ponce. He descends from the ceiling (sitting on a lift), strums his lyre stupidly at irrelevant points, speaks his lines with blatantly jokey insincerity, and then rushes feyly across the stage: all to widespread audience laughter. I confess to a certain malicious glee in reporting that, when he reascended to heaven, he bumped his head on the ceiling. In Agamemnon alone, Clytemnestra wears four different outfits. Can you believe that she addresses her husband, the high king of Greece, feigning joy at his return, with her hands in her pockets? I have survived to tell the tale. I am not, however, man enough to tell you just how badly Ekaterina Vassilieva acts her: mainly through clenched and bared teeth and with much chestily melodramatic vocalisation. Her daughter Electra, though played in a higher vocal key by Tatiana Doguileva, takes after her; she screams and weeps with great relish. Then there is the clunky pacing of each play. I realise now why I have always preferred Stein's stagings of operas to his stagings of plays - because he cannot set the tempo for Verdi or Debussy. In The Oresteia, you long for more surtitles, just because you want something more to read (anything - it need not be by Aeschylus). In Agamemnon, the gear-changes introducing or following each choral ode are so slow that the whole play stalls. Since the whole trilogy lasts (with two intervals) seven hours and a half, this slowness becomes insufferable. Lest I sound vindictive, I will add that Evgueni Mironov's performance as Orestes has an integrity, a variety of tone, and a mixture of restraint and intensity that stands out amid the other performances. And, of course, there is some stimulus to be had from renewing acquaintance with Aeschylus's monumental trilogy, even in these circumstances. To my ear, the Russian text used here has nothing of Aeschylus's rich gravitas, but the power of his overall dramatic architecture can hardly be missed. One thinks of The Oresteia as one single work of art, like the Parthenon, but actually it keeps changing as it proceeds. Eventually Orestes and his family pass out of view, and the drama addresses the issue of justice and law, and leaves us looking not backwards any more but forward into a new democratic world. Beside this awesome construction, most subsequent drama feels as flimsy as balsawood. * * * The Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh's Georgian honeycomb of social spaces, retiring rooms, chambres separees and refreshment pit-stops, comes into its own at festival time, writes Martin Hoyle. Over the past few years comedy has become particularly associated with the George Street venue, by happy chance a few paces from the Scottish FT office. This year's discovery is not a complete surprise, since those in the know will recognise names associated with last year's runaway hit both in Edinburgh and London, Anorak of Fire. Such is the harrowing nature of much of the fringe, those who do not immediately twig may take the opening of Gee] Wow] seriously, with its young man in a woman's petticoat reclining on a chaise-longue and reminiscing about the squalid background (one of 12 children of a hooker, regularly abused) that led to eminence among Andy Warhol's superstars. Only when Clive Neon casts off female garb and resumes a Black Country twang does the penny drop: this Rugely radish-packer has channelled his lifelong 'rebellious attitude and preoccupation with the colour cerise' into fantasy. Just how far the fantasy extends we are unsure. Did he really take Warhol's place on a lecture tour in blond wig and shades ('Oy know what it tikes to be Anday'), uttering the famous bland fatuities? And, reluctant to relinquish his allotted 15 minutes of fame, did he really impose himself on the New York art scene sharing a flat with a performance artist who doubled as a hatstand at fashionable parties? And finally achieve fame with a free-form rock opera with penguins and celery? Or did he remain the Midlands' most unloving son, dreaming of escape from the boredom of Birmingham (which sensitive city I advise this show never to visit)? Either way, James Holmes is very funny, especially in the Brum scenes, when reliving his youth first as a mod ('we looked loike this': blank vacuity) then as a rocker ('we looked loike this': blank vacuity, the head further forward). Sarah Frankcom directs Stephen Dinsdale's script. Blue Helmet might make more of an impact if those of the cast unused to projecting without mikes could get their lines over. Chief offenders are Mark Arden's semi-intelligible blurt as a thicky British private and Maria McErlane's semi-audible mumble as a doctor from Medecins sans Frontieres. As the well-meaning but ludicrously inept UN commander in a murderous eastern European three-way civil war, Robert Llewellyn plays with cheerful clarity and style; but then he wrote it. The warring factions - two European, one Hindu include one military leader who longs to meet Kate Adie. That is one of the funnier jokes. The humour is heavyish-handed, certainly not funny enough to redeem trampling on sensitive areas. And when reference is made more than once to a character's breasts, it seems lazy to present us with a flat chest. Or perhaps that's a joke as well. The Oresteia is at the Murrayfield Ice Rink tonight and tomorrow</p>

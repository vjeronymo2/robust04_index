During a meeting of the National Secretariat of the CTC  [Cuban Workers Federation], CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross  reported that the CTC is now preparing to evaluate and devote  attention to what the workers brought up, and to promote the  (?adoption) of measures, so that every proposal gets its  response. For that reason, the CTC will meticulously take stock  of the process in each province. This assessment will begin on  17 March, with Holguin, and conclude on 25 March, with Villa  Clara. The matter will also be examined during the expanded  national CTC committee meeting, scheduled for 29 March.    [Havana Radio Rebelde Network at 1000 GMT on 9 March, in  this  same connection, reports: "The monitoring of excess workers and  their utilization based on the principle of seeking a position  for personnel without a job, takes on greater importance at the  current moment of struggle for economic efficiency, pointed out  CTC Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal during the meeting of the  CTC Secretariat."]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Skopje, 25 June (TANJUG) -- "We mentioned the  problem of Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] northern border with Serbia during the Corfu  talks. We decided to discuss this issue in detail and, if  possible, to resolve it appropriately," said Lord Owen,  cochairman of the conference on former Yugoslavia, today during  his brief meeting with the press in Skopje.    According to Owen, the European Union "is striving to  prevent  another war, in addition the Bosnian one, and that is the  Serb-Croat war, which was one of the main items on the Corfu  summit agenda, besides the situation in Ukraine."    Owen said that Macedonia was discussed at the summit in  connection with the cochairmen's and international envoys'  efforts to organize direct negotiations with Greece and that  Macedonia needs aid, economic aid in particular. "All of us  involved in the negotiating process will support this," Lord  Owen said.</p>

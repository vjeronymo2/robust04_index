			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Trade News: High-speed rail plan will link Oslo with Berlin DANISH, German and Swedish state railways plan to develop a high-speed rail system linking Oslo and Stockholm with Copenhagen, and Copenhagen with Hamburg, Berlin and Cologne. The intention is to cut travelling time between the capitals by half or more, enabling the railways to compete better with air transport. Journeys from Stockholm to Berlin would be 6.5 hours and Oslo-Berlin 8.5 hours. The plan is estimated to cost DKr40bn-DKr50bn (Pounds 4.1bn-Pounds 5.1bn) over 15 years, including DKr15bn for a rail tunnel linking the south Danish island of Lolland with Germany under the Fehmern Belt. Railways concerned are Deutsche Bundesbahn/Deutsche Reichsbahn, SJ, the Swedish state railway, and DSB, the Danish state railway. Only in the initial stages, the plan still requires decisions by the respective governments. Planners predict that with trains travelling at 200-350kph, passenger and freight traffic will increase dramatically. Passenger traffic between Hamburg and Copenhagen, when the journey time is cut from five hours today to two hours, is expected to increase from 1m to 5m passengers a year, while freight traffic will increase from 8m tonnes to 20m-23m tonnes. The link to Stockholm and Oslo will use the bridge across the Oresund, the straits separating Copenhagen and Sweden, which the Danish and Swedish governments are already planning to build, with completion due at the end of this decade. The plan requires new track between Copenhagen and Hamburg and a tunnel under the Fehmern Belt. A permanent link across the belt still needs Danish and German approval.</p>

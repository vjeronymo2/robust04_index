			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Lower school sales hit Nottingham Nottingham Group, one of the UK's leading suppliers of educational products, yesterday announced its first decline in profits for 12 years. The setback came just five months after its flotation. The shares fell 36p to 119p, having been as low as 110p, as the company revealed a further decline in sales to primary and secondary schools - its core business. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell 8.5 per cent to Pounds 3.61m (Pounds 3.94m), reflecting a 6 per cent decline in sales to schools. This was exacerbated by a shift towards lower margin products and the impact of increased marketing costs. Nottingham's shares were issued in March at 155p, when the company stated in its prospectus: 'The directors expect that turnover and profit during the current financial year will benefit from a combination of the release of cash reserves by schools, the recently introduced marketing initiatives and new product lines.' The peak period for sales to schools is from late May to the end of July, and Nottingham has found that schools have increased their budget reserves. With the National Curriculum to be announced in January and implemented by September, Mr David Mansfield, chief executive, expects sales to improve by mid-1995, as reserves fall. He said, however, that profits in the second half were still unlikely to match 1993. Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 23.4m to Pounds 23.8m, with sales for the rehabilitation market rising from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 5.7m. Pre-school sales also increased. Operating expenses rose from Pounds 7.55m to Pounds 7.8m, reflecting the cost of new marketing initiatives, which have yet to feed through into increased sales. Nottingham is looking for acquisitions in related businesses, as gearing has fallen from 55 to 40 per cent since the flotation. An interim dividend of 1.84p is payable from earnings per share of 4.6p (5.12p).</p>

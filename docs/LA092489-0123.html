			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARMELITE ORDER BACKS AUSCHWITZ CONVENT MOVE  </P> <P> Leaders of the Roman Catholic Carmelite order said Saturday that they support  moving one of their convents from the former Auschwitz death camp in Poland as  Jewish groups have demanded.  </P> <P> Father Anthony Morello, general counselor of the Carmelite order, said he gave  his order's assurances it supported moving the convent away from the Nazi death  camp during a meeting with Sigmund Sternberg, head of the International Council  of Christians and Jews.  </P> <P> In his statement, Morello said he affirmed that all along the position of the  general of the order, Father Philip Sainz de Baranda, "has been that agreements  must be honored."  </P> <P> The statement did not say exactly when the meeting was held.  </P> <P> Sternberg helped moderate the Auschwitz dispute when he announced Friday that  the Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, had assured him in a letter that the  convent must be moved from the site of the death camp.  </P> <P> Catholic and Jewish leaders agreed in Geneva in 1987 to move the Carmelite  convent. The nuns were to be transferred to a nearby prayer center last  February, but the center was not erected and the nuns remain at a building  beside the Auschwitz camp.  </P> <P> Glemp and other Polish church leaders later opposed moving the nuns. In  defending the current site, Glemp made statements that some Jews viewed as  anti-Semitic.  </P> <P> Many Polish Catholics have supported keeping the convent where it is. They  argue that the nuns are not harming anyone and that many Polish Catholics were  killed at Auschwitz.  </P> <P> Jewish groups complained that the convent and its religious symbols are  offensive at a site where 2.5 million Jews were killed as part of Hitler's  campaign to exterminate European Jews during World War II. About 1.5 million of  Auschwitz's 4 million victims were Polish Christians and other non-Jews.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riding on recent positive developments in the  economy, the country's net foreign investments posted a  triple-digit growth of 289 percent to $677 million during the  first quarter from the previous quarter's $174 million,  preliminary figures obtained by Business World from the Bangko  Sentral ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] show.    This represents a 164.4 percent upsurge from the level in  the  comparative period last year, which was $256 million.    This development, in effect, reverses the negative trend  established last year when net foreign investments dipped by 17  percent when capital outflows outpaced inflows.    For the first time after a series of dumps, inflows during  the first quarter this year grew by 205.2 percent to $1.63  billion, compared with $534 million during the same period in  1993.    Against the previous quarter's level of $1.019 billion,  inflows posted a 59.96 percent increase.    The tremendous boost in inflows mainly came from portfolio  investments or investments in the stock market were registered  at $736 million, and new foreign investments were worth $556  million for the quarter.    Remittances, which combine personal income ($598 million)  and  withdrawals from 247/543 accounts ($589 million) also accounted  for the bulk of non-merchandise transactions.    On the other hand, outflows which are in the form of capital  withdrawals, capital for investments abroad, outward remittances  from bank inter-branch operations, and proceeds from portfolio  investments, amounted to $953 million. This represents a 243  percent increase from $278 million the same period last year,  and 12.78 percent hike from the fourth quarter's $108-million  level.    Total capital taken out of the country amounted to $534  million, while investments in foreign countries' stock markets  reached $369 million. These two factors comprised the bulk of  foreign investment outflows.    Bangko Sentral Gov. Gabriel C. Singson explained that the  continuous surge in foreign currency deposit unit (FCDU)  accounts could have been tapped by investors as a way of  returning to the country the substantial amount of capital flown  out during the Marcos years.    The surge in FCDU accounts persists even as there are heavy  withdrawals noted from such accounts which are, in turn, being  sold in the foreign exchange market in exchange for local  currency.    This helps buoy up the exchange value of the peso against  the  dollar.    Total outstanding FCDU balance as of April, he said, amounts  to $5.8 billion, including the $300 million worth of  non-resident accounts.    Total FCDU accounts in end 1993 amounted to around $5.4  billion to $5.5 billion in spite of the $2.962 billion in  withdrawals from such accounts.    Mr. Singson believes the FCDU accounts are being used as a  vehicle to bring back capital that investors had scurried out  during the crisis years in the eighties, which resulted in  massive capital flights.    Mr. Singson has recently been under fire from exporters for  allowing the peso value to further strengthen.</p>

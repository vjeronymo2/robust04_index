			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Lion eyes its share: A bumper crop of films at the US box office June is shaping up as a more than usually magical month for Walt Disney. The US entertainment giant got off to a nice start this week when a Saudi Arabian prince swept to the rescue of Euro Disney, its financially troubled French theme park associate. Desert themes were already much on the mind of Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney's chairman: the company has just released a low-budget sequel to its hit animated movie 'Aladdin' directly into the US video market - bypassing cinemas - and this follow-up, called the 'Return of Jafar', is proving a big hit. It is the first time Disney has made a full-length film purely for the video market, a sector dominated by cheap children's fare and exercise tapes with inspiring titles like 'Buns of Steel'. The gamble is paying off. Across the US, children under the age of 10 are pestering parents for a copy, and industry experts suggest 'Jafar' could become one of the 10 best-selling videos of all time. But Disney's biggest June success has yet to come: in the middle of the month it will release its latest full-length animated movie, 'The Lion King', the story of a young lion that becomes king of the jungle after fighting off a wicked uncle who kills his father. In other words, Bambi crossed with Hamlet in an exotic African setting. It has superb animation, music by British pop star Elton John, and a strong cast of actors' voices, which includes Jeremy Irons, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg. No wonder Hollywood is confidently predicting it will be the runaway hit film of the summer. That would be no small achievement, because the summer season is one of Hollywood's most important periods of the year, accounting for some 40 per cent of the annual American box office take. But this year the season - which began with last weekend's Memorial Day public holiday and ends with Labor Day in early September - is producing much more than the normal quotient of hysterical Hollywood nail-biting. There are two reasons. First, spring was unusually bad at the box office, with so few American-made hits that a low-budget British comedy, 'Four Weddings and a Funeral', briefly became the most popular movie in the country. Second, the studios are releasing an extraordinary number of films this summer - about 60 - and they cannot all be hits. Films that do not perform well over the weekend they are released, or during the subsequent weekend, will be quickly and cold-bloodedly yanked from cinema schedules. Hollywood will be hard-pressed to match the success of last summer, when 'Jurassic Park', the dinosaurs-run-amuck movie directed by Steven Spielberg and backed by Universal Studios, broke all box office records and powered the industry to an unprecedented Dollars 2.1bn in ticket sales. This paved the way for a record annual Dollars 5.1bn at the US box office. But at least half a dozen films could break through the Dollars 100m barrier for total US box office sales which traditionally marks a film as a blockbuster - and they will need to if the studios are to make a decent profit, since some of the most ambitious movies cost Dollars 40m to Dollars 50m to make. 'True Lies', a spy adventure from Rupert Murdoch's Fox group, starring muscle-man Arnold Schwarzenegger, is rumoured to have cost more than Dollars 100m. Schwarzenegger, reunited with the director who made his big hit 'Terminator 2', will be trying to put behind him one of last summer's biggest flops, 'Last Action Hero'. The season has got off to a strong start. 'The Flintstones', produced by Spielberg and distributed by Universal, took a record Dollars 37.5m at the box office over the Memorial Day weekend. That just topped the Dollars 37.03m taken in 1989 by 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'. The film has real actors playing characters from the 1950s cartoon series of the same name, with its Stone Age setting and signature cry of 'Yabba Dabba Doo'. The movie has been widely panned. Critics' barbed puns range from 'Yabba Dabba Don't', to 'Yabba Dabba Doo-Doo'. But it seems certain to maintain its strong run ('have legs', in the industry jargon), thanks to a huge tie-in marketing campaign, involving 1,000 products ranging from McDonald's hamburgers to Flintstone catapults. The success of the 'Flintstones' has overshadowed the strong start made by Warner Brothers' 'Maverick'. Starring heart-throb Mel Gibson, this is another in a long line of movies this year which revamp television series. The trend has critics wondering about the paucity of Hollywood's imagination. Others with hit potential include 'City Slickers 2', a follow-up to the success that comedian Billy Crystal had with the first modern-day western with this title; 'Forrest Gump', the story of a simpleton starring Tom Hanks; and 'Speed', about a bus rigged by a psychotic to explode if it slows below 50mph. But the season should still belong to 'The Lion King', which industry observers think could top Dollars 200m in total US box office receipts. With that and the Saudi rescue under his belt, Mr Eisner might be heard muttering 'Hakuna Matata', the Swahili motto adopted in the film by the would-be lion king. It means 'no worries'.</p>

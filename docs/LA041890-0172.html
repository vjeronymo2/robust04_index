			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORANGE COUNTY'S HEAD LIBRARIAN COMES TO  L.A.  </P> <P> Orange County's head librarian, who earned a reputation for cultivating  multi-ethnic library services for a changing public, has been selected as Los  Angeles' city librarian.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Martinez Smith, 47, is the first Latino to direct the city's  63-branch system.  </P> <P> She was appointed to the position, with its $105,000 annual salary, after a  nationwide search to replace Wyman Jones, who resigned to go into publishing.  </P> <P> "I think the library has an opportunity to become a haven, a beacon for such a  multicultural, diverse community," she said.  </P> <P> During her 11 years in Orange County, Smith oversaw construction of eight new  branch libraries in a system whose cardholders numbered 58% of the population.  Orange County operates 27 library branches with a budget of over $24 million.  L.A.'s system has a budget of $35 million and a cardholder rate of about 20%.  </P> <P> Smith said one of her chief tasks will be supervising the re-emergence of the  Central Library, ravaged by arson fires in 1986. "I'm sure there's going to be  some (fiscal) constraints, but I think the city and the populace are behind the  new library and community services," she said.  </P></p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Bundesbank call to cut public spending GERMANY must act quickly to cut public spending or risk even greater strains on the economy, a leading member of the Bundesbank policy-making council warned yesterday, The necessary cuts would be hard to implement, given that the German people had become used to ever-increasing public spending, Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, told industrialists in Wurzburg. But cuts were essential in view of German reunification costs and the size of public-sector debt. Postponement would add to the economic costs of measures which were ultimately unavoidable. His comments come as the government is engaged in talks with unions and employers over a 'solidarity pact' designed to help Germany overcome the current downturn. Within the next few week, it must also find DM13bn (Pounds 5.3bn) spending cuts as part of a supplementary budget. Analysts said Mr Issing's speech was designed to show further, significant interest rate cuts were not a foregone conclusion after last week's 15 basis-point cut in short-term money market rates. The persistence of inflation meant more demands were being made on the German economy than it could meet, Mr Issing added. Wage costs had risen out of line with productivity. The 9.5 per cent rise in unit labour costs over the past two years had left an unmistakable mark on prices.</p>

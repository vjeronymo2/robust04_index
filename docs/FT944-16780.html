			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / BR admits to job cuts at offshoot Unions expect to be told next week that more than 1,500 white-collar workers will lose their jobs at British Rail Infrastructure Services over the next six months as the organisation is split into 20 separate companies prior to privatisation. British Rail yesterday admitted there would be job losses but refused to confirm the figure of 1,500. Unions believe the main victims will be managerial and administrative staff. BRIS, which employs 30,000, is subcontracted by Railtrack to maintain track and signalling work.</p>

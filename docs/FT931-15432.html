			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Cut in whisky intake will restore balance - The implications of the reorganisation at United Distillers SINCE Guinness bought Distillers in 1986, it has devoted much of its energy to reorganising the distribution and marketing of Scotch whisky. With great success. Brands such as Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, White Horse and Haig, which represent 35 per cent of the Scotch whisky market, have been pushed up-market with redesigned packaging, new-look advertising and hefty price increases. Guinness's whisky arm, United Distillers, now handles the distribution of more than 90 per cent of its products compared with 20 per cent six years ago. Profits have more than doubled as a result from Pounds 357m to Pounds 749m. Now, though, with the industry worrying about a return of the 1970s' whisky glut, Guinness is switching its management emphasis to rationalising production. Yesterday Mr Tony Greener, Guinness chairman and chief executive, announced 700 job cuts, the closure of five Scottish distilleries, and Pounds 100m of investment in modernising whisky production facilities in the next three years. Overall world production of Scotch grew slightly last year, but demand fell in the UK and in other important markets such as the US and Japan. Mr Alan Gray, industry analyst at Charterhouse Tilney, the securities house, estimates that the industry cut production of malt whisky last year by 15 per cent and reduced grain whisky output by 3 to 5 per cent. 'I believe further cuts are needed this year - probably 10 to 12 per cent in malt and 7.5 per cent in grain - to restore the balance between supply and demand in 1994,' he says. The closure of UD's four malt distilleries - at Pittyvaich, Balmenach, Rosebank and Bladnoch - will take out about 9 per cent of UD's capacity and 2.5 per cent of industry production. Closing the grain distillery at Cambus will reduce UD's capacity by 18 per cent and that of the industry by about 7 per cent. The group's growth has slowed dramatically in the past 12 months under the impact of recession, leading several analysts to suggest that progress from now on would be more pedestrian. While it remains committed to its marketing strategy, adverse trading conditions have increased the pressure on the group to cut costs - not least to free more resources for its expensive marketing programme. Together with the distillery closures and their conversion into warehouses or museums, bottling and packaging operations are to be concentrated in three centres - Glasgow, Kilmarnock and Leven - reducing the group's bottling lines from 100 to 68. Operations at Perth will cease next year with the loss of 300 jobs; the Broxburn and Leith plants will be closed in 1995 with the loss of another 230 jobs. Efforts will be made to minimise the impact of unemployment through voluntary redundancy, early retirement and natural employment turnover. Mr Greener said: 'The investment in new technology requires significant reorganisation to achieve improved productivity, efficiency and profitability. These moves will further equip us to take advantages of the opportunities through the 1990s and beyond.' While yesterday's announcement focused on the Scotch whisky industry, Guinness also took steps to accelerate productivity improvements in its Cruz Campo brewing operations in Spain. The Pounds 533m acquisition of Cruz Campo in 1990, followed by that of Union Cervecera, has not brought the expected rapid rewards. One of Europe's fastest-growing beer markets at the time of the takeover, Spanish consumption declined 5 per cent last year in spite of tourist attractions such as the Olympic Games and Expo 92. A recent doubling of the excise tax on beer, increasing the retail price by about 20 per cent, is expected to depress demand further. Cruz Campo, since the integration of Union Cervecera, has increased its market share from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, but regards further productivity improvements as urgent. Though one brewery has been closed, further rationalisation of production has been restricted by the costs of distributing beer from centralised plants. The group plans to accelerate the reduction of people employed at its nine breweries but seems unlikely to close any of the plants.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GUINESS MAKES CHANGES IN SCOTLAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BLENDING &amp;                           MALT DISTILLERS PACKAGING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leith                                Pittyvaich  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All 40 jobs to go                    Mothballed                                      employs 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Perth                                Balmenach  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All 300 jobs to go                   Converting to warehousing                                      employs 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Broxburn                             Rosebank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 190 jobs to go                       Mothballed (of 250)                             employs 15  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Bladnoch  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      Converting to warehousing &amp;                                      heritage centre                                      employs 14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GRAIN DISTILLER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cambus  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Converting to warehousing &amp; filling plant 144 jobs to go (of 194)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Guinness  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

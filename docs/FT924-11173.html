			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Gencor falls 10% in year of weak commodity prices GENCOR, South Africa's second-largest mining house, yesterday announced a 10 per cent fall in attributable profits for the year to the end of August. The results reflect weak international commodity markets, which particularly affected Gencor's mining operations, where attributable profits fell by 21.5 per cent. Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, said that considering the difficult commercial environment, the group had done well to limit the fall in underlying operating profits - excluding one-off items - to 1 per cent, down to R1.17bn (Dollars 399m). Taking into account one-off items, transaction surpluses and an increase in the number of shares issued following a R2bn rights issue in February, total attributable profits fell by 10 per cent to R1.26bn from R1.40bn and earnings per share by 17 per cent to 98.8 cents from 119.5 cents. The dividend was increased to 45 cents per share from 43 cents. A divisional breakdown of contribution to attributable profits shows that the mining, metals and minerals arm, Genmin, contributed R391m, or 32 per cent; Sappi, the forest products group, R189m, or 15 per cent; Malbak, the industrial arm, R131m, or 10 per cent; Engen, the energy group, R259m, or 20 per cent; and investment arm Genbel, and other investments, R317m, or 25 per cent. Mr Gilbertson said that with few exceptions the average export prices received were well down on the levels in the previous year. The limited depreciation of the rand against the dollar was not sufficient to offset the effects of domestic inflation. He said decisions on the two large capital projects the group has on the drawing board - the R6.7bn Alusaf aluminium smelter project and the R2.5bn Columbus stainless steel joint venture - were 'imminent'. He was confident of a 'fair degree' of local institutional support for Alusaf, which is seeking to raise R1.2bn. Mr Gilbertson confirmed that unbundling of Gencor remained a 'distinct possibility', but it was on hold pending clarification of issues such as marketable securities tax.</p>

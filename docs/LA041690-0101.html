Several of the relatives were crying as they kissed the boy or called,  "Hi, Jesse! Hi, Jesse!"  </P> <P> Although they said the boy could not have walked from Sunland to Panorama City,  police stopped short of calling the boy's disappearance a kidnaping. Police  said the boy is too young to tell them what happened.  </P></p>

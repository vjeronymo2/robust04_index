			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Marines take control of Somali capital US Marines search a Somali citizen yesterday as part of their operation to gain control of Mogadishu, the devastated capital. More than 1,300 Marines, wearing desert camouflage and black face paint, swept through the city, securing the airport and port as well as regaining control of the abandoned US embassy compound. The operation was completed without any major confrontations, although one UN aid worker was shot and wounded on the airport road by unidentified gunmen. The US relief effort, the largest ever undertaken in Africa, aims to restore order to starvation-struck Somalia, which has fallen into a state of anarchy. Many Somalis were stunned by the size and intensity of the US operation. Report, Page 20</p>

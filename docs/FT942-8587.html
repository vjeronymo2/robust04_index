			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow further improves on Fed's action Wall Street US share prices improved yesterday as the welcome response to the Federal Reserve's bold move to tighter money carried over into a second trading session, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 12.28 higher at 3,732.89, after pulling out of a modest mid-morning decline, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.32 at 453.69. Advances outnumbered falls by 1,632 to 664 after heavy volume of 337.7m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.92 up at 434.90. A solid rebound by slumping technology stocks boosted the Nasdaq composite by 10.37 to 721.89. In spite of a 49-point advance by the Dow industrials in the previous session, the market was spared a round of widespread profit-taking. In early activity, most issues held close to their opening values as investors sifted through the implications of the Fed's decision on Tuesday to lift two short-term interest rates. The central bank's move encouraged the rally in equities because it was accompanied by an announcement suggesting that the Fed would suspend a series of monthly tightenings which began in early February. The policy shift had set off a decline of more than 9 per cent in share prices. One reason stocks failed to make further headway yesterday morning was a modest decline by the benchmark 30-year government securities stock. Treasury investors were somewhat concerned by the dollar's failure to respond positively to Tuesday's rate increases. Its continued weakness raised the possibility that the Fed may have little choice but to take further action to prop up the currency. But in the equity markets, a late wave of program-guided buying was enough to offset weakness in a few pivotal stocks depressing the Dow for much of the day. British Steel ended Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 18 1/8, AT&amp;T added Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55 1/4 and Sears rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 1/8. Chevron closed Dollars 1 3/4 down at Dollars 86 3/8 after Dean Witter Reynolds trimmed its second-quarter earnings estimate for the company by 10 cents to Dollars 1.25 a share. The securities house said the same weakness in refining and marketing which was hurting Chevron could affect other energy groups. Financial issues were actively traded following Tuesday's move by many commercial banking groups to raise their prime lending rates in response to the Fed's policy adjustment. Citicorp put on Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 5/8 in heavy trade of 3.3m shares. BankAmerica was Dollars 1 1/8 better at Dollars 49. In technology, International Business Machines was near the top of the NYSE's most active list. The stock dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 on reports that Compaq Computers had become Europe's leading computer marketer. Compaq jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 104 5/8 . The Nasdaq, a laggard in Tuesday's general advance, played catch-up yesterday, largely because of a rebound by software stocks which were hit hard in the previous session. Lotus Development recovered Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 and Wellfleet gained Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 30 5/8.</p>

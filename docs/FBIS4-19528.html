			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "State Protection Confirms: PKK </F> Blackmails Asylum-Seekers"]    [Text] Berlin -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has  warned against consequences for the German-Turkish relations if  the Turks are indeed using German weapons in their fight against  Kurds. Kinkel said the reports and documents presented by human  rights groups will be evaluated. However, it will probably be  difficult to prove the allegations.    Saxony's Interior Minister Heinz Eggert also threatened  consequences if it turns out that reports about the arrest and  torture of the Kurdish couple Ramazan and Zubeyde Cetin, who  were deported to Turkey on 6 April, prove true. Lothar Hermes,  spokesman of the Saxon Refugee Council, claims that he spoke  with the Cetins on the telephone on Friday [15 April] and they  told him about having been mistreated. Eggert expressed "most  serious doubts" about such reports. If the allegations are  confirmed, "then the entire discussion about the Kurds in  Germany must be held in a new way."    The Berlin State Protection has confirmed reports by the  Baden-Wuerttemberg Interior Ministry that the Workers Party of  Kurdistan (PKK) is blackmailing asylum-seekers. A spokesman  said the PKK intends to extort 20 million German marks from  Kurds and Turks in Germany in 1994.    In the meantime, 210 ground-to-air missiles for Turkey were  loaded on the freighter Kayseri near Stadersand on the Lower  Elbe on Saturday. The loading was originally expected to take  place in the free port of Hamburg. Protests occurred there,  however.</p>

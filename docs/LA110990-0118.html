			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> GRAY SAYS HE'S READY TO PLAY  </P> <P> Cornerback Jerry Gray, who was held out of last Sunday's game because of a sore  left knee, practiced again Thursday and said he did not plan to stay on the  sideline against the New York Giants.  </P> <P> "I'll play Sunday -- I'll play Sunday, believe me," Gray said.  </P> <P> "What happened is that I had a lot of fluid on my knee going into last week.  This week, I have little to none."  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson, however, wasn't so sure about Gray's availability. "We're  not exactly sure what to do, to be honest with you," Robinson said. "It's not  one of those things that's an obvious decision."  </P> <P> Although a great deal of attention has been focused on the possibility of an  11-0 Giant team playing an 11-0 San Francisco 49er team in their Candlestick  Park matchup on Monday night, Dec. 3, New York Coach Bill Parcells doesn't want  to hear anything about it.  </P> <P> "There's no mention of the 49er game around here," Parcells said. "The only  people who have said anything about that are the newspapers. I can assure you  that our players are paying absolutely zero attention to the 49ers." TIM  KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

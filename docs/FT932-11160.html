			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bangkok, Manila feature in Pacific Rim region PHILIPPINE shares remained at all-time highs, although many markets were lower elsewhere. Tokyo remained closed for the Golden Week holiday. MANILA continued in record territory, with the market taking its lead from PLDT's overnight gain on Wall Street. The composite index touched an all-time intraday peak of 1,645.76 in late dealing before easing to end 21.06 up at a record 1,636.52. A surge in foreign buying and falling interest rates have sparked the boom, with investors convinced that strong economic growth will fuel a fresh bull run. The index has climbed 299 points, or 18.27 per cent, since February 1. BANGKOK plunged across the board, led by losses in finance and bank shares as investors were unnerved by a deputy minister's comment over the weekend that a minister, identified only as 'Mr T', might be involved in share price manipulation. The SET index fell 17.19, or 2 per cent, to 828.10 in thin turnover of Bt2.76bn. HONG KONG saw waves of selected bargain hunting emerge in the afternoon, reversing an early easier trend. The Hang Seng index closed 37.18 higher at 6,827.29 in turnover of HKDollars 3.5bn, after Monday's HKDollars 3.2bn. The rebound was mainly due to active bargain hunting in Cheung Kong and Hutchison Whampoa on rumours that Chinese companies were active buyers. The shares rose 40 cents each to HKDollars 26.50 and HKDollars 19.60 respectively. NEW ZEALAND lost a hefty 1.9 per cent in large volume amid rumoured changes to the Morgan Stanley Capital International index and some suspected overseas programme-linked selling. The NZSE-40 index shed 30.23 to 1,564.12. Falls were seen across a wide front. Among the recently favoured forestry stocks, Carter Holt Harvey relinquished 12 cents to NZDollars 2.90 and Fletcher Challenge weakened 14 cents to NZDollars 2.60. TAIWAN came in for late profit-taking which left the market lower after sluggish trade. The weighted index, which opened slightly ahead, finished a net 25.62 down at 4,448.18 in thin turnover of TDollars 25.5bn. Financials were strong in early trade after some banks reported good April profit figures, but investors soon sold to take quick profits. AUSTRALIA edged slightly lower after the release of worse than expected data showing a March current account deficit of ADollars 2.1bn, seasonally adjusted, after ADollars 861m in February. The All Ordinaries index ended 0.2 off at 1,664.3 in light turnover of ADollars 240.9m. COLOMBO continued its downward trend, although analysts noted that the market had been declining even before the assassination of President Ranasinghe Premadasa on Saturday. The all-share index finished 3.16 easier at 532.60 in turnover that rose to Rp13.9m from Monday's Rp12.4m. KUALA LUMPUR saw big losses in several blue chip stocks help to drag the composite index down 11.29, or 1.6 per cent, to 706.08. A rumour about the health of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad depressed sentiment. Telekom fell 70 cents to MDollars 14.70, Genting shed 30 cents to MDollars 15.90 and Leader lost 40 cents to MDollars 18.60. SINGAPORE fell broadly on continuous profit-taking in blue chips, but brokers welcomed the correction, saying it was much needed. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 14.26 to 1,776.64. Foreign shares of national carrier SIA closed 30 cents cheaper at SDollars 9.20. Acma Industries, under profit-taking pressure after the highs seen following a major Russian supply deal, has recovered in the last two days. It rose 20 cents to SDollars 6.35. SEOUL closed slightly firmer in mixed trade after profit-taking jostled with a mild rebound in blue chip manufacturers and some financial shares. The composite index put on 1.24 at 719.83 . News that South Korea's trade deficit in April eased to Dollars 94m from a Dollars 470m shortfall a year earlier boosted steel and semiconductor exporters. JAKARTA was little changed after selective profit-taking in slow trade. The official index firmed 0.22 to 313.91 after Monday's slight decline. Jakarta International Hotel moved forward Rp150 to Rp8,200 on news of a Dollars 250m hotel project in a joint venture with Conrad Hotels, a subsidiary of Hilton Hotels.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Peterborough town project approved A 2000-acre new-town project on the outskirts of Peterborough has won planning permission. Most of the scheme, to be developed by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is planned for derelict land formerly used to extract brick clay. The developers say Peterborough Southern Township will be the largest private-sector new town for more than 30 years. The project, costing an estimated Pounds 500m, will comprise 5,200 houses, a retail centre, and commercial and industrial land. Infrastructure work is expected to start soon. The scheme should be completed by 2004. The plans for the Peterborough Southern Township have been under consideration for more than seven years. The scheme won outline planning consent in September 1991. Final consent was granted this week after agreement was reached on planning conditions.</p>

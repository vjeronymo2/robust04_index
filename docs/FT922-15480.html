			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: PosGold wins investor support for ACM deal POSEIDON Gold (PosGold), part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, looks set to achieve one of two attempted mergers after shareholders in ACM Gold voted in favour by a narrow margin. The merger was approved by a margin of less than 1 per cent of investors, reflecting dissatisfaction among some small shareholders about the terms offered by PosGold. However, the vote means Mr de Crespigny has won approval for the more important element of his plans to turn PosGold into Australia's third largest gold producer, with annual production of more than 700,000 ounces. The plan suffered a setback when shareholders in Mount Leyshon Gold Mines voted for a merger with PosGold, but by an insufficient margin to satisfy the company's articles of association. The merger proposal is part of a simplification of the Normandy Poseidon group structure. It would also give PosGold direct control of Mount Leyshon and ACM Gold assets. ACM Gold is 40 per cent owned by Normandy Poseidon following a recent joint takeover of Australian Consolidated Minerals with Western Mining Corporation. Mount Leyshon is 49 per cent owned by PosGold. Mr de Crespigny is expected to offer improved terms to Mount Leyshon shareholders, some of whom have indicated they would accept an offer which provided a premium for control. If the two deals go through, PosGold will have a strong presence in three of Australia's biggest gold provinces - Kalgoorlie, Tennant Creek and Charters Towers.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MASS KILLER SALCIDO SEIZED AT A ROADBLOCK IN MEXICO;  </P> <P> PICKED UP NEAR HIS HOMETOWN  </P> <P> California winery worker Ramon Salcido, wanted in a bloody rampage that left  seven people dead, including his wife and two of his baby daughters, was  arrested today at a roadblock in northwestern Mexico, officials said.  </P> <P> "He was arrested before dawn this morning in a surprise roadblock set up by  agents fighting the illicit drug trade," said Vicente Mendoza, a spokesman for  the attorney general's office.  </P> <P> Salcido was picked up just outside Guasave, a village near Los Mochis, his  hometown in Sinaloa state about 850 miles northwest of Mexico City, Mendoza  said.  </P> <P> Mendoza said Salcido, a Mexican national, will be flown to Mexico City later  today for an extradition hearing.  </P> <P> "He has been arrested at the request of U.S. authorities who have asked for his  extradition. We are bringing him to Mexico City," Mendoza said, adding that  Salcido is in the custody of the Federal Judicial Police, a branch of the  attorney general's office.  </P> <P> Salcido was the object of one of the biggest manhunts in California history.  The FBI joined the search on Monday.  </P> <P> He was arrested the same day that services were being held in the Sonoma County  wine country town of Glen Ellen, Calif., for some of the six members of  Salcido's family who were killed.  </P> <P> About 300 people attended a memorial service Tuesday for another of the  victims, Tracy Toovey.  </P> <P> Salcido, 28, was a forklift operator who worked with Toovey at the Grand Cru  winery.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cocaine-Fueled Night  </P> <P> Salcido's wife, mother-in-law, two young sisters-in-law and Toovey were  butchered, shot to death or both on April 15. The next day, three of Salcido's  daughters were found with their throats cut, two of them dead.  </P> <P> The survivor, 3-year-old Carmina, is recovering in Petaluma Valley Hospital.  She told investigators that her father cut her and her sisters.  </P> <P> Salcido's friends told the San Francisco Examiner that he had a frenzied,  cocaine-fueled night of drinking and dancing before the killings.  </P> <P> "He party, party, party all the time -- run around all night," the newspaper  quoted one unidentified person as saying. "He drink everything -- beer, wine,  tequila."  </P> <P> Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen said his detectives are not sure what  touched off Salcido. It was known that earlier Salcido had been served with a  court order demanding payment of more than $5,000 in past-due child support  payments for a child by another woman, and friends said this had upset him.  </P> <P> It was also known that he was having troubles with his slain second wife,  Angela, who reportedly wanted an annulment. And acquaintances said he was very  jealous of her.  </P> <P> Salcido's mother, Valentino Bojorquez Armendariz, told The Times on Tuesday  that her son called her last Friday and told her, "Mama, this is last time you  will hear my voice."  </P> <P> Bojorquez said her eldest son was sobbing in the brief phone call to her home  in Los Mochis. She said her memory of the conversation wasn't clear, but she  remembered that Salcido said, "I have problems and I'm going to kill myself,"  or "I have problems and they're going to kill me."  </P> <P> He then hung up, and Bojorquez said she had not heard from him since.  </P></p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / London's economy 'reviving steadily' London's economy is reviving steadily, with strong improvements in business confidence and domestic and export trade, according to a report published yesterday. But the report suggests that the capital's problems are not over. According to the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which interviewed 300 London companies employing 250,000 people, jobs will continue to be shed in the early part of this year, particularly in the service sector. The survey, carried out in the fourth quarter of last year, found that investment plans had been revised sharply upwards for the next 12 months with a particular improvement in manufacturing exports. The chamber says the survey has strengthened hopes for a sustained recovery in the capital. It says London's financial services sector continued to grow, with new jobs created. Business confidence measured in terms of expected profits remains high for service companies, with the second highest figure recorded since 1988. Manufacturing shows a similar situation. The chamber says that while the outlook for jobs remains uncertain, the slowdown in redundancies has continued. Quarterly Economic Report and Survey. London Chamber of Commerce, 33 Queen Street, London, EC4R 1AP. Pounds 12 to members, Pounds 18 to non-members.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Letter: A weighty solution to the problem of red tape Sir, While Charles Batchelor's article on red tape (Growing Business, December 15) highlights the burden that government bureaucracy places on small businesses, it misses one crucial point - nobody knows precisely how big the problem is, or whether the situation is improving or worsening. To combat this ignorance, an immediate survey should be carried out to assess the precise costs of understanding and complying with the various regulations. To gain an accurate picture, it will be essential for all businesses to provide information. However, if the task is designated to one of the more customer-oriented government departments, the necessary questionnaire would run to no more than, say, 50 pages (plus notes, of course) and would take a maximum of two days for company directors to complete.

			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Yeltsin row may scare off IMF Growing hostility between the Russian government and President Boris Yeltsin is threatening to derail ambitious plans by the International Monetary Fund to support the Russian economy next year. Attempts by the president's Security Council to blame - and possibly remove from office - important economic reformers following an inquiry into the causes of the rouble's collapse last month may disincline the Fund to make up to Dollars 14bn (Pounds 8.5bn) available to Moscow next year. Observers believe Mr Yeltsin is now strongly opposed to government plans to peg the currency and bring down inflation to 1 per cent a month next year. The Fund supports the plan and it has latterly attracted the approval of the Group of Seven nations. The struggle burst into the open yesterday when Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, said he would not work with candidates now being considered for the post of finance minister who would be drawn from the president's office. He said the tough 1995 budget, backed by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, was a 'unique opportunity' to break the cycle of high inflation which has dogged Russian reform for three years. The government is preparing a letter of intent which will be the basis on which the IMF would advance loans of up to Dollars 14bn next year to fund the budget deficit and to support the rouble if and when it is pegged to the dollar. Though differences remain between the IMF and the government - on the rate at which the rouble will be pegged and on whether the stabilisation fund will be lodged with the government or retained under the control of the IMF - the two sides agree on the basic parameters of the budget and on the need for rapid action. However, opponents of the budget, including Mr Alexander Livshits, an economic adviser to Mr Yeltsin, have said they do not believe the economy can support, or the parliament agree to, such a tough policy - and argue for a target monthly inflation rate of 5 per cent next year, an option the government considered and rejected in September. Such a target would be highly unlikely to attract IMF or G7 support The opponents have seized the opportunity afforded by the report of the Security Council's commission - completed this week but unpublished - on the events surrounding 'Black Tuesday' on October 11, when the rouble lost a quarter of its value in one day. The report blames the fall on Mr Shokhin, together with the former minister of the economy, Mr Sergei Dubynin, and former central bank governor Mr Victor Gerashchenko. Both Mr Dubynin and Mr Gerashchenko resigned last month, and Mr Yeltsin yesterday fired Mr Victor Krunya, director of the Federal Currency and Export Control Service, for his part in the affair. Mr Shokhin, as the senior remaining economic minister, is now in a precarious position, as is the budget and the reform strategy. G7 officials believe the budget offers a last chance to stabilise the rouble and bring down inflation to allow badly needed domestic and foreign investment.</p>

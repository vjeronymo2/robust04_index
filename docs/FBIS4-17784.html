			<p>BFN     [Text] As has already been reported, the Armenian  Government has launched an initiative proposing the introduction  of a new single currency within the framework of the economic  union of the CIS countries, similar to the EU's ECU [European  currency unit].    With this in mind, Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan  sent letters to the prime ministers of the CIS countries today,  noting that the existence of the decades of unified system over  the territory of the former Soviet Union is making the  independent economic development of the CIS countries impossible  without painful consequences.    The Armenian prime minister reminded his CIS colleagues that  since the introduction of the national currencies in these  countries, the financial transactions between them has been  considerably difficult. The Russian ruble has become the means  of payment for any trade transaction with the result that these  states are appealing to Russia for additional credits to settle  accounts between them. In this way, they are contributing to  the Russian budget deficit. In its turn, the devaluation of the  Russian ruble is causing even further devaluation of the  national currencies.    The Armenian Government sees the mitigation of the financial  difficulties in the wider use of the national currencies and  therefore proposes the creation of a single CIS currency to  settle the mutual accounts through a CIS interstate bank. This  will broaden the opportunities of using the national currencies,  assist in their stabilization, and establish exchange rates  between them as eventually the interstate obligations will be  regulated through the national currencies. This will make it  possible to spare the CIS countries from accruing debts to  Russia, alleviate Russia's credit problems, and contribute to  the stabilization of the Russian ruble.    In the opinion of the Armenian Government, the creation of  an  interstate bank will be beneficial for all the CIS countries.  Therefore, Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan has called on all his  colleagues to defend the idea of the creation of such a bank.    In his letter, Grant Bagratyan also detailed his views on  how  to set up the bank and form its initial capital.</p>

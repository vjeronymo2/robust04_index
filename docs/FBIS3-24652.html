			<p>SUMMARY                                  Japanese press reporting and statements in the press by senior  Japanese officials suggest that Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is  coming to Washington in advance of the 11 February summit with no  immediate plans to make concessions on the issue of setting  objective criteria to assess Japan's trade performance.  Tokyo  may in fact be calculating that by continuing to take a hard line  at this point, it will force the United States to make  concessions.  It may also hope that its recent announcement of  its economic stimulus package and plans for a tax cut will  satisfy to some extent U.S. demands that Tokyo take steps to  reduce its huge trade surplus.                              END SUMMARY      Senior Japanese political and government leaders who commented to  the press on Foreign Minister Hata's last-minute trip to  Washington to try to break the impasse in the stalled U.S.-Japan  framework talks all stressed that the Japanese Government had no  intention of making concessions on the issue of setting objective  criteria.  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reportedly told a  news conference on 9 February that Japan would find it  "impossible" to accept objective criteria (Kyodo, 9 February).  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, in announcing Hata's  trip, stated that Hata would conduct negotiations in Washington  in line with Tokyo's "basic stance" that "it is very difficult to  accept the proposal for numerical targets," according to a 9  February Kyodo report.   Kyodo on 9 February also quoted an  unnamed government source as stating that Tokyo would continue to  reject any calls to establish objective criteria, and hinted that  Japan would consider taking the case to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade if the United States were to invoke sanctions.  Hata himself was a bit less categorical on the objective criteria  issue, noting only that he would "discuss the matter keeping in  mind the potential implications," according to another 9 February  Kyodo report.      Both Hata and the unnamed government source quoted by Kyodo also  alluded to a concern that may in part be driving the Japanese  resistance to objective criteria, namely, that other countries-  -particularly, in the near term, the European Union--that have  trade deficits with Japan might use any U.S.-Japan agreement  incorporating objective criteria to press for criteria to assess  Japan's trade performance with regard to them.  Hata reportedly  told the press before leaving for Washington that among the  issues he would consider in his negotiations would be "what the  implications could be internationally" (Kyodo, 9 January).  The  unnamed government source was quoted by Kyodo as stating that any  concessions by Japan on objective criteria would have an impact  not only on U.S.-Japan relations, but also on other countries  throughout the world.      Such statements have recently marked the commentary of other  Japanese officials and businessmen on the issue of objective  criteria.  For example, on 18 January Asahi Shimbun quoted an  unnamed senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) official as stating that "the European Union and Asian  nations are paying much attention to how Japan handles trade  issues with the United States" and warning that Tokyo must  therefore "not make unnecessary concessions."  Similarly, in an  interview in the 2 February Mainichi Shimbun, Yutaka Kume,  Chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association and  Chairman of Nissan Motor Corporation, also warned that if Japan  were to agree to extend the voluntary plan to purchase U.S.-made  auto parts announced during former President Bush's trip to Tokyo  in January 1992, "I do not think the European Union will remain  indifferent."      Expectation of U.S. Concessions      Some officials in Tokyo may anticipate that by continuing to take  a hard line, the Japanese Government will force the United States  to make concessions in order to achieve an agreement at the talks  before the summit between President Clinton and Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa.  The 5 February Mainichi Shimbun quoted an  unidentified source close to the framework negotiations as  stating that during his recent trip to Tokyo, U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor indicated that the United States  would not stick to its "conventional calls" for setting objective  criteria--a move which the source apparently interpreted as a  prospective U.S. concession.  Another report in the same edition  of Mainichi Shimbun quoted members of the Japanese negotiating  team as arguing that the United States would "withdraw its  demands in the end because Japan is doing its best" and as  warning that the "possibility of cooperation will expand only if  the United States withdraws its demands on numerical targets."      Stress on Economic Stimulus   Some officials may also hope that the package of economic  stimulus measures that Tokyo has just announced, including a 53  billion dollar tax cut, will satisfy Washington's demands that  Tokyo take steps to help promote imports and reduce its trade  surplus.  The 8 February Mainichi Shimbun quoted an unnamed  senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official as predicting  that "the atmosphere surrounding the ongoing economic framework  talks will be greatly changed" depending on the way Japan  presented its macroeconomic policies, including the stimulus  package, at the summit.  Before his departure for Washington,  Foreign Minister Hata told reporters that one of the main goals  of his discussions with U.S. officials would be to clear up a  "lack of understanding" in the U.S. Government about the full  extent of the Hosokawa government's efforts to stimulate the  Japanese economy and increase imports of foreign goods (Kyodo, 9  February).      Outlook      In his talks in Washington, Hata will probably continue to resist  the concept of objective criteria in any form that might be  interpreted in the future as specific targets to which Washington  would attempt to hold the Japanese Government.  One factor that  might encourage him to make some limited concessions, however,  will be the pressure on Prime Minister Hosokawa to be able to  portray his 11 February summit with President Clinton as  successful.  Hosokawa has come in for considerable criticism in  Tokyo--from within the ruling coalition, from the opposition  parties, and from the media, which has until recently generally  been sympathetic to him--for his bungling of his initial  announcement on 2 February of a large tax cut and the delayed  imposition of a 7 percent national welfare tax.  A weak  performance at the summit--or any suggestion that it failed in  some major respect--would almost certainly open him up to further  domestic criticism of his leadership.   (AUTHOR:  BOUNDS.

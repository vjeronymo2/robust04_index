			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Storehouse sees year of progress Sales at Storehouse, the BhS and Mothercare retail chain, were 5 per cent ahead in the first quarter, Mr Ian Hay Davison, the chairman, told the annual meeting. Costs remained under control, he said, and operating profits were ahead of the same period last year. Although it was too early for a profit forecast, he was confident the year would be one of 'significant progress'. For the year to April 2 1994 Storehouse reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 62.4m (Pounds 15.2m).</p>

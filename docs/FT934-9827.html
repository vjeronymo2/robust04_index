			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: When worker turns poacher - Robert Rice explains the confusion over restrictions on ex-employees Restrictions imposed by businesses on employees, preventing them from poaching clients and staff after they have left the company, have produced a steady stream of court battles. But two recent, conflicting decisions by the Court of Appeal have thrown this area of the law into confusion. In October last year, the court gave a judgment in J A Mont (UK) v Mills that appeared to tighten further the accepted approach to interpreting restrictive covenants. The court ruled that where a restrictive covenant imposed by an employer on an ex-employee was clearly too wide and was therefore unenforceable as an unreasonable restraint of trade, the court would not attempt to find within it some narrower and more reasonable restriction that could be enforced. But in August this year, in the case of Hanover Insurance Brokers v Shapiro and others, a differently constituted court appeared to cast doubt on what it called the 'unsympathetic approach' adopted by the court in the Mont case. On this occasion, the judges indicated there were circumstances where the court could legitimately look behind what appeared on the surface to be an unenforceable and unreasonable restraint, to find the true intention of the parties. The court also raised questions over the enforceability of clauses that seek to prevent the poaching of staff by ex-employees, in the most detailed treatment of the subject by the courts since 1959. While the HIB case does not create a precedent, it does make the law of restraint of trade less certain. According to Mr Peter Frost of Herbert Smith, HIB's solicitors, lawyers had always advised their corporate clients that restraint clauses had to be drafted very carefully, because any ambiguity would be interpreted by the court in the employee's favour. After the HIB decision, that may no longer be the case. In particular, where the clause has been inexpertly drafted, the courts may now be prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the employer. The HIB case concerned four ex-employees: Mr Monty Shapiro, the chairman and a consultant, Mr Paul Anscombe, managing director, Mr Peter Rose, a director, and Mr David Knowles, a manager. Each of the defendants had a service agreement with HIB, which contained provisions restricting their activities for 12 months after the termination of their employment. The action was brought by HIB to enforce those restrictions. The four defendants were trying to carry on a business of insurance broking through another company. Although the service agreements were not identical, they were broadly similar. The thrust of the restraints was that, for 12 months after leaving HIB, the four men should not canvass, solicit or endeavour to take away from the company the business of any of its customers or clients who had been customers or clients in the 12 months prior to their leaving. They were also banned for 12 months from poaching any of HIB's staff. HIB obtained an ex parte injunction, which the defendants unsuccessfully attempted to have set aside, first in the High Court and then in the Court of Appeal. The High Court did, however, reject the injunction insofar as it related to poaching HIB staff, and so the Court of Appeal also had to deal with a cross-appeal by HIB, which sought to have the restriction on poaching staff reinstated. The issue of the proper approach to the construction of restrictive covenants arose in relation to the appeal by Mr Rose and Mr Knowles. They had argued that the restraint on canvassing and soliciting was unreasonably wide and therefore unenforceable. This was because the reference in their service agreements was not to soliciting or taking away from HIB the business of HIB's customers, but to soliciting or taking away from Hanover, HIB's parent, or its subsidiaries the business of Hanover's or its subsidiaries' customers. Hanover, the court said, could be described as a conglomerate. It was conceded by counsel for Mr Rose and Mr Knowles that the 'business' referred to in the phrase 'canvass, solicit or endeavour to take away the business' was meant to refer to the business of insurance brokerage and not to any other business carried on by Hanover or its subsidiaries. This was plainly right, the court said, and it followed that the ban on canvassing and soliciting was only meant to apply to HIB's, or Hanover's, insurance broking clients. Yet at first sight, Lord Justice Nolan said, the covenant was written so as to protect the Hanover group and all its businesses. As such, it was plainly too wide and unenforceable, he said. To allow the restriction to stand, therefore, would involve the court adopting a more flexible and supportive approach to the interpretation of the restriction than the court had shown in the earlier Mont case. According to Mr Frost, the message sent by the court in allowing the Rose and Knowles canvassing restriction to stand was that, where the type of restriction was appropriate, the clause had not been drafted by lawyers and, in all the circumstances of the case, it was clear that both sides knew what the clause was meant to mean, then the court might be prepared to give the employer the benefit of the doubt. But the court was not prepared to adopt the same liberal approach to the construction of the restriction on poaching HIB staff. The judges said the restriction as drafted would have applied to all employees of HIB irrespective of their expertise or seniority and would have applied to those who were employees at the time they were poached even if they had only become employees after all the defendants had left. As such it was much too wide and amounted to 'a mere covenant against competition on the defendants', which the court would not enforce. The court was not prepared to accept HIB's argument that an insurance brokerage and the goodwill of its business depended on its staff and that this was a legitimate business interest meriting protection. The court was not even prepared to entertain that HIB had a seriously arguable case on this point sufficient to grant an injunction until the issue could be argued in full at trial. Having taken a liberal approach on the interpretation of the Rose and Knowles canvassing clause, the court's position on the cross-appeal appeared somewhat contradictory. But according to Mr Frost, the real reason for rejecting the cross-appeal was that the court simply did not like this form of restriction. Citing a 1959 case, the judges said: 'An employee has the right to work for the employer he wants to work for if that employer is willing to employ him.' That must cast doubt on the validity of any clause against the poaching of staff, Mr Frost said. Until now it had been thought that employers had a legitimate interest in maintaining the stability of their workforce, particularly where they had invested considerable time and money in training, and that this legitimate interest could be protected. From now on lawyers would have to advise employers that there was little they could do to stop employees from working for anyone they wanted to work for, he said. Indeed, the HIB judgment as a whole will necessitate a reassessment by business of its strategy towards restraints of trade.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen, a special  economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, has built  several power plants with a total generating capacity of more  than two million kw in the past six years.    Since the city was approved as a special economic zone in  1980, the booming economy and growing population of the city  have required an expanding power supply.    In China, almost all large power plants were financed by the  state in the past. But the city decided in 1987 to build power  plants by itself, setting many favorable policies to encourage  overseas and local investors.    At present, a thermal power plant with a generating capacity  of 1.8 million kw is under construction. According to its power  development program, the city will construct two more large  power plants in the near future.    The program calls for the total generating capacity of the  city's power plants to reach 6.35 million kw by the end of this  century, to cover most of the city's power needs.</p>

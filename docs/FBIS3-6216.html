			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Hwang Ui-pong: "Powerhouses in the Kim </F> Chong-il Republic"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The story about the likelihood  of something serious happening inside the power structure in  North Korea where the succession of power to Kim Chong-il has  been nearly completed is not limited to the realm of fiction.  The Japanese biweekly SAPIO in its 12 August 1993 issue printed  a sensational article about the possibility of a violent clash  between the Kim Il-song faction and the Kim Chong-il faction.    The article said: "The first round of high-level talks  between the United States and North Korea on matters concerning  North Korea's withdrawal from the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty [NPT] was held in New York. But the venue for the second  round was moved to Geneva. It appears that Kim Il-song had  something to do with the change of the venue. He probably wanted  to prevent Kim Chong-il from making policy decisions and give  his own instructions to the North Korean delegatio through  Ambassador Kim Kwang-sop in Vienna. Earlier, on 18 March, just a  week after North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT,  Kim Kwang-sop took up his post as ambassador in Vienna. He is  the husband of Kim Kyong-chin, daughter of Kim Il-song's third  wife, Kim Chong-ae. Kim Kyong-chin is Kim Pyong-il's sister.  Behind the sudden appointment of Kim Kwang-sop was Kim Il-song's  desire to avoid isolation from the international community by  dispatching Kim Kwang-sop, a man belonging to the anti-Kim  Chong-il force, to the seat of IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] headquarters."    The SAPIO article continues: "There is a possibility that an  internal change in North Korea, irrespective of sanctions from  the outside, will happen. Nobody knows when a neurotic Kim  Chong-il might instruct his close aides who are present at a  midnight meeting surrounded by pretty women to mount a  deliberate attack on the South to provoke the South Korean  front-line division commanders, or might order his aides to take  up a plan to invade the South as a subject of discussion at such  a meeting. Should that really happen, first- and  second-generation revolutionaries might urge officers who  support Kim Pyong-il to rise up in order to block Kim Chong-il's  adventure."    The content of the SAPIO article seems to have little  substance. There is almost no reliable information to  substantiate the likelihood of serious strife or conflict  breaking out within the North Korean power elite, at least at  this moment. Rather the dominant view is that, with the process  of "dynastic succession of power to Kim Chong-il" progressing  smoothly, a tidy Kim Chong-il kingdom is in the making.    Nevertheless experts on North Korea are cautiously watching  developments in North Korea. According to them, it appears on  the surface that the Kim Chong-il hierarchy is being  established, and there is ample room for unstable developments,  depending on the situation. In the opinion of these experts,  North Korea could be engulfed in an unpredictable political  upheaval when Kim Il-song dies.    One thing is certain about the Kim Chong-il leadership,  namely, that after Kim Il-song dies, there will be internal  strife in one form or another, and the way this strife is  overcome may decide the fate of the Kim Chong-il regime. The  prevailing view is that, in this process, threats to Kim  Chong-il from opposing forces may come in the form of internal  conflict among those in power rather than in the form of  something like a popular uprising.    Accordingly, it is very important to examine the profiles of  those in power in North Korea in predicting the future of not  only the current North Korean regime but also the Kim Chong-il  regime after Kim Il-song's death. Would there emerge in North  Korea a man like Khrushchev who downgraded Stalin? Or would the  successor to the dictator in North Korea fall as Hua Guofeng did  after Mao Zedong died?    To examine the personal connections of those in power in  North Korea, it is necessary first of all to know the  peculiarities of the North Korean power structure. As everyone  knows, In North Korea the party dominates the power structure.  The party stands above the government, and all decisions and  policies of the government are under party control. Power  centers on three organizations, namely, the Workers Party of  Korea [WPK] Central Committee that exercises supreme leadership  when the WPK Congress is not in session; the Political Bureau in  control of the Central Committee; and the core of the Political  Bureau, namely, its Standing Committee.    The Political Bureau, which is at the center of power,  currently consists of 13 full members and nine candidate  members. The full members are: Kim Il-song (head of state, WPK  general secretary, and chairman of the WPK Military Affairs  Committee); Kim Chong-il (chairman of the National Defense  Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Armed  Forces [KPA]); O Chin-u (minister of People's Armed Forces);  Kang Song-san (premier of the State Administration Council); Yi  Chong-ok (vice president); Pak Song-chol (vice president); Kim  Yong-chu (vice president); Kim Yong-nam (minister of foreign  affairs); Choe Kwang (KPA chief of General Staff); Kye Ung-tae  (party secretary); Chon Pyong-ho (party secretary); Han  Song-yong (party secretary); So Yun-sok (responsible secretary,  South Pyongan Provincial WPK Committee). These are really the  most influential persons in North Korea.    Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il, and O Chin-u (members of the  Political Bureau Standing Committee) are at the core of the  power center in North Korea. Considering the fact that O Chin-u  is a symbolic figure representing the military as Kim Il-song's  comrade in revolution, it may be said that Kim Il-song and his  son are the ones who actually rule North Korea.    The Secretariat, as important as the Political Bureau in the  party machinery, discusses matters relating to personnel and  other important matters as they arise and make pertinent  decisions. Whereas the Political Bureau is a political  organization that chiefly makes highly important political  decisions, the Secretariat may be called an "organization above  the administrative branch of government" because it formulates  major practical polices and commands their implementation. The  Secretariat consists of 11 members, including Kim Chong-il and  Kye Ung-tae, under Secretary General Kim Il-song. It has 27  specialized divisions and has 12 municipal and provincial WPK  committees under its control.    In North Korea where the party stands supreme, holding party  power means holding state power. The WPK Department of  Organization and Guidance was the first official organization  that Kim Chong-il joined in 1964 after he graduated from Kim  Il-song University. It is in the party machinery where a  majority of his trusted followers are placed. The WPK is Kim  Chong-il's power base.    The one who draws the foremost attention in the North Korean  party hierarchy is Chang Song-taek, 49, husband of Kim  Chong-il's younger sister. As a WPK Central Committee member,  Chang heads three party departments, namely, the Department of  Three-Revolution Team, the Department of Labor Organizations,  and the Department of Youth Affairs. Irrespective of his  position and rank, Chang Song-taek's star is rising rapidly  because he is Kim Il-song's son-in-law and Kim Chong-il's  brother-in-law. Opinions differ, but many experts regard Chang  Song-taek as the third most powerful person after Kim Il-song  and Kim Chong-il.    Chang Song-taek is said to be a highly capable person with  smooth personal relationships. What is more, he spends his money  generously for people around him. That is why he is very  popular. He is regarded as Kim Chong-il's alter ego in the  party. Whereas Kim Chong-il is not easily accessible, Chang is  readily accessible. Naturally, party cadres tend to flock around  the latter. Chang is called "Kim Chong-il's itinerant  counterpart" because he is the man who puts into execution  policies prepared by Kim Chong-il and his policy planners in the  party. Kim Chong-il has such an unquestioning trust in Chang  Song-taek that he is quoted as saying, "You are the only person  I can trust and depend on."    Interestingly, some observers say that Chang Song-taek is  rising so fast in the hierarchy that he is being held in check  by both Ki Il-song and Kim Chong-il. Originally, Kim Il-song is  said to have opposed accepting Chang as his son-in-law. Chang  met Kim Il-song's daughter, Kim Kyong-hui, 48, for the first  time while they were in college. Kim Kyong-hui, Chang's  classmate at Kim Il-song University Department of Political  Economics, loved him passionately. When Kim Il-song discovered  their love affair, he forced Chang to be transferred to Songdo  College of Political Economics in Wonsan. But Kim Kyong-hui  loved Chang so much that she would travel to Wonsan by rail at  each weekend to see him. In the end, Kim Il-song gave in and  approved their marriage.    Even after the marriage, Kim Il-song continued to hold Chang  in check. In June 1990, when Kim Chong-il recommended that the  vacant post of director of state security be filled by Chang  Song-taek, Kim Il-song squashed the recommendation. They say the  reason Kim Il-song is holding Chang Song-taek in check is that  Chang is superior to Kim Chong-il in ability as well as in  character.    It is noteworthy that Kim Chong-il is also holding Chang  Song-taek in check despite the fact that Chang is known as his  closest aide. There were rumors that some sports officials and  ambassadors known as Chang's men were replaced. In the latter  part of 1993 the North Korean press mentioned "eliminating the  act of playing toady to some cadres and fueling factionalism."  Observers say that Chang Song-taek is the only person who could  have been linked to this report.    In its 24 June 1993 weekly edition NAEWOE TONGSIN reported  that Kim Chong-il began to put his brakes on Chang Song-taek's  abuse of power. Based on testimony by a North Korean defector,  NAEWOE TONGSIN said: "In early 1991 Kim Chong-il convened a  meeting of important party cadres in the central party  headquarters during which he pointed out and criticized one by  one the irregularities committed by Chang Song-taek." Following  this episode party cadres were said to be trying to avoid Chang.    As a matter of fact, it is difficult to confirm the rumor  about the discord between Kim Chong-il and Chang Song-taek  because their political activities are veiled in secrecy. But  that rumor cannot but be the focus of attention because the  blood ties among those at the top of the hierarchy might work as  a fuse to kindle a power struggle. The story in Chong Ul-pyong's  novel--the story that Chang Song-taek becomes the party general  secretary after Kim Il-song and his son are ousted from  power--may be based on the same assumption.    Kim Il-song's brother, Kim Yong-chu (72), is also arousing  attention these days. Kim Yong-chu was removed from power in  1974 when Kim Chong-il officially emerged as Kim Il-song's heir  apparent. But he staged a comeback late last year for the first  time in 20 years when he was named a Political Bureau member and  vice president. Speculation is rife regarding his comeback.    In the past there were various rumors about his whereabouts.  Some said he was convalescing in Siberia in the form of de facto  confinement. Others said he was in Moscow. Still others said he  was under house arrest in a house in South Pyongan Province. Ko  Chong-song (33), who defected to South Korea in June 1993 while  working as a guidance worker at the revolution's historical site  in Kanggye, Chagang Province, testified as follows about Kim  Yong-chu's whereabouts:    "Kim Yong-chu underwent medical treatment (for a mental  disease) in Chamosan for a while after he was ousted from power  by Kim Chong-il. Later he moved to Unsuri, a mountainous  village in Nangnim County, Chagang Province. Subsequently, he  stayed in Chosan County or, maybe in Iwon County, in Chagang  Province until he moved to Puchang-tong, Kanggye City, in 1980.  He stayed in Kangye until April 1991. As far as I know, he lived  there idling away at home with no particular job.    "Kim Yong-chu lived in a duplex unit (about 20 pyong) in a  two-story workers apartment complex in Kangye with his wife and  two daughters. I heard the rumor that he had a son also. His  older daughter was a guidance worker at the provincial  Administrative [and Economic Guidance] Committee, and his  younger daughter worked at the meteorological observatory in  Chagang Province. It was in April 1991 that Kim Yong-chu moved  to Pyongyang. About a week before he moved, his home was  burglarized. Rumors said that the thief made off with a watch  and money.    "According to rumors, Kim Yong-chu was able to move to  Pyongyang after his two daughters petitioned Kim Chong-il. On  the day he moved, Kim Chong-il went to Kanggye aboard a special  train. When Kim Chong-il arrived, Kim Yong-chu's daughters met  him for the first time. When the women addressed Kim Chong-il as  `dear leader comrade,' he said to them, `You should not address  me like that,' and told them to call him cousin."    Experts on North Korea make the following general analysis  about the reasons for Kim Yong-chu's comeback:    First, Kim Yong-chu has been reinstated because the  succession arrangements for Kim Chong-il are so secure that he  can no longer be Kim Chong-il's rival. Second, the comeback is  aimed at making Kim Yong-chu, Kim Chong-il's uncle, the guardian  of the system for Kim Chong-il's succession to power.    Despite his exclusion from power for over 20 years, Kim  Yong-chu's future role, particularly in the field of North-South  relations, deserves attention in view of his career, including  his cochairmanship of the North-South Coordinating Committee  which he held when he was director of the WPK Central Committee  Department of Organization and Guidance.    Some experts say that it is a mistake to regard him as an  "expert on South Korea." When the 4 July 1972 Joint Statement  was issued, he was named as cochairman of the Coordinating  Committee simply because he was the counterpart of Yi Hu-rak,  then ROK Central Intelligence Agency [KCIA] director. In  reality, Pak Song-chol was in charge. However, some observers  speculate that if a hurdle is raised in the way of Kim  Chong-il's immediate succession to the presidency upon Kim  Il-song's death, Kim Yong-chu might assume the presidency on a  provisional basis for the purpose of crisis management.    Kim Nam-sik of the Institute for Peace said that Kim  Yong-chu  appears to have the ability to serve at least as a  complementary force for the Kim Chong-il leadership structure,  and that, depending on circumstances, the possibility cannot  ruled out that he will serve as provisional president in the  event of Kim Il-song's death, thereby filling the vacuum in the  transitional period before the Kim Chong-il regime establishes  itself.    The party line is an absolute guideline for action in North  Korea, and any deviation from it automatically constitutes an  antiparty, antinational, and antistate act. It is Kye Ung-tae  (76), Political Bureau member and party secretary in charge of  public security and judicial affairs, who sees to it that the  party line is effectively implemented at party, government,  military, and public levels. He is a powerful man with the right  of personnel management over the director of state security, the  minister of public security, the president of Central Court, and  the procurator general of the Central Procurator's Office. Kim  Si-hak (71), director of the WPK Department of Administration,  furnishes Kye Ung-tae with various information collected from  intelligence, public security, and judicial sources. By  analyzing such information, Kye Ung-tae provides "partywide"  guidance. He consults Kim Chong-il and receives instructions  from him on important matters. In short, Kye Ung-tae is a  powerful man who holds all intelligence and inspection  organizations under his control.    Chon Pyong-ho (70) and Han Song-yong (67) are both Political  Bureau members and members of the party Secretariat. Chon is in  charge of heavy industry, and Han in charge of machine and metal  industries. They were appointed to the Secretariat after the  Kim Chong-il era began. They are Kim Chong-il's intimate  technocrats who have shared their political fortunes with him.  Reportedly, Chon and Han--both children of revolutionary  martyrs--stayed with Kim Chong-il for about six months in Kim  Il-song's residence before Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute  opened in 1946. They were among the children of fallen  revolutionaries whom Kim Chong-suk [Kim Il-song's wife] looked  after in her home. In this way these children entered into  special relationships with Kim Chong-il from their childhood.    Chon Pyong-ho is an authority on theories on party building  and has such outstanding writing ability that he has reportedly  drafted theses and speeches for Kim il-song and Kim Chong-il.  Chon Pyong-ho is a member of the National Defense Commission. He  is unique in that he is the only nonmilitary person in the  commission besides Kim Chong-il, its chairman. In this position  Chon pushes forward Kim Chong-il's stand by playing the role of  a pipeline connecting the National Defense Commission to the  party. Both Chon Pyong-ho and Han Song-yong are not only  quick-witted, but also have profound expertise and an  outstanding ability. Although their stars have not risen as  fast as Kim Tal-hyon's, they have steadily maintained the tempo  of their ascendancy and are regarded as important pillars  propping up the Kim Chong-il heirdom.    So Kwan-hui (68), WPK secretary in charge of agriculture, is  an influential person known as Kim Chong-il's intimate economic  brain. He is recognized as an agricultural expert credited with  the founding of the so-called chuche-based farming method.    Kim Kuk-tae (76), director of the WPK Department of Cadre  Affairs, was among the first graduating class of Mangyongdae  Revolutionary Institute. He is the son of the late Vice Premier  Kim Chaek, who died during the Korean war. Kim Kuk-tae graduated  from Kim Il-song University and studied at Moscow University. He  is a bulwark and shield for the Kim Chong-il regime. A party  theoretician, he was in overall command and supervision of  political, ideological, and propaganda activities while serving  as director of the WPK Department of Propaganda and Agitation in  the 1967-1973 period. He was at the center of attention when he  pushed forward the drive to found the unitary ideology system of  the party. As part of this drive, he reorganized history  research rooms into Kim Il-song research rooms.    Kim Kuk-tae played a decisive role in consolidating Kim  Chong-il's power by ousting Kim Chong-il's stepmother, Kim  Song-ae, and his uncle, Kim Yong-chu, from power. Reportedly, it  was thanks to Kim Kuk-tae that the practice of hanging portraits  of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il side by side was established.    Hwang Chang-yop (69), secretary in charge of ideology, and  Yang Hyong-sop (71), speaker of the Supreme People's Assembly  [SPA], are expert theoreticians. As such they are the  ideological prop of the establishment and the "royal  instructors" who teach the art of kingship to Kim Chong-il.  Hwang Chang-yop, husband of Kim Il-song's niece, is a  philosopher. After graduating from Kim Il-song University, he  majored in philosophy at Moscow University. Upon returning from  Moscow, he filled the chair of philosophy at Kim Il-song  University and began to demonstrate his ideological and  theoretical talents. He became the SPA speaker in his forties  and served in that post for three terms. Beginning in 1975 or  thereabout when North Korea joined the Nonaligned Movement,  Hwang Chang-yop visited more than 30 countries on over 20  occasions organizing chuche ideology research organizations in  host countries. Thus he made a great contribution to the effort  to muster the support of nonaligned nations by unfolding his  so-called people-to-people diplomacy.    Reportedly, Hwang Chang-yop began to teach the art of  kingship to Kim Chong-il when the latter was named heir apparent  at the Seventh Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee in  September 1973. From then on he assumed responsibility as  manager of Kim Chong-il's public as well as private life. He  introduced Kim Hye-suk (43) to Kim Chong-il. They say Kim  Hye-suk is Kim Chong-il's second wife. After Kim Chong-il  divorced his first wife, Hong Il-chon, there was a two-year  blank period. In the course of searching for a candidate for  Kim Chong-il's second wife, Hwang Chang-yop uncovered Kim  Hye-suk, a beautiful woman hailing from Hoeryong, North Hamgyong  Province. She is a graduate of Kim Il-song University. Hwang  worked hard to rewrite Kim Chong-il's experience and his  background in such a way as to fit his position as heir  apparent. Hwang arbitrarily changed Kim Chong-il's birth place  from the Soviet Union to Mt. Paekdu, and greatly contributed to  idolizing Kim Chong-il by inventing such epithets for him as  "the Party Center," "the Dear Leader," and "the Sagacious  Leader."    All North Korean state programs and all foreign proposals to  North Korea must be approved after going through ideological  scrutiny by the party's chuche ideology research group led by  Hwang Chang-yop. Particularly, any plan directed toward South  Korea and various South Korean proposals are said to be subject  to double scrutiny by him. Hwang Chang-yop, the circumspect  scholarly type, pays more attention to giving lectures on chuche  ideology than discussing matters of mutual interest when he  meets foreign guests. That is why foreign visitors who meet him  often give their impressions by saying, "It was like receiving a  college lecture."    Yang Hyong-sop is the only high-ranking North Korean  official  who hails from Cheju, South Korea. While attending Moscow  University, he became acquainted with Kim Yong-chu. Thanks to  this tie, Yang Hyong-sop became Kim Il-song's relative by  marrying Kim Sin-suk (86), Kim Il-song's cousin. His face was  familiar to us because he hosted receptions for the delegations  to the second, fourth, and sixth rounds of North-South  high-level talks in Pyongyang in his capacity as speaker.  Because he was close to Kim Yong-chu, Yang Hong-sop was demoted  to president of the Academy of Social Sciences from a Standing  Committee member of the Political Bureau in 1980. But he  reemerged in the forefront of power as SPA speaker in April  1984. He became a candidate member of th Political Bureau, thus  rising in rank from 32d place to 18th.    The following are among the influential persons in charge of  South Korean affairs--an important function in the North Korean  power structure: Kim Yong-sun (59), party secretary for South  Korean affairs, and Kwon Hui-kyong (66), director of the WPK  Department of Investigations. In the personnel reshuffle last  December, Ki Yong-sun lost his post as a candidate member of the  WPK Political Bureau and slipped from 15th to 26th place in the  ranking. This gives the impression that his power has been  weakened. But judging from the fact that he still holds his  position as party secretary for South Korean affairs, apparently  he is still an influential person. According to recent reports,  North Korea set up a high-power special measures group in  preparation for sudden breakthroughs in its relations with the  ROK, the United States, and Japan. Reportedly, Kim Yong-sun has  taken charge of the U.S. unit. Kim, a tall massive figure, 180  cm in height and 90 kg in weight, is regarded as a key player in  the North's policy toward the South.    An anecdote illustrates Kim Yong-sun's straightforward  personality. In 1984 when he was the deputy director of the WPK  Department of International Affairs, Kim Chong-il said to him:  "Inasmuch as what the party's Department of international  Affairs does falls within the realm of foreign relations  activity, its members should practice social dancing, such as  the polka." So, Kim Yong-sun organized a dance party in the  courtyard of the party central headquarters building, to which  members of his department and their wives were invited. At the  sight, officials of other department exclaimed, "The  international department is going wild," and squealed to Kim  Chong-il. The plea that the dance party was held according to  Kim Chong-il's suggestion was not accepted. The party Department  of Organization and Guidance investigated the case and confirmed  some "cases of love affairs." As a result, Kim Yong-sun and 70  employees, about half the total number of employees of the  Department of International Affairs, were dismissed. Kim  Yong-sun staged a comeback a year after this case, and in the  end became director of the party's Department of International  Affairs.    Kwon Hui-kyong is an expert on foreign information and  collects information on South Korea. Apparently, he was chosen  as the person in overall charge of this area because of his  ability to collect and analyze information, a skill he learned  while serving as ambassador to the Soviet Union for many years.  While working as ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kwon Hui-Kyong  used to return home once or twice a year to provide Kim Chong-il  with high-level information and thus succeeded to win his trust.  The fact alone that Kwon served as ambassador to the Soviet  Union for 15 years in two stints shows that he carries a lot of  weight.    There is an anecdote that gives some glimpses of Kwon  Hui-kyong's character and loyalty to Kim Chong-il. When Kwon was  ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kim Chong-il from time to time  called him back for drinks. Each time he left Moscow for home,  he kept not only his embassy staff but also then Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam, his superior, in the dark about his trip  home. As a result, occasionally there was a stir in the North  Korean embassy because nobody knew where the ambassador was.    Kim Ki-nam (68), director of the WPK Department of  Propaganda  and Agitation, may be reckoned as another influential figure in  the WPK. He has held this job since 1987 and is said to have  very close personal ties with Kim Chong-il. Actually, he is  regarded as one of Kim Chong-il's closest aides. Number-one  writer in the party, Kim Ki-nam not only writes articles for Kim  Chong-il, but also takes overall command of all information and  propaganda. All famous slogans in North Korea--such as "Let us  live in our own way !" and "Study in the manner of anti-Japanese  guerrillas!"--are his brainchild or were brushed up by him. Kim  Ki-nam; Hyon Chun-kuk, NODONG SINMUN editor in chief; and Kim  Chong-suk, MINJU CHOSON editor in chief, are called the "Gang  of Three" of the propaganda team.    The military in North Korea is strictly under the control of  the party, but it has the potential of playing the most powerful  role in an emergency. That is why the military is always the  focus of attention. At present the military is regarded as one  of the major forces buttressing the Kim Chong-il succession  system. But according to experts on North Korea, it is difficult  to predict the course the military might take after Kim  Il-song's death. That is why the military must be watched most  closely in connection with any possible change in power in North  Korea.    Among the influential figures in the military, O Chin-u (78)  may come first. He is a member of the Standing Committee of the  Political Bureau and ranks third in the ranking order. He also  holds the posts of minister of the People's Armed Forces, first  vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, and member of  the WPK Military Affairs Committee. As these titles suggest, he  is the top man in the North Korean military. He belongs to the  first generation of revolutionaries who engaged in anti-Japanese  partisan operations under Kim Il-song. He actively supported the  campaign to lay the groundwork for Kim Chong-il's succession to  power, and was promoted to the rank of marshal in 1992. He has  been constant in his loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son.    There is an interesting anecdote telling how O Chin-u came  to  be reverentially loyal to Kim Chong-il, who is inexperienced and  so young compared with him. One day in the early winter of  1985--the year in which O Chin-u was promoted to the rank of  vice marshal--while driving a Mercedes-Benz 450 alone through  Sosong Street, Sosong District, in Pyongyang at about 0200, his  car hit a concrete pole in front of the Memorial Hall honoring  the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. A policeman on  patrol spotted the accident. Seeing the emblem of the vice  marshal of the People's Army on O Chin-u's shoulder, the watch  bearing a Kim Il-song mark on his wrist, and the special license  number on his car, the policeman immediately knew that the  driver was a high-ranking official in the hierarchy and took him  to the hospital immediately. Meanwhile, the story says, Kim  Chong-il, informed of the accident, promptly took measures to  save O Chin-u's life.    On the night before the accident, O Chin-ui had a heated  argument with Kim Chong-il at a drinking party about the  question of dismissing O Kuk-yol. After the party was over, a  frustrated O drove the car by himself leaving his driver and  aide de camp behind, and had an accident on the way. That was  the circumstance surrounding the accident. This anecdote is  often cited to explain how O Chin-u came to be loyally devoted  to Kim Chong-il, and how Kim Chong-il came to trust O Chin-u so  much.    In connection with the future of North Korea, O Kuk-yol (65)  draws more attention than O Chin-u. Reportedly, O Kuk-yol, a KPA  general, is currently in charge of the party's Department of  Operations. But in the future he is expected to be the minister  of the People's Armed Forces. O Kuk-yol is a son of O Chung-hup,  Kim Il-song's comrade-in-arms in partisan fighting. He was among  the first graduating class of Mangyongdae Revolutionary  Institute. He is an elite military officer who graduated from  Kim Il-song University and a Soviet air force academy.    He was appointed as Air Force commander in 1968 at the age  of  40. In the middle of the 1970's O Kuk-yol, together with O  Chin-u, suppressed the forces in the military opposed to the  system insuring Kim Chong-il's succession to power. From then on  O Kuk-yol enjoyed the complete trust of Kim Chong-il. In 1979 he  was promoted to KPA chief of General Staff with the rank of  lieutenant general (equivalent to two-star general in the South)  and became a candidate member of the Political Bureau. In this  way he emerged as a key figure in the military.    However, while breezing along on the royal road to success,  O  Kuk-yol had to relinquish his post as KPA chief of General  Staff, which he had led for 10 years, to Choe Kwang in 1988  because of his friction with O Chin-u. In those days O Kuk-yol,  banking on Kim Chong-il's trust, ignored O Chin-u. As part of a  scheme to oust O Kuk-yol, O Chin-u sent him to the Higher Kim  Il-song Institute in January 1988 for a month-long training  course. Meanwhile, O Chin-u presented a written evaluation  report to Kim Il-song detailing irregularities committed by O  Kuk-yol. As a consequence, O Kuk-yol was relieved as KPA chief  of General Staff.    According to Ko Yong-hwan (41), a North Korean defector, O  Kuk-yol is very popular among younger military officers. He is  so popular that a saying circulates among North Korean military  personnel that "if O Chin-u wages war, we might lose; but when O  Kuk-yol does, we will win." The reason for O Kuk-yol's  popularity is that, whereas O Chin-u has "the image of a senile  old man," O Kuk-yol looks like an intelligent man of vision.  While serving as KPA chief of staff, O Kuk-yol made many  reasonable suggestions, including the suggestion that, to  promote the modernization of the military, military personnel be  given more opportunities to have overseas training, and that  military commandeers be given more power so that they might not  need to try to read the minds of political officers.    Another influential military figure who deserves attention  alongside O Kuk-yol is Choe Kwang (76), KPA chief of General  Staff. Choe Kwang, a vice marshal with background as a former  partisan fighter, ranks next only to O Chin-u in the military.  Dr. Kang In-tok, director of the Institute for Far Eastern  Studies, regards Choe Kwang and Kim Kwang-chin (76), who  symbolize the first generation of KPA soldiers, as persons to  be reckoned with. Choe Kwang early on criticized the  partisan-type antiquated North Korean military system and called  for its modernization, and thus ended up losing his power.    The key figures in the North Korean military may be divided  into two groups, one consisting of the first generation of  partisan fighters, and the other consisting of military  technocrats. KPA Vice Marshals Paek Hak-nim (76), Yi Ul-sol  (74), and Chu To-il (78) belong to the former, whereas Generals  Kim Tu-nam (66), Kim Kang-hwan (64), and Yi Pong-won (67) belong  to the latter.    Paek Hak-nim is in charge of security matters as a member of  the Military Affairs Committee and minister of public security.  A veteran partisan fighter, he has been a close aide to Kim  Il-song. He was a company commander of Kim Il-song's security  force and later its overall commander. Pak Hak-nim is always  associated with the legendary story that he rescued Kim Il-song  from danger during an assault by his guerrilla unit on an area  adjacent to the Tumen River bank. It is a well-known story  throughout North Korea that Pak waded through the snow at the  foot of the mountain in northern Manchuria searching for pine  nuts for Kim Il-song who was completely exhausted in the icy  winter weather there. Anyhow, thanks to this personal tie to Kim  Il-song, Paek is also on intimate terms with Kim Chong-il. They  say Paek brought from overseas the kinds of acoustic equipment  and musical instruments Kim Chong-il liked as a gift for him.    Yi Ul-sol and Chu To-il, both members of the party Military  Affairs Committee, head the General Bureau of Security and the  Pyongyang Defense Command, respectively. These titles are  indicative of their standing in the military. As a matter of  fact, they have greater power than their positions suggest. Like  Paek Hak-nim, they "have waited upon" Kim Il-song "near at  hand." That is why, experts say, they are in a position to make  the most of their unique ties to Kim Il-song and his son. The  range of their activities is not limited to North Korea, and  they are expected to go as far as it is necessary to prop up the  Kim Chong-il heirdom. They are expected to serve as a shield for  the Kim Chong-il regime when Kim Il-song dies.    Kim Tu-nam, Kim Kang-hwan, and Yi Pong-won all belong to the  second partisan generation and are graduates of Mangyongdae  Revolutionary Institute. They belong to the military power  elite. Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan are former and current  directors of the party Department of Military Affairs,  respectively. These two and O Kuk-yol are called "the troika who  established the unitary ideology system of the party in the  military."    What draws attention in connection with the careers of Kim  Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan is the fact that both formerly served  as deputy chief of Section 13 of the WPK Department of  Organization and Guidance. This department is one of the 22  departments under the party Central Committee, and it has 13  sections. To all intents and purposes, the Department of  Organization and Guidance is the highest power center in North  Korea. It provides party guidance to all party, government, and  military organizations through personnel management and  ideological scrutiny. It is common knowledge that when it comes  to personnel affairs, background materials prepared by the  Department of Organization and Guidance play a vital role in  taking personnel actions with regard to officials at the same  level as or at higher levels than provincial party secretaries  (equivalent to the rank of provincial governor), vice ministers  of the State Administration Council (same as vice minister of  the cabinet), and general officers. The Department of  Organization and Guidance was the public organization in which  Kim Chong-il began his public career. The fact alone that Kim  Chong-il still has this department under his personal control is  indicative of its power.    Various information converges on the Department of  Organization and Guidance in the form of a daily report so that  the department can use it in making ideological evaluations of  important cadres. The collected information covers everything  about cadres, for instance, details of a drinking bout the  director of a certain department had with a certain person for a  certain number of hours; or details of the medical treatment a  certain military general received and the doctor's opinion on  the patient's condition. These bits of information are used in  evaluating cadres. Therefore it is no exaggeration to say that  in a sense a guidance functionary in the communications and  transportation section of this department has more power than  the minister of posts and telecommunications.    Section 13 of the Department of Organization and Guidance in  charge of military affairs not only gives guidance for the  correct implementation of the party's military policy but also  actually exercises the power held by the party Military Affairs  Committee and the National Defense Commission. This department  is really all-powerful because it also directly controls the KPA  Party Committee and the KPA General Political Bureau. From the  fact that Kim Tu-nam and Kim Kang-hwan once served as deputy  director of this department in charge of Section 13, most  probably they must have wielded immense power over the military.    Yi Pong-won is currently deputy director of the KPA General  Political Bureau. O Chin-u being its director, Yi may be  regarded as the de facto director. Yi, responsible for political  control over the military, is in essence the special person Kim  Chong-il dispatched to the military. He is expected to become  next director of the General Political Bureau, succeeding Choe  Kwang.    Persons emplaced in administrative, economic, and diplomatic  positions in the State Administration Council are not as  powerful as those in the party and military. But they are the  ones who are charged with the task of finding practical  solutions to difficult problems confronting North Korea, such as  how to achieve economic development and how to improve North  Korea's relations with the United States and Japan. That is why  their roles are assuming added importance.    As far as we are concerned, technocrats in North Korean  government organizations are the effective windows through which  we can predict whether it is possible for North Korea to shift  its direction to reform and opening. That is why attention is  focused on these technocrats and the roles they are playing.    The State Administration Council, with the largest array of  expert technocrats, is equivalent to our cabinet. But there are  limits to its role because the party Political Bureau or  Secretariat formulate all important policies and the State  Administration Council draws up only detailed plans for their  implementation. However, with the same influential persons  holding both party and government positions, there are quite a  few powerful persons in the State Administration Council.    Premier Kang Song-san (63) is Kim Il-song's cousin by a  maternal aunt and the fourth-ranking member of the Political  Bureau. He is a leading technocrat who has steered the North  Korean economy together with Yi Kun-mo and Yon Hyong-muk. After  graduating from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and Kim  Il-song University, Kang Song-san majored in economics at Moscow  University. He started out as a guidance worker at the party  Department of Organization and Guidance. He successively served  as director of that department, responsible secretary of the  Pyongyang Municipal WPK Committee, premier of the State  Administration Council, and responsible secretary of the North  Hamgyong Provincial WPK Committee before he was reappointed  premier of the State Administration Council.    As is apparent from his blood ties to Kim Il-song and his  career, Premier Kang Song-san is the top administrator in North  Korea who has breezed along on the elite track. In a sense it is  quite natural that his name is adorned with such epithets as  "the front-runner of the new generation" and "the man at the  head of the second generation of revolutionaries." Kang Song-san  has been reckoned as one of the few trump cards that North Korea  can use in reviving its economy. This can be easily understood  when one traces the footsteps he has taken until now. This is  because his career and North Korea's economic development and  policy for opening are closely linked.    Kang Song-san was appointed to the premiership for the first  time during the third session of the Seventh SPA in January  1984. At this session he, then first vice premier, delivered a  speech titled "On Stepping Up South-South Cooperation and  External Economic Activities and Further Developing Trade  Activities." After this speech, he was named premier of the  State Administration Council. His speech drew attention because  it was unique in that it called for active economic exchanges  with capitalist countries.    During his premiership, North Korea enacted the joint  venture  law in September 1984 to facilitate ventures with foreign  enterprises. In December of the same year North Korea  established the External Economic Committee. He was relieved of  his premiership in December 1986. Later, in March 1988, he was  appointed as responsible secretary of the North Hamgyong  Provincial WPK Committee. It appeared that he was demoted from  the premiership to a position equivalent to provincial governor.  But in the intervening years he worked out the plan for the  development of "the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic and Trade Zone."    Opinions differ about his image as a proponent of reform and  opening that his career projects. Some say that, given the  nature of the North Korean regime, Kang just acted  administratively each time Kim Il-song and his son issued  instructions and that the measures for opening he took were not  of his making. Others, on the other hand, claim that it is a  fact that, despite certain limitations, Kang Song-san has pushed  for the opening of North Korea.    It is said that there are more than 10 vice premiers in the  North Korean State Administration Council. Relatively well-known  among them are: Choe Yong-nim (68), Kim Hwan (64), and Hong  Sok-hyong in charge of the economy; and Kim Yong-nam (69) in  charge of foreign relations.    Many observers predict that some day Choe Yong-nim and Kim  Hwan will become premiers of the State Administration Council.  This is to say that Kim Chong-il trusts them that much.  According to these observers, Choe Yong-nim, a veritable  retainer for the Kim Il-song clan, might become premier if the  Kim Chong-il heirdom is beset with trouble, or if an economic  crisis erupts and voices mount demanding accelerated opening to  the outside world and faster economic development.    Choe Yong-nim, vice premier and minister of metal industry,  is a retainer of the Kim Il-song family who early on served as  senior secretary of the presidential palace. He is known for his  meticulous character and his mental agility. He is said to be  fluent in Russian, English, and Japanese. After becoming a vice  premier in February 1984, he consolidated his position as the  nucleus of administrative and economic organizations. He was  relieved as vice premier in October 1985, but staged a comeback  as a candidate member of the Political Bureau, vice premier, and  chairman of the State Planning Committee in May 1990.    Vice Premier Kim Hwan once appeared to have been purged for  a  while but later staged a comeback. He is regarded as a would-be  reformist in the Kim Chong-il era. He graduated from Kim Il-song  University and Karl Marx School of Engineering in East Germany.  He once served as a member of the Political Bureau of the WPK  Central Committee and a member of the party Secretariat, and  subsequently held other important jobs. He tried to set up a  Chinese-type special zone in Kim Chong-suk County, Yanggang  Province. Kim Hwan came out with that idea when Kim Chong-il was  groping for some changes after he had consolidated his position  as heir apparent at the Sixth WPK Congress. Although Kim  Chong-il endorsed Kim Hwan's plan, Kim Il-song rejected it, and  as a result, Kim Hwan was ousted from his post.    Hong Sok-hyong was named vice premier and chairman of the  State Planning Committee succeeding Kim Tal-hyon in last  December's reshuffle. He is a grandson of Hong Myong-hui and a  son of Hong Ki-mun, former vice president of the Academy of  Social Sciences. The background of his career advancement draws  attention. Hong Sok-hyong successively served as first minister  of metal industry in the State Administration Council and as a  candidate member of the WPK Central Committee. He has been the  responsible secretary of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex  WPK Committee since 1988. He is known for his expertise in  metals in particular and in science and technology in general.  His latest promotion has prompted speculation that the focus of  North Korea's economic policy will shift to economic activities  in the field.    In connection with Hong Sok-hyong's role, it is noteworthy  that he is concurrently chairman of the State Planning  Committee. In a socialist state under a thoroughgoing economic  planning system, the duties of the state planning committee are  very important indeed. As a matter of fact, it has been  customary for North Korea to assign big wheels to the  chairmanship of the State Planning Committee. Particularly in  view of the real condition in North Korea, which is in a  transition period, we can easily imagine the great hope the  party leadership might pin on Hong Sok-hyok.    Kim Yong-nam, foreign minister and concurrently member of  the  Political Bureau, is the godfather of North Korean diplomacy  after the late Ho Tam. He was born a son of a railway worker in  North Korea. After graduating from Kim Il-song University, he  studied at Moscow University. Upon returning from Moscow, he  embarked upon his career as a party bureaucrat in the party  Department of International affairs. As a diplomatic  technocrat, he concentrated on European diplomacy until the late  1970's and on Southeast Asian and African diplomacy beginning in  the 1980's. He has long served in the bureaucracy, probably  because he is the type who stands aloof from factionalism or  sectarianism. Attention is focused on how he will deal with  outstanding issues, such as the IAEA nuclear inspection issue  and the problem of improving North Korean relations with the  United States and Japan.    Yi Hwa-son (58) and Kang Sok-chu (55) cannot be counted out  from the list of influential figures in North Korean diplomacy.  Yi Hwa-son is deputy director of the party Department of  Organization and Guidance in charge of Section 2 of the  department. He is not conspicuous to outsiders, but he is said  to exercise very strong influence on North Korean diplomacy. He  holds the right of personnel management over all North Korean  diplomats except Kim Yong-sun and Kim Yong-nam. Even Vice  Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu is said to be cowed in his  presence.    Lately Kang Sok-chu has become a "star diplomat" as he often  appears before mass media in his capacity as North Korean  delegate to U.S.-North Korean negotiations on the nuclear  facilities inspection issue. Kang, currently vice minister of  foreign affairs, emerged as an important diplomat when he  addressed the UN General Assembly as senior North Korea delegate  when North Korea was admitted to the United Nations in late  1991. He is classified as a typical technocrat. Very little is  known about the background of his career. The period in which he  began to cut a conspicuous figure in the North Korean Foreign  Ministry coincided the period in which the campaign to  establish the Kim Chong-il heirdom was in full swing. This may  suggests that Kang Sok-chu may be one of the Kim Chong-il  intimates.    According to Ko Yong-hwan, a former North Korean diplomat  who  defected to the South, Kang Sok-chu is a man who is  "intelligent, skillful in adapting himself to circumstances, and  fond of reproaching others to their faces." Kang stands ready 24  hours a day to answer the call of Kim Chong-il at any time.  According to Ko, when Kim Chong-il calls up the Foreign Ministry  at 2300, Kang moves from room to room in shirtsleeves and  slippers to collect papers in person instead of using the  intercom and fax machine.    Experts on North Korea say that, inasmuch as Kim Chong-il  set  it as his strategic goal to establish diplomatic relations with  the United States and Japan, he will have no choice but to keep  Kang Sok-chu in important posts because of his proficiency in  English and expertise in diplomacy toward the West.  The future courses of the "faded stars" like Yon Hyong-muk  (62) and Kim Tal-hyon (54) deserve attention. These two are  well-known to us as the former premiers of the State  Administration Council who attended the high-level inter-Korean  talks. Although they are removed from the top post in the  central government, they are expected to stage a comeback in  view of their outstanding abilities as economic technocrats.  Inasmuch as they are typical North Korean proponents of opening  to the outside world, much is to be expected from them when  inter-Korean economic cooperation moves into high gear.    Yon Hyong-muk, a native of North Hamgyong Province,  graduated  from Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute and the Ural College of  Engineering in the Soviet Union. After he became a guidance  worker at the party Department of Organization and Guidance, he  continued to climb the bureaucratic ladder and was elected to  the party Central Committee in 1970 at the age of 38. In 1974 he  was named a member of the Political Bureau and the party  Secretariat. He is regarded as the foremost front-runner among  the elite technocrats. After emerging as the number-one heavy  industry expert, he became premier of the State Administration  Council in December 1988. But he was demoted to responsible  secretary of the Chagang Provincial WPK Committee at the Fourth  Session of the Ninth SPA for his failure to fulfill the economic  plan.    Yon Hyong-muk is known as a cautious and learned man with  outstanding powers of judgment. Commenting on his personality, a  defector from the North said, "If Kang Song-san knows only one  side of a particular issue, Yon Hyong-muk will know three  sides." Yon Hyong-muk currently is a candidate member of the  Political Bureau. Therefore it is hard to conclude that he has  been ousted from power.    We can guess the future standing of Kim Tal-hyon on the same  basis as in the case of Yon Hyong-muk. Once he was called an  "immediate candidate for the premiership," but he suddenly  disappeared from the front stage of the power scene late last  year. At that time speculation persisted that he just took  responsibility for the slowdown in economic development as a  matter of formality, and therefore he cannot be regarded as  ousted from power completely. Observers attach weight to Kim  Tal-hyon not only because he is a rare economic expert in North  Korea but also because he is the husband of Kim Il-song's cousin  once removed. Viewed from this angle, recent reports that Kim  Tal-hyon has taken charge of a special measures team on South  Korea deserve attention.    According to Ko Yong-hwan, Kim Tal-hyon says what he has to  say even in front of Kim Il-song. In brief, he is the only man  in the administration who can say "No" to Kim Il-song. That is  why Kim Il-song sometimes characterizes him as "an arrogant but  intelligent man."    There is the rumor that Kim Tal-hyon has been demoted as a  warning because he appeared to be the head of the reformist  group.    As is apparent from the above analysis, the North Korean  hierarchy consists of the intimates of Kim Il-song and Kim  Chong-il without exception. In the socialist regimes in the  Soviet Union and China, squabbles about party lines or policies  begot factions, and factionalism gave rise to power struggles.  But it seems that North Korea maintains a nearly perfect  patriarchal leadership structure centering on Kim Il-song and  his son.    This feature of the North Korean power elite is a by-product  of the process in these past 20 years by which the Kim Chong-il  leadership has thoroughly consolidated its support base while  laying the groundwork for the succession of power. Nevertheless,  an analysis of major players in the apparently monolithic North  Korean power elite reveals some elements of factionalism.    First, the power elite has a strong characteristic of  nepotism. Its salient feature is that many of Kim Il-song's  relatives are entrenched in the center of power. The relatives  of Kim Il-song and his son number more than 20. They include:  Kim Song-ae, Pak Song-chol, Yang Hyong-sop, Hwang Chang-yop,  Kang Song-san, Kim Chung-nim, Kim Tal-hyon, and Kim Yong-sun.    According to an analysis by a research team headed by Dr.  Chon Hyon-chun at the Research Institute for National  Unification, about 7 percent of the full members of the WPK  Central Committee are Kim Il-song's relatives by blood and  marriage. Considering the fact that it is difficult to ascertain  the kinships because of the closed nature of North Korean  society, the ratio must be much greater than that. About 50  percent of these relatives on the Central Committee are above  the 30th place in the ranking order. This ratio squares with the  fact that five members of the Kim Il-song clan are among the  first 10 places in the ranking order of the Political Bureau.    Second, graduates of particular schools are conspicuously  numerous. Graduates of Mangyongdae Revolutionary School, which  has courses from kindergarten to high school, account for 3  percent of officials with the rank of vice minister and above  and 13 percent of the full membership of the Central Committee.  These figures are only confirmed ones, and the actual numbers  may far exceed them.    As for colleges and universities, Kim Il-song University and  Kimchaek Polytechnic College top the list by a large margin.  The ratio of graduates of the Kimchaek Polytechnic College is  increasing, reflecting the tendency to attach greater importance  to expert technocrats. Of those who studied abroad, 70 percent  studied in the Soviet Union.    All this indicates that the path from Mangyongdae  Revolutionary Institute to Kim Il-Song University to  universities in the Soviet Union has been the typical academic  track for the North Korean power elite. Mangyongdae  Revolutionary Institute is a special school that admits only  bereaved children of fallen revolutionaries and children of  high-ranking officials. Anyone who enters this school will  automatically be put on an elite track.    The regional distribution is also interesting. Overall,  those  who hail from Hamgyong Provinces and Pyongan Provinces account  for a large proportion. Particularly in the Central Committee,  those from Hamgyong Provinces account for 48.4 percent of the  total full members, although the population of North and South  Hamgyong Provinces accounts for 22.6 percent of North Korea's  total population according to 1990 statistics. There is a  historical factor behind the overwhelming large proportion of  natives of Hamgyong Provinces in the power elite. It is said  that Kim Il-song was reluctant to employ people from the areas  that were once under the control of UN forces during the Korean  war because, in his opinion, the temporary occupation  compromised their social integrity. For this reason, he filled  key posts with people from the Hamgyong Provinces, particularly  North Hamgyong Province.    On the basis of our analysis of the key figures in the North  Korean power elite and the peculiarities of their personal  connections, we wonder whether it is possible to prognosticate  about the possibility of change in the power structure in North  Korea, particularly the possibility of the Kim Chong-il regime  disintegrating after Kim Il-song dies.    Experts on North Korea admit that the process of succession  of power to Kim Chong-il has progressed successfully. But they  predict that when Kim Il-song dies, the present atmosphere of  unconditional loyalty to Kim Chong-il might undergo considerable  change. Kim Chong-il may be able to take over the reins of  government from Kim Il-song, but it is impossible for him to  inherit his father's charisma. That is why, experts say, there  is bound to be a centrifugal force at work within the power  elite.    Dr. Chon Hyon-chun gave the following estimate about the  possibility of change in the power structure in North Korea:    "The cohesive power of the Kim Chong-il power elite is  stronger than that of the power elite in any other socialist  country. That is why, supposing Kim Chong-il will take control  of North Korea after Kim Il-song dies, it might not be until at  least three to five years after the succession of power that  factional moves begin to appear. If factionalism appears in  North Korea, it will be triggered by strife between the  relatives of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il and a group of expert  bureaucrats who are not their relatives."    In this regard Dr. Kang In-tok says that it is necessary to  watch the first 1.5 generations of revolutionaries as well as  the military. This generation of revolutionaries has been  relatively alienated by the North Korean regime and might find  it difficult to regard Kim Chong-il as a qualified successor to  power. Therefore, when Kim Il-song dies, this generation might  not show much reverence to Kim Chong-il.    In the military are many who have experienced life in the  Soviet Union and East Europe. Therefore, experts say, these  military officers are bound to question the appropriateness of  Kim Chong-il as Kim Il-song's successor when the senior Kim  dies. It is said that as a rule the party controls the military  in a socialist country. However, experts say that this is true  only in peacetime, and in times of emergency the military would  control the party. In this event technocrats might join the  anti-Kim Chong-il move in alliance with the anti-Kim Chong-il  group, although not as its leading force.    If so, we are interested in the question of who could be the  center of the anti-Kim Chong-il force in such an emergency. In  this connection, some observers pay attention to Ambassador to  Bulgaria Kim Pyong-il (41), who is Kim Chong-il's half-brother.  But the dominant view is skeptical about Kim Pyong-il because of  his youth and lack of experience. Nevertheless he remains a  factor to be reckoned with because he resembles Kim Il-song and  is more popular than Kim Chong-il.    We cannot ignore the outlook that, as examined above, the  North Korea power elite would not change so easily. Some critics  question the claim that in North Korea there is conflict between  hard-liners and moderates or between conservatives and  proponents of opening. In the opinion of these critics, we  should not overlook the fact that people like Kim Tal-hyon, who  are regarded as belonging to the group of proponents of opening,  in reality have a strong party spirit as well as expertise and  they are not diehard proponents of reform and opening.    In conclusion, if there is to be any change in the North  Korean power structure, chances are high that change will  appear after Kim Il-song's death. In this event, how the  "powerful" military and the group of expert bureaucrats who have  relatively good rational judgment, as well as the group of  people who are not related to Kim Il-song by blood or marriage  and who have been left out of power, will act will be the most  crucial factor.</p>

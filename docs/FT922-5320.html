			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Greece Fund board to amend structure THE BOARD of Greece Fund, a closed-end investment company listed on the London Stock Exchange, is proposing to amend the fund's structure following complaints that the shares were trading at a large discount to net asset value and were illiquid, writes Sara Webb. The board will seek shareholder approval for the Greece Fund - managed by Schroder Investment Management - to be turned into an open-ended investment company, and will allow investors to redeem their shares at the net asset value. The fund's board has agreed to allow limited redemption of the shares. 'In view of the fact that trading on the Athens stock exchange is still relatively illiquid by international standards, the board believes it necessary at this stage for the redemption right to be restricted  .. to once each quarter', it said in a statement. Up to 25 per cent of the issued shares can be redeemed in the quarter after the new proposals are implemented, and a further 5 per cent of the shares may be redeemed in each subsequent quarter. Schroder Investment Management said that it was unclear whether the fund would be allowed to retain its London listing once it became an open-ended fund. However, the fund is seeking an alternative listing on the Irish Stock Exchange in case it is forced to give up its London listing. The board said it would move the central management and control of the Greece Fund from the UK to Jersey.</p>

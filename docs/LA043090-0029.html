			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OAKLAND BALLET RECONSTRUCTS 'LE TRAIN BLEU'  </P> <P> The great secret of the Oakland Ballet's newly reconstructed "Le Train Bleu" is  immediacy. The setting by sculptor Henri Laurens may slice an ordinary beach  landscape into exotic Cubist planes and angles, but we instantly recognize it  and its inhabitants: sleek bathing beauties in designer swimwear (by Coco  Chanel, no less) and hot musclemen on the make. If we connect with this  long-lost 1924 "operette dansee" through our own direct observation and  experience, so do the dancers. "Train Bleu" may be a fabled relic of Serge  Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but it's also the ancestor of every surf frolic  from "The Boy Friend" to "Beach Blanket Bingo." These young Californians  understand it perfectly. Cast as seaside "poules" and "gigolos," they revel in  the witty mock athleticism of Bronislava Nijinska's choreography, along with  the preening narcissism that she so inventively filters through classical  style.  </P> <P> The pantomimic sexual byplay devised by Jean Cocteau also seems second nature  to them -- and that's crucial, because "Train Bleu" is very much concerned with  people selling themselves to one another. Sometimes the score by Darius Milhaud  becomes an ironic comment on this lust-and-sand milieu -- rather like  Nijinska's pointed references to "Giselle" and "The Sleeping Beauty" -- but  elsewhere the use of familiar '20s idioms makes it sound like pop records  playing in nearby hotels.  </P> <P> Although both Irina Nijinska (the choreographer's daughter) and Frank W. D.  Ries (a Cocteau specialist) had to rely on guesswork as well as scholarship in  assembling their reconstruction, "Le Train Bleu" always feels fully alive in  the present tense.  </P> <P> Indeed, this insistently trivial and topical collaboration -- which also  originally enlisted the contributions of Pablo Picasso and Anton Dolin -- seems  infinitely closer to us than any of the dance masterworks created by Nijinska  or her brother, Vaslav Nijinsky. As the irresistible "Beau Gosse" (Dolin's  character), Michael Lowe can't smoothly switch between mime, gymnastics and  classical bravura, so the role looks imposed on him rather than a  custom-tailored tour de force. But Abra Rudisill makes every seductive flapper  mannerism newly incendiary as "Perlouse" (originally danced by Lydia Sokolova),  a portrayal exactly on target.  </P> <P> Rudisill also gives a valiant but muted performance as Caroline in the  company's valiant but muted production of "Jardin aux Lilas," with Lowe, again,  cast as her lover.  </P> <P> This Sallie Wilson staging of Antony Tudor's 1936 classic settles for clarity  when it needs much more richness of interpretation -- especially in gestural  expression.  </P> <P> Agnes de Mille's aptly titled "Inconsequentials" represents a kind of notebook:  miscellaneous ballet lore and ironic commentary collected over the years and  arranged in 1983 (after two previous versions) to a selection of Schubert piano  and vocal music. The piece presents itself as a cheery, pseudo-folk  divertissement in elegant classical style, but along the way there are  unexpectedly trenchant observations about fatuous male virtuosi, the rhetoric  of dance-drama and the role of women in ballet.  </P> <P> Some of us would rather hear De Mille speak on these subjects than watch them  season a dirndl-and-lederhosen charade. But everything De Mille choreographs is  worth the most careful attention, and "Inconsequentials" does offer more  opportunities to admire Rudisill, and to become acquainted with such Oakland  paragons as Elizabeth Ashton and Joral Schmalle. Taped music accompanied all  three ballets -- with the unsteady (and uncredited) singing in  "Inconsequentials" and the plodding tempos in "Jardin aux Lilas" working  against the best interests of the company.  </P></p>

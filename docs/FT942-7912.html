			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): MoDo - Other companies The Swedish pulp and paper group will almost certainly return to the black when it announces its first-quarter figures on Thursday. Analysts are expecting profits of up to SKr310m (Dollars 40m) after last year's SKr200m deficit. The improvement has been driven by higher pulp and fine paper prices, a better performance at the company's French unit and lower financial costs. MoDo has already indicated that it expects a 1994 profit of more than SKr1bn after last year's SKr449m deficit.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Observer: Cutting the coat Does Naim Attallah, publisher and Asprey's boss, have a better eye for clothes than Martin Taylor, Courtaulds Textiles' outgoing chief executive? When Courtaulds pulled the plug on thirty-something society couturier Arabella Pollen's business in May - after backing it for three years - Taylor's image took a rare knock and the British design world was plunged into deep gloom. Now it is the turn of one of the very few other youngish British designers, 32-year-old Tomasz Starzewski, who has weathered the recession to see Attallah's luxury goods group buy up a controlling share. Actually, the well-connected Pollen, whose father was the former head of Sotheby's in the US, also came to the attention of the ever chivalrous publisher when she started over a decade ago. But they parted company and his eye has turned to Starzewski, a first generation Polish immigrant who took his first step on the ladder from above a Fulham fish and chip shop in which he sewed and slept. But then a hard-nosed businessman like Attallah is no snob.</p>

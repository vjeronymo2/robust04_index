			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IKE'S GRANDDAUGHTER, SOVIET SCIENTIST MARRY;  </P> <P> ROMANCE: IN A STORYBOOK ENDING, A CLOSE ADVISER TO GORBACHEV TAKES THE HAND OF  FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT'S KIN.  </P> <P> Not long ago it would have been too preposterous an idea for any but the most  far-fetched of romantic novels: The granddaughter of a former American  President marrying a top Soviet space scientist and friend of the country's  Communist Party chief.  </P> <P> But the world has been turned on its head since then, and Friday, an idea too  outlandish for fiction became fact. Susan Eisenhower, 38, granddaughter of the  late Dwight D. Eisenhower, married Roald Z. Sagdeyev, 57, adviser to Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and close friend of the late Nobel Peace  laureate and physicist, Andrei D. Sakharov.  </P> <P> Their union, everyone agreed, was both a measure of the political change in the  world and a symbol of hope for its future.  </P> <P> One of the Russian guests even showed up wearing an "I Like Ike" button, which  mysteriously found its way here after one of Dwight Eisenhower's 1950s election  campaigns.  </P> <P> There were two ceremonies, a standard, five-minute civil procedure at a special  Soviet "marriage palace" used for important weddings, followed by a short  religious service at the elegant official residence of U.S. Ambassador Jack F.  Matlock Jr.. The groom, according to one guest at the second ceremony, said his  vows in Russian, the bride in English.  </P> <P> The marriage happened to coincide with an important official visit to Moscow by  Secretary of State James A. Baker III. And it came just two days after a  historic decision by the Soviet Communist Party leadership to move toward a  multi-party system and an American-style presidency -- "convergence" by almost  any standard.  </P> <P> Baker, who would normally have been Matlock's guest at the official Spaso House  residence during his stay, deferred to the wedding and sought quarters  elsewhere. He reportedly did not even make it to the reception because his  talks with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Gorbachev went longer  than expected. But Baker's wife, Susan, was there.  </P> <P> "There have been many joint Soviet-American projects, ranging from space to  biotechnology, but today's 'project' is sui generis (unique)," wrote a  correspondent for the official Tass news agency in his account of the union.  Many other Soviet-American marriages have occurred, he added, but never  involving people of such "high status."  </P> <P> Most of the approximately 300 guests at the Spaso House reception were Soviet  citizens. The media was barred except for a handful of photographers permitted  inside for a five-minute "photo opportunity."  </P> <P> A few clusters of ordinary Russians stood in a park across the street watching  as a parade of official black Volga and Chaika automobiles sped up to the front  gate and disgorged their well-dressed passengers. It was obvious by the large  number and variety of fur coats on display that the animal rights movement has  had little echo here in what American residents sometimes call "The Big Red  Apple."  </P> <P> "Good day, comrades!" said the jovial police guard at the mansion's entrance as  he intercepted arriving guests. "Your invitations, please."  </P> <P> A few of the guests were famous enough that he dispensed with the formality.  "Of course you have an invitation," he remarked to one senior government  official. Then, with a salute, a smile, and a wave toward the entrance, he  invited: "Please!"  </P> <P> Many of the Soviet guests brought gifts, some of them bound in cheap but scarce  white wrapping paper, others carried in plastic bags.  </P> <P> Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, whose face and voice are  familiar to television viewers around the world, struggled up the icy driveway  with his wife gripping his left arm and carrying a large basket of flowers in  his right.  </P> <P> Among other guests were Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, the Russian poet  Yevgeny Yevtushenko, and Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand Hammer.  </P> <P> The bride wore an off-white, two-piece suit. Her daughter by a former marriage  was a flower girl. Sagdeyev also has two grown children from an earlier  marriage, which ended in divorce.  </P> <P> The couple met in Chautauqua, N.Y., three years ago at a conference on  Soviet-American relations. According to the Tass account of the meeting: "At a  reception, the Soviet academician, giving the lie to the widely held view of  the Russians as square and reserved, mounted the stage and, applauded by his  audience, sang 'When the Saints Go Marching In,' and then danced, and danced,  and danced with Susan."  </P> <P> Eisenhower, one of four children of John Eisenhower, later helped transcribe  and edit the English-language version of Sagdeyev's memoirs, which are soon to  be published in the United States.  </P> <P> Eisenhower has called the marriage an indication of how times are changing for  the better. She has said the couple was anxious about the reaction when they  notified Soviet and American authorities of their intention to wed, but that  fortunately their relationship evolved at a time that this country was changing  dramatically.  </P> <P> It all adds up, said the normally unromantic Tass, to a "sensational" love  story.  </P></p>

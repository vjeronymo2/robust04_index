			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / US candidates chase votes on digital superhighway Political candidates in California have discovered that the information superhighway can be a fast and inexpensive route to voters. They are using the Internet, a global network of computers, to answer questions and deliver election campaign pitches in the run-up to next week's US mid-term elections. Fed up with television campaign ads filled with more barbs than substance, thousands of computer users are going online to find out where the candidates stand on issues and to research details of their past records. Over the past month, more than 5,000 people have logged on to the California Online Voter Guide, a non-partisan service funded by groups ranging from the California Teachers' Association to Pacific Bell, the regional telephone company. Many more are accessing Project Vote Smart, a service sponsored by the League of Women Voters that provides voting records, campaign finance data and performance evaluations of candidates by interest groups. Several candidates are using electronic mail to communicate directly with voters. E-mail addresses for the two main gubernatorial candidates in California - incumbent Pete Wilson (Republican) and his challenger Kathleen Brown (Democrat) - have been widely published and their campaign staff regularly answer voters' questions. Both have also participated in online chat sessions with subscribers to America On-line, CompuServe and Prodigy, the commercial online services. Ms Brown also has an electronic presence on the World Wide Web, the fastest growing portion of the Internet which provides easy ways to scan the globe for information resources. To reach voters who do not have home computers, Ms Brown this week set up computer kiosks in San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles. Each kiosk contains an Apple Macintosh personal computer containing a range of information about the candidate, including recordings of some of her campaign speeches. Claiming to break new ground in the use of technology in a political campaign, Ms Brown said that the technology 'combines two elements that have contributed to California's economy and creativity - Hollywood and the Silicon Valley'. When it comes to election day, the Internet will also be the place for up-to-the-minute news on election returns. The full text of the bulky California ballot pamphlet is already online via http://www. election. digital. com and the digital campaign cybertrail is spreading to other states. Through Project Vote Smart, computer terminals laden with voter information are being placed in public libraries in several states. To find out where California's gubernatorial candidates stand on the controversial issues of immigration, taxes and health care in the November 8 election, send E-mail to petewilson@delphi. com or katbrown@netcom. com - and wait to see if the computer promises are kept.</p>

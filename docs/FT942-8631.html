			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shake-up at Galeries Lafayette Galeries Lafayette, one of France's leading retail groups, yesterday announced details of a financial restructuring package and reorganisation of its activities into three divisions. The restructuring follows a period of expansion for Galeries Lafayette. The group, which owns the department stores, two years ago took over Nouvelles Galeries, the general merchandise stores, and last autumn acquired full control of Monoprix, the supermarket and hypermarket chain. It is regrouping its interests into three areas: department stores, popular stores and its service activities. The department stores will be renamed Grands Magasins Galeries Lafayette and its Uniprix chain of general merchandise stores will change its name to Monoprix. Galeries Lafayette is streamlining its financial structure with a FFr15m (Dollars 2.5m) capital increase and by consolidating the ownership of all the holding companies within the group, including Monoprix.</p>

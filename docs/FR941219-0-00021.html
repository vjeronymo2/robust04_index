			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three diversity provisions are added to the regulation in &sect;&sect;1607.3(b)(3), (c) and (d) to require that board members reflect the diversity of the legal and client communities, including such factors as race, ethnicity, gender, and other similar factors. In so doing, the regulation relocates the current section of the rule that relates to diversity among attorney board members, revises the language to incorporate a more up-to-date statement of the concerns addressed by the current subsection, and applies the requirement to all categories of board members. While the language of this final rule specifically mentions race, ethnicity, and gender, it also includes a reference to ``other similar factors'' that may be relevant in a particular legal community and population of the area served by the recipient, which may include, for example, age, physical abilities, and religious belief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule did not have the word ``similar'' as a modifier in the phrase ``other factors.'' Some comments stated that the diversity requirement was too broad and compliance would be difficult if, at the same time, a recipient did not have the authority to select client board members. However, other comments suggested broader areas of diversity, such as experience or expertise in poverty areas, such as housing, education, benefits, homelessness, etc. The Board decided to revise the language to ``other similar factors'' instead of ``other factors.'' This revision is intended to provide sufficient leeway for local programs to determine the appropriate types of diversity in their service areas and to insure that their local boards ``reasonably'' reflect those types of diversity that are relevant to the mission of legal services programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provision does not require mathematical precision, but sets out goals that recipients should strive to achieve. In this regard, &sect;1607.3(h) will allow programs to consult with the appointing organizations to insure that the appointments are made consistent with LSC guidelines. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between allowing no recipient input and giving the recipient the authority to make all appointments. Finally, if necessary and appropriate, the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6 could be utilized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1607.3(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to attorney board members, the rule revises the language of the current rule that is based on the requirements of the McCollum Amendment in the act appropriating funds for the Corporation. The McCollum Amendment requires a majority of the board members to be appointed by appropriate state, county and municipal bar associations. The revision clarifies that the appointments can be made by one or more such bar associations, as long as those bar associations collectively represent a majority of attorneys practicing law in the recipient's service area. If there are minority or gender-based bar associations that represent attorneys practicing in a particular locality, those bar associations may be included in the mix of bar associations that make appointments of attorneys to a recipient's board, especially if their inclusion would help to insure that there is appropriate diversity among the attorney members of the board. In addition, although the rule, consistent with the language of the McCollum Amendment, states that the appointments are to be made by the ``governing bodies'' of the bar associations, the Board recognizes that different bar associations should be free to exercise their appointment responsibility in a manner consistent with their own policies, procedures and practices. The McCollum Amendment does not direct LSC to impose any particular method of appointment on a bar association.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment objected to term limitations on attorney appointments imposed by a state bar and suggested that the rule state specifically that any decisions on term limitations should be made by the recipient as part of its bylaws, rather than by the appointing bar or other organization. The Board did not incorporate the suggested change, because it feels that recipients should be allowed to work out those differences on a local level with the appointing organizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule also adds language which is based on part of the McCollum Amendment to make it clear that national support centers are not required to use the American Bar Association (``ABA'') or a collection of all state bars to appoint their attorney members, simply because they provide service nationally. The rule also recognizes that some recipients, especially Native American or migrant programs, may have offices in one state, but also provide services in one or more adjacent or nearby states. The language is intended to permit those programs, if they so decide, to have the bar associations of the other states in which they provide service make appointments as well as the bar of the state in which their principal office is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the additional ten percent of the board members who must be attorneys, but who are not covered by the McCollum Amendment, the final rule now explicitly states what is implicit in the language of the current regulation, i.e., that they may be selected by the recipient's governing body, if it so chooses. The rule does change the current regulation with respect to the additional ten percent of attorney board members in one respect, however. Under the current regulation, the additional attorneys must be representatives of bar associations or other legal organizations, e.g., law schools. This requirement is not contained in the LSC Act. Under this revised regulation, the recipient may select attorneys who are not representatives of any particular bar or legal organization, or may select attorneys who are affiliated with non-legal organizations, as long as they are admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, and as long as the organization has an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor. Thus, the recipient may select lawyers who represent the business community or the United Way and who could be helpful in fundraising, or lawyers who provide substantial pro bono services to the client community and could be helpful in designing a recipient's private attorney involvement program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The distinguishing characteristics of a standby letter of credit for risk-based capital purposes is the combination of irrevocability with the fact that funding is triggered by some failure to repay or perform an obligation. Thus, any commitment (by whatever name) that involves an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> irrevocable  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> obligation to make a payment to the customer or to a third-party in the event the customer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> fails to repay  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> an outstanding debt obligation or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> fails to perform  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> a contractual obligation is treated, for risk-based capital purposes, as respectively, a financial guarantee standby letter of credit or a performance standby. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A loan commitment, on the other hand, involves an obligation (with or without a material adverse change or similar clause) of the banking organization to fund its customer  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> in the normal course  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> of business should the customer seek to draw down the commitment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sale and repurchase agreements and asset sales with recourse (to the extent not included on the balance sheet) and forward agreements also are converted at 100 percent. <FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>  So-called ``loan strips'' (that is, short-term advances sold under long-term commitments without direct recourse) are treated for risk-based capital purposes as assets sold with recourse and, accordingly, are also converted at 100 percent. The definition of the term ``recourse'' is set forth in section III.B.5 of this appendix A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 48 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the regulatory reports and under GAAP, bank holding companies are permitted to treat some asset sales with recourse as ``true'' sales. For risk-based capital purposes, however, such assets sold with recourse and reported as ``true'' sales by bank holding companies are converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the underlying obligor or, if relevant the guarantor or nature of the collateral, provided that the transactions meet the definition of assets sold with recourse, including the sale of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages, that is contained in the instructions to the commercial bank Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report). Accordingly, the entire amount of any assets transferred with recourse that are not already included on the balance sheet, including pools of 1- to 4-family residential mortgages, is to be converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, or if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. In certain recourse transactions the amount of the institution's contractual liability may be limited to an amount less than the effective risk-based capital requirement for the assets being transferred with recourse. In such cases, the amount of total capital that must be maintained against the transaction is equal to the maximum amount of possible loss under the recourse provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with certain drawdown at a specified future date. Such obligations include forward purchases, forward deposits placed, <FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>  and partly-paid shares and securities; they do not include commitments to make residential mortgage loans or forward foreign exchange contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Forward forward deposits accepted are treated as interest rate contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Securities lent by a banking organization are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk of loss. If a banking organization, as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify the customer against loss, then the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively, a banking organization lends its own securities, or acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the obligor, to any collateral delivered to the lending banking organization, or, if applicable, to the independent custodian acting on the lender's behalf. Where a banking organization is acting as agent for a customer in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that is collateralized by cash delivered to the banking organization, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit in the banking organization for purposes of determining the appropriate risk weight category, provided that any indemnification is limited to no more than the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received and any reinvestment risk associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <CFRNO>12 CFR Chapter III</CFRNO> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Authority and Issuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposes to amend part 325 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 325_CAPITAL MAINTENANCE <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jiro Yamaguchi, Hokkaido University professor: </F> "Promising Political Scientist Probes the Depths of `Blueprint  for Building a New Japan'"]    [Text] Stereotyped Criticisms Are Inapplicable    It has been my assignment for a considerable period of time  to comment on Ichiro Ozawa's actions. When he organized the  so-called Ozawa study group during his days in the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) and resolutely proposed national security  measures and constitutional revisions for Japan, I made or  published comments in response to a number of requests from  newspapers and periodicals. At that time, coupled with my  impression that he might be someone who thought out matters much  more thoroughly than the leftist politicians, frankly speaking,  I was greatly perplexed that he might be a new type of  politician not found in the traditional LDP.    My intuition that the stereotyped criticisms against the  traditional LDP politicians were not applicable to him was not  mistaken even in the light of his subsequent actions. Thinking  that carefully thought-out logic must be readied when  criticizing Ozawa, I had deferred finalizing comments on Ozawa.    My thoughts were further strengthened after comparing my  publication, Political Reform (Iawanami Shinsho),  which did not sell as well, but which was published at about the  same time last year as Ozawa's bestseller, Blueprint for  Building a New Japan (Kodansha). As though he perceived my  perplexity, Takashi Mikuri (Tokyo Metropolitan University  professor), a political scientist whom I respect, submitted the  following comments to the YOMIURI SHIMBUN readers' section:    "Above all, the most striking parts of Yamaguchi's book  (Political Reform) and Ozawa's book (Blueprint  for Building a New Japan), which should basically assume  antithetical positions, are the aggressiveness shown in the  desire for reform. The views toward `reform' of Yamaguchi, who  is farthest from power, and Ozawa, who has been in the center of  power, are in agreement to an astonishing degree. Thus, `reform'  proposals by amateurs and professionals will begin to coincide  on a concrete level before Japan reaches the 21st century" (5  July 1993 issue of YOMIURI SHIMBUN).  <H5>  For Competitive System Rather Than Linkage </H5>   It is true that regarding criticisms against closed politics  under the 1955 setup, which I will touch upon later, my  assertions and Ozawa's arguments have many points in common.  However, I cannot get rid of the feeling that I want to avoid  the role of waving the political reform banner by siding with  Ozawa-style "political reform." What is necessary now for  political scientists is to present a vision of creating a  healthy competitive system within Japanese politics. If Ozawa's  paradigm becomes the next fixed framework of Japanese politics,  Hosokawa's coalition regime would become a repetition of Konoe's  supportive government and if I link up with this trend, then I  would probably be called a "pocket edition" of Sadaji Yabe  (Tokyo University professor--then, Fumimaro Konoe's "brain"). I  do not know with what intention Mikuri wrote that comment, but  if only Ozawa's paradigm existed in 21st century Japan, that  would be termed a great tragedy.    At any rate, at present, when the one-party rule by the LDP  has ended and reorganization of the party system has entered the  second round, the stage of discovering common points in  criticism against the old system and marshaling energy to  destroy the old setup is ending. Of course, as indicated by the  difficulties in passing the political reform bill, great  political efforts are needed to eliminate long standing abuses,  but the task that is called for hereafter is the development of  various ideas regarding a political design under the next party  system. Also, when that task is undertaken, the Blueprint  for Building a New Japan will be an unavoidable publication  presenting concepts for the next generation. When the political  force to oppose Ozawa's Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] group is  organized, too, the plan for the new political force will  probably be formulated in refutation of this book.    As mentioned frequently, there might be a question as to  whether this is Ozawa's individual work, but as long as it is a  book published after his perusal and in his name, it is not  improper to treat him as a political theorist or strategist. The  very fact that he gathered outstanding brain trusters and  published the book with precise timing might be said to be a  testimony to his excellence as strategist. In view of Ozawa's  performances and activities as a politician, particularly in  relation to corruption, I do not deny the importance of the type  of criticisms (so-called "settlement disputes"), which cast  doubts on the credibility of his arguments, but a number of  scathing articles have already been written about that point.  Here, I want to accept the publication at face value and  consider future Japanese politics through internal scrutiny of  Ozawa's assertions.  <H5>  Assessment of 1955 Setup and Postwar Generation </H5>   As a premise to this discussion, there must be clarification  as to the type of problems that existed in postwar Japanese  politics, particularly in politics under the 1955 setup, and the  reform courses that are considered necessary. Also, as mentioned  earlier in relation to Mikuri's comments, I believe that shared,  rather than confrontational, awareness is stronger between Ozawa  and me regarding this point. For example, the following section  of Blueprint for Building a New Japan is practically  the same as my criticisms of the 1955 setup:    "Entrusting the maintenance of international order entirely  to the United States, Japan concentrated solely on economic  development and distribution of assets resulting from it. Things  went smoothly if budget allocations were made as fairly as  possible, considering opposition parties' demands. Reaching such  consultative agreements was the essence of politics. There were  no serious discussions about the path Japan should pursue nor  truly intense confrontations regarding policies. (Omission).  Unnoticed, the democratic principle that there should be a  change between ruling and opposition parties was forgotten and  the existence of a perennial government party and perpetual  opposition party was no longer considered strange" (page 65,  said publication).    Regarding such summarization of postwar politics by Ozawa,  as  to whether there is agreement or perhaps, reluctant acceptance  of the statement, or conversely, opposition, I feel that rather  than differences in individual feelings, differences between  generations in how they interpret postwar politics begin to  show. For example, Takeshi Kobo (Nagoya University professor), a  political scientist born in 1954, states in an outstanding  article on Ozawa expressing his personal viewpoint, "Can  Leftists Oppose Ichiro Ozawa?" (monthly periodical JOKYO,  November 1993): "As a person committed to the reformist or  leftist side, I have a number of objections to such  summarization of postwar politics but, ultimately, it is a hard  fact that the opposition could not alter such a structure so I  believe that the foregoing generalization must be accepted  basically."  <H5>  Disillusioned With Allotted Roles </H5>   As for myself and my juniors, who were born at about the  same  time as the formation of the 1955 setup, we have watched  consultative politics since our childhood. Those of us who were  born after the mid-1950's are not directly aware of postwar  reformist glories, such as the protect-the-Constitution movement  and the 1960 Security Treaty demonstrations. Also, we haven't  had the experience of peering at the true nature of political  movements and power displays through college student uprisings.    While harboring various dissatisfactions with real politics,  we had been greatly frustrated by the absence of a political  entity to replace the LDP regime. While hoping for political  reform through changes in government reins, we had been  expecting the emergence of a reformist force led by the Social  Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ). However, upon observing that  the opposition to administration, which should traditionally be  an indispensable element in democracy, was nothing more than an  allotted role, as scripted in the 1955 setup, disillusionment  with the existing reformist political party only deepened.    Generational differences in viewpoints on the role to be  performed by the reformist force are serious and the differences  were accentuated suddenly when the coalition regime was formed.  Evaluation of the coalition regime and assessment of Ozawa's  awareness of the times are closely related. For those of us born  in the 1950's who believe the historic roles of the LDP and SDPJ  have ended, Ozawa's criticism of the 1955 setup might be said to  have an appeal because of its explicitness.  <H5>  Structure of Postwar Democracy and Nonuse of Power </H5>   Ozawa's criticism of consultative politics also thrust upon  us the issue of political power in postwar democracy that had  been shelved for a long period. During the days when the  one-party rule by the LDP was an axiomatic premise, persons  critical of the LDP followed, though regretfully, the  stereotyped thinking that those in power were the rascals on the  other side and that clean, just persons were all opposed to  power. Neither power nor leadership was a subject taken up  seriously in postwar political discussions. Of course, the  framework to protect people's rights is inadequate in Japan and  the importance of the "freedom-from-power" issue has not  diminished, but the thinking was never prevalent that laws and  systems should be altered by having the side which respects  rights gain the majority or take over the government.    On the other hand, the LDP government which had the power  did  exercise physical force, at times, to protect the setup but  generally, rather than settling matters by using power, it took  steps more often to cajole by saving the honor of the opposing  side. Politics lost the capability to handle problems with  entangled interests and the reality that vested rights, once  acquired, cannot be disposed of in spite of the criticisms of  numerous citizens is deeply tied to the tradition of postwar  politics to evade the use of power. To use a phrase that was  popular in the past, Japanese politics is a hollow structure and  it is impossible to tell where power resides.  <H5>  Formulate Plan for Freedom To Gain Power </H5>   In contrast, Ozawa points out the crime of not using power.  Also, he proposes reforms in cabinet organization and election  system to create strong authority and clarify responsibilities.  As is well known, regarding this point, there are criticisms  about suppression of minority views and stage setting to achieve  strong authoritative rule. However, in light of the development  of Japanese politics which has been tossed about since the  1980's by foreign pressure such as "input from the flank"  (Takeshi Sasaki, Tokyo University professor), mentioned in an  article, and because subjective identification and solution of  problems had been abandoned, the creation of political  leadership through the choice of the people themselves has  become a task of far more importance than ever before, as  pointed out by Ozawa. In other words, together with freedom from  power, a concrete plan for "freedom to gain power" is probably  being sought by the people.    In the first place, under the parliamentary cabinet system,  like in Japan and UK, the majority party in the parliament  controls the legislature and simultaneously wields the  administrative power. In other words, the fusion of the two  powers, legislative and administrative, takes place through the  ruling party. The basic image of party politics under the  parliamentary cabinet system is for the party, which took over  the government reins, to strive for the implementation of  policies that it pledged to the populace by using its powerful  authority and for the people to pass judgment at the next  election and replace the ruling party if its performance is  found to be unsatisfactory. In that sense, Ozawa's assertion is  not in any way an irrational argument to support dictatorship.    This form of parliamentary cabinet system will not destroy  democracy only if there are multiple political forces competing  ceaselessly for power. It is not unreasonable if many  intellectuals should consider it a nightmare if, within a  framework of strengthened leadership, the party led by Ozawa  should continue a lengthy one-party rule as the LDP did. The  problem is whether there is a political force that can vie for  governmental power with the party led by Ozawa. Arguments that  the past system of rivalrous politics or zoku Dietmen politics  are less harmful than the deployment of Ozawa-style leadership  will not stand up, at all, against his reform proposal. It is  the urgent task of those engaged in Japanese politics to propose  changes through substantive policies and concepts while  cooperating with the effort to eliminate from political arenas,  such as the cabinet and Diet, the obstacles which traditionally  curtailed creativity and responsiveness in Japanese politics.  <H5>  External Policies and National Model for Japan </H5>   When envisioning another design to oppose the paradigm  portrayed by Ozawa, the most significant confrontational point  is the question of Japan's national image and position in the  world. Views regarding this point are closely intertwined with  the question of how the locus of postwar Japan should be  assessed. Earlier, I stated that I agree with Ozawa's criticisms  of the 1955 setup, but what becomes a problem is the disparity  between overall postwar politics and the party politics  arrangement called the 1955 setup. According to Ozawa, postwar  Japan was a "special country" which fervently pursued prosperity  for its own country without hardly bearing any costs for peace  and freedom and if so, politics under the 1955 setup would be  the ultimate in special politics suited to a special country.    However, it seems that condemning postwar politics in such a  manner is a one-sided viewpoint. It is a fact that postwar Japan  was successful in its development because it enjoyed the world's  public assets without, charge but it is not particularly strange  for a developing country to be exempted from shouldering the  costs of international public resources. In the future, Japan  may have to take the initiative in fulfilling its responsibility  to provide international support but in that event, it is  probably necessary to analyze the positive and negative aspects  of the locus of Japanese development with the intent of  furnishing a model for succeeding countries. Also, when  presenting the Japanese experience as a universal model, the  important factor must not be overlooked that Japan avoided  spending resources on the military under the postwar  Constitution and followd the course of a "civilian power"  (Yoichi Funabashi, ASAHI SHIMBUN's U.S. Bureau chief). It can be  said that Ozawa's hyperintense irritation with postwar Japan is  giving the impression to many persons that is trying to  repudiate all facets of postwar peace.  <H5>  One-Nation Peace Doctrine and Santa Claus </H5>   Ozawa will probably refute this by point saying people are  misinterpreting his arguments. However, upon reading his  Blueprint for Building a New Japan," one will notice that  there is a contradiction in his attitude toward the "one-nation  peace doctrine" that he should be criticizing. On the one hand,  he is admonishing Japanese who have become accustomed to  prosperity that "the world is not that generous"; but on the  other hand, he is saying that maintaining the wealth of Japanese  is the mission of politics and is making big promises to people  about tax reductions and public investment increases. The  one-nation peace doctrine is not a patent of the SDPJ, which had  been an opposition party, but actually the paradigm built up by  successive LDP regimes which had exercised national power. Ozawa  himself had received training as a politican within this  paradigm. Plans to augment the Shinkansen lines and expressway  network, which are described in the said publication, are only  rehash of the "Japanese Archipelago Reconstruction," a plan that  should be considered bankrupt. Since he is the disciple of  Kakuei Tanaka, he probably cannot detach himself from the maxim  of LDP politics since Tanaka that "development is good."    If he is claiming that Japan must pay more of the costs of  world peace and freedom, he should explain carefully to the  people that politics is not the function of passing out benefits  freely to various regions and groups in the country. With  respect to the tax reform bill to reduce income taxes and secure  public works revenues by increasing the consumption tax rate, he  has presented plausible estimates. However, for example, if  running costs, subsequent to the construction of generally  unprofitable Shinkansen lines and expressways, are to be paid  for through the citizens' taxes, the burden on the people will  certainly increase beyond his estimates. To undertake  international contributions externally and to spread benefits  internally, like in the archipelago reconstruction scheme, is  simply following the past LDP's all-inclusive party course of  currying the favor of all groups. Isn't the strong authority  sought by Ozawa intended to serve in establishing policy  priorities clearly and not in enacting the role of a generous  Santa Claus for all groups?    Also, if I were asked what point we should really reflect on  in postwar politics, I think that the biggest mistake was to  believe that quantitative expansion of the economy was of utmost  value and to ruin our country through indiscrimate granting  common public works, In order to polish the image of postwar  Japan, the task to reassess the prosperity and development  course pursued until now will be essential in the search for the  next political direction.  <H5>  Changes in Confrontation Over Constitution </H5>   Assessment of postwar Japan is linked closely to the  interpretation of the postwar Constitution. Ozawa's contribution  to the discussions on the Constitution deserves special  attention. His greatest achievement is the breakdown of the  pattern that "conservatives are forces for constitutional  revision" and the presentation of concrete proposals toward  realization of his concept of the constitutional doctrine. In  other words, support of the Constitution is no longer the  exclusive right of the Constitution protection forces and they,  too, are being pressed to present concrete ideas on how to carry  out the constitutional principles. In the Blueprint for  Building a New Japan, the importance of values advocated  heretofore by progressives, such as respect for individuals and  decentralization of control, are emphasized so Ozawa should  probably be regarded as someone who shares the basic principles  associated with politics, such as human rights and democracy. I  welcome the fact that from the hardened confrontational pattern  of pro- and anti-Constitution revision forces under the 1955  setup, a competitive arena to deal with constitutional  principles is finally emerging.    At a glance, Ozawa's contention appears to be extremely  universal. In particular, his proposal to maintain a standby UN  force in Japan and to conduct overseas actions of Japanese armed  units only under UN supervision is clearly different from the  policy of expanding externally in pursuit of national interests.  Actually, a similar idea had already been presented in 1959 in  the midst of the Cold War by Yoshikazu Sakamoto (presently, an  associate member of International Christian University's Peace  Research Institute) in his essay, "Defense Concept for a Neutral  Japan" (carried in the publication, International Politics  in the Nuclear Age, by Iwanami Shoten). (There are  differences between the two parties on the extent to which Japan  should participate in UN police activities.) There is historic  irony in the fact that this idea gained reality with the  collapse of the Cold War structure and, moreover, is being  presented by the standard bearer of the new conservative party.    Thus, it must be recognized that there is a certain logic in  Ozawa's externally directed thoughts. Therefore, when  criticizing them, it is unfair to disbelieve what he has stated  explicity and to denounce his probable intentions by imagining  what he has not written. To criticize his policies, it is  essential to carefully consider his situational awareness on  which his views are premised.  <H5>  Ozawa Thinks Constitution Is "Commandment" </H5>   As far as I can tell, Ozawa's perception of the current  situation is as described below. With respect to nonuse of  military power in international society, postwar Japan spent  half a century compliant and confined. However, now that Japan  has become a great economic power with worldwide influence and  the possibility of cooperation among the big powers, centered on  UN, has widened with the end of the Cold War, it is essential  for Japan to reenter international society by stepping out of  its confinement and participating in various activities, whether  military or nonmilitary, in order to "occupy an honorable  position in international society." Meanwhile, as far as the  current situation of the international society is concerned, the  control of the superpowers has loosened with the collapse of the  Cold War structure and conditions are closer to anarchy than  heretofore. Therefore, military power is still required to  resolve conflicts and preserve order.    It might be said that for Ozawa, the constitutional  stipulation of pacifism is only a commandment imposed on Japan,  which was defeated in World War II, to refrain from using  military power for national interests. Therefore, there are no  restrictions, at all, for Japan to participate in military  activities under the UN flag.  <H5>  Allegory of the Fall of Carthage </H5>   The question is whether or not it is correct to apply to the  constitutional pacifism or demilitarization concept the special  interpretation that it was a "commandment" imposed on Japan in  1945. That is related to the assessment of military  effectiveness in the post-Cold War international society. It  seems that Ozawa is thoroughly convinced that it is a natural  state for international society to be ruled by power. For  example, he draws on the allegory of the fall of Carthage to  warn the Japanese who are accustomed to peace. "Unlike Venice,  this country (Carthage) built up its military force with  mercenaries assembled through unsparing use of its wealth. For  this reason, it was eventually defeated by the Roman army made  up mainly of farmers. Carthage had far greater wealth than Rome,  but the thinking that it could defend the country only with  money proved fatal" (page 106, Blueprint for Building a  New Japan).    The implication is that the rule of international society in  the late 20th century has not changed much since the days of  Rome. The singular change probably noted by Ozawa is that since  it has become difficult in the late 20th century for any country  to secure its national safety with only its military force,  there is an urgent need to establish a joint force with each  country contributing.  <H5>  Proof That Power Is Secondary </H5>   However, it can also be said that this type of thinking,  which appears at a glance to be realistic, is really overlooking  the changes in the world. The biggest change is that  establishment of rules through negotiations between past  enemies, as shown by the reconciliation between Israel and PLO  and the abolishment of apartheid in South Africa, has become the  motivating force to create peace. To guarantee observance of the  rule, some force might be needed but, in any event, power is  secondary.    Conversely, as shown by the internal wars among African  nations, peace cannot be secured no matter how the advanced  countries try to intervene militarily as long as the concerned  parties want to fight. To put it extremely, for settlement of  the stalemated regional conflicts, the only solution might be to  wait for an antiwar feeling to emerge after warring parties get  tired of fighting like at the time of Germany's Thirty Year War.    Also, Japan's ineptness in the Gulf war seems to have left  deep scars internally in Ozawa, but even in the Gulf war the  United States was unable to exercise military power to force  upon Iraq the order that it desired and had to be satisfied with  the liberation of Kuwait.  <H5>  Idealism and Realism Twisted </H5>   As for making peace through negotiations, it can be said  that, learning from experience, human beings are making progress  slowly. It can also be said that, as for continuing rapacious  killings for ethnic and religious reasons, human beings have not  made any progress. In either case, the effectiveness of military  power as a means to resolve conflicts has been diminishing with  the passage of time. In that sense, the demilitarization concept  of the Constitution is pointing the direction that times should  follow. That is definitely not a commandment that Japan, blamed  for an aggressive war, had accepted reluctantly.    The thinking that international cooperation based on good  intentions will build peace was called an unrealistic dream in  the past by conservatives. However, looking at the world today,  one will realize that sustainable peace will emerge only though  such a process. In that sense, it is important to maintain  idealism. However, in the case of Ozawa, his overoptimism that  use of military power, based on international cooperation, will  create freedom and peace is a matter of concern. One should be  cautious that a "peace creation strategy," based on good  intentions, might bring about unintended results. It is not  certain whether Ozawa's concept, which delved into the military  sphere of national security, will truly lead to the creation of  peace.  <H5>  What Is an Ordinary Country? </H5>   According to Ozawa, international society is still in a  natural state and Japan should become an ordinary member of  international society, bearing responsibility for security by  arms. The symbol of an ordinary country has an attractive ring  to people who are dissatisfied that Japan only accumulates  wealth and does not gain any respect from international society.  The will to despise fanatical devotion to money is important,  but the question that must be considered is what constitutes  ordinariness.    Actually, in a changing world society, it is not clear what  can be regarded as ordinary. Of course, no matter how  enthusiastic he is about military contributions, Ozawa must not  be considering military superpowers, such as the United States  or PRC, as the ordinary countries he is aiming for. Then, are  countries like UK and France, which are permanent members of the  UN Security Council, possess nuclear power, and conduct skilled  diplomacy, to be considered as ordinary? Or, are countries like  Sweden and Canada, called the middle powers, which participate  in UN policing actions but maintain a certain distance from the  military strategies of superpowers and contribute to peace, the  ordinary countries? Or, are countries like India and Brazil,  which wield strong political and military influence in their  respective regions, the ordinary countries?  <H5>  Solution Not Found To Resolving Complicated Conflicts </H5>   In Ozawa's vocabulary, an ordinary country means a country  which shares costs necessary to provide international support,  including military assistance, but the extent of participation  in contributing support in the area of military power differs  greatly with countries. In ways to participate, there is no  single formula or a simple "ordinary" way; many countries are  participating through various means. You cannot say that,  because a country took the lead and participated in a  large-scale armed intervention, like in the Gulf war, it is  ordinary. In fact, the views of many researchers are in  agreement that the scenario of obvious aggression followed by  the simple act of subjugating villains, as in the Gulf war, is  not likely to occur frequently in the future. How to cope with  much more complicated regional conflicts is still an unsolved  question. UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's plan for a  peacekeeping force, which is believed to have influenced Ozawa's  "peace creation strategy," is not likely to be implemented  smoothly, as shown by the Somalia case.    There is widespread public agreement that Japan should play  a  bigger role in solving conflicts in various parts of the world  and in eliminating hunger and poverty. Also, it seems that  arguments are strengthening in politics to move toward approval  of Japanese participation in UN police actions when those  engaged in conflicts desire peace and try to establish an  orderly framework through negotiations. I believe that what is  essential now in discussions on foreign policies is the  clarification of Japan's independent stance regarding provision  of international support, particularly the setting of a ceiling  on commitment to military forces. The term, "ordinary country,"  is still a vague symbol and many persons naturally fear that  Japan would be dragged into a quagmire of military interventions  when they hear the term.  <H5>  Political Reorganization and Formation of Anti-Ozawa Forces </H5>   By the time this article is published, the issue of the  political reform bill would probably have been settled.  Regardless of the outcome of the political reform bill, looking  at the hard feelings created among the political parties during  deliberations on the bill, I think it is certain that Japanese  politics will move toward the second round of reorganization.  When that happens, the ruling parties which make up the  coalition regime will probably be unable to unite. The SDPJ will  be split, the LDP will also be wavering, and the groping toward  a new political party will continue for a while. In that  process, it appears certain that the group comprised of  Shinseito, led by Ozawa, and Komeito will take the initiative.  In the media and press, comments are made often that there is  fear Ozawa and Taisaku Ikeda would grasp the power in Japan.  However, to think that a united Shinseito-Komeito force can  establish a stable one-party rule like the LDP in the past is an  overestimation of Ozawa. It might be said that Ozawa's power is  growing even more because journalists and scholars overrate him  and fear him for no reason.    Ozawa is undoubtedly an outstanding theorist, but his  excellence is best shown in his bold criticisms of and disregard  for the common sense and long standing rules of the special  political circle called Nagata-cho. Therefore, those who are  most knowledgeable about his excellence are politicians in the  circle, reporters of political departments that act as the  circle's organ, and scholars who conduct studies of the circle.  For the general populace which is unfamiliar with the internal  conditions of politics, he appears as an interesting or  dangerous politician who attacks the old framework recklessly  and creates disturbances.    When he uses "strong-arm tactics," Nagata-cho insiders stand  in fear, but the average citizen ignores him with unexpected  coolness as during the 1991 Tokyo gubernatorial election.  Perhaps his justification for trying to destroy the old order is  not understood by the people. Although he was able to clear  himself of suspicion in the publicized general contractor  scandal, because of the "undefinable nature" that Ozawa has, the  possibility remains that the Ozawa group might become, in  political terms, a "denial party" (a party from which even  citizens who are not interested in politics want to deny votes).  To avoid that, he must polish the national image that he is  aiming for; to evade the criticism that his acts belie his  words, he must present specific policies to materialize the  values of personal freedom and independence.    In any event, our task as we approach the 21st century is to  form a political force which can present a vision and national  image to counter his ordinary country and to create the  competition for governmental power.

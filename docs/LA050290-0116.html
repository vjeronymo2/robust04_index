			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES 5-YEAR HOUSING PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved a state-mandated local housing  plan that spells out the city's strategy for dealing with housing needs in the  next five years.  </P> <P> The plan calls for building 1,823 new dwelling units by 1995, with about  one-third of those for low-income residents.  </P> <P> The city also promised to continue its mobile home rent-control program and  issue loans for home rehabilitation in the Los Rios area.  </P> <P> City staff members noted that severe cuts in federal housing programs, a lack  of land for development and high property costs made it difficult to meet some  of the state's requirements regarding affordable housing.  </P> <P> The housing plan is an element of the city's General Plan, the blueprint for  local residential and commercial development. The plan must be revised every  five years and submitted to the state for approval.LAURA MICHAELIS  </P></p>

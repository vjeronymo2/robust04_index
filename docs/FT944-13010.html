			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / International Company News: JAL returns to the black Japan Air Lines disclosed unrealised foreign exchange losses of Y43.9bn (Dollars 453m) as it reported a return to profits in the first half of 1994. The airline said the losses result from a purchase of Dollars 3.6bn in 10-year forward contracts dating from 1986, which the company made to hedge the risk of buying US dollars to pay for aircraft procurement. Since JAL bought the forward contracts the yen has appreciated sharply, resulting in huge unrealised losses to JAL. The company will not disclose any past losses resulting from the contracts. However, new finance ministry regulations required JAL to disclose its remaining unrealised losses of Y43.9bn which represents the difference between the amount in yen that JAL will pay for the dollars it is committed to buying and the market rate. The disclosure comes as JAL announced a turnround in its business performance on the strength of increased overseas travel by Japanese. In the six months to September, JAL revenues rose 5 per cent to Y526.4bn from Y500.4bn a year earlier. Recurring profits improved to Y20.6bn from a loss of Y7.9bn and net income was Y11.7bn against a net loss of Y3.4bn. Total accumulated loss for the company still amounted to Y43.4bn against Y55.1bn at the end of the last fiscal year. New lower economy class fares and the yen's rise led to a sharp gain in international passengers, numbers increasing by 16 per cent and revenue from international travel rising 12 per cent. The airline expects the rest of the year to bring similar conditions to the first half. It forecasts sales of Y1,020bn against Y982bn, recurring profits of Y1bn against a Y26.2bn loss and break-even at the net level against a Y26.2bn loss. The company is undergoing a major restructuring and will pass both the interim and final dividend.</p>

			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Make the most of National Savings - Ways of getting an income from the government's tax-free products MANY private investors must have considered the tax advantages and attractive returns offered by National Savings certificates. The snag is that those National Savings products which offer a fixed return pay no income for five years; and those which pay a regular income do not offer a fixed return. A number of readers have written to ask whether it is possible to obtain a decent income by cashing in the fixed certificates on a regular basis over the five-year period. The problem with such a strategy is that the return on certificates is carefully slanted towards those who retain their investment for the full five years. Early encashment means a lower return overall. For example, on the current 36th issue, the rate of returns are as follows: during the first year (nil); after one year (5.5 per cent); after two years (6 per cent); after three years (6.75 per cent); after four years (7.5 per cent); after five years (8.5 per cent). The best strategy of all is to buy certificates on a regular basis so that one can enjoy the full returns in five years time. This is obviously an approach that can be followed by those who are nearing retirement. Others who are have already retired will not be able to wait that long, however. Accordingly I have constructed a number of strategies which use the certificates for short term income. (All I used was a calculator; readers can create their own strategies to suit individual needs.) Each strategy assumes an initial investment of Pounds 10,000. Strategy One aims to create a level income over the five years while ensuring that the full Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment in 1997. The fact that certificates are sold in Pounds 25 units makes it difficult to ensure that the income is completely level. But as the table shows, by encashing successively Pounds 775, Pounds 725, Pounds 675 and Pounds 625 worth of initial units in the first four years, the investor will receive an income of between Pounds 814 and Pounds 834 a year. In the final year (1997), the investor is left with Pounds 7,200 of his original Pounds 10,000 of certificates. They mature with a value of Pounds 10,826.33, allowing him to take Pounds 826.33 as income and leave the Pounds 10,000 initial capital intact. The investor would be around Pounds 920 down on the return he would have made had he kept the full Pounds 10,000 in the certificates for five years. For comparison, a basic rate taxpayer would have to earn around 10.9 per cent gross from the building society in each year to get the same net annual income. A top rate taxpayer would have to earn around 13.7 per cent gross. The current redemption yields on five year gilts are between 9 and 9.5 per cent, but these are subject to income tax. Strategy Two aims for a growing income. As the table shows, this system produces a somewhat lower return in the early years (by encashing fewer certificates) but a higher income is earned in 1996 and 1997. By cashing in successively Pounds 700, Pounds 700, Pounds 675 and Pounds 650, this system gets an annual increase in income of between 4.4 and 8.1 per cent. Again, the strategy ensures that Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment in 1997. Overall, this means that the investor is around Pounds 880 down on the return that would have been achieved by keeping in the Pounds 10,000 for the full five years. Strategy Three is designed for those who need the maximum income, and are prepared to see a capital loss. It is designed to produce an income of Pounds 1,000 a year, by surrendering certificates worth Pounds 950, Pounds 900, Pounds 825 and Pounds 750 in successive years. By 1997, this high encashment rate means that only Pounds 6,565 of the original investment is left. If the investor takes a Pounds 1,000 income that year, then he will be left with only Pounds 8,871 to reinvest. In addition, he will have made a return Pounds 1,147 less than if he had left the Pounds 10,000 in for five years. What about the other national savings investments? The return on the index-linked certificates varies, of course, with the rate of inflation so one could not be certain of the returns achieved. It is therefore uncertain for those who want to be sure of their income. The capital bonds are also a difficult case. They are designed to pay 11.5 per cent per annum if held for five years. But although they pay no income until the five years are up, the investor must pay tax on the notional interest received each year (a fact which is far from clear in the advertisements for the product). So these bonds are best used for income by non-taxpayers. In the first year, the return is zero; after one year 7 per cent; in the second 8.75 per cent; in the third 11 per cent; in the fourth 13.75 per cent; and in the fifth 17.3 per cent. So Pounds 10,000 invested now would grow to Pounds 10,700 in 1993; Pounds 11,636 in 1994; Pounds 12,916 in 1995; Pounds 14,692 in 1996; and Pounds 17,234 in 1997. Strategy Four aims for a level income from the capital bonds. Bonds are sold in Pounds 100 lumps, so it is difficult to get a precisely steady income, but once again, Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment. Note an important caveat, three months notice is needed for early encashment. By encashing bonds worth Pounds 1,000, Pounds 900, Pounds 800 and Pounds 700 in successive years, this strategy produces a very healthy annual income. But the investor ends up around Pounds 1,680 down on the returns he would have achieved by leaving the money in for the full five years. The new Pounds 50,000 limit (up from Pounds 25,000) for National Savings income bonds took effect from April 30.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STRATEGY ONE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                  Capital         Units        Income                      retained      encashed      received                      (Pounds)      (Pounds)      (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993                    9,225           775        817.63 1994                    8,500           725        814.61 1995                    7,825           675        821.12 1996                    7,200           625        834.67 1997                      n/a         7,200        826.33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- After taking income in 1997, Pounds 10,000 is left for reinvestment.

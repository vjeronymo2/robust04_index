			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / The Guinness Appeals: Decision may take two weeks MR Ernest Saunders, Mr Anthony Parnes and Mr Gerald Ronson must wait another two to three weeks before learning whether they have won their appeals against their convictions in the Guinness trial. The Court of Appeal yesterday finished hearing the appeals, which Lord Justice Neill said raised important and difficult issues. He said it would be at least a fortnight before he and Mr Justice Ognall and Mr Justice Owen would be able to give their judgment. If they dismiss the appeals against conviction, they will go on to hear appeals against the sentences imposed on the three men at the end of the trial last August. Mr Saunders, the former Guinness chairman and chief executive, is serving five years for conspiracy, theft and false accounting. Mr Parnes, a City stockbroker, was sentenced to 2 1/2 years for theft and false accounting. Mr Ronson, head of the Heron group, released in February after serving just under half his 12-month jail term, was also fined a record Pounds 5m on his convictions of conspiracy, theft and false accounting. He had been given until May 25 to pay the fine. Yesterday the Appeal Court extended the time until 10 days after the end of the appeals. Mr Saunders and Mr Parnes are in Ford open prison in West Sussex. If their appeals fail, Mr Parnes will be eligible for parole at the end of June and Mr Saunders at the end of next April. The central issue in the appeals against conviction, which lasted eight days, has been the defence contention that Mr Justice Henry, the trial judge, misdirected the jury. All the charges in the case related to the share support operation mounted by Guinness during the takeover battle for Distillers.</p>

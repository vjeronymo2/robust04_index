The Cameroonian  foreign minister made that statement after a meeting here  yesterday with his Nigerian counterpart, Babagana Kingibe, who  arrived in the Cameroonian capital on 9 March at the head of a  military and civilian delegation.    Kingibe has said that he will go back for consultations with  the Nigerian authorities on the conditions set by Cameroon which  also wants the summit meeting to be held in a neutral country.  The Nigerian minister told Cameroon Radio that talks between  the two delegations were on course. The joint communique on the  bilateral talks has not yet been signed although the Nigerian  delegation is scheduled to leave the Cameroonian capital today.    Fambare Ouattara Natchaba, Togolese minister of foreign  affairs and cooperation, attended the meeting which examined the  territorial dispute over the Bakassi Peninsula said to be rich  in oil and natural gas. Last week, Togolese Head of State  Gnassingbe Eyadema undertook to mediate between the two  countries. In this regard, he visited Yaounde and Lagos [as  received] to examine with Biya and Abacha ways and means of  finding a peaceful solution to the dispute.</p>

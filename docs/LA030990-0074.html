			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT BREWS OVER $43 BILLION IN UNSPENT DEFENSE FUNDS  </P> <P> A battle is shaping up over $43 billion in unspent Pentagon funds left over  from the Ronald Reagan Administration's arms buildup, even as Congress is  seeking to cut military spending.  </P> <P> The funds are contained in two low-profile accounts. And, despite the size of  the money pot, some people are just noticing that it exists.  </P> <P> Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) charged Thursday that the Pentagon funds amount  to a "semi-secret slush fund" that exists largely outside congressional  jurisdiction. The funds are nearly half as large as the Bush Administration's  proposed fiscal 1991 military procurement budget.  </P> <P> When the existence of the funds surfaced quietly last year in congressional  hearings, the General Accounting Office was asked by Rep. John P. Murtha  (D-Pa.) and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) to investigate whether they were  being used properly. The GAO found that the money was not being used improperly  but that the situation constituted a loss of control by Congress.  </P> <P> Dingell called for legislation to eliminate the $43-billion funding authority  held by the Pentagon in the accounts.  </P> <P> Pentagon spokeswoman Susan Hansen denied that the accounts represent a slush  fund and described them as a kind of reserve held against unexpected or  unbilled claims by defense contractors. She acknowledged that the $43 billion  "sounds somewhat like the figures we know."  </P> <P> Hansen said the $43-billion accounts are under the control of the Treasury  Department and referred questions about their size to Treasury officials. But a  Treasury spokesman said that the Defense Department controls the funds and that  the Treasury's only function is to write checks against the money.  </P> <P> The controversy underscores the increasing concern many experts have with the  Pentagon's accounting system, which was severely criticized only last week in a  draft GAO audit that was leaked to the press. In that audit, it was disclosed  that the Air Force had understated its costs on three major weapons systems  built during the Reagan Administration by $25.5 billion because of sloppy  accounting.  </P> <P> Moreover, the entire Pentagon business apparatus has been stung repeatedly  through the years for its inability to deal effectively with such seemingly  trivial matters as paying defense contractors on time, handling paper work and  negotiating adequate contracts.  </P> <P> The $43 billion in unspent Pentagon funding authority is held in a so-called M  account and a "merged surplus account." The staff of Dingell's House Energy and  Commerce Committee, which has been investigating the funds, found that $25.3  billion in authority is held in the merged surplus account and $17.2 billion is  held in the M account. The Navy holds the largest amount of funds with $9  billion in its M account and $8 billion in its merged surplus accounts, Dingell  said.  </P> <P> Under the federal budget system, congressional appropriations lapse after two  years. It has been widely assumed that all lapsed appropriations are returned  to the Treasury, but a large portion of those funds ends up in such special  accounts.  </P> <P> The M account is supposed to contain funds to pay for weapons contracts that  have not yet come due but for which the two-year appropriation has lapsed. The  merged surplus account theoretically contains lapsed appropriations that would  be used to pay off unexpected claims against the Pentagon.  </P> <P> "The only way we are able to use those funds is if an obligation was made on a  previous contract and a bill is forthcoming that was not expected," Hansen said  about the M account. As for the merged surplus account, she explained: "Maybe  somebody can bring a battleship out of mothballs and present a bill that goes  back that far."  </P> <P> But a Dingell staff member said funds in the merged surplus account can be used  to pay virtually any claim against the government, using funds appropriated for  one weapon to pay for another.  </P> <P> For example, the Air Force used its M account to pay about $1 billion to Eaton  Corp. to fix the B-1 bomber avionics system, which failed to meet its  contractual requirements and left the bomber unable to fulfill its mission of  penetrating Soviet air defenses.  </P></p>

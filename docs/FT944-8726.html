			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / The FT Interview: Dark days for a white knight - Italy's embattled prime minister takes time out to explain his mission to save Italy from the left Silvio Berlusconi honours the engagement. Obliged to impose two confidence votes on his unruly coalition allies this week and facing a second general strike, the media magnate turned prime minister might have made his excuses. Instead, with a gaggle of demonstrators outside the Palazzo Chigi, and a difficult cabinet session inside, Mr Berlusconi takes time out to explain his role since taking office six months ago. 'I'm the protagonist of a revolution. I have to operate in a completely different way to my predecessors,' he says. He sees himself not just as an outsider, but as a man bringing radical and necessary change to Italy. His election victory in March, just three months after entering politics, was due largely to the vacuum created by the collapse of Italy's post-war political structure. And he is determined to distance himself from all that went before. 'The only good things I inherited,' he says, surveying the antique chairs, paintings and tapestries in his office, 'are the furniture, the building and these objects of Italian culture.' But being prime minister is a lot tougher and more complex than running his Fininvest business empire, he concedes. 'As a businessman, I was 100 per cent responsible for all the decisions running Italy's second largest private conglomerate. Here my role is the exact opposite, because this is a coalition government. It has to operate through compromise and mediation.' His main challenge lies in balancing the interests in his rightwing coalition, while implementing the painful measures needed to correct Italy's serious fiscal imbalance. The 1995 budget before parliament involves big cuts in public spending and a shake-up of the costly state-run pensions system. Mr Berlusconi tried - and failed - to get the unions' support for this. In the end, he says, he had to take a tough line and court unpopularity. 'I did not want this head-on confrontation,' he says. But he has little room for manoeuvre. 'Our proposals on pension reform are the minimum we could do to convey a strong signal to the financial markets that we are serious about reducing the ratio of debt to gross domestic product.' On the latest projections, Italy's huge debt should peak at the equivalent of 126 per cent of GDP in 1996. And he refuses to budge on his election promise of tax cuts. Italy needs to make more people pay their proper share of taxes, he says, rather than tax more heavily those already paying. He promises to simplify the tax and legal structure. 'We want to escape from the jungle of incomprehensible legislation that surrounds us.' He also wants to slim down government and review every department to see what can be best handled by private enterprise. The question is whether he will be around long enough to see through such changes. 'I don't know,' he says disarmingly. He hopes the main coalition partners - his Forza Italia movement, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - will stay together over the next crucial weeks. But once the budget is approved, which must be by the end of the year, all the coalition partners will have to show where their real loyalties lie and account for the discipline of their members of parliament. He hints that, if the coalition lacks sufficient purpose to allow him to pursue his agenda, he would seek a fresh mandate. Mr Berlusconi is convinced most voters are moderate. But he also believes that the 35 per cent of the electorate on the left represent a real threat to Italy's future. He complains that people outside Italy do not understand this. 'Abroad, they talk about the MSI/National Alliance as something negative; but the real danger is the contrary.' He explains his willingness to forego his business career in favour of politics exclusively in this context. 'You've got to understand the left had already placed its supporters in key positions in universities, publishing houses, radio networks, TV stations and the courts. And they had the organisation to bring people onto the streets . . . Everything was ready for a leftwing minority to take power.' 'I'm convinced if the left had won the elections, Italy had a future without either freedom or prosperity.' For him, the fall of the Berlin Wall made no difference to the power or designs of the left in Italy. While Berlusconi sees himself as a white knight rescuing Italy from the left's embrace, others are less charitable about his entry into politics. Questions are still asked about the conflict between his interests as a businessman and his role as a political leader. Apart from a substantial presence in publishing, financial services and retailing, his Fininvest empire owns three commercial television channels accounting for nearly half the nation's TV audience. He spells out that since entering politics, he has resigned from all directorships and executive responsibilities. He has also appointed a three-man commission to draft legislation to prevent a conflict of interest  -and accepted its findings 'without changing a comma'. In addition, there are numerous checks and balances in Italy's parliamentary democracy to monitor his behaviour, he says, not least of which is public opinion. Finally he turns the argument on its head: 'The real point of the conflict of interest debate is that my companies have suffered from me becoming a politician rather than the other way around. As a result of entering politics, I have suffered both from a personal and an entrepreneurial point of view.' The Fininvest group, he says, has not been able to take advertising from state bodies. With some bitterness he comments on the way his enemies have planted 30 bombs at his Standa stores since he took office. Standa sales this year are down 10 per cent as a result of a boycott organised by his opponents. He says he is willing to sell all his assets. But having built up the group from scratch over the past 20 years, he does not seem yet to have resolved a profound personal dilemma over whether or not to let go of his own baby. He will not be a forced seller, he emphasises: 'That would be unconstitutional, going against the basic right of private property.' And he lets slip the thought that Italian prime ministers are not elected for a fixed term. The implication is clear: he is heading Italy's 53rd post-war government and he does not know when he may need to look for another job. The Fininvest link continues to cause speculation of a different kind: whether Italy's anti-corruption magistrates, who are investigating various aspects of his business empire, will eventually reach to the top. 'On this front I have always been tranquil. Otherwise, I would never have entered politics because I knew thousands of spotlights would be immediately turned onto my activities. For example there have been 126 searches by the police in the last few months, compared to less than 100 in the previous 10 years.' In an unstable political environment, Mr Berlusconi will not be drawn on the chances of his government's survival. The decisive moment will come once the budget has been passed. The crucial element will then be his stormy relationship with Mr Bossi of the League. Having fought with each other from the beginning of the administration, the question is whether the prime minister can sideline Mr Bossi without falling too much into the right's hands. Mr Berlusconi is not yet at the eye of the storm. He ends the interview to rejoin the cabinet, for what turns out to be one of the stormiest sessions of his administration.</p>

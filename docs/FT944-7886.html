			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Brussels gets tough on public contracts: Commission has launched raft of court actions in move to outlaw unfair practices The European Commission has begun to bare its teeth as it tries to outlaw unfair practices preventing companies from winning public sector contracts in other EU countries. It is threatening to seek a court injunction to halt work on a DM400m (Pounds 164m) German power station contract Recent figures showing the huge amount of work still required to incorporate EU public procurement directives into member states' laws underline the scale of the task. Eight public works directives should have been included in domestic law by July 1, but, by the end of October, this had not happened in a third of cases, according to Brussels. At that point it started 28 proceedings against governments for failing to include the directives in domestic legislation or for doing so incorrectly. But its threatened injunction, which could stop a live project, is an unusual step. Germany, long identified as one of the worst offenders, is the subject of legal proceedings on two of the eight public works directives and may face action on another four. Only Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have fulfilled their obligations - 'with a few minor exceptions' - to enact all eight. The directives, which require all public contracts of more than Ecu200,000 (Pounds 157,000) to be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities, seek to ensure that all EU companies are treated equally when bidding for public sector contracts. They demand that contract procedures and technical standards should not be used to favour domestic companies. Contract conditions should be clearly stated, and standardised forms used as much as possible. Conditions, once published, should not be changed to favour one bidder. The Commission has been particularly concerned about the practice in some southern Mediterranean countries of reopening negotiations after contracts have been awarded. In these instances a favoured supplier can safely bid a very low price, secure in the knowledge that this will subsequently be renegotiated along with other contract conditions. Brussels says this may encourage corruption if final costs are not subject to open competition but determined by consultation between local officials and the winning bidder. The number of legal actions pursued by the Commission against governments and public authorities for failing to apply the directives to specific contracts has more than doubled during the past 12 months to about 250. In one of the most recent, Brussels is threatening to seek an injunction in the European Court to prevent work starting on a steam turbine contract for a DM5bn power station at Lippendorf in eastern Germany. It wants the recently privatised eastern German electricity company, Veag, to reopen the bidding for the DM400m steam turbine contract which was awarded to a German subsidiary of Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri. The German subsidiary of General Electric of the US which claimed it was 'unfairly excluded from the final round of price negotiations' complained to a Berlin court that European companies, such as ABB and Siemens, traditionally had been been treated by the German power sector as 'court suppliers'. Legal action is not the only weapon at the Commission's disposal. Governments which fail to apply or police directives properly have been warned that EU soft loans and grants from the so-called structural funds may not be available for public works if proper procedures are ignored. Greece and Spain, following warnings, have agreed to abandon their practice of reopening negotiations after contracts have been awarded. The prize for the Commission and companies seeking to break into other countries' markets is large. Public procurement in the EU totalled Ecu595bn in 1990, equivalent to 14.4 per cent of gross domestic product. Only 2 per cent of this was awarded to companies from another country.</p>

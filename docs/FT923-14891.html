			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / G24 offers Dollars 8m for Yugoslav refugees THE European Commission got much less than it wanted yesterday in aid pledges for Yugoslav refugees at a meeting of the G24 group of rich countries, Reuters reports from Brussels. The European Community executive had wanted the G24 to double the Commission's own aid offer of Ecu120m (Pounds 85m) for victims of the Yugoslav conflict. But diplomats said new pledges by G24 states totalled only about Dollars 8m (Pounds 4.1m), and the Commission's own offer was halved by EC member states in a behind-the-scenes budget row. A Commission spokesman said after the meeting of G24 officials the executive could go ahead with about Ecu57.5m in food and other aid. To find more money for the EC's contribution, he said talks would have to be held with the other EC institutions - the Council of Ministers representing member states, and the European Parliament.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S WARNING TO THE ISRAELIS  </P> <P> Secretary of State James Baker delivered a strong warning to the pro-Israel  lobbying organization, saying that Israel must be realistic and give up  territorial claims (Part I, May 23).  </P> <P> I will ask a very simple question of Baker. When has our country ever given up  territories won in a war?  </P> <P> But more importantly, the Israelis didn't start the wars they won; they fought  hard to survive only after being attacked and because of superiority in  strength -- not in numbers of personnel -- they won.  </P> <P> I don't see the U.S. giving up New Mexico or any other part of our county --  and I have never noted our country returning land to the Indians that we took  with or without fighting for it.  </P> <P> Let's be realistic. If the Israelis were to give up the territories they would  be committing suicide, pure and simple. They would have their enemy within just  a few short miles -- ready and anxious to thoroughly defeat Israel. And the  U.S. would have to help in the rescue, bringing in our troops; this is  something Israel doesn't want the U.S. to do and our own Americans would refuse  to participate on principle.  </P> <P> The sooner the Arabs -- with their enormous wealth and so much open land --  take care of their own, the Palestinians, the sooner peace can prevail. And  none of this has a thing to do with giving up territories legally and ethically  won by the Israelis.  </P> <P> HENRY EHRLICH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: STRAWBERRY OMELET IS LOW ON CALORIES, BUT NOT TASTE  </P> <P> A recent study suggested that a drastic reduction in daily calorie intake may  extend one's life span by up to 50%.  </P> <P> But for those who subscribe to the notion that to eat is no vice, the question  is: What would be grimmer than a longer life of fewer meals?  </P> <P> If quality of life is what concerns you, continue to serve delectable dishes  such as this strawberry omelet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STRAWBERRY OMELET  </P> <P> 3/4 cup strawberries, hulled and halved  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon Kirsch or Grand Marnier  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon sugar  </P> <P> Dash salt  </P> <P> 8 eggs or 4 eggs and 6 whites, well beaten  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter (less if using nonstick pan)  </P> <P> Whole strawberries  </P> <P> Soak halved strawberries in Kirsch and 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 hour.  </P> <P> Beat salt and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar into eggs. Heat butter in  skillet. When melted, swirl pan to distribute butter evenly, then pour in eggs.  </P> <P> Cook over low heat until bottom is set, but top is still slightly liquid.  Distribute halved strawberries evenly in strip down center of omelet. Using  spatula, fold bottom edge up to enclose filling. Continue cooking over medium  heat until bottom has browned, and center is set.  </P> <P> Invert large serving plate over pan, and flip omelet onto it.

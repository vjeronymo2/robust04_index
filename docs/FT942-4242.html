			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Half of accountancy firms report an absolute decline in fee income levels Accountancy firms are still languishing in the after-effects of the recession, according to the Financial Times league table of the top 30 firms published today. Nearly half of the firms reported absolute declines in fee income levels, while only three were able to report revenue growth in double digits. The data shows the enormous and growing gulf between the 'Big Six' firms and the rest of the market. Touche Ross, which fell to sixth place with a decline of 0.8 per cent to Pounds 332.9m, remains more than three times the size of the next largest firm. Total income to the 30 largest accountancy practices was Pounds 3.4bn in 1993-94, up by less than 2 per cent on the previous year. The proportion taken up by the largest six firms edged up marginally to 76 per cent. The largest growth came from Latham, Crossley &amp; Davis, a small firm which reported an 18 per cent rise to Pounds 9.7m in the year to April 30. The biggest decline came from Littlejohn Frazer, down 13.5 per cent to Pounds 9m. At the top end of the league table, Andersen, comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting, moved up from sixth place two years ago to become the third largest firm in the country this year. The table also shows the diversification of the accounting firms from purely accounting and auditing work into tax, insolvency and management consulting. However, many firms reported declines in insolvency income, which had sustained them during the recession but has now fallen in line with the number of business failures. Two of the firms with strong specialisms now show less than one-fifth of their income from audit and accounting work. These are Andersen, because of Andersen Consulting, and Smith &amp; Williamson, with its heavy banking and investment management service. Levy Gee, an insolvency specialist, reports only 37 per cent from accounting. The trend to cutting jobs continued, with the number of partners across the firms reduced to just over 4,700 down 7 per cent from last year, and the number of other professional staff down 6 per cent to a little under 41,000. The figures are prepared for comparison with most firms providing information for financial year-ends to March or April, although these do not always correspond to their own year-ends for internal use. It remains difficult to compare the firms for a number of reasons, including the fact that a number of the smaller accountancy practices are affiliations rather than single firms. For this reason, Moores Rowland has for the first time been shown adjusted to exclude its MRI associates, which lowers its place in the rankings. On a like-for-like basis, it remains 16th in the league.</p>

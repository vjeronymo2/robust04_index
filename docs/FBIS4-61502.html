			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Lev </F> Rumyantsev]    [Text] St. Petersburg, 5 May -- Relations between Russia  and Estonia and, in particular, the problem of the withdrawal of  Russian troops will be the subject of an exchange of opinions at  the meeting between Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and  Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt.    At St. Petersburg's Pulkovo-2 airport, where the head of the  Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry arrived today, he told  journalists: We shall withdraw our troops from Estonia solidly  and in a worthy manner on the basis of an agreement which, if it  is concluded without delay, will allow our forces to be  withdrawn by 31 August 1994. Unfortunately, no signals have yet  been seen from the Estonian side indicating that they intend to  conduct the talks seriously, Andrey Kozyrev said.    The minister stressed that Russia is capable of settling its  relations with Estonia by itself. However, Russia welcomes it  when other states help in resolving problems, as happened during  the talks with Latvia. Carl Bildt and the leaders of other  countries played a positive role in achieving a compromise.    Andrey Kozyrev called attention to the fact that after the  withdrawal of troops from the Baltic states, the question of  observing CSCE norms and international standards in the sphere  of human rights will remain urgent. We consider, the minister  said, that Sweden and other states are not extraneous to this  question. We are against human rights' problems being turned  into just bilateral questions.    Russia, Kozyrev noted, favours setting up in the Council of  cooperation of Baltic Sea states the post of commissioner for  human rights and ethnic minorities who would have quite a lot of  work to do in the Baltic region.    Speaking of links with Sweden, Andrey Kozyrev described  these  relations as good. The Swedes, he said, display a business-like  approach in partnership within the framework of the CSCE and at  a regional level.</p>

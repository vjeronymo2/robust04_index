			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Gencor moves to unbundle all non-mining units: Group seeks greater focus - Talks start on Royal Dutch Shell metal interests GENCOR, South Africa's second largest mining house, yesterday announced that it plans to unbundle its non-mining interests in a deal that will probably halve the group's market capitalisation to about R8bn (Pounds 1.6bn) from R16bn. Gencor also disclosed that it is involved in talks with Royal Dutch Shell for the acquisition of its main metal mining businesses. Discussions are at an early stage, but if successful would see the creation of a world-scale mining enterprise. The effect of the Gencor unbundling, expected to be completed by August 31, is that Gencor will relinquish control of its three industrial arms  - paper and pulp company Sappi, consumer group Malbak and energy company Engen - as well as investment arm Genbel. Gencor will emerge as purely a mining, metals and mineral processing company, with interests in gold, platinum, coal, ferro-alloys, stainless steel and aluminium. Although Gencor said the move was motivated by the desire to unlock shareholder wealth - it trades at a discount of about 19 per cent, or R3.8bn, to net asset value - and improve focus for operations and investors, Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, conceded there had been a political angle to the deal. Unbundling is a policy much favoured by the African National Congress. The announcement was favourably received in the investment community. It will also bring some of South Africa's unwieldly conglomerates into line with trends towards more focused operations. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, and chairman of Gencor when the unbundling issue was raised nearly three years ago, also endorsed the deal. 'I welcome the announcement of the plan to unbundle in the belief that it will result in five entrepreneurs,' he said. The restructure will involve Gencor passing its shares in Sappi, Malhold, Genbel and Engen to its own shareholders. Gencor Beherend, the controlling pyramid, which has only a 54 per cent stake in Gencor, will pass its shares in the underlying companies to shareholders (50 per cent Sanlam and 25 per cent Rembrandt, the tobacco group) and be liquidated. Mr Marinus Daling, chief executive of Sankorp, which controls Sanlam's strategic investments, and the key driving force behind the unbundling, said that Sankorp supported the unbundling 'because focus is extremely important to us as investors'. Gencor plans to supplement existing cash holdings of about R1.5bn by raising a further R1.5bn by disposing of group shares and portfolio investments. Thus, by the time of unbundling, Genmin will be about R1.5bn larger. Lex, Page 20; Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

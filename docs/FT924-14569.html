			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Bassano honours its most famous son - Exhibition Most Renaissance artists, like Leonardo da Vinci, only came to be named after their home towns as a result of leaving them. Jacopo da Ponte - known as Bassano - is the great exception. He spent most of his working life in and around the small town of Bassano in the Veneto, apparently making the 45km trip to Venice only once. Despite that, after Titian and along with Veronese and Tintoretto, he was one of the most influential and inventive Venetian painters of the 16th century. Bassano del Grappa is honouring its most famous and loyal of sons on the 400th anniversary of his death with the first monographic exhibition of the artist since 1957. The town has even spent some L1.5bn overhauling its museum's security, lighting and climate control systems in order to secure substantial foreign loans. The show is co-sponsored by the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, and a version of it, comprising fewer - and some different - oils plus more drawings, opens in Texas in January. The exhibition's achievements are considerable. As one might expect, pictures have been gathered together from far-flung and unlikely corners of the globe - from Ottowa to the Alvar Aalto Museum in Jyvaskyla. Assiduous sleuthing has uncovered a number of previously unknown works which add to our understanding of the artist. Most intriguingly, however, the show is witness to the developing sensibility of a provincial painter as sensitive as litmus paper to what he could glean, through pictures or prints, of current artistic practice. As this impressive display amply reveals, Bassano was fortunate enough to live in, and to have been inspired by, a great age of Venetian painting. We find him first in a 'Flight into Egypt', dated to 1534, a painting of considerable nave charm. The figures moving frieze-like across the picture plane have the monumentality of Giotto and the palette of fresco, and indeed derive from the frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua; the Madonna and Child come courtesy of a Titian fresco in Venice. Within a decade, he has plunged into the maelstrom of Venetian Mannerism. Compositions are crowded, complex and urgent, with figures boldly cropped and foreshortened. 'The Adoration of the Magi' from Edinburgh, arguably his masterpiece, is a virtuoso performance of arrested action, sharp-edged clarity and harshly sumptuous Venetian colour. Drawing on the theatricality of Pordenone and, via Schiavone, on the elongated forms of Parmigianino, he is now bang up to date. In many ways Bassano is a remarkable artist. Most importantly, he established the genre of the pastoral landscape. From the first he had favoured Biblical subjects that allowed him to paint humble rustic folk and their animals in the landscape, often at night. Gradually the subject of the picture slips into secondary importance, so that in a 'Sacrifice of Noah', for example, one has to search the middle distance for a minute Noah and his flaming altar. It was only a short step to dispensing with religious subject-matter altogether - and to the pioneering series of landscapes which represent the four seasons or the four elements through the depiction of peasants at work in the countryside. A large and broadly executed canvas of two hunting dogs, painted for their own sake, and set against a lowering evening sky with the imposing Monte del Grappa in the distance, is also virtually unique in 16th-century art. As a draughtsman, Bassano is perhaps no less original. At about the same time as Federico Barocci in Urbino, he is covering large sheets of rough blue paper with bold figure studies in dashing combinations of coloured chalks. Bassano is, however, a peculiarly uneven artist. Anatomy is often weak, and execution frequently careless. Moreover, he tends towards the formulaic. Is this also the consequence of workshop mentality and practice? Certainly Jacopo, both son and father of painters, clearly regarded painting as a family business, and the family workshop's production-line continued to churn out lamentable Jacopo pastiches well into the 17th century. It was, however, considered perfectly acceptable for a master at the head of a busy workshop to re-use and re-combine particularly effective figures and motifs - the premium on originality is a prejudice of our own age. That said, the relentlessness of the repetition does suggest a lack of imagination or intellectual curiosity. One reclining male figure, for instance, is variously Lazarus, St John the Baptist, a vanquished soldier, Joseph, and any number of shepherds. Bassano is also curiously old-fashioned. His habit of combining unrelated Biblical events flouts pictorial credibility: we find St Jerome deep in his books as Christ on the Cross behind him gushes blood and the Marys weep. St Anthony Abbot similarly fails to notice the commotion beside him as the mounted St Martin slices his cloak in half in order to share it with the beggar. The museum's third gallery reveals the malign influence of his son Francesco who has a penchant for the sootiest of night scenes implausibly stuffed with chaotic mounds of copper pots and pans. It is hard not to heave a sigh of great relief when Francesco decides to move to Venice in 1579. Thereafter, Jacopo seems to have recaptured the spark that animated the paintings of the '40s and '50s. His last religious works are indisputably his most powerful. In an almost monochromatic, torchlit 'Christ Crowned with Thorns', the rapidly executed figures of the suffering Christ and his tormentors barely emerge out of an oppressive darkness. The picture has a ghostliness and a profundity which echo the late works of his most enduring influence, Titian. 'Jacopo Bassano' continues at the Museo Civico, Bassano del Grappa, until December 6, and shows at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas, January 23-April 25. Italian and English editions of the catalogue are published by Nuova Alfa Editoriale.</p>

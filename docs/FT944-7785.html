			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Opec dangers The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries yesterday took the unprecedented step of extending its production ceiling for a year in an attempt to coax oil prices upwards. The move, urged on the cartel by Saudi Arabia, its largest and most influential producer, suggests Opec's capacity to influence the direction and stability of oil prices survives. Whether prices rise in the next six months, as Opec hopes, depends partly on whether the production ceiling holds, partly on what happens to the output of non-OPEC suppliers and partly on whether world demand rises. Unfortunately for Opec, the weather in many northern countries has been warm so far this autumn. Nonetheless, the expansion in demand from rapidly growing non-OECD countries is now large enough to compensate for recessions in industrialised countries, in sharp contrast to the pattern in 1973 and 1982. As a result, world demand for oil, which hovered between 55m and 65m barrels per day between 1973 and 1990, has broken out of that range to some 68m b/d this year. On the evidence of this week's meeting, Opec should be able to deliver the broadly predictable oil prices oil-importing countries desire, particularly if the cartel continues to operate against the more comfortable background of steadily rising world demand. Over time, Opec's share of the world's production is also likely to creep upwards, at least so long as investment in production outside Opec remains restrained by moderate price levels. But the result is also likely to be a growing concentration of output inside Opec, since only Saudi Arabia looks capable of supplying much of any longer-term increase in demand. The markets have been more pre-occupied with the possibility that Iraq will, at some point, resume exporting oil, once it has complied with enough of the conditions imposed by the United Nations after the Gulf war. But its return would probably add only about 1m b/d to world production, a third of its pre-war levels. The question about Iraq obscures the far greater importance of Saudi Arabia, which accounts for a third of Opec production and a seventh of the whole world's. Provided that it has adequate resources to invest in more production, which it should, even in its current cash-strapped state, it is well placed to increase its share of Opec's output as world demand grows. Saudi Arabia's ability to adjust its production to demand, in both directions, can secure the price stability so much desired by the rest of the world. It would do no harm if that stability were to be about a gently rising trend. For the moment at least, the kingdom also feels it has a strong interest in providing what is needed. The problem, however, is that the stability of the world's oil market and so of the global economy is correspondingly vulnerable to any Saudi political turmoil, or radical change in objectives.</p>

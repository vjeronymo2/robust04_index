			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWNSIDE, UP SIDE OF SINATRA'S LETTER  </P> <P> So Frank Sinatra (Letters, Sept. 16) doesn't think that stardom is something  that carries the potential for destruction. Well, Presley, Monroe and Joplin  are just a few examples of lives botched by the trappings of superstardom.  </P> <P> For Mr. Sinatra to trivialize George Michael's statements and make them seem  superfluous or self-serving indicate his grasp of the downside of "the  business" is minuscule. A performer is, foremost, a human being, not a  commodity, a wind-up toy or machine.  </P> <P> For Michael to see that stardom is robbing him of something meaningful is a  heartfelt realization, and he deserves a measure of respect for it.  </P> <P> Frank Sinatra, you're one of the best, but you missed the mark in your  observations about George Michael.  </P> <P> MIKE SEKULIC  </P> <P> El Monte  </P></p>

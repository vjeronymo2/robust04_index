			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAZARDS OF RADIATION  </P> <P> It is, of course, outrageous as you pointed out in your editorial "They Were  Told There Was No Danger" (Oct. 1) that 500 uranium mine workers, an estimated  150,000 civilians living downwind of atomic bomb tests that were conducted  during the 1950s and 1960s and the military personnel who were used as guinea  pigs during those same tests were lied to by the U.S. government regarding the  hazards of radiation.  </P> <P> It is important to note, though, that we are still being lied to by our  government and the nuclear industry regarding the safety of nuclear power  plants and the effects of low-level radiation.  </P> <P> In "Nuclear Witnesses -- Insiders Speak Out," author Leslie J. Freeman  interviews medical researcher Dr. Rosalie Bertell, medical physicist Dr. John  W. Gofman and physicist Dr. Ernest J. Sternglass regarding their many years of  research on the health effects of low-level radiation. All three researchers  have concluded that there are no "safe" levels of radiation.  </P> <P> Yet, the nuclear industry continues to promote the use of radiation in food  irradiation and medicine, nuclear reactors continue to vent radiation into the  water and air, and consumer products containing small amounts of radioactive  materials continue to be introduced.  </P> <P> Perhaps most insidious and outrageous of all is the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission-approved plan to allow the nuclear industry to petition the NRC for  permission to dispose of as much as one-third of its low-level radioactive  waste as "below regulatory concern." This radioactive waste could then be  disposed of as regular garbage and sent to landfills, incinerators and even  recycling plants instead of to a properly regulated nuclear-waste disposal  site.  </P> <P> LARRY SIEGEL  </P> <P> Hawthorne  </P></p>

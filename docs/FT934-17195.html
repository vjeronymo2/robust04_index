			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Duchy ponders end to Belgian franc link LUXEMBOURG is examining what impact a devaluation of the Belgian franc would have on the 71-year-old currency link between the two countries. But it is already clear to highly-placed observers of the Luxembourg economy that it would be politically difficult, if not impossible, to break the currency link. Market rumour about a possible rupture between the Belgian and Luxembourg francs was fuelled on Thursday by Luxembourg's announcement of the terms for its first public bond auction. Bond traders were surprised that the coupon on the Luxembourg 10-year bond was substantially lower than the yield on Belgian 10-year bonds, in spite of the fact that the currencies are interchangeable. Luxembourg believes breaking the link would have drastic consequences for the future of European monetary union, because it would break up the central core of EC currencies around the D-Mark. It would also leave the Luxembourg franc exposed to heavy speculation on international currency markets. The most realistic alternative to currency association with Belgium would be direct links with Germany. That would be an unpalatable solution for many older Luxembourgers, who still remember wartime occupation by their neighbour. Furthermore, Luxembourg would have little or no say in the Bundesbank's decisions on monetary policy, whereas Belgian bank decisions are taken in collaboration with the Grand Duchy's authorities. Belgium and Luxembourg have been part of a currency association and economic union since 1922, and the agreement to link currencies was renewed for a further 10 years last year. The Belgian national bank, which refuses to comment on the future of the link, has consistently and strongly denied that it is considering floating the franc. But Belgium's firm strategy of shadowing the D-Mark has come under increasing pressure since August's currency crisis, when the fluctuation bands of the European exchange rate mechanism were relaxed. Having raised interest rates to counter speculation against the franc last month, the Belgian central bank has since announced four cuts in the central rate. On Thursday the central rate was reduced from 9.75 per cent to 9.65 per cent, and the Belgian franc weakened still further. Mr Jean-Claude Koeune, chief economist at Banque Bruxelles Lambert in Brussels, said: yesterday: 'The Luxembourg economy doesn't need a depreciation of its currency against the D-Mark, considering about 40 per cent of its imports come from Germany. That's why Luxembourg wants the Belgian authorities to keep the link with the D-Mark.' Luxembourg has examined cutting the link with the Belgian franc once before, in 1982, after the currency was devalued. Then it was warned that breaking the link would have negative consequences for the Grand Duchy. Relinquishing the Belgian franc peg would prove very damaging for Luxembourg's 200 or so banks, which have substantial assets in the Belgian currency, especially bonds.</p>

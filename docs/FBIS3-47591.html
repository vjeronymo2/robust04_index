Nearly 400 songs including "Kim Chong-il, He Is Our Destiny"  and "Comrade Kim Chong-il Is Our Supreme Commander" are edited  in collections of songs recently issued by the literature and  art press group.    "We Will Win Because You Are Leading Us," a poem dedicated  by  Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will, to dear Comrade Kim  Chong- il last year, was composed as a song.    In the poem Yi In-mo emphasizes the unshakable ideological  conviction that as long as there is the leadership of dear  Comrade Kim Chong-il the revolutionary cause of chuche, the  cause of socialism, shall not perish.    Today the Korean people are filled with revolutionary  optimism and conviction that as long as they are under his wise  leadership, they are sure to win victory, no matter what ordeals  and difficulties may crop up in their way.    A song "Single Heart" sings of the indomitable spirit and  determination of the Korean people to carry their revolutionary  cause through to accomplishment, united around the illustrious  leader in one mind and will.    "Comrade Kim Chong-il Is Our Supreme Commander," "Let Us  Uphold Our Supreme Commander With Arms" and other songs tell  about the national pride and honor of holding in high esteem  Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding military strategist and  ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, as chairman of  the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea and supreme commander of the Korean People's  Army, and about the unshakable faith and will of the People's  Army and people to resolutely defend him with arms.    Many songs including "We Will Hold Comrade Kim Chong-il in  High Esteem Forever," "Kim Chong-il, He Is Our Destiny," and  "Long Live Comrade Kim Chong-il, Great Brilliant Commander"  reflect the unanimous mind and will of the Korean people to  follow with loyalty and filial piety the illustrious leader who  takes care of and protects the destiny of the nation and its  future and hope.</p>

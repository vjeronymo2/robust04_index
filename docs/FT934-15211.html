			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Getting to work on a more attractive profile: Michael Cassell meets a top executive taking time out to rid manufacturing of its 'slummy image' AS CHIEF executive of Allied-Lyons, one of Britain's biggest food and drink groups, Mr Tony Hales is a busy man; not too busy, however, to place himself at the head of an ambitious mission to restore the image and performance of manufacturing industry. Today, Mr Hales 45, will preside over his first meeting as chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's National Manufacturing Council, set up nearly two years' ago to spread best practice in management, build new partnerships with government and the City and give industry a more attractive profile. The post is for two years and, by the end of it, he wants to be able to demonstrate that UK competitiveness has improved to the point where industry can show some real manufacturing leadership in Europe. He also wants to see the beginning of the end of industry's 'dirty, slummy' image, promoting it back up the list of respectable professions. A trifle ambitious?: 'I have to believe that hopes of real improvement are realistic or I might as well pack up and go home.' But can the National Manufacturing Council, bringing together nearly 60 executives from every corner of industry, prove anything more than a high-powered talking shop?: 'It certainly will be a rather unusual meeting to chair', he concedes. 'But it is more a question of the individual initiatives pursued by the various sub-groups set up to tackle separate issues. In that respect, we are making progress'. At its annual conference next month, the CBI will launch its Competitiveness Forum programme, to help companies improve performance in areas such as innovation, marketing and manufacturing. Mr Hales acknowledges that manufacturing has acquired a new political priority and that government, led by the Department of Trade and Industry - 'we used to call it the department of trade interference' - is gradually proving more supportive. 'It has been impressed by structured argument put forward on behalf of manufacturing but we have to keep banging away at the same themes across government.' But though he has demands of government to help improve the chances of a strong, sustained manufacturing revival - 'above all, a stable macroeconomic climate' - he stresses that the solutions lie primarily with industry itself. 'It is too easy to say everything wrong with British industry is the fault of government. We have to get on and be very much more professional managers ourselves.' Mr Hales says productivity is improving, labour relations are good and Britain can offer a flexible, well-trained workforce which should not be constrained by the 'bureaucracy of Brussels'. Most worryingly, corporate investment is not improving. He therefore wants the institutions to be more imaginative in providing financing and he believes the government has a clear and pressing role to play in this respect. 'It is crunch time for Kenneth Clarke, who has said he wants to be remembered for what he did to help commerce and manufacturing. He has used the right language; now he has to deliver.' A Budget priority must be extra investment incentives, particularly for small and medium-sized companies. 'Not enough has been done on tax breaks to help stimulate investment in growing businesses. Dividends have been treated more favourably than investment. The invitation to consume rather than to invest has proved harmful. Attitudes have to change.'</p>

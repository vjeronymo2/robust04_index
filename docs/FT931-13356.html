			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / As They Say in Europe: Talking dirty in six languages - James Morgan asks what offends the man on a London omnibus ONE THING the papers shared this week was Clinton fatigue. Editorials from Dublin to Lublin made half-hearted attempts not to be boring but failed. The inauguration of a president remains, as ever, the crossroads of history that lead to a new beginning and the quest for the rebirth of the American dream. Only Paris-Normandie had an interesting view of the new man in the White House: 'It is as if Pontarlier town council were put in charge of France.' Pontarlier is, incidentally, much nicer than Little Rock. So, like the papers, I pursued last week's topic: unacceptable behaviour and, my special interest, cross-frontier variations in definitions of it. The research programme accidentally revealed that the British can deal easily with the wilder shores of human emotions and the French cannot. I discovered this thanks to AFP, the French news agency. The test involved the revelations concerning a telephone conversation supposedly between a male member of the royal family and a woman with whom he was evidently on good terms. Sure enough the British, and English-speakers in general, were assumed to be able to deal with the raw truth. When the story broke in Australia, the English service of AFP gave it 1,000 words. In French, however, it was compressed to under 200 words and the sole reference to the contents of the 'presumed transcription' noted that the two 'do not hide either their love or their reciprocal physical attraction'. And yet the French at home have few inhibitions. Political debate is larded with words that I would not transcribe even in asterisks. Comedy shows on television can consist of a stream of jokes that make the average British stand-up comic sound like Noel Coward. Such material can also provide the basis for what passes for German humour yet it would be unacceptable in Spain or Britain. But these two countries themselves differ on what is acceptable. In my local paper, among advertisements for plumbers and electricians, is a column of notices detailing the facilities available for making, yes, telephone calls of a lubricious nature. Such items used to decorate Spanish papers but not since the phone lines were closed last month in response to widespread public pressure. Yet those same papers, often liberal and leftish, freely advertise the services of transvestite prostitutes, among others. Afternoon television programmes for children can be interspersed with items where youngish females progressively divest themselves of what do seem to be rather uncomfortable garments. National sensitivities involve not only the intimate side of life. The delicacy of the British struck me this week in a bus which had a sign saying, 'We would prefer you not to eat or drink on this bus. However, if you do would you please take your litter with you.' I spent some time working out how this would translate. German is not suitable for conveying moral uncertainty or the doctrine of the second best; the nearest I got was Essen und trinken verboten. In French the warning is like something from a home for the incontinent elderly; in Italian, an invitation to steal the bus; in Russia, nobody sufficiently resourceful to possess the items involved would be fool enough to leave anything behind. And in Czech, the sign would be a trap to ensnare the man with a sandwich in an endless bureaucratic nightmare. The same 9A bus also saw the entrance of an inspector who treated even those without a ticket with some deference. This was a savage contrast with what I remember from my time in Vienna, where, in similar operations, two young toughs board a tram at opposite ends, the doors slamming tight shut behind them. They adopt the demeanour of those who had mastered the techniques of extracting confessions efficiently, open their denim jackets to expose heavy metal badges and shout Kontrollieren. Not surprisingly nobody is without a ticket. The purpose of this digression is to set the scene for my favourite opinion poll which appeared again in the Vienna tabloid, Kurier, the other day. The question was: 'Which groups would you find objectionable as neighbours?' Top of the poll were Turks and Romanians; the least unpopular of the nine were Slovenes and Jews. (Discussion of the prevalence of anti-Semitism in this part of the world often fails to reflect the rich spectrum of prejudice that characterises Austrian society.) Commentators noted that there had been a steady fall in the level of hatred from the peak in 1988, the year newspapers demanded that 'Waldheim must go' following revelations about his wartime past that he had prefered to conceal.) I have asked many questions about this poll over the years: is a list of 'detestees' presented to respondents or can they supply their own? Whatever happened to the Poles who once led the field but now get scarcely a mention? And, has anybody ever included the Viennese on the list? But the question I suppose I am really asking is this: would The Sun publish the results of such a poll if it were conducted in Britain?

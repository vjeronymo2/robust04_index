			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule provided an arithmetic example of an aggregate analysis computation. It also gave a detailed narrative of the steps to use in calculating the maximum cushion. Two comments requested that Step B in the calculation be simplified and Step C deleted. Many stated that HUD should describe the aggregate accounting method using only a narrative paragraph and should not attempt to set out the arithmetic steps to use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Others disagreed with HUD's calculations. For example, 38 commenters stated that when they determine the lowest monthly trial balance calculations of an escrow account, they first consider disbursements (debits) before receipts (credits). They claim that borrowers often do not make their mortgage payments until the end of a grace period. Disbursements are often due at the first of the month. Because HUD did not consider the timing of payments and disbursements, the commenters argued that the low-point balance may be understated. They claim this could result in shortages and deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The final rule contains both narrative and arithmetic descriptions of the steps to be used in an escrow account analysis under either method. The Department believes that it is providing useful guidance to the industry by giving both descriptions and examples. If HUD failed to provide a step-by-step algorithm, some servicers might be uncertain about the allowable limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  To consider all disbursements before receipts is to effectively reintroduce one month pre-accrual. Under the final rule, the escrow account analysis is a picture of the escrow account at month's end. Consequently, the timing of the payments and disbursements within a month do not change the computations. If a servicer pays a disbursement before the borrower makes a monthly mortgage payment, then the servicer may use the allowable cushion, if necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Single-Item Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nineteen comments stated that HUD should reaffirm its past policy in support of single-item analysis method. They argued that Section 10 of RESPA permits single-item analysis. HUD's previous informal interpretations and an opinion of the Comptroller General supported this view. They claim that Congress did not intend aggregate analysis limits to be imposed on escrow account balances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Other comments indicated that HUD's example in Appendix F of a single-item analysis was inconsistent with the methodology used by the majority of the industry. The commenters claimed that the industry does not use a trial running balance to determine single-item analysis limits. The commenters expressed concern that they would have to conform their current systems and software to the proposed single-item analysis during the phase-in period. They claimed that this would further increase costs and the burden of compliance. Five suggested that HUD delay the implementation of the ``new'' single-item analysis provisions for one year, to permit time to reprogram systems and train staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  When the Secretary issued the proposed rule, he was well aware of prior HUD interpretations concerning single-item analysis. Through informal legal opinions, HUD allowed servicers to use single-item analysis in calculating Section 10's limitations. HUD also issued an Interpretive Rule, dated January 21, 1993, in which HUD allowed single-item analysis within Section 10's limitations. The Interpretive Rule is effective until the effective date of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  HUD reconsidered its position on single-item accounting because HUD's Phase II report showed that aggregate accounting would result in lower escrow balances. When RESPA was first enacted the vast majority of servicers employed single-item analysis. The development of computer software and the increased availability of computer office equipment, however, makes the aggregate accounting computations easier than before. The statute describes the cushion as ``one-sixth of the estimated total amount'' of such charges. This rule represents the policy decision that aggregate accounting shall be the new standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In reaching this decision, the Secretary has seriously considered the countervailing interests. Servicers have had the benefit of greater escrow account balances under a single-item analysis accounting than they would have had if an aggregate analysis were employed. On the other hand, borrowers have had more money tied up in escrow accounts under a single-item accounting practice than would have been the case if aggregate accounting were practiced. Because the application of single-item analysis almost always means that servicers collect more money from borrowers than would be the case if the account were computed on an aggregate basis, the final rule requires an aggregate analysis prospectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  During the three-year phase-in period, servicers may still use single-item analysis for pre-rule accounts. The proposed rule contained a description and an illustration of single-item analysis that some commenters argued inaccurately described their practices. HUD does not intend for servicers to develop new single-item analysis systems. However, any application of single-item analysis must be within Section 10's limits as interpreted by this rule in &sect;3500.17(d)(2). As long as servicers are within these limits, they may use a single-item accounting procedure on pre-rule accounts for three years from the publication date of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Completion of HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A Settlement Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four comments noted that the HUD settlement statements currently use single-item analysis at closing. They raised questions concerning the proper procedures for collecting the cushion at settlement after the effective date of this rule. Some commenters were concerned that aggregate accounting at settlement could cause confusion if that method replaced the relatively simple method of adding a two-month cushion to the amounts due by the initial payment date. Several commenters suggested that single-item analysis be permitted at closing and aggregate analysis be used for all post-closing escrow activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In consideration of these concerns, HUD is offering two alternative methods for completing the HUD settlement statements during a phase-in period ending three years from the date of publication of this rule. However, one of the Department's goals in this rule is to reduce the amount borrowers must pay at closing into escrow accounts. HUD intends to implement this goal by requiring aggregate accounting practices at closing. The Department intends to make computer software available to interested persons to help make the necessary calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Under the first of the 2 methods permitted during the phase-in period, the settlement agent may use an aggregate accounting method to adjust the initial entries on the last line of the 1000 series on the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement. The Department anticipates that software and implementation materials will be generally available to settlement agents by the effective date of this rule. Alternatively, during the phase-in period the settlement agent may initially calculate the deposits using a single-item analysis approach, but with only a one-month cushion. HUD's studies indicate that a one-month cushion roughly yields the equivalent aggregate accounting result. This option is available only where aggregate accounting is not performed as part of the closing process. The final rule permits the servicer to provide the initial escrow account statement within 45 days of closing, and the servicer shall then adjust the escrow account at that time to an aggregate accounting calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Federal Reserve Board also was concerned about how lenders would calculate the amount for the mortgage insurance premium cushion in making a Truth in Lending disclosure of the annual percentage rate. HUD consulted with Federal Reserve Board officials, who indicated that the Federal Reserve Board will issue, in conjunction with the issuance of this final rule, clarifying instructions for lenders and servicers to use in completing the HUD settlement statements and in computing the annual percentage rate. Whichever of the alternative methods is used during the phase-in period, the figures currently required by the Federal Reserve Board for Regulation Z purposes will still be reported, in the same form under which they have always been reported. This practice will minimize inconvenience for both the Federal Reserve Board and lenders under Regulation Z.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Appendix F in the rule sets out examples of aggregate analysis. Appendix A contains instructions for completing the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statements during the phase-in period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Branding this as a premeditated and deliberate move to push  the North-South relations to a more acute phase of confrontation  and war from the beginning of the year, a MINJU CHOSON news  analyst says:    It goes without saying that the suspension of the "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises will lose its meaning in case a  greater war game than the "Team Spirit" is staged. If things go  like this, the "nuclear problem" will remain unsolved on the  Korean peninsula indefinitely, to say nothing of detente and  peace.    By more desperately resorting to war moves, the Kim Yong-sam  group reveals once again that it is a group of warlikers and  traitors outdistancing the preceding military dictators.    Politics is in confusion in South Korea. Through several  working contacts between the DPRK and the United States, the  third round of talks was put on the order of the day and it was  agreed to settle the issues in a package deal as proposed by the  DPRK.    Driven to a miserable position under such situation, the  traitor Kim Yong-sam is getting hysteric in North-South  confrontation and staging feverish war games from the beginning  of the year and is scheming to stage a war game surpassing the  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises in summer. This is  intended to threaten the DPRK and put a spoke in the wheel of  the DPRK-USA talks, the key to the solution of the nuclear  problem and peace on the Korean peninsula.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must look straight at the  reality and act with discretion.</p>

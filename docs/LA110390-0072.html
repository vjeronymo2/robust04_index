			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 136 FEAR IGNITES FLURRY OF TAX ACTIVITY;  </P> <P> FINANCES: LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SCRAMBLE TO PASS NEW LEVIES IN CASE 'POISON PILL'  CHOKES OFF REVENUE SOURCES.  </P> <P> Like shoppers rushing to a going-out-of-business sale, local officials in  several Southland communities are scrambling to levy new taxes in anticipation  that a proposed constitutional amendment will pass in Tuesday's election and  wipe out their power to raise revenues without first getting voter approval.  </P> <P> Lynwood acted so quickly last week to adopt an emergency 10% utility tax that  officials there said they did not have time to figure out the cost to the  average consumer.  </P> <P> Downey adopted a 3% utility tax at a special council meeting Tuesday and the  San Diego County Board of Supervisors last week voted to enact a first-ever  license tax for businesses in unincorporated areas.  </P> <P> Other communities, including San Fernando, Compton and West Hollywood, have  scheduled meetings for Monday to vote on tax levies before the controversial  initiative, Proposition 136, takes the matter out of their hands.  </P> <P> The reason for the rush is that Proposition 136 will take effect at midnight  Tuesday if it is approved by voters.  </P> <P> The measure is the brainchild of those allied with the Jarvis-Gann anti-tax  crusaders. It would prohibit a city or county from enacting a new  general-purpose tax or increasing an existing one unless a majority of voters  approved. A new or increased special-purpose tax, such as a levy to pay for  increased police protection, could not be enacted unless two-thirds of the  voters approved.  </P> <P> The measure, bankrolled largely by the liquor industry, contains some  exemptions for tax hikes needed in emergencies.  </P> <P> It is known as the "poison pill" initiative because it could also wipe out key  funding elements of at least three other propositions on Tuesday's ballot. In  one instance, it would block a new tax on alcohol unless two-thirds of the  voters approve.  </P> <P> "This is far more reaching than most people realize," said Iola Williams,  former president of the League of California Cities, which strongly opposes  136.  </P> <P> Said Compton Councilman Maxcy D. Filer: "Any time you cannot tax or raise  funds, I don't know how you can run a government, because you're at the mercy  of someone else."  </P> <P> Williams said that without direct taxing power, city and county governments run  the risk of becoming even more dependent on the state for financial support.  </P> <P> There appears to be no likelihood of a last-minute tax push by the Los Angeles  City Council, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has already  signaled its lack of interest. In some other cities, tax increases were  considered but not enacted.  </P> <P> In San Jose, where Williams is a councilwoman, officials worked for weeks to  come up with a list of possible new revenues sources. But on Tuesday, they  abandoned the effort, fearing voter resentment. .  </P> <P> San Bernardino Mayor Bob Holcomb has been trying for a month to persuade his  City Council to raise the utility tax from 8% to 9%. But even with a promise  not to implement the tax if Proposition 136 fails, Holcomb has been unable to  get enough votes for it.  </P> <P> "I think it's doing what logic dictates," the mayor said of the attempted tax  hike. He said he plans to make one last try at the City Council meeting on  Monday.  </P> <P> Backers of Proposition 136 are chortling over the beat-the-clock tax measures,  saying they will boost voter support for the initiative.  </P> <P> "It absolutely helps us enormously," said Ray McNally, a Sacramento public  relations strategist helping to orchestrate the 136 campaign. "These guys slink  around and underscore the voters' suspicions that they can't trust politicians  and that's a big selling point on Proposition 136."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, opponents of 136 winced at news of the election eve tax push.  </P> <P> "If cities all rush to do this, it makes it bad for us," said Lenny Goldberg,  director of the "No on 136" campaign.  </P> <P> But for some city officials concerned over shrinking revenue to pay for  municipal services, the political pitfalls were worth risking.  </P> <P> West Hollywood Councilwoman Babette Lang was loudly booed by the audience when  she left her sickbed this week -- where she is recuperating from a broken hip  -- to break a monthlong deadlock over a proposed business license tax. She cast  the third and deciding vote for the tax, which comes back for final approval on  Monday.  </P> <P> The measure, designed to raise $1 million a year, would impose a $270 annual  tax on a business with annual sales of $565,000.  </P> <P> "This is something that is really needed and we have to do it now," Lang said.  "Besides, the tax is minimal. I don't believe it will really hurt the business  community."  </P> <P> San Fernando Mayor James B. Hansen proposed an ordinance empowering the city to  levy taxes on basic utilities and cable television service. The measure, he  said, would give the city a quick method of raising revenue "if financial  disaster hits." .  </P> <P> The City Council will meet Monday to consider the tax.  </P> <P> "I think it's a good business decision to do it," Hansen said. However, he said  he would withdraw his support if residents voice overwhelming opposition to the  proposal. .  </P> <P> In Compton, where more than 100 city employees have been laid off over the past  two years because of budget problems, the City Council will vote Monday on  raising its utility tax from 5% to 7%.  </P> <P> "Nobody likes to impose fees but we had no choice," said Lynwood City  Councilman Paul H. Richards, referring to Proposition 136.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Stephanie Chavez, John L.

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Into the black - The week ahead Since the Pounds 149m pre-tax loss last time, British Steel has started the long climb back into the black. On Monday, even the most pessimistic of analysts is expecting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 60m for the year to March, and forecasts range as high as Pounds 95m. Most believe a maintained final dividend of 1p per share is likely, making a total of 1.5p for the year. Wessex Water is expected to draw the sector's reporting season to a close on Tuesday with the biggest dividend increase of all the top 10 water companies. Forecasts are for a pay-out of between 23.5p and 24p, against last year's 21.5p. The main issues, as with its fellow companies, will be cost savings and the performance of the non-regulated waste management business. Wessex is expected to score highly on both counts. Profit is estimated to rise by 20 per cent to about Pounds 103m. East Midlands Electricity has prepared the market already for a disappointing pre-tax profit figure for 1993/94. The total will be depressed by Pounds 130m as a result of post-privatisation acquisitions which have performed disappointingly. That will leave pre-tax profit, to be announced on Monday, at around Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m. The dividend should be unaffected at about 22.7p. Manweb, which distributes electricity in north Wales and Cheshire, is expected to announce pre-tax profit of about Pounds 125m to Pounds 130m on Tuesday. The dividend should be about 22.5p. Hazlewood Foods is expected to announce an annual pre-tax profit of up to Pounds 50m on Tuesday, down from the previous year's Pounds 55m on turnover of Pounds 761.8m. Last year's figure is unlikely to be matched even after taking out exceptional charges related to restructuring and the sale of a Dutch subsidiary. Wednesday sees the first annual result from specialist chemicals group BTP since it acquired most of ailing MTM in June last year. The MTM businesses have been coming through well and analysts expect pre-tax profit to have jumped from Pounds 20.5m to around Pounds 29m. The MTM deal was funded by a rights issue, which will hold back growth in underlying earnings per share to about 15 per cent. Forecasts for this year vary widely, so the shares will be sensitive to comments about present trading. Rothmans International, the tobacco group now shorn of its luxury goods interests, is expected to report a lower annual profit on Thursday due to the Pounds 48m costs associated with the demerger of Dunhill. BZW, the broker, is forecasting a pre-tax figure of Pounds 440m, down from a pro forma Pounds 470m the previous year.</p>

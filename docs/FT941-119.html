			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Observer: The green forays The Thai army - famous for staging 17 coups d'etat and doing well out of logging businesses - is trying to mollify public fears of yet another upheaval. A senior officer has written in Thailand's Army News a piece called 'Fear no coup'. It explains that coups are caused not by ambitious soldiers but by the shortcomings of democracy and 'inappropriate behaviour' by politicians. The piece adds that a typical warning sign of a coup is criticism of the government for ineptitude by the media and academics. Very comforting; the media have been in anti-government overdrive of late. The Bangkok Post headlined its story on the army's views thus: 'No coup if MPs doing good job'. Is that over one week or three?</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Improved margins behind 71% advance at T&amp;N THE FRUITS of investment in the US and cost-cutting showed through in T&amp;N's 71 per cent increase in pre-tax profit, from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 34.7m, in the six months to end-June. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive of the motor components and engineering group, said it was considering a German acquisition. Opportunities were arising as previously expensive companies fell into losses. 'The time to buy is when people want to sell,' he said. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 712m (Pounds 699m). The main reason for the profits advance was a better operating margin of 8.4 per cent, up from 7.1 per cent, before exceptional costs of Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 6.8m) for job cuts and plant closures. Profit after the exceptionals rose to Pounds 54.4m (Pounds 42.8m). The pre-tax figure was struck after Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 7.3m) of payments related to asbestos claims and interest costs of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 16.6m). Earnings per share of 4p (2.82p) just covered the maintained interim dividend of 3.6p. In the US, where T&amp;N paid nearly Pounds 100m (and brought in Pounds 90m debt) for JPI two years ago, operating profit jumped from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 12m on flat turnover of Pounds 168m (Pounds 164m). In the UK, the benefits of cost-cutting pushed up operating profit from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 20.7m on sales of Pounds 273m (Pounds 275m). Mr Hope stressed the importance of UK earnings in the face of advance corporation tax rules that penalised international companies. The tax rate fell below 48 per cent in the first half compared with 55 per cent for 1991. Although the continental profit figure looked disappointing at Pounds 6.2m, down from Pounds 7.4m, it was depressed by redundancy costs in Germany and a six week strike at an Italian factory. Profits from the rest of the world rose by Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 15.5m. Interim net debt stood at Pounds 180.6m (Pounds 188.8m), gearing of 33.5 per cent. COMMENT It has been much easier to appreciate T&amp;N's industrial strategy of building up an international auto engineering group than its record on earnings per share and returns on cash outlay. It has managed to sustain capital spending at Pounds 80m to Pounds 100m a year, increase research and development, take heavy rationalisation costs and maintain an uncovered dividend. Something would have to give - and shareholders have often done so through rights issues. The crucial link between the industrial strategy and the profit and loss account - cutting costs to achieve international competitiveness - has delivered some good news. Even so the 10.85p total dividend looks set to be uncovered again this year, assuming a pre-tax profit approaching Pounds 70m. The prospective p/e is about 17 after yesterday's 9p rise in the share price to 136p. A yield of nearly 11 per cent offers support, although the distribution level continues to invite some criticism. A German acquisition of, say, Pounds 100m would weigh down the balance sheet and raise the spectre of a rights issue as soon as the share price registered significant gains.</p>

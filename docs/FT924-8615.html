			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Ahlstrom to take key role in Enso AHLSTROM, the Finnish forest and metals engineering group, is set to become the leading private shareholder in Enso-Gutzeit through a forest-for-shares deal worth FM926m (Dollars 185m). Enso, one of Europe's leading forest industry groups, is buying 100,000 hectares of forest in south-eastern Finland from Ahlstrom. Payment will be in the form of 44m new Enso shares, which equates to 23.5 per cent of the shares in Enso and 10.1 per cent of the votes. The deal still leaves the Finnish state as the largest shareholder, with 59 per cent of the votes. Mr Jukka Harmala, Enso's president, said the transaction would increase the size of the group's raw material base to more than 450,000 hectares. It would also improve the group's debt/equity ratio, he added. Enso will issue 6.6m series A restricted shares at FM27 each and 37.4m series R restricted shares at FM20 each to Ahlstrom. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year, with the new shares entitled to a dividend from 1993 onwards.</p>

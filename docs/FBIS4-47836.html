			<p>BFN     [Text] Rioting former ANC guerrillas, some drunk,  threatened their commander and stoned ANC cars at a camp near  Pretoria while the rest of South Africa celebrated Nelson  Mandela's election win.    One of the cars was apparently set on fire and SADF [South  African Defence Force] troops had to fire warning shots to  restore order, sources close to the ANC said yesterday.    Three of the rioters were said to have been injured by other  guerrillas helping the army.    The riot erupted on Monday night after protests by angry  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK]  members dissatisfied about pay and food at the tented camp.    Mandela, in a speech late on Monday marking the ANC's  election victory, paid tribute to SA's security forces.    "We also commend the security forces for the sterling work  done. This has laid a solid foundation for a truly professional  security force committed to the service of the people and  loyalty to the new constitution," he said.    About 200 former guerrillas were involved in the riot, which  was quelled after MK chief-of-staff Siphiwe Nyanda called on  SADF troops to restore order.    "Warning shots were fired in the air to subdue the crowd,"  said one official, who did not wish to be identified.    About 4,500 former guerrillas are based at the Wallmannstal  assembly camp north of Pretoria, ready for integration with  South African troops in a unified national defence force.    Officers at Wallmannstal said about 170 MK members were  being  held, most by military police, after the incident.    The ANC said it would comment later on the incident.    The base's joint operations centre issued a terse statement  late on Monday saying the unrest was a result of the soldiers'  complaints about pay and food.    "Mr Nyanda, chief-of-staff of the MK contingent of the non-  statutory element of the South African National Defence Force  (SANDF), was called to explain the situation to disgruntled  soldiers.    "During the meeting, a small group of drunk troops stoned Mr  Nyanda's and other MK commanders' cars. Mr Nyanda asked the  SADF contingent of the SANDF for help to keep order. The  situation was brought under control and disciplinary action  would be taken," the statement said.    There have been several other similar incidents involving  ex-  guerrillas being integrated into joint military structures.    The National Peacekeeping Force -- grouping ex-guerrillas,  former homeland armies, the SADF and SAP [South African Police]  -- has been given a secondary role in townships after failing to  stem unrest in the communities it was set up to protect.    The peace force was hit by desertions and drunkenness during  its training and several hundred former guerrillas went on  strike demanding more pay -- which they got.</p>

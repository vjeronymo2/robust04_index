			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Removal of asbestos containing flooring materials is a Class II asbestos job. As such, it must be performed using the operation specific controls set out in paragraph (g)(ii)(a), or when called for by an ``exposure assessment using ``alternative'' controls. Additional controls must be used if the employer does not produce a ``negative exposure assessment'' prior to the beginning of the job, if during the job, there is reasonable belief that a permissible exposure level will be exceeded, or if methods are used which are expected to result in flooring material breaking or otherwise removed in a non-intact state. The required controls in large part mirror those of the proposal which were based on work practice recommended by the Resilient Flooring Covering Institute (RFCI). Additional ``non-aggressive'' practices are allowed, in response to supporting data and to commenters such as Michael Murphy of Monsanto who asked that OSHA ``*&blank;*&blank;* allow the use of other practices which achieve comparable results'' (Ex. 7&hyph;125).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that these provisions are necessary and appropriate to reduce risk to workers who perform this type of activity. The relative level of risk of removing asbestos-containing flooring was considered in the rulemaking. OSHA has not classified asbestos containing flooring as ``high risk.'' The degree of risk from removing these materials depends on the kind of removal activity performed, and on the condition of the material. Data relating to flooring removal show overall lower levels than TSI and surfacing ACM (see e.g., Ex. 7&hyph;100; 7&hyph;132). Thus, EPA recently included resilient floor covering, in its lowest risk category (Category I non-friable ACM). However EPA concluded that ``if these materials are in poor condition and are friable or they are subjected to sanding, grinding, cutting or abrading, they are to be treated as friable asbestos materials (55 FR at 48409). The OSHA record supports these findings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Opinions of some asbestos abatement experts familiar with a range of asbestos removal projects agreed with the basis for EPA's and OSHA's classification scheme. Marshall Marcus stated that flooring removals, when well conducted are likely to involve lower exposures than removals of other types of interior asbestos containing materials; whereas Mary Finn emphasized that removing of flooring tile, because it cannot be saturated easily, may, when aggressively removed, result in significant exposures (see testimony of Marshall Marcus, Tr. 3794 and Mary Finn Tr. 3765).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA's approach of requiring those removal methods which are unlikely to elevate exposures was challenged by participants who contended that methods for removing flooring cannot be determined at the beginning of the project. This might occur when employees discover during the project that flooring is resistant to removal. This may be difficult to predict in advance, as pointed out by BCTD (Ex. 143 at 155, citing testimony of asbestos contractor and consultant Marshall Marcus, Tr. 3794 and others). OSHA acknowledges that such difficulties may occur. However, as pointed out by Mary Finn, many of the variables contributing to exposures are available for consideration at the inception of the project; ``*&blank;*&blank;* the predictability of how aggressive one must remove floor tile varies from job to job depending on the age of the particular materials, depending on the wear that it's undergone and depending on the techniques that the particular contractor and his workers might use'' (Tr. 3744).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, OSHA notes that much of the project data submitted show consistency in practices over the entire project. In cases where more aggressive methods are resorted to mid-job, OSHA requires a ``mid-course correction:'' a re-evaluation of the exposure potential by the competent person, and the installation of additional controls if the projection is that the exposures will exceed the PEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most ``aggressive'' techniques, such as ``shot-blasting'' may be used only after an evaluation showed that less aggressive methods are not feasible. Even if the evaluation of the ``aggressive'' method shows exposures will be below the PEL, the employees must still install critical barriers or otherwise isolate the removal operation [paragraph (g)(4)(i)(B)(2)], and employees must wear respirators. This is required regardless of when such ``aggressive'' methods were used, at the inception, or mid-way into a removal job.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific ``non-aggressive'' control methods are allowed and preferred for removing flooring materials (tile, sheet, and mastics) which contain asbestos and those materials for which the employer/building owner has not verified the absence of asbestos. The controls are ``non-aggressive'' work practices, and include the practices which under OSHA's proposal would have allowed an exemption from the requirement to erect a negative pressure enclosure for flooring material removal (see 55 FR at 29719).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA did not propose to require employers to assume that vinyl or asphalt tile or resilient flooring was asbestos containing, although the RFCI recommended that such an assumption be made. OSHA asked for comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several industrial hygienists agreed that the recommendation should be followed. For example, David Kirby, industrial hygienist, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, testified that an ongoing survey of ORNL facilities showed that ``90 percent of our floor tile either contained asbestos or the mastic material that's used to attach them to the floors contained asbestos.'' Mr. Kirby recommended that it's ``prudent to *&blank;*&blank;* assume that all floor tile materials contain asbestos, unless you can prove the contrary *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Tr. 124&hyph;125). According to Mr. Kirby, negating the presence of asbestos content in flooring material entails a complex and expensive process; ``taking those materials, having them ashed, using high temperature ashing techniques, and then the residue could be analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.'' Other evidence in the record indicated the prevalence of asbestos containing flooring material. An EPA 1988 survey, cited in the HEI report, reported that 42% of public and commercial buildings within the U.S. contain asbestos containing floor tile (Ex. 1&hyph;344). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> VOLUME OF CO2 CAUSED BY FOREST LOSS POSES A PUZZLE  </P> <P> Scientists trying to understand Earth's greenhouse warming are struggling with  a basic frustration. They are convinced that heavy loss of forests is adding  heat-trapping carbon dioxide (CO2) gas to the atmosphere. But they cannot make  even a ballpark guess at the amount.  </P> <P> Statistics for Earth's forest cover on which they base their calculations are  turning out to be seriously in error. There is much less CO2 absorbing biomass  per square meter on average in a forest than standard references report. This  throws assessments of the climatic impact of deforestation -- and, conversely,  of the beneficial climatic effect of reforestation -- into doubt.  </P> <P> Research by Daniel Botkin and Lloyd Simpson at UC Santa Barbara and by Sandra  Brown at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, shows that widely used  estimates of forest biomass overstate Earth's inventory by 100% to 300%. The  message, Brown said, is "Forget all those (old biomass) numbers. They're just  not valid anymore."  </P> <P> Berrien Moore III at the University of New Hampshire's Complex Systems Research  Center calls this "one of the most frustrating things" for scientists trying to  understand global climate change.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CO2 Produced by Decay  </P> <P> A growing tree takes CO2 out of the air and locks up the carbon in its tissues.  The tree releases the carbon -- generally as CO2 -- when it dies and decays or  is burned. This is a key part of Earth's carbon cycle. The burning of fossil  fuels is the biggest source of new atmospheric CO2. But, with 70,000 to 110,000  square kilometers of land being deforested and put to other uses each year,  scientists expect the loss of forest biomass to be a significant secondary CO2  source, Moore said.  </P> <P> He added that even taking account of deforestation along with other known CO2  sources and allowing for CO2 "sinks" such as removal by the sea, scientists  have been unable to account fully for atmospheric CO2 concentrations. "It looks  like we don't understand the carbon cycle," Moore said. The realization that  scientists have been using the wrong numbers for forest biomass adds to this  frustration.  </P> <P> Simpson said the numbers result from unwarranted extrapolation of narrowly  limited surveys to global scales. He and Botkin have studied the northern  (boreal) forest that stretches from Alaska to Newfoundland. He noted that  previous estimates of the average biomass of that forest were based on sampling  done near cities and universities. These are along the southern part of the  forest where the tree cover is denser so they give an inflated estimate of the  biomass average.  </P> <P> Botkin and Simpson applied a random-sampling statistical technique developed  for crop surveys to the entire forest. They came up with a biomass average of  4.17 kilograms per square kilometer with an uncertainty of 24%. The averages in  general use are two to three times higher.  </P> <P> Brown has found comparable overestimates for tropical forests. Her latest study  for southern and Southeast Asia yields a biomass average of about 25 kilograms  per square kilometer. Standard values are twice as high. "This suggests that  deforestation is not as significant a source of CO2" as estimates since 1980  have implied, she said.  </P> <P> She added that this lays more of the blame for atmospheric CO2 buildup on  fossil-fuel burning. But it does not justify deforestation. She points out that  forests are valuable for many things besides their climatic role. These include  genetic resources, water supply and products other than timber.  </P> <P> In fact, Charles Peters of the New York Botanical Garden, Alwyn Gentry of the  Missouri Botanical Garden and Robert Mendelshon of Yale University published an  analysis of the value of non-wood forest products last June 29 in Nature. They  show that, in the Amazon forest, sustained harvest of such products as fruit,  oils, latex, fibers and medicines can be two to three times more profitable  than cutting the trees and trying to farm the land.  </P> <P> Botkin and Simpson are extending their research to North American temperate  forests. Brown is moving ahead with a program to provide estimates of forest  biomass within each square of a grid of 0.5-degree latitude/longitude squares  for the entire forested globe. Both scientists emphasize much more research  will be needed to give climate-change analysts a reliable biomass data base  with which to work.  </P></p>

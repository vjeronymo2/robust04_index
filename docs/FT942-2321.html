			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / PO staff may get free shares in sell-off Thousands of postal workers may receive more than Pounds 400 in free shares in the Post Office if Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wins support for his plan to sell 51 per cent of the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. Mr Heseltine wants to distribute more free shares to workers in the sale of the Post Office than in any previous privatisation. He disclosed the plan during recent presentations to Tory backbenchers in an effort to gain their support for the planned sale. Mr Heseltine hopes next week to publish a green paper setting out the options for change. He wants 10 per cent of the shares reserved for the workforce, the maximum number allowed under Stock Exchange rules. However, under Mr Heseltine's plan a greater proportion of the shares reserved for employees would be free than in any previous government flotation. He is considering offering the free shares on the basis of length of employee service. He is also considering offering postal staff free shares to match the amount they purchase. With more than 170,000 employees working for Royal Mail, the letter service and Parcelforce, 10 per cent of the shares in the Pounds 1bn sell-off would see postal staff rewarded with more than Pounds 800 worth of preferential shares. Half of those shares would be free for longer-serving staff. While the green paper recognises that the Royal Mail and Parcelforce could be kept in the public sector, the DTI remains confident that Mr Heseltine will win his cabinet colleagues' backing to proceed with privatisation. Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the DTI minister responsible for the Post Office, will outline the importance of changing the Post Offices structure in a speech tomorrow to a London Conference on the future of the corporation. He is expected to issue a warning to Tory backbenchers who want to limit privatisation to the sale of a 49 per cent stake in the corporation that the sale of a minority stake would not give the corporation enough freedom from the constraints of the public sector. The Post Office will today announce record pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 300m in the year to the end of the March 1994. But Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, will point out that a decline in letterbox mail, the first in recent history, underlines the need for the greater commercialisation at the corporation.</p>

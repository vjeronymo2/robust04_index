			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Lars-Ludvig Roed report: "Farmers Turn Guns on EU"] </F>   [Text] The Association of Norwegian Farmers is moving its  guns into position: In the next few days and weeks strategy on  the European Union [EU] will be staked out, and farmer's own  knowledge of the EU will be increased. Yesterday the first  regional meeting of the farmers' association, the farmers'  wives' association, young farmers' groups and the agricultural  cooperation organization came to an end.    In the course of a few weeks, the country's more prominent  farmers' representatives will have met and put together their  figures and arguments. The farmers' association is investing  much in its support for and involvement in No to the EU, but it  also wants to to be very visible locally. An additional -- and  voluntary -- membership subscription of 400 kroner will go to  support campaigning. The aim is that in the end it will be very  few Norwegians who say "don't know" when asked what impact the  EU will have on Norwegian agriculture.    It is a very competent participant in the debate that is now  giving the starting signal for the battle against the results  the government achieved in the EU membership negotiations. With  its own office in Brussels and staff who have been very close to  the EU's and Norway's delegations: "We have never been more  than two days behind the negotiations; sometimes, because of our  large contact network, we were even ahead of the Norwegian  negotiators when it came to knowledge of the EU's positions,"  said Leif Forsell, head of the farmers' association's economic  policy section, when he yesterday briefed the "farming elite"  from Ostfold, Akershus, Vestfold, and Buskerud. But he did not  have much other good news from Brussels.    In the conference hall of As Hotel he presented a series of  calculations that pointed without exception to solid minus  figures for Norwegian farmers in the EU, regardless of whether  they concentrate on grain, hogs, or milk production.    The important question of how many people will be covered by  the concept of "northern agriculture" -- that is, areas where  Norway will be able to maintain comprehensive support  arrangements -- has still not been clarified. But this lack of  clarity was of no use to yesterday's audience of around 30; with  farms in eastern Norway they belong to the region that has the  least prospect of being defined as northern.    The frustration was palpable, because individual farmers  think it bitterly ironic that those areas of Norway that are  best suited to agriculture are also the areas that will be  covered by the toughest conditions in the EU. The fact that  Leif Forsell hinted that competitiveness would be less of a  problem if farmers make the transition from  grain/hogs/poultry/cheese/butter to cattle, for example, was  cold comfort: Not even with cattle will profits be significant,  and making a transition takes time. But Forsell's example  calculations were crystal clear: Without any support a farm  with around 100 acres of grain will lose all of its net income  of 115,000 kroner -- it would actually move into minus figures.  "And I am not painting an excessively black picture; these are  the government's own figures," he pointed out.</p>

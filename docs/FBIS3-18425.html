			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta by </F> correspondent Stefano Tomassini on 2 March; place not given]    [Text] [Tomassini] Minister, these have been long and  difficult negotiations, and talks with Norway, for example, are  still not over. Why has it been so difficult?    [Andreatta] These have been the first negotiations toward  widening the European Union [EU] since Maastricht, and a group  of countries, including Italy, wants to set very strict  conditions -- that is to say, immediately bringing even new  member countries in at the stage where Europe has no borders.    [Tomassini] Turning to Austria, how and in what way is the  entry of this country into the EU important for Italy?    [Andreatta] For Italy it means truly implementing  Maastricht.  In effect, we only had free borders with France. A large part  of our borders were still subject to the delays of frontier  controls. Above all, politically speaking, Austria's membership,  which we have strongly advocated, represents the opening of  possibilities in a new and imminent cycle in which countries  from central and eastern Europe join the Union.    [Tomassini] Some people will certainly be thinking that an  enlarged Europe is tantamount to a watered down Europe. Is  there a real risk that some of the original spirit of the  community will be lost?    [Andreatta] Of course. Any institution which grows is  subject to tensions, but it is also enriched. The culture of  northern democracies will be a very important component in the  future Europe. But I believe that this risk must be faced,  because events which have happened since 1989 mean that if  Europe wants a political role it must bring order to the process  of developing democracies in the former socialist countries.  This entails enlargement.</p>

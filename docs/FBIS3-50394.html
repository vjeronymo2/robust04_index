			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Seven brigades of the Croatian Army, assisted by  paramilitary formations of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO],  are continuing their fierce attacks in the direction of Gornji  Vakuf and the river Lasva valley, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's  press center has announced.    Fighters from Sibenik, Osijek, Vukovar, Vinkovci, Varazdin,  and Zagreb are amassing around Gornji Vakuf with constant  artillery support. Zagreb's assurances that these are not  Croatian Army units, but volunteers from Bosnia were already  heard at the beginning of the Serb aggression against the  internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina.

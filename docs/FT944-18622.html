			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: Wagner in period - London concerts Performances on 'period' instruments are catching up with musical history. A movement that initially concerned itself with Baroque and Classical repertory has now encompassed the early Romantic period. Under Roger Norrington, the London Classical Players have been steadily exploring the 19th century, and on Saturday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall they stepped further into the 'unknown' with the culminating Romantic composer: Richard Wagner. The occasion was Norrington's 'Wagner Day', devised as an exploration of German Romantic music parallel to the South Bank's Deutsche Romantik exhibition. Its aims were more modest than his previous, celebrated 'Experience' weekends, and no attempt was made to cover the range of the Hayward show - that would have meant playing Mozart through to Stockhausen. Rather, Saturday's events focused on the half-century from the death of Beethoven to that of Wagner, and we were restricted to small bites: two talks and two short concerts of chamber music contrasting one early and one late Romantic, Schubert and Liszt; there was no room to explore the darker side of Wagner's Romanticism. The revelations all came in the evening's concert, the first half of which consisted of overtures by Beethoven (Coriolan), Weber (Freischutz), Mendelssohn (Hebrides) and Schumann (Genoveva), played on instruments of the mid-to-late 19th century, as Wagner would have heard them. After the interval, Norrington picked up the threads with the Overture to Rienzi (written in 1840, seven years before Genoveva), in a thrilling performance where smaller-scale - though never under-nourished - climaxes were punctuated by clanging cymbals and shrieking piccolo. Orchestra and conductor clearly relished their new challenge, and communicated their sense of discovery to the audience. But giving Wagner the 'period' treatment means more than playing on gut strings with no vibrato: since the composer's death, performances of his music have become markedly slower, and Norrington's re-thinking of tempos provided the greatest insights. By observing that the 6/8 time signature in the Tristan Prelude means two beats per bar, Norrington got away from the now-customary, cloying six, and in the process gave a performance full of surging passion. In adhering to Wagner's own timing for the Meistersinger Prelude, he produced a refreshing, animated account that underlined the opera's comic spirit. We also heard the Preludes to Parsifal and Act 3 of Lohengrin. Now we must hear whole operas: arguments about the size of Wagner voices today would perhaps be settled, and - were Norrington conducting - opera houses might save on their overtime bills.</p>

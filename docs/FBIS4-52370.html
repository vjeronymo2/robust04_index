			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency Sam Rangsi, state minister and  minister of the economy and finance, said recently that rural  development is very important to the Royal Government in its  struggle against the Khmer Rouge. He added that, within the  next few years, Cambodia will need greatly increased foreign  funds if it is to fight against acute poverty, corruption, and  violence.    At present, the Royal Government is facing big political and  economic problems in a country which has lost everything due to  war.    The excellency said that within the next two to three years  we will need greatly increased foreign funds and more foreign  experts to help bring Cambodia to normalcy and train its human  resources.    His excellency the state minister said that he wants a  market  economy, but at the same time the country also needs the  monarchy.    He said the international donors will help (?and encourage)  us to build a correct, legal, strong and [word indistinct]  system.    His excellency the minister of the economy and finance also  said that, in a country in which over 85 percent of the  population are farmers, the land ownership law is very important  and peasants should be encouraged to stay in their hometown  rather than immigrate into the cities or be compelled by poverty  to join the Khmer Rouge.    His excellency stressed that efforts should be made to  enable  the people to stay in their hometowns and have enough to feed  themselves in line with the goal to make Cambodia  self-sufficient in food. He added that this is the best means  of defense against the Khmer Rouge.</p>

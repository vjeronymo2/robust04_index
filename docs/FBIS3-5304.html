			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear friends; in the Today Issues feature today, I  would like to discuss the issue of boat people, a concern to  many people.    As announced before, on 14 February a conference of  high-ranking government representatives from various Southeast  Asian countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, France,  Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, Vietnam, and other  countries, was held in Geneva to discuss the issues relating to  boat people, mainly Vietnamese.    The conference attendants reported that there are presently  some 60,000 Vietnamese boat people currently living in various  refugee camps in Hong Kong and some Southeast Asian countries.  Most of these people are not considered genuine refugees and  will have no choice other than returning to Vietnam. The  conference attendants declared that they will not and are not be  able to contribute finance to support and provide free health  services to these people indefinitely. All refugee camps are  planning to close as early as possible before the deadline of  late 1995.    Regarding repatriation allowance, a boat person returning to  Vietnam used to be eligible for a $360 allowance, which has  recently been reduced to $240 and will be further reduced.  Apart from the allowance reduction, there are two other  concrete provisions worth noting. First, the boat people  arriving in Hong Kong, Japan, and Southeast Asia after 27  September 1991 will not be eligible for the allowance nor the  European Community [EC] program, an assistance program that  funds projects of settlement and employment for repatriates.  Second, the credit, occupational training, and financial  allowance programs of the EC will be terminated in November 1994.    The Vietnamese boat people living outside of Vietnam,  therefore, should return voluntarily and soon to Vietnam while  they are still eligible for assistance from these financial  support programs.    Dear friends, 60,000 Vietnamese living in overseas refugee  camps are related to tens of thousands of families or millions  of people all around the country. Therefore, I think that the  information released here is important to many people. It is  even more important to those who, for some reason, still have  the intention to flee illegally from their motherland.    In implementing the renovation policy initiated and led by  the Communist Party of Vietnam, our people have achieved  important progress in the last three years. Many economic goals  previously planned to be achieved by the end of 1995 had already  been fulfilled at the end of 1993. We have progressed from the  stage where many people did not have enough to eat, to being  able to resolve the food shortage problem and exporting some 1.4  million tonnes of rice every year. The inflation rate decreased  from a three-digit to a two-digit number and came down to 4.4  percent in 1993. More than 700 projects, large and small, of  foreign investment with a total capital of over $7 billion are  being developed in various socioeconomic sectors all over the  country. The living standards of our people, though still not  quite satisfactory, have been improved significantly. The  social and political stability are well safeguarded.    Our developing economy, our stabilized society, and the  assistance from the world community, are the key factors to help  nearly 20,000 people from various refugee camps return in the  last three years, quickly reintegrate into the community, and  resettle fairly well. Many of them have become rich.    Inherited from our thousand-year-old generous tradition, the  merciful Vietnam motherland, the people, and the authorities at  all levels always open arms widely for the children, the  siblings, and the friends coming back from the wrong. New  opportunities and challenges are awaiting each and every citizen  of Vietnam. Out of your home, out of work. [sentence as heard]  There is no place like your own people's community and your own  motherland, would you agree with me? If you are of the same  opinion, every one of us, in our own circumstances, should do  something to prove our people's love to each other and advance  together toward the goals of a prosperous people and a strong  country.</p>

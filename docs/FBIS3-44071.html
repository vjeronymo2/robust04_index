			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   ANC Health Plan--"It's going to be extremely difficult for  anyone to lightly dismiss the ANC's [African National Congress]  new health plan. It has morality and common-sense on its side,"  begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 21 January in a  page-8 editorial. However, the ANC's "good intentions are one  thing, mechanisms for successfully implementing them quite  another," warns THE STAR. Regarding the ANC's plan to  discourage private sector health care, THE STAR believes that  "from the ANC's point of view, such restrictions are necessary  to achieve equity in health care provision, but they are already  being described as having `overtones of socialism.'"  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   ANC Health Plan--"The ANC, like US President Bill Clinton a  year ago, will enter government faced with a health service in  crisis due to rising costs which are placing health care beyond  the means of many people. The draft national health plan  published on Wednesday for public debate is an honest attempt to  address that crisis," starts an editorial on page 8 of the  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 21 January. "Some of  its prescriptions, though, are off the mark." Financing the ANC  plan "assumes the existing budgets should meet most requirements  once savings have been made through the elimination of  mismanagement and general inefficiencies which have  characterised the apartheid era. This is wishful thinking."  "It is naive to think that rationalisation will bring major  cost savings." With financing of the plan a given problem, the  "main shortcoming is the desire to `discourage' private sector  health care." "The test for the ANC is to produce an affordable  plan without threatening existing services and standards."    Mandela's Violence Accusations Viewed--"There is one glaring  flaw in ANC president Nelson Mandela's repeated claim that  President FW de Klerk and his government have consciously  orchestrated township violence to undermine the ANC's support  base," states a second editorial on the same page. "Opinion  polls show ANC support has risen steadily in tandem with levels  of violence, while NP [National Party] fortunes have declined."  "It is easy, as Mandela repeatedly does on this issue, to take  cheap shots based on less than rigorous analysis. We could just  as easily argue that, to judge by the outcome, Mandela and the  ANC orchestrated the violence to improve their own standing at  the polls." In conclusion the paper writes that "no one can  stop Mandela continuing to make this claim against De Klerk. He  has already made it so often that it has become folklore in ANC  circles. But it will hardly improve the unifying abilities of  the future president of the government of national unity."</p>

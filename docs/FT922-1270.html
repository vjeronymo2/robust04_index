			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: FDA approves Merck drug MERCK, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, has received US regulatory permission to market its Proscar drug for the treatment and control of benign prostate disease, writes Karen Zagor. The Food and Drug Administration's ruling comes about four months after an advisory panel to the US watchdog decided that the benefits of Proscar outweighed the risks. Although the FDA had been widely expected to approve the drug after the advisory panel's decision, news that Proscar would be on the market by late July spurred active trading in Merck shares, which rose Dollars 2 1/4 on Wall Street yesterday to close at Dollars 50 1/2 . Merck believes that Proscar will be its next Dollars 1bn product. Earlier this month Proscar was approved for marketing in the UK.</p>

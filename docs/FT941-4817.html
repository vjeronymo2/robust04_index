			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian TV network cautious in spite of rise Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network Australia, the country's dominant commercial TV operator, yesterday announced an after-tax profit of ADollars 48.51m (USDollars 34.9m) for the six months to end-December, up by 25.3 per cent on the same period of 1992-93. However, Nine warned that the increased costs associated with covering overseas sporting events - including the Winter Olympics and the current South African cricket tour - would peg its second-half profit at around last time's figure. 'The directors are not anticipating a second-half result significantly above last year,' said the company. Nine Network said its earnings before interest and tax rose by 15 per cent to ADollars 72.7m, with TV advertising increasing by over 10 per cent, mainly in the first quarter. Total group revenue stood at ADollars 312.4m, compared with ADollars 288.1m last time - an increase of 8.4 per cent. Nine said the slower overall increase reflected the sale of the Perth radio stations and flat revenue growth at Sky Channel. Ashton Mining, the Australian diamond producer, yesterday reported a net profit of ADollars 36.6m in 1993, up from ADollars 35.4m the previous year. The 1993 figure is scored after an ADollars 11.8m net abnormal item (nil in the previous year). Ashton said the performance was 'particularly pleasing, given the lower diamond sales revenue resulting from the full-year impact of the CSO deferred purchases in 1993'.</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong Last week's Hong Kong flotation of the Denway car venture was a vivid demonstration that investing in Chinese companies is fast becoming a speculative mania. Doubtless Denway produces estimable products, and double-digit growth rates in China guarantee a ready market. Still, oversubscription of 657 times is getting out of hand. Price/earnings multiples of shares in Chinese companies are often three times those of Hong Kong equivalents, while disclosure and accounting standards are lower. Even the legal status of equity holders is uncertain. Some attempt has been made to define property in China, but it has never been tested in the courts. Claims on assets held in joint ventures with Chinese municipal authorities may be hard to enforce. While this may not matter too much while things are going well, the risks are substantial. Property investors may be the first to get their fingers burnt, with as much as 800m sq ft of development already agreed in principle. This is far in excess of any possible need. Only well-located projects stand a good chance of making money. Of course, many direct investments in China are doing well. Some ventures export 90 per cent of their output. The low cost base produces such a quick return that risk of heavy capital loss is minimal. But portfolio investment requires a level of scepticism which is currently out of fashion. An overheating Chinese economy may dampen interest in large flotations such as Shanghai Petrochemical, due later this year. For the time being, fear has yet to conquer greed.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN OIL  </P> <P> Your editorial is absolutely right. We must use oil more efficiently. One way  of achieving this is to replace the direct burning of oil with the use of  electricity.  </P> <P> This can be done in industry, transportation and even home heating. It has been  demonstrated that the high efficiency of many electrical processes more than  compensates for the energy losses encountered in generating and delivering  electricity.  </P> <P> Furthermore, using electricity means that we are not dependent on a single  fuel. If foreign oil becomes unavailable we still have an abundant supply of  electricity that can be generated with domestic coal and nuclear energy.  Another plus is that nuclear and coal generating plants don't compete with home  heating for fuel oil.  </P> <P> SULLIVAN S. MARSDEN JR.  </P> <P> Prof. of Petroleum Engineering  </P> <P> Stanford University  </P></p>

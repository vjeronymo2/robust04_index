			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Strikebreakers keep 47% of railways open Railtrack said 47 per cent of the network remained open once signal workers had begun their third 48-hour stoppage yesterday in their 12-week dispute over pay. The proportion of the network kept open was the best achieved by Railtrack, the state-owned rail infrastructure company, on any strike day. However, the number of trains which ran - 45 per cent - was about the same as last week. The latest strike is due to run until noon tomorrow and will be followed by a 24-hour stoppage next Thursday - during the Trades Union Congress in Blackpool. The RMT transport union said the strike was still 'solidly supported'. Mr John Ellis, Railtrack's production manager, agreed yesterday that the strike had not yet 'crumbled'. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, attacked an offer by Railtrack to its managers, inspectors and supervisors of free trips to Paris and Brussels next month on the Channel tunnel Eurostar service, which is not yet open to the public. Mr Knapp said the company's reward for 'strikebreakers' might have been better spent on trying to resolve the grievances of the signal workers. He pointed out that the offer was not available to non-RMT signalling staff who had been working through the dispute. Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, called on the signal workers yesterday to urge their union to go back into negotiation. He said: 'I hope the signalmen will ask their union for how much longer the railway industry must suffer while its passengers and freight users desert, and what will be the long-term effect of this on their jobs.' In a bulletin sent to signal workers yesterday, Railtrack warned there were only 24 working days left to settle their grievances and improve their pension benefits by up to Pounds 50m. The British Rail Pension Fund actuary has confirmed that the deadline to agree the restructuring package for signal workers and secure the millions reserved to meet the costs of upgrading pensions is September 30. 'If that dealine passes Railtrack's pension fund will lose that money', Railtrack warned. The bulletin said 105 signal workers were due to retire between September 1995 and September 1996, and they would suffer a fall in the value of their pensions if there were no deal by the end of next month. Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director, said yesterday: 'For them and many that will receive these benefits in the future, the 30 September deadline is vital.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["At the Crossroads of Opinion" live phone-in with Ukrainian </F> President Leonid Kravchuk, moderated by Viktoriya Popovych and  Vadym Zadorozhnyy]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]    [Popovych] We will begin our conversation with the president  by analyzing the economic situation in Ukraine, for the economic  situation directly affects the political situation in our state.  And so, Leonid Makarovych, the state of Ukraine's economy at the  moment when it acquired independence and today, and the  objective and subjective factors, which have affected and are  affecting our economy, please.    [Kravchuk] Well, if one is to compare the figures, then  naturally the state of the economy on the day of independence  was better than today. But those were different economies --  the one on the day of independence and today's economy. There  was the economy of the post-Soviet period. It has not exhausted  precisely these features even now.    But the shoots of a new economy, a market economy, are now  beginning to appear. They are appearing everywhere -- in  industry, in the agrarian sector, in construction. That is, a  new structure is now emerging. Proprietors are emerging. And  the reform of the economy into a market one is proceeding  gradually. It is difficult, but it is proceeding. Naturally  this process of transition from one economy to another one  cannot be painless or easy, therefore, the level of the decline  of production naturally is great, that is, if one is to look  only at the process.    But there are subjective factors, as you rightly say. These  are Ukraine's great dependence on energy-carriers, which have  increased by tens, hundreds, thousands of times recently, I mean  the prices. There is the problem of management. There is the  problem of personnel. There is the problem of the purely  functional dependence of our economy on the economies of other  states of the former Soviet Union. There are links that truly  cannot be in the same mode as they were in before. They should  change. They should improve. They should acquire an entirely  different substance and nature, not centralized or  administrative, but namely the search for the best paths, the  best way out of the situation.    And we already see, although it is too early yet to speak of  some sort of successes, but there are already, well, say, some  kind of healthy processes too. The rate of inflation has  decreased. Even the price of the consumer basket has decreased  somewhat. That is, well, there are complex processes proceeding  in parallel with the birth of the new. This is the singularity  we have today.    [Popovych] Yes, Supreme Council chairman Ivan Plyushch gave  these figures at the final sitting yesterday. He gave them and  spoke of the decline in production too. He cited (?43) percent  and at the same time these positive points -- the increase in  the containment of hyperinflation from (?191) percent in  December of last year to (?5.7) percent in March this year.  Retail prices --we have noticed this too -- have not been  rising recently, and have been decreasing for some goods. And  this is the question: Can one explain this by the fact that the  deputies of the previous convocation were busy with the election  campaign, did not assemble for plenary sittings, while the  government and the president had the chance to work and conduct  measures planned by themselves, and there was no one to block  them?    [Kravchuk] Well, I would not say this, but one thing that is  well-known: that when the parliament is engaged in its affair,  the government in its affair and the president in his affair,  that is not verbally, but realistically, [words indistinct], the  result is better, and there is no doubt that when deputies  assemble, say, or assembled, instead of elaborating normal,  (?say) necessary laws, legislative acts, normative acts, were  reduced to hearing about and studying, say, the situation, and  it was difficult to take realistic steps to improve the  situation -- this was (?not) reflected in the government's work,  undoubtedly, but I cannot say this was the result of the Supreme  Council not assembling.    [Passage omitted]  I can stress that the vigor, purposefulness, and energy of the  government administrative structures are now directed precisely  at overcoming the economic crisis. This is true.    [Popovych] Please tell us, then, does this period of  stabilization -- the beginning of stabilization -- signify that  Ukraine is now approaching the peak, the culmination, and that a  levelling out will begin now, that we will go up?    [Kravchuk] Well, I would like to think, just like you, and I  hope that it will happen namely like this, if we do not shake  up, say, the political situation in the country, if we do not  stir up differences, if that for which we are calling all the  time, both the Supreme Council and the president -- for national  accord, for civic reconciliation, for unity around lofty aims,  around lofty tasks -- statehood, independence, the market  economy, democracy -- if we have all this, then I hope that the  next parliament, which will assemble with these tasks, and if we  all work, work together energetically, then this beginning can  then become some kind of course, some kind of stable course  towards overcoming the crisis.    [Zadorozhnyy] So that you can again convince us, and  possibly  our listeners, that this stabilization is nevertheless an  objective process and, thanks to the efforts of our government  officials, deny this assertion by some specialists, who believe  that the containment of inflation is a consequence of  nonpayments, that is neither the producers or consumers have any  money, and that a new inflationary spiral supposedly awaits us  in the middle of May when the monetary printing press will be  started up again, and another monetary emission will take place.    [Kravchuk] Well, you know, here one has to take account of  the fact that money is not given, but earned. I know that many  producers are making their products for the warehouse. There  are trillions of karbovantsi worth of products in warehouses at  present. [passage omitted]    But if a commodity is needed, if a cheap quality product is  made, then it will always find a consumer in a market  environment. Therefore, money cannot be issued for, say,  unearned goods, unfinished (?poor-quality) goods. Then it is  clear that the monetary and payments crisis is also explained by  the fact that namely these market mechanisms have not been  elaborated yet -- demand, the consumer's possibilities, the  producer's possibilities, the production structure, the  consumption structure, the balance of payments, the cash  possibilities of Ukraine and directly of consumers, and  producers, I mean producers and consumers as people who consume  food products, for example, every day, or other domestic  products. Time is needed for all of this. Therefore, clearly  if some people want to throw unearned money into production, or  into indexation, or to add trillions to circulating assets, then  clearly inflation will creep upwards, because there can only be  and should only be as much money as goods produced.    [Popovych] Leonid Makarovych, tell us, please, some people  in Ukraine, most of all, for example, members of the  Hrynyov-Kuchma Interregional Bloc of Reforms assert that all our  economic setbacks can only be overcome by renewing economic ties  with Russia. But will the unification of two exhausted paupers  do much good? For example, we know it from the Ostankino TV  programs that large enterprises are coming to a halt in Russia,  such as ZIL [Likhachev automobile works], a large harvester  plant was mentioned, oil wells are standing idle, andmachinery  does not go to the fields.    [Zadorozhnyy] In the same manner, they are not paying  producers.    [Popovych] People are failing to receive their wages for  several months. So how shall we unite and renew these  relations? What will they give us?    [Kravchuk] Here we should look at the problem as follows:  the  production and market relations within the framework of the CIS  are necessary and I do not want anyone to doubt this. They are  necessary, because the CIS market is so far a determining market  for us. Not the European market, but CIS. We have not yet  approached the European market and have not entered it  seriously, structurally. Although, steps have been made, and  what is more, significant steps. However, when they talk about  renewing ties, there is a detail which needs to be explained. I  can show it to you on one example only.    There is a missile-carrying ship in Nikolayev called the  Varyah. As far as I remember, approximately more than 1,500  enterprises of the former USSR were building it, I have in mind  its components. Now, when we offered Russia to renew the  construction of this ship and then dispose of it appropriately,  this has already become impossible for objective reasons,  because as many as nearly 500 enterprises, which had been  earlier working for this ship, ceased to exist as such. And the  same happens in every industry.    Rather complicated processes are under way. Enterprises are  being closed down, new enterprises and production shops, which  manufacture new products, are commissioned. Then how can we  renew in full measure the ties without taking into account the  situation which has already taken shape. If someone wants to  renew the ties in full measure, this means to renew the Soviet  Union in full measure, to renew the planned-centralized economy  in full measure, in other words, to renew everything as it was  before. But this is just impracticable. This is why I am  talking not about the renewal but about the development and  expansion of ties on the new principles, in accordance with the  market situation. Because, if Russia goes further on along the  road of market and we will be lagging behind, it will become  just impossible to renew these ties on the new principles.    I am speaking not only about Russia, but about other  countries as well. That is to say, one should approach this  issue in concrete, not general terms. If the idea is to  establish economic ties of the new nature and new systems, I  fully support exactly these ties.    As for the developments in Russia, you see, the situation is  complicated everywhere -- in Russia, in Belarus, and in Ukraine  -- because the entire economy is being reformed and its  structure altered. Complicated processes are under way.  Someone makes it better and someone makes it less good,  however, everywhere difficulties are of a broad-scale nature.    [Zadorozhnyy] It happened that there is competition between  Ukraine and Russia, in terms of comparisons.    But we have already touched upon the issue of the CIS. On 15  April in Moscow, Ukraine acceded to the CIS economic union as an  associate member and signed all the economic agreements.    Mykola Riznyk from Australia wants to know the difference  between an associate and full member of the economic union. Is  the associate membership of Ukraine in CIS fraught with danger  to Ukraine's independence?    [Kravchuk] I will give only one example to answer Mykola  Riznyk.    The treaty on the economic union emphasizes that the full  members of the economic union cannot accede to other unions. As  far as the associate members, they can do so. In other words,  Ukraine, in this particular case, is free to accede to the  European Union as well, if it is ready for this. By the way, an  associate member has more freedom of action and more  opportunities as far as international relations with other  countries are concerned. But it also has every opportunity to  participate, as fully as possible, within the framework of the  economic union.    [Popovych] Mr. President, tell me, what advantage does  Ukraine have or will it have from being a member of the CIS,  from the agreements that have been signed? For example, any  commonwealth envisages that its members have certain concessions  and advantages. It seems that the CIS does not have this,  because if one takes into account the fact that Russia sells us  energy sources at the highest world prices...    [Kravchuk, interrupting] This is an interesting question. It  is fairly apt. For example, for there to be competition within  the framework of the CIS and for there to be normal conditions,  producers should have identical conditions. If, say, a Russian  producer buys energy soruces twice as cheaply as a Ukrainian  one, then what kind of a free, let us say, free CIS market, with  competition on equal terms, can one speak of? This is difficult.    Let us say the same about free trade. It is free when there  are no restrictions. But for the time being, Russia has made  certain exceptions for itself, for its goods, say, in the  document, which we have signed, although it will not come into  force tomorrow. And this concerns primarily energy soruces.  Thus trade is sort of free, but with certain reservations and  certain exceptions. So, this is right.    Take the European Union. There they watch pricing, quotas,  customs duties, and such things very closely so that one country  does not experience losses from a market that is not regulated  or coordinated with other countries. We do not have this yet.  This is the main reason for all of these complexities that we  have in trade, in settlements, and so on. [passage omitted]    [Popovych] Let us return to the issue of the CIS. Mr.  President, the CIS' acquisition of observer status at the United  Nations, the desire to acquire this status at the CSCE, the  endorsement of a CIS flag and emblem, to me these are all signs  of the creation of a state, which, in addition, is, as before,  under the aegis of Russia, because Russian representatives  occupy almost all of the leading posts in CIS structures, and  Russia will continue to be in the chair at sittings until the  end of the year. Is this not so? Is this the revival of the  old empire or the creation of a new empire with the economic  union being used a means to bring CIS countries into this  process? Belarus has already made a step into Russia's embrace.    [Kravchuk] Well, the European Union also has its parliament.  It has its flag, it has its emblem. It even has certain  executive structures. And it does not evoke any doubt in anyone  that it is some kind of empire or suprastate. This is not the  only point. The point is something else: that only independent  states with all of the institutions and attributes of statehood  -- a currency, a financial and banking system, institutions of  power, troops, everything of its own that it can have -- should  enter a union, any union. And then this problem does not arise.    As far as Belarus is concerned, there is another problem  here. Belarus is already going beyond the feature that the  European Union has -- yes, they are going toward the ECU there,  but for the moment each country has its own currency. This is  the main thing in economic independence. Their currencies unite  Belarus with Russia. Then the problem of integration is  considerably deeper. It is so deep that it can then turn into  some kind of political, let us say, integrational processes.  But this is then the affair of Russia and Belarus. This is  their affair.    Ukraine occupies a different position. We occupy the  position that every state should have all of the attributes of  statehood both in the economy and in policy -- in military  policy and in international policy. This is the most important  thing. And if we have this, if there are no encroachments from  anyone on these institutions, then one can enter any union and  have any pennants, any flags. They are not state ones.  Incidentally, no one endorsed them. They were simply looked at  and approved. There was no endorsement and no one put their  signatures to this.    [Zadorozhnyy] And in the context of the question put by  Viktoriya, the question about unions, what is your attitude to  the idea of Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev of creating a  Eurasian union?    [Kravchuk] Well, this is a continuation of the subject.  Clearly, Nazarbayev and many leaders of CIS states have a  problem with the effectiveness of CIS work. Frankly, We see  that it works with a very low coefficient of usefulness.  Although I have insisted and insist that it is fulfilling its  role, and I am convinced that without the CIS resolving  interstate and internal state problems would be even worse.  This is a fact.    So, each has ideas about searching for a more effective  system. Well, Nazarbayev proposed a Eurasian union. This is  the outline of, let us say, the European Union, and I am saying  that I do not see any, well, complexities in being able to draw  nearer to a closer economic union. This is very important. I  am speaking about economic integration. I am not talking about  political integration, but for this, it is necessary to draw  nearer. It is necessary for the conditions to evolve.    For example, we cannot become a full-fledged member of the  European Union at the moment, because neither our economy nor  our domestic and other problems are ready to enter into  cooperation with them. This is simply unrealistic, and at  present, the Eurasian union is simply an idea, but its  implementation is simply unrealistic at present. The right  conditions have not evolved for this. That is, one has to  proceed by stages.    I have said several times and am saying again that Europe  was  going toward the European Union for more than 35 years after the  Rome sitting, in 1957 I think. This is how long it took for you  to come to the creation of the European Union. And now take a  look at the plan for it. With what tolerance, with what  respect, with the confirmation of legal, international and other  (?norms) this is being carried out, by means of polls,  referendums, and so on. One cannot think thus: heads of state  assemble, sign, and then there is a Eurasian or some other kind  of union. One has to move toward this.    [Popovych] Well, returning to the issue of flags and  emblems,  I think that we have already replied to Mr. Oleh Antonyuk from  London, Great Britain. Because he is asking: if Ukraine is an  associate member, then what are flags, emblems, joint borders  and their protection, a joint command, doing there -- everything  is there, and God knows what else that we do not know about, but  it has already been written down and signed by you. He is  addressing you here.    [Kravchuk] We did not say anything about flags. Neither did  we talk about joint borders. We talked only about joint  protection of borders. That is, where there are borders, for  example, between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, we signed a  declaration, a document, on cooperation between our border  troops to protect the borders, and not on joint borders.    [Zadorozhnyy] I think that Boris Yeltsin [word indistinct]  at  a news conference, perhaps mistakenly. He said that namely  joint borders had been agreed on.    [Kravchuk] Well, it was probably a mistake. The document  says that the three of us -- Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus --  signed a declaration -- what is it called -- a memorandum on  joint protection of common borders -- that is, common ones where  we come into contact with each other and not joint ones as such.  For example, the border between Ukraine and Russia. It is a  common border for the two of us. This means that its joint  protection is the cooperation of border troops, and not that  there is no Ukrainian border at all or there is no Russian or  Belarusian border.    [Zadorozhnyy] Mr. President, another listener wants to put a  question to you. We are listening. Speak, please.    [Sayuk] Yuriy Sayuk from Bavaria speaking. Mr. President, I  have two questions. The first question: the existence of the  state of Ukraine depends on energy resources. However, the  terminal has not been built yet, the Arab and Iranian  possibilities have not been fulfilled. [words indistinct]  (?helplessness). This is the first question.    The second question concerns [passage indistinct]. Esteemed  Leonid Makarovych, I would like your guidance. Where is the  limit to accommodation? You have already partly touched on the  matter. But I am interested in the issue of joint  communications, joint citizenship, language, and suprastate  structures. And another thing, has the older brother [Russia]  in the friendship of peoples, and Slavic ones too, handed over  anything from joint property abroad for Ukraine's embassies and  missions yet? Thank you for your attention.    [Kravchuk] With regard to the terminal, this issue has  already been presented for practical resolution. There are  firms ready to begin implementing it. And we are also  conducting business talks with Turkey on constructing part of a  pipeline, approximately 300 kilometers long, which should  transport, say, some part, some amount I would say, of oil and  energy sources to Ukraine, to the Black Sea, and maybe to  Europe. So this issue is being resolved.    I would simply like to remind you that issues of such a  large  scale, which you mentioned, are not resolved so easily,  especially as Ukraine does not have its own currency [as heard].  It has to search for such firms and forms of cooperation so as  to attract funds from elsewhere. One has to bear this in mind,  because our desires and our possibilities very often do not  coincide.    Now, regarding the older brother. There is a certain  exaggeration. I have said and say that fate has dealt with us  in such a way that we live in friendship and equal partnership  with Russia. History has not given us another way, because to  have such a large neighbor and not to find cooperation with him,  not to find accord with him, not to find understanding with him  on any issues, equality above all, I stress, partnership, would  constantly threaten Ukraine's statehood and independence. We,  you, are doomed by history to act namely thus. If someone  thinks that there is another way, exacerbation of the situation  with Russia, this way will not lead to the normal development of  Ukraine, and not only Ukraine. It is even about wider problems,  problems of a European and world scale. That is why we will act  precisely in this way.    [Zadorozhnyy] Mr. President, Mr. Yuriy Sayuk also had a  question concerning the Arab-Iranian agreement and the former  USSR property abroad. But, please, be brief because other  listeners are waiting.    [Kravchuk] There are examples. I am just not ready now to  speak from memory. I did not know what questions I would have  to answer. There are examples of Russia enabling us to use the  premises abroad for our embassies and consulates. Of course, we  make appropriate payments for the rent. This is true. However,  at the official level, let us say, at the interstate level, this  issue has not yet been solved. There are many problems here.    As far as the Arab project is concerned, I have already said  that we link all the issues pertaining to the construction of  the oil pipeline with Turkey. [passage omitted: caller from UK  asks whether people of Ukrainian descent who live in the UK have  the right to Ukrainian citizenship. Kravchuk explains that only  persons who arrive in Ukraine for permanent residence can obtain  Ukrainian citizenship]    [U.S. caller Filimonchuk] Highly esteemed Mr. President, I  have three questions. The first one is this: It was a fatal  mistake to recognize Crimea, to grant Crimea autonomy. How is  Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine going to get out of that  situation [words indistinct]?    The second question: Why was former Defense Minister  Kostyantyn Morozov dismissed? Why was he not appointed to the  post of prime minister?    The third question: Why is Ukraine procrastinating with the  introduction of the hryvna into the Ukrainian monetary system?  Thanks.    [Kravchuk] As far as the autonomy of Crimea is concerned, if  we regard ourselves as a democratic and law-governed state, then  the expression of people's will is a norm for all the civilized  states as far as their desire to have any structure is concerned.    A referendum was held in Crimea that showed that the  majority  of the population of Crimea expressed its will that Crimea  should become an autonomous republic. This is the first thing.  The second thing is that the decision was made at the time when  the Soviet Union was still in existence. If we, for example,  had ignored the will of the people of Crimea, something  different could have happened. The USSR Supreme Soviet and the  USSR Congress of People's Deputies could have solved this issue  without any, let us say, major consent on the part of Ukraine.  The USSR, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were still in  existence then, and you know how things were done then. Then we  could have lost Crimea, let us say, as a result of a decision by  the USSR Supreme Soviet which was empowered to solve these  issues. If, for example, any documents were required on the  part of Russia and Ukraine, these could become available because  at that time, I repeat this, there was no independent state  here, at that time it was still the USSR.    As far as Kostyantyn Morozov is concerned, this is the post  which is approved by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. I  submitted Morozov's candidacy request to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine to be appointed defense minister. However, Kostyantyn  Morozov came to me and asked me to withdraw his candidature for  the post of defense minister. He explained this by the fact  that the Supreme Council would not support him. Therefore, I  withdrew his candidature at his own request.    Third, as far as the hryvna is concerned, a stabilization  fund is required to introduce the hryvna. At present, we are  carrying out intensive, active work with the IMF and with the  World Bank so that they would give us a stabilization currency  fund for the introduction of the hryvna. If such a fund becomes  available we shall be able to introduce the hryvna with the hope  of real success and without apprehension of possible inflation.  If there is no stabilization fund...[pauses] and inflation may  lead to great damage, to grave losses, and to removing strong,  authoritative currency -- the Ukrainian hryvna -- from the  agenda.    [Belgian caller Omelyan Koval] [passage omitted] My second  question deals with the sovereignty of Ukraine and the  inviolability of its territory stemming from international  agreements. It is known that Russia is trying to keep the  Crimean shores for its Black Sea Fleet. How does this conform  with the principle of independence of the state and  inviolability of its borders?    The third issue deals with foreign trade and export of state  and private property worth billions of dollars beyond the  borders of Ukraine at a time when only a small part of its value  returns to Ukraine, and the rest is replenishing private bank  accounts. What has been done by the government to make these  billions return to Ukraine and help stabilize its own currency  and its convertibility?    [Kravchuk] [Passage omitted] Concerning the Russian Black  Sea  Fleet in Crimea and how this conforms with Ukraine's  sovereignty: Well, you see, there are two aspects of this  problem. There were many countries where the U.S. Navy was  based; however, this did not endanger the sovereignty of the  countries concerned. This is the first thing.    Second. We should take realities into account. If Russia  has relevant bases today for its Black Sea Fleet in Crimea,  Sevastopol, and so on, one cannot make Russia leave these bases  by force. We have to agree with Russia by signing relevant  agreements, relevant documents which would deal with the  leasing, let us say, of the bases on the territory of Crimea for  a certain period of time, until this issue is solved on a  widescale basis. That is to say, I would not like this to be  closely linked with sovereignty. The main thing is how to solve  the issue, on what principles. Second, is there a possibility  today of solving this issue any other way? I, for example, do  not see such a way. Those who think that it can be solved by  means of, let us say, diktat or the use of any sanctions or  force must see that this is impracticable today. We have to  solve this issue in accordance with realities.    On foreign trade, you are right to say that part of the  money, I just do not know what part -- unfortunately I do not  have the figures which are available to you -- billions or any  other figure -- but I also know that part of the money fails to  return to Ukraine. There are two ways here: an administrative  one, that is, the implementation of such measures as, let us  say, blocking the borders, perhaps, to take some other measures  -- however, in a democratic society this way is doomed to  failure, after all -- and another way is to create prerequisites  in Ukraine for investments. When we have convertible currency,  when we have the right conditions for investment, when we have  the right conditions for trade, the commodity producers or  private individuals will have no desire to transfer money from  Ukraine, but will be interested in investing the money in  Ukraine, because here it will give better results and yield  higher profits. That is to say, we must approach the situation  in exactly this way. We are moving in this direction step by  step. [passage omitted on use of Ukrainian language in  parliament]    [U.S. caller Stovbunenko] [Passage omitted] Will Ukraine  reserve the right to have its own nuclear weapons for  self-defense?    [Kravchuk] [passage omitted] As far as nuclear weapons are  concerned, I would like you to understand that today Ukraine  cannot maintain nuclear weapons for objective, subjective and  any other reasons. It inherited these nuclear weapons, although  it has neither scientific nor technical servicing ... [pauses]  Ukraine has no structures whatsoever to manufacture, service,  and equip nuclear weapons. This is why nuclear weapons here in  Ukraine could even endanger Ukraine itself, and not only  Ukraine, rather than protect it, if there is no possibility to  maintain, equip, service, test and manufacture them.    In this case this is a dangerous weapon on the territory of  the state and we proceed exactly from this fact. Meanwhile, to  build all this Ukraine would need hundreds of -- I emphasize  this -- billions of dollars. And we are now looking for at  least one billion. This is why we are acting in line with our  possibilities. But this does not mean that we are not looking  for the other ways toward consolidating defense capacity and  ways to use such a weapon which will be highly effective,  although non-nuclear. Like all other countries we are looking  for exactly these ways.    [Zadorozhnyy] [Passage omitted] Of late, there has been a  tendency for the left- wing forces to return to power in  countries where parliamentary elections have been held. Ukraine  has not been an exception. However, if the return of the  left-wingers in other states means, well, a change in the  economy or in foreign policy, Ukraine may even face the danger  of losing its independence.    As has been reported, in the near future you are supposed to  meet Petro Symonenko, the leader of the Ukrainian communists.  What are you going to clear up first and foremost during this  meeting?    [Kravchuk] I have already met Petro Symonenko. We discussed  issues of interest, it seems to me, for both the left-wingers  and the right-wingers and for the centrists; in other words,  issues of our state's independence, development of market  relations, development of normal, goodneighborly relations with  the CIS countries, and not only the CIS countries. In other  words, we discussed a whole range of issues.    It seems to me that the communist leader understands the  situation and I did not feel, I say this sincerely, that he had  any thought of casting doubt on the independence of our Ukraine.  He doubts the way toward, let us say, this independence. This  is connected, above all, with the economy and with the social  protection of people. This was the keynote. I put questions  straightforwardly to receive straightforward answers. If they  are sincere, well, I hope they are, there was no indication that  the left-wing forces in parliament would immediately raise the  question of Ukraine's independence or dependence, or whatever  you may call it. It is impossible today to assess the  left-wingers in a negative way only and, let us say, the  right-wingers in a positive way only. The left-wingers are not a  homogeneous mass, excuse me for the word mass, the same as the  right-wingers. Life is much more complicated than just  labelling this or that deputy either a left-winger or a  right-winger. [passage omitted]    [Popovych] Mr. President, I will put several questions all  at once, as a listener has now broached this subject. We have  had very many calls to the editorial office during the week,  ahead of this program, on this subject -- that is, presidential  elections. The first question I will put to you is: Are you  thinking of putting forward your candidacy for president for the  next term? That question is from Vasyl Semak from England. He  also expressed the view that presidential elections should not  be allowed this year at any cost, because, according to him,  Kuchma will get in and it will be worse. Vasyl Semak from  England thinks this. Also Mykola Lazarenko from England.  Highly esteemed Mr. President, can a person with a very limited  knowledge of the Ukrainian language be nominated as candidate  for president of Ukraine -- I mean Leonid Kuchma. If in mockery  of the Ukrainian nation a Russian-speaking president is elected,  then is there a danger that he will appeal to his northern  fellow Russian-speakers to defend him.    Vyacheslav Dymovyy, a lawyer from Moscow and a Ukrainian.  This is a slightly different question. Mr. Kravchuk, do you  accept the appearance of Kuchma as your mistake? Is Kravchuk  intending to bear responsibility for the fact that he will leave  the post of president without a struggle? [passage omitted]    [Zadorozhnyy] To complete this group of questions, for the  listeners are listening, they put questions to us before the  program, and naturally they are checking to see if their  questions are going to be heard. This is also on the same  subject. This is from Vasyl Kucherenko, from Toronto, Canada.  Mr. President, is it expedient at the current stage -- when  Ukraine is only just becoming consolidated in the international  arena, constructing its own policies and economy, resolving  domestic and foreign issues and issues of the social system and  government, forming a new multiparty parliament, and does not  yet have a legal constitutional court or an approved basic law,  Ukraine's constitution -- to elect a new president, spending a  total of 1.618 trillion karbovantsi on this, plus 462-billion  karbovantsi on run-off voting? Mr. President, you took upon  yourself the heaviest burden and responsibility for the fate of  independent Ukraine and of the Ukrainian people at the most  difficult time for Ukraine, in December 1991. Can individual  little groups, little parties, and collectives or associations  decide whether to elect or not to elect a popular president?  Only the whole Ukrainian people can elect you or show no  confidence in you.    [Kravchuk] Well, I want to answer briefly with certain  theses. In Ukraine too at present there is also the opinion  among deputies of all levels and among collectives that the  election of a president at the present time is premature, (?but)  no one is raising the issue of elections of a president in  general, whether preterm or new elections, although our  Constitution does not envisage preterm elections. The preterm  suspension of powers following a referendum is envisaged.    But the new Supreme Council has to decide this. I am  inclined to think that the Supreme Council cannot remain outside  this important question. I have had meetings with deputies,  with leaders of parties and forces, and have said that if the  the old Supreme Council of that convocation adopted such a law  under pressure of, say, and under certain conditions, then the  new Supreme Council, which will take over responsibility for  four years, should express its attitude, whether it confirms or  whether it does something else. But it cannot remain outside  this issue.    I have to appeal to the new Supreme Council with a request  to  express its attitude toward the election of both the president  and local bodies of power. If the Supreme Council is inclined  to this, well, it will be up to the Supreme Council.    [Zadorozhnyy] Do we understand that your stand concerning  yourself as a candidate to run in the coming presidential  election remains unchanged?    [Kravchuk] You see, if I join these election processes  today,  at once, without knowing the Supreme Council's clearly expressed  opinion, this means that I am inclined to and I take part in  the election which is not envisaged, let us say, in a  full-fledged, full-blooded manner, either by the constitution or  by all our legitimate laws. In other words, I cannot agree to  this today. However, if the Supreme Council clearly expresses  its opinion of the status and confirms, at least by  constitutional majority, or simple majority or in any other way,  its attitude toward this, then I will be able to say about this  more distinctly. Now, at this stage, I cannot say anything  else. [passage omitted on Moscow listener's comments  establishing he is on air]    [Unidentified Moscow caller] I am very indignant at  yesterday's statement on Ostankino television by Mr. Grachev  regarding Ukraine's Navy and its location. I would like to hear  from the president what his attitude to this is.    [Kravchuk] Regarding the issue with Russia, I cannot see any  other way of reaching agreement than by adopting the principles  of legality, recognized by the international community, and  settling this issue. As for the details, they always  are...[pauses] one side is saying one thing -- a Russian  minister can say one thing and a Ukrainian one will tell you  another, but this does not mean that what ministers are saying  is objective truth, let us say, subject to no appeal, as this is  a very complex and large-scale problem. We are to settle this  issue conclusively with the president of Russia and the  government of Russia, and this is what we shall do.    I would only like these problems not to be exacerbated  prematurely on the basis of some preliminary talks and meetings  between ministers and delegations or to be interpreted as the  Ukrainian president's position. This is searching for ways,  while the Ukrainian president has expressed his position. It is  that we shall support Russia's interest in having a Russian  naval base in Sevastopol. We shall back, shall we say, Russia's  position on the use of the infrastructure that there is and the  accords that exist between Ukraine and Russia -- the four  documents signed in Yalta, Zavidovo and, let us say, Moscow and  Massandra -- for everybody after all to get together and settle  this issue.    However, no one -- neither Ukraine nor Russia -- can enforce  diktat or a unilateral wish or unilateral advantages. This is a  complex problem which should be tackled wisely and calmly in  order not to fall out or conflict.    [Zadorozhnyy] In that case, can it be understood that the  next stage of negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet and its  division will now be tackled by both presidents directly, that  of Ukraine and that of Russia?    [Kravchuk] At any rate, today I had a conversation with the  leadership of Russia. I talked with Viktor Stepanovich  Chernomyrdin. I offered to meet him, now either at governmental  or presidential level, with appropriate ministers and experts  seated at our side, and make a decision, because this is the  issue that will not be settled by ministers. This is to be  settled by the presidents and governments. Documents and  estimates, however, are of course to be produced by specialists,  including military specialists, but this is not the issue that  can be settled by military ministers.    I just would not like any, let us say, far-reaching  conclusions to be made yet on the basis of the meeting in Crimea  that was held. It was difficult, it was not easy and there is no  need to investigate now who is right and who is not --  especially on the basis of speeches by ministers and their  meetings with journalists. This, I would like to repeat, cannot  be done. This is only searching for ways rather than resolving  the problem conclusively. The final settlement of the issue is  up to the presidents.    [Popovych] Mr. President, the situation has become so  aggravated. Please tell us: Can such a situation arise -- I  will repeat this -- in which Ukraine will have to turn to  international organizations or seek participation of such  countries as, for example, the United States of America in the  solution of this issue?    By the way, there was a news item saying that the U.S. side  expressed its readiness to help resolve the Crimean issue.    [Zadorozhnyy] [word indistinct] concerning nuclear  disarmament.    [Kravchuk] This is a matter of a specific nature. Nuclear  states.... [changes thought]. For example, why was the United  States involved in this situation? Because an agreement on  nuclear arms reduction was signed between the USSR and the  United States of America. We also inherited the treaty that was  signed, and we are now responsible for it. So, the  participation of the United States here is logical, and not just  logical but also concrete.    As far as the Black Sea Fleet is concerned, I believe we  must  resolve this issue with Russia, and I am convinced that we will  resolve it.    [Zadorozhnyy] Were there any statements concerning a third  party? Because a statement by President Boris Yeltsin's press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov has already become available to  us. According to the statement, Yeltsin said the following, in  particular: Russia will not allow any outside interference in  the resolution of the Black Sea Fleet issue.    [Kravchuk] As far as I know, I have never said this  anywhere;  neither Yukhym Zvyahilskyy nor Ivan Plyushch have been saying  this. Therefore, I do not know the source of this news. I have  always said that there is a state policy, and there are opinions  of certain political parties and forces. Therefore, if  Zhirinovskiy says something, I will not refute him at the state  level. I will, however, if Yeltsin says it. I have never said  this, and I have never expressed myself in this connection.  [passage omitted]    [Popovych] We have received another fax; this one is from  Mykola Plavyuk. I do not think it is necessary to explain who  Mykola Plavyuk is [former Ukrainian president in exile]. Does  the (?experience) of the elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council  help in completing work on Ukraine's constitution, and what are  the prospects of the Cabinet of Ministers beginning real reform  of Ukraine's economy in the very near future under your  leadership?    [Kravchuk] With regard to the Constitution, I think that one  will be able to speak of the new parliament's real possibilities  for starting on the constitution after the additional elections  to the Supreme Council have been held. At present, 338 deputies  have been elected. It was said at the Supreme Council on 22  April that the authorities of 335 deputies had been confirmed.  This number of deputies is evidently insufficient for a  constitutional majority, however; that is 300 votes. Therefore,  to say now that the Supreme Council can start on the  constitution immediately, before the additional deputies are  elected, is impracticable. When a full-blooded parliament that  represents all of Ukraine and all of its electors is elected,  however, I believe that this is the largest and most important  task--with which the old parliament did not manage to deal.  This was the greatest fault in its work.    As far as the economy about which you speak is concerned, I  already said something at the beginning of the program about the  fact that some kind of positive, perhaps not processes, but  rough outlines--I am saying this very carefully--regarding the  economic situation are already taking place. We should begin  wide-scale, let us say, privatization of small, medium, and  large enterprises. The reforms that will take place to improve  banking, credit, and structural reconstruction are all on the  agenda. They are not only on the agenda, but in practice are  already under way.    [Popovych] Another question on the elections from Yosyp  Lesiv  from Belgium. Elections to local bodies of power in Ukraine's  oblasts and rayons are proposed in conjunction with the new  presidential elections. According to my understanding of the  current electoral law, the elections to local bodies of power  will abolish the institution of presidential missions. As an  observer of Ukrainian political life, I believe that Ukraine  needs strong executive power now. This is the stand of our  listener.    [Kravchuk] Well, I can only perceive this is as a stance,  although I have also said this in my domestic usage that the  president--if he has powers as head of state and as the  executive power--he should also have corresponding powers in the  local bodies of power and in the corresponding structures. I am  convinced that the Soviet representative form and the  presidential executive form do not relate to each other. This  is my conviction.    There are also other points of view, but I support the one  that says that if the president should have strong authority,  then he should have the corresponding strong structures. If the  president has representative authority, then he is another type  of president. One should even begin to think about how to elect  him, when to elect him. Is it necessary for a president with  only representative functions to be elected by the public?  These are the main problems. Without resolving them, it is  difficult to speak of the seriousness of our intentions.  [passage omitted]    [Popovych] I have a question, Mr. President. Returning to  the Crimea's problems: Yuriy Meshkov himself, the president of  the autonomy, is stirring up anti-Ukrainian sentiments in  Crimea. His calls on the eve of elections show this. In  general, this is some kind of a paradox for the president to  call on voters not to vote for deputies to Ukraine's Supreme  Council. So do his current decrees on personnel changes in the  power department structures--in the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, the security service. Now he has decided to replace  the justice minister. Will new measures be taken, as his  decrees have been revoked, as we know. Will new more efficient  measures be taken with regard to Meshkov's anticonstitutional  actions? Perhaps in connection with this, here is a question  from Taras Voytenko from Moscow as to whether there will be  political autonomization of the regions in order to avoid  conflicts such as in Moldova and Georgia.    [Kravchuk] Well, naturally there is some kind of link here.  As far as the decrees by Meshkov are concerned, I have already  been saying that all the decrees issued by Meshkov will be  rescinded by the president of Ukraine if they violate the  Constitution and the laws of Ukraine. This will be done without  fail. I am speaking about the economic decrees only. There may  be relevant easements in relation to these, because the idea is  to give more economic freedom, to apply the Ukrainian  president's decree that grants additional opportunities for the  economic liberalization of the economy, and so on.    Here we will calculate the situation stemming from this  decree and from our laws. Those laws and decrees that  contradict our constitutional norms will be rescinded. They  mean, as far as I understand, that the more political  independence granted to the regions will lead to easing the  situation. Well, this is an opinion. I regard Ukraine as a  unitarian state today, and there may be some prospects for steps  forward in this direction. However, if political autonomy is  granted today to all oblasts, if this is what they mean, this  could lead to the disintegration--I say this sincerely--of our  statehood.    As far as economic autonomies, economic freedoms, as far as  the broadest possible freedoms are concerned, I support this.  However, any talk about political autonomy is premature.    [Popovych] What do you mean by political autonomy? Do you  mean free economic zones in certain regions, or do you mean all  of Ukraine somehow?    [Kravchuk] No, this means, for example, oblasts receive  great  powers, say, in dealing with property and utilizing budgets.  More account is taken of their needs and of the sources for  covering their expenditures, for example, with regard to issues  connected with quotas or restrictions and the possibilities to  make use of products to sell in order to replenish hard currency  funds. That is quite a lot. I have only named a few points.  These are economic freedoms whereby it is not necessary to go  to Kiev, to the center, about every little thing. It can be  decided there, on the spot.    As far as economic zones are concerned, however, that is  another matter. It is envisaged in the law and should be  examined in every specific case for each territory. What I said  about economic autonomy applies to all territories.    [Popovych] Another listener, Vasyl Semak from Nottingham,  Great Britain, asks whether the president believes Ukraine will  survive to the end of your term, because the foreign press  writes that Ukraine will be divided.    [Kravchuk] Well, everyone is making predictions. As one  says, curse the tongues of those who say this about Ukraine and  about its possibilities, and praise God that Ukraine has  survived now for two and a half years since independence was  declared. It is surviving, working hard, laboriously reaching  for economic heights, overcoming crisis, and creating its  political institutions and laws. We do not succeed at  everything. Not everything is appropriate to our possibilities,  as one says. This is true. The foreign press writes what it  wants to see, however. We do not want this. We listen to the  foreign press and say that you may bark if you really want to  bark at Ukraine so much, but the show goes on. [passage omitted]    [Zadorozhnyy] Petro Dyadyk from Poland points out that the  anniversary of the deportation of the Crimean Tatars will be  commemorated and asks why Poland is silent about the Wisla  operation. Presumably, he would like to know Ukraine's position  on this.    [Kravchuk] Well, we raised this very issue when I met  President Walesa at the parliament during my visit to Poland.  We instructed our relevant institutions, the Ministries of  Foreign Affairs, to study it more and to submit the appropriate  adjustments and an appropriate stand on this issue. That is, it  has not been left unconsidered. [passage omitted]    [Kravchuk] You know, I would like to say something else. We  often hear on the surface of our statehood, for example, in  political circles, at rallies, in squares, and even in the  Supreme Council, many words that disturb people because the  words are against Ukraine. When I talk to people, however--for  example, in collectives, in collectives in the East, in the  West, in the South, and in the North--I am even more convinced  that the issue of statehood, the issue of independence, is now  internally characteristic to our people of all nationalities.  This is very important. These years did not pass in vain.  [passage omitted]    Goodbye. I wish all of you radio listeners -- Ukrainians and  non- Ukrainians abroad -- good health, happiness, and all good  things. [passage omitted]</p>

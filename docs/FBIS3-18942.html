The Spanish, Italians, and  British, on the other hand, have realized that the changes going  on in the South American country are promising.    In an interview with HANDELSBLATT, Cavallo said that during  his visit to Germany, which ends on Thursday [10 March], he  discussed more favorable conditions for Hermes export guarantees  with Economics Minister Rexrodt and Finance Minister Waigel.  Currently, involvement in Argentina is considered "especially  risky," similar to involvement in Brazil, for instance. Hermes  credit guarantees are accordingly expensive. A double taxation  agreement with Germany is being worked out.    Cavallo is optimistic that the German side will be persuaded  by developments in Argentina: The national budget has been in  surplus since 1992. By linking the peso to the dollar,  inflation could be cut from 5,000 percent (in 1989) to 4-5  percent this year. Over the last three years, annual economic  growth has been 6 to 9 percent.    The Menem government has so far privatized over 100  companies. Among European countries, Spain is particularly  active in the telecommunications sector. France (water, gas,  electricity), Italy (telecommunications as well), and Great  Britain (gas, petroleum) have made substantial investments.  Mentioning Germany, Cavallo could only think of a satellite  project by Dasa.    There will be further privatization of airports, nuclear  power stations, and the electricity and water supply outside  Buenos Aires. Cavallo hopes that German interest will be greater  this time than it has been in the past.    He sees good opportunities for German companies in the  traditionally private sectors. In the car industry (Mercedes  and Volkswagen) the economics minister hopes for higher  production with a simultaneous reduction in the number of  models, in order to increase productivity. Other models and  parts could be increasingly imported from Germany -- not least  because of the significant cut in customs duties.    Involvement in the food sector is also worthwhile, according  to the economics minister. Thus, a German brewery has become  active in Argentina. Apart from that, Cavallo mentioned  catering, tourism, and the pharmaceutical industry.    MERCOSUR, whose members are Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and  Paraguay, offers a large domestic market for investors. On 1  January 1995, a free trade area will be completed. Argentina's  interest in NAFTA does not contradict this. The foreign and  economics ministers of MERCOSUR will meet in Buenos Aires on  Thursday [10 March] to discuss the likely effects of a planned  customs union, Cavallo said.    Argentina, whose main exports are wheat, soya, meat, and  recently also fish, had expected the GATT Uruguay Round to  result in more liberal trade in agricultural produce, but it is  nevertheless content with the outcome. Traditional exports are  declining, while industrial exports are on the increase.    Cavallo does not consider the negative balance of trade  (1993: minus $3.2 billion) to be a problem. Like Germany in the  1950's, Argentina is financing its economic reconstruction with  foreign capital. Over the past three years, some $30 billion  has come into the country, some two-thirds of which is  expatriate capital. The country will depend on these capital  imports for another three to four years. What is important is  that the 1991/92 boom in consumption is over and money is now  "going into productive investment," Cavallo said.</p>

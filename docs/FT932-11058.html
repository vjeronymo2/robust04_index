			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew open on Ulster talks SIR Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, refused yesterday to rule out re-starting political talks on the province without the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. 'I would not want to anticipate any particular format,' Sir Patrick said in an radio interview in Washington DC. Mr Paisley says he will not enter talks until the Irish government makes further concessions on its constitutional claim on Northern Ireland. He also wants Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, to stop talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, has been refused a visa to visit the US.</p>

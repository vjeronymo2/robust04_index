The letter to the CE says that Slovakia is not observing its  commitments towards the CE regarding ethnic policy, Csaky  reported.    This statement is exemplified by the shortcomings in the  adopted laws on names and surnames, anomalies in the names of  Hungarians communities in south Slovakia and the discriminatory  language law, Csaky said.    The so-called alternative educational system, which assumes  that vocational subjects should be taught in Slovak, is a  "well-thought out attack on the system of the Hungarian  schools," Csaky stated.    Chairman of the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) Peter  Weiss said that the demands voiced in Komarno (during a meeting  of ethnic Hungarian representatives on January 8) are  "exaggerated and tactlessly articulated." They served the  governing coalition because they deflected public attention from  the growing economic and social problems, "created the picture  of an enemy, and pushed the poorly working process of  privatization to the margin of interest.

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Mediterranean Bonds: Fundamental factors fuel a rally Italy, Spain and Portugal - are once again in favour. Many analysts are confident the second wave of convergence will be more sustained than the first, which crashed a year ago when the Danes voted against ratifying the Maastricht treaty, shattering expectations of European monetary union. But the latest rally in the Mediterranean bond markets is founded on economic fundamentals. 'In an environment where intra-European currency risks have already been reduced by floats, realignments and successful defences of the existing parities, lower German interest rates can only contribute towards further bond yield convergence,' according to analysts at SG Warburg. The process is well under way, with 10-year yields between Mediterranean markets and Germany at their lowest point since the first half of 1992. This time, the rally is supported by the negative outlook for the D-Mark. 'The risk of the D-Mark turning round and rallying is much less this time,' according to Mr Steve Major, a bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities. The French yield curve is now below the German yield curve as far out as five years, which has 'given heart to the Mediterranean markets,' says Mr Major. Dealers report large flows into the Spanish market, with many investors switching out of D-Mark assets. Flows into Italian bonds have been much smaller, but are expected to increase, while Portugal offers interesting opportunities. The result of the first Maastricht vote in Denmark was not the only factor to restrain Spanish and Italian bond markets. Both have suffered difficulties of their own, though in Spain confidence is returning. Assembling a Socialist-led coalition government in Spain is well advanced, liberating the market from political uncertainty. The 10-year yield margin between Spain and Germany has dropped from 527 basis points at the start of the year to around 350 basis points. In absolute terms, 10-year Spanish bond yields have dropped 200 basis points, and five-year yields have performed better, falling 280 basis points. Italy's recovery has been less dramatic. The spread between 10-year Italian and German bond yields has narrowed from 627 basis points at the start of the year to 500 basis points, but with gross yields at 11.79 per cent, they still appear to have some way to go. The country's severe debt overhang, and the uncertain political outlook before elections in the autumn, means there is still a brake on Italian bonds. But the lira's devaluation has served the market well, and there is growing confidence the currency is stabilising. The much smaller and less developed Portuguese market has been left behind, but interest in it could grow, as the government establishes benchmark issues across the yield curve. The government is shortly to launch the first 10-year issue of domestic bonds. Analysts say the government plans to issue around Es400bn this year. Nevertheless, the market still suffers from a lack of liquidity. and there are fears the Escudo may have further to fall. Despite this, with short-term interest rates 160 basis points higher than in Spain, the market appears to offer prospects for healthy returns as the economy plunges into recession.</p>

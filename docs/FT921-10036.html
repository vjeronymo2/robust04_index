			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Spie losses depress Schneider SCHNEIDER, the French electrical equipment group, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Georges de Buffevent, chairman of Spie-Batignolle, its troubled building subsidiary, after disclosing that Spie's losses had triggered a sharp fall in group net profits to around FFr300m (Dollars 55.5m) in 1991 from FFr950m in 1990. Spie, in common with other building companies, has suffered from France's economic slowdown. It blamed its fall into net losses of FFr950m last year - from net profits of FFr251m in 1990 - on the sluggish state of the construction market and the postponment of a number of industrial orders. The 1991 performance also reflects the cost of a FFr150m restructuring programme which Spie began in the second quarter of 1991, but will continue throughout this year. Moreover, the company was hit by unspecified losses from Transmanche Link, a consortium of contractors working on the Channel Tunnel. Spie yesterday said Mr de Buffevent had resigned because of disagreements over strategy. He has been succeeded by Mr Claude Coppin, managing director. Despite Spie's problems the Schneider group, which last summer won a bitter Dollars 2.23bn hostile takeover bid for Square D, a US competitor, increased its overall turnover by 13 per cent to more than FFr58bn in 1991. This includes a seven-month contribution from Square D. The Schneider board has decided to freeze its dividend for 1991. It expressed confidence about group prospects for 1992 given the 'resilience' of its industrial interests.</p>

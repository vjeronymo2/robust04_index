			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Crack of the whips tames rebels IN THE end their discipline just failed them. Last night's nail-biting government victory confirmed that a hard core of Tory rebels had just fallen short in their attempts to derail the Maastricht ratification process - in spite of an impressively well-drilled campaign waged in the corridors and committee rooms of Westminster. A no-holds-barred lobbying effort mounted by a desperate government machine succeeded in deterring just enough prospective rebels to head off a disastrous defeat. The reverse will come as a bitter blow to rebel leaders like Mr James Cran, the MP for Beverley, who had repeatedly expressed confidence in his side's ability to win through. They know that they may not get another chance to inflict serious damage on the document, referred to by Mr Michael Spicer, another rebel leader, as a treaty too far. Opportunity would knock again only if Labour could be coaxed once more into opposing a Maastricht-related motion. The comments of two rebels who wavered illustrate the extraordinary lengths to which the government was obliged to resort in order to win the day. Mr Walter Sweeney, the newly-elected MP for Vale of Glamorgan, cited two factors which coaxed him out of the hard-line rebel camp and persuaded him to abstain on both divisions. The first was a faxed message he received yesterday from his constituency executive saying that they were 'deeply concerned' about his reported views and urging him to review his decision. This was sent following a visit to the executive on Tuesday night by a Tory central office official. At this meeting, 'the executive voted by 15 votes to 6 with 4 abstentions to send me the message', Mr Sweeney said. The other factor influencing him was his perception that the division was being interpreted 'quite wrongly' as a vote on Mr Major's future. 'In a way I wanted the motion to be defeated but I did not want the prime minister to be defeated,' he said. 'Now that the government has won by three votes . . . I am very torn.' He said he had spoken to a number of whips during the day, including Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip. Their message was that the future of the prime minister was at stake and that his vote might prove decisive. Mr Michael Carttiss, MP for Great Yarmouth and another Tory expected to rebel, said he had decided to support the government motion and oppose the Labour amendment after last-minute meetings with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Major. Although he disagreed with the government's policies on Europe, he could not bring himself to bring down the government, he said. Mr Vivian Bendall, MP for Ilford North who had intended to abstain in both divisions, decided to support the government motion when he saw that the Labour amendment had fallen by just six votes. 'I thought the second vote would be closer and that the prime minister might resign if (it) was lost,' he said. He had pressed two colleagues to abstain on the second division instead of voting against. Mr Heseltine had given him an assurance in the chamber that the third reading of the Maastricht bill would not take place until after a second Danish referendum, he added.</p>

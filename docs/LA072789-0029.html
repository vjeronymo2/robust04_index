			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LAWNDALE CONSIDERS SUING HAWTHORNE OVER MATTEL PROJECT  </P> <P> Lawndale city officials say they are considering legal action against the city  of Hawthorne over a large redevelopment project approved this week by the  Hawthorne City Council.  </P> <P> The dispute centers on the 36-acre "Mattel Project," which involves revamping  and expanding Mattel Inc.'s corporate headquarters near Rosecrans Avenue and  the San Diego Freeway. The giant toy maker once manufactured products there,  including its popular Barbie dolls, but moved its manufacturing operations  overseas years ago.  </P> <P> A number of other developments, including a hotel, two restaurants, and retail  and office buildings, are also planned as part of the $150-million project,  which is expected ultimately to generate millions of new tax dollars for  Hawthorne.  </P> <P> At Monday's Hawthorne City Council meeting, Lawndale Mayor Sarann Kruse urged  council members to delay approving a development agreement for the project.  </P> <P> Kruse took Hawthorne council members to task, saying planners had failed to  determine the combined environmental impacts that the Mattel project and  another Hawthorne redevelopment project less than a mile away would have on  Lawndale. The second project, which includes a 28-acre parcel on the east side  of the San Diego Freeway, is in the planning stages.  </P> <P> Kruse urged council members not to make a decision until officials from  Lawndale and Hawthorne had an opportunity to sit down together and study the  matter.  </P> <P> "We are coming to see it is not possible for the city of Lawndale to solve its  problems in isolation," Kruse said.  </P> <P> Kruse outlined her objections in a lengthy letter she delivered to Hawthorne  council members just minutes before their 7 p.m. meeting. She was accompanied  by an attorney from the law firm that regularly represents Lawndale on legal  matters.  </P> <P> Hawthorne council members did not address Kruse and offered little public  comment before approving on a 4-0 vote an agreement with Comstock, Crosser and  Hickey Development Co., based in Manhattan Beach. Councilman David York was  absent.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Kruse said Lawndale council members will meet Aug. 6 to discuss  whether to file suit against Hawthorne. She declined to comment further.  </P> <P> Hawthorne Mayor Betty Ainsworth said in an interview that Kruse's letter and  appearance before the council came as a surprise to her and her colleagues.  </P> <P> "It's like we had everything together and ready to go and then, boom!" she  said. "They could have written us a letter; they could have phoned us and said,  'We would like to meet with you.' "  </P> <P> Ainsworth said plans for the Mattel project have been in the works for two  years, and that Hawthorne officials had met on several occasions with Lawndale  to discuss the project.  </P> <P> "We felt we were addressing their concerns," she said. "And we will continue  working with them."  </P> <P> Ainsworth said that even though the city is now negotiating with a developer  for the second redevelopment project, the deal could fall through. The proposal  includes more retail development as well as townhouses and condominiums. If the  second project does move forward, the cumulative environmental impacts of it  and the Mattel project will be studied by planners, she said.  </P> <P> Other Hawthorne city officials said proper procedures had been followed in  preparing the environmental report for the Mattel project, including its  impacts on Lawndale.  </P> <P> For example, because of the increased traffic congestion the project is  expected to bring, a $1.5-million fund has been established to improve nearby  roadways, they said.  </P> <P> Bob Comstock, managing partner of the development company, said obtaining quick  approval for the project from council members was essential.  </P> <P> In all, the company's plan hinges on five pending agreements, one of which  allows a property owner to pull out if escrow on his parcel does not close by  September. "For us to hit our deadlines, it was really important for us to move  forward," he said.  </P> <P> Preliminary plans call for the construction of two restaurants, at least one  hotel, numerous retail buildings and up to 500,000 square feet of office space.  </P> <P> The project would also allow Mattel, which owns seven acres of land in the  redevelopment area, to consolidate its offices and do away with space once  reserved for manufacturing. The company's existing six-story building will be  remodeled, and another low-rise office building will be built.  </P> <P> "The situation has developed into an inefficient one for us," Mattel spokesman  Glenn Bozarth said. "Our needs are very different today than they were in the  '50s and '60s when we first occupied the land."  </P> <P> The entire redevelopment project is expected to be completed by 1996 and to  bring the city up to $2 million annually in new revenue, according to Bud  Cormier, Hawthorne's assistant director of redevelopment.  </P></p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: Sainsbury fizzes with enthusiasm - Britain's biggest wine merchant now has a range to fit its buying power NOT BEFORE time, Britain's biggest wine merchant is beginning to show signs of the sheer enthusiasm for wine that has for several years distinguished the best of its rivals. More than a decade ago Sainsbury led the supermarkets' advance into wine merchant territory with a combination of muscle and confidence that gave it the lion's share of the highly competitive British wine market. In recent years, however, Sainsbury's wine department may have kept shareholders happy by keeping at least a percentage point ahead of Tesco, its main rival for wine market share. But the famously broad selection seemed more driven by gaps to be filled and price points to be reached than inspired by the increasingly dazzling range of plums on offer in the world's vineyards and cellars. Producers and agents complained that a decision which took a month chez Safeway, and a minute at Oddbins, could take up to a year at Sainsbury's. The company's rivals among multiple retailers may be concerned at its increasing insistence on exclusive rights to certain lines. Its rivals among the independent merchants are probably less concerned about Sainsbury's efforts to overcome the supermarket wine retailer's most serious shortcoming: lack of expert advice. Sales assistants trained by headphones, a two-hour audio tape and a workbook are unlikely to be much of a match for the bevy of wine enthusiasts employed by most decent wine merchants. Nor does Sainsbury, or any other supermarket, give the independents a run for their money in the Pounds 5-plus per bottle range. But the wines that follow all represent bargains from the Sainsbury buying team, at last reflecting ingenuity as well as heavyweight bargaining (they seem to have done their own bulk buying from Peter Bright and Hardys of Australia). It is worth noting, however, that, with the exception of the Copertino and Green Point, there is no point in keeping these wines; in fact most are best drunk now, enhanced by the bloom of youth. Some are just reaching the shelf. Spot the wine with no antipodean connection. WHITES Chapel Hill Chardonnay 1992 Pounds 2.99. Terrible label, but great value. Made by a New Zealander in Hungary. Of course. Much more convincing than Chapel Hill Sauvignon. The Country Collection Basilicata White Pounds 3.29. Unusually fruity dry southern Italian, made by the ubiquitous Jacques Lurton of Bordeaux. (Just Pounds 2.99 at Victoria Wine until the end of June.) Gyongyos Country White Pounds 3.35. Now for Hugh Ryman (of Bordeaux, Languedoc, Moldova et al) playing with Semillon grapes in Hungary. Very lively (and the racy Gyongyos Chardonnay is probably worth the 36p supplement over the Chapel Hill version). Chardonnay Delle Tre Venezie Pounds 3.59. New, highly successful, part barrel-fermented north-eastern Italian. Sainsbury's Sauvignon Vin De Pays D'oc Pounds 3.59. Better than most Languedoc answers to Sancerre. Santa Sara 1992 Pounds 3.95. Oaky, slightly sweet Portuguese white from Australian Peter Bright. Chais Beaumiere Sauvignon 1992 Pounds 3.99. Much better than most Languedoc answers to Sancerre, and possibly the best wine yet from the French outpost of Hardys of Australia (although their quarter bottles of Merlot 1991 continue to shock British Airways customers with their quality). Denbies Estate 1991 Pounds 3.99. Well-made lively dry white. Full, round and fruity. Unapologetically English. Viognier 1992 Pounds 4.49. Scented, pale version of Condrieu from the Ardeche co-op. Moondah Brook Chenin Blanc 1992. Pounds 4.99 Sainsbury's most interesting Australian wine (as opposed to wine-maker). Oak and lime, but nothing like after-shave. REDS Do Campo Tinto Pounds 2.99. Good lively Portuguese red from Peter Bright, whose Argentinian red Malbec/Cabernet and, especially, white Torrontes at Pounds 2.99 should be the bargains of August when they arrive. La Mancha 1992 Castillo de Alhambra Pounds 2.99. More concentrated Spanish red than previous vintages. Copertino Riserva 1989 Pounds 3.95. Heady southern Italian, a prime candidate for cellaring. Cavas de Weinert 1985 Pounds 6.99. Full, sweet, viscous and a real mouthful. Special. OTHERS Jeanmaire 1988 Champagne Pounds 9.95. Special offer. Silly price. Respectable quality. Green Point 1990 Pounds 9.95. Australian fizz from Moet &amp; Chandon; every bit as good as the above. Nagyrede Cabernet Sauvignon Rose 1992 Pounds 2.99. Pretty, very pale, dry and scented. Bouvier Trockenbeerenauslese 1989 Pounds 5.85 (half). Rich, curranty Austrian dessert wine.</p>

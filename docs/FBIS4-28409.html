			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The North side  headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for  the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon) released a  statement Tuesday bitterly denouncing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's  harsh suppression of the leading members of the South Korean  Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) and the  South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon.    Branding the suppression as an unpardonable challenge to  patriotism of South Korean students who are devotedly struggling  for independence, democracy and reunification and to the  indomitable will of the youth and students in the North, South  and overseas for reunification, the statement said:    The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are now making a sweeping  roundup of 30 to 40 leading members of Hanchongnyon and the  South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon including  Hanchongnyon Chairman Kim Hyon-chun and Chairman of the National  Reunification Committee of Hanchongnyon Yang Tong-hun.    The harsh suppression of patriotic students launched by the  Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors around the second inaugural  ceremony of Hanchongnyon is motivated by a sinister intention to  stamp out the South Korean students' patriotic movement for  reunification.    The traitorous clique must look squarely at the situation,  promptly scrap "the National Security Law," [NSL] an  anti-reunification law of the old time, and stop at once the  criminal roundup of the leading members of the South side  headquarters of Hanchongnyon and Pomchonghaknyon they have  launched by invoking "the NSL."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia welcomes Kazakhstan's joining the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty as a denuclearized state, the chief  Russian negotiator at the talks with Kazakhstan, Gennadiy  Uranov, told INTERFAX.    Almaty ratified the START-I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol  back in July last year, but delayed its joining the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty for a long time, he said. "Now this  problem has been resolved, which laid the foundations for  stepping up the talks between Russia and Kazakhstan, including  negotiations on cooperation in the military area," the diplomat  said.    Another senior Foreign Ministry official, who is also  responsible for Russia's relations with Kazakhstan, told  INTERFAX that Kazakhstan's joining the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty and the U.S. Vice President Albert Gore's visit to Almaty  were not coincidental. "The fact that the U.S.A. allocates  money for nuclear disarmament in Kazakhstan evidently influenced  the step taken by the Kazakh leadership," he said.    He also said that the success scored at the parliamentary  elections in Russia by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal  Democratic Party "may somewhat complicate relations between  Russia and Kazakhstan." "Zhirinovsky's territorial and other  claims on Almaty are known well enough," he concluded.</p>

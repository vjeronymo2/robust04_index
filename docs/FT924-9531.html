			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Maxwell's Death - The First Anniversary: Family comes to terms with shifting fortunes - A year on at the surviving members of the Maxwell dynasty THERE will be a poignant reminder of the Maxwell family's shifting fortunes in the run-up to Christmas with two Sotheby's auctions of the contents of Headington Hill Hall - the Maxwell family home in Oxford. The sales - organised by administrators to Robert Maxwell's personal estate  -will include wine, paintings and an assortment of memorabilia. The combined sales are expected to raise about Pounds 1m - none of which is likely to end up in the hands of the family, although Mrs Betty Maxwell, the tycoon's widow, is arguing for a share of the proceeds. The auctions will be followed within months by the sale of the remainder of the Maxwell lease on Headington Hill Hall, which belongs to Oxford City Council. The lease is being sold by PHL Estates, a private Maxwell company under administration. Mrs Maxwell is not destitute. She still owns a large chateau, reportedly valued at Pounds 3m, in Lot et Garonne in France, which she has firmly told administrators belongs to her. She has provided Pounds 900,000 to cover the legal fees of her sons. In January she surfaced briefly to sue the magazine Paris Match for publishing photographs of her husband's autopsy. She has refused to give any interviews since earlier in the year but is preparing a book of memoirs. By contrast Mrs Pandora Maxwell, Mr Kevin Maxwell's wife and Robert Maxwell's least favourite daughter-in-law, has put forward an image of family resilience in a series of public declarations. 'The only image my children have of prison,' she said recently, 'is when they went to see the Wind in the Willows and saw Toad languishing in jail. They hero-worship their daddy. The pressure is enormous . . . ' Her husband has kept both his sense of humour and equanimity in spite of the criminal charges he faces. He is negotiating a publishing contract for a book on the effects of bankruptcy. There will be only one chapter on his own experience. Kevin and his brother Ian - who also faces criminal charges - abandoned an attempt earlier this year to set up a Dollars 10m media investment fund. Kevin, who subsequently signed up briefly as unemployed, decided to take himself off the register and seek work as a consultant. He and his brother Ian have moved into an office in central London. In an affidavit sworn after his father's death, Kevin valued his assets at Pounds 1.6m and admitted to debts of Pounds 1.75m. Over the past year he has sold his London home and his Morgan car. He and his wife live in her converted barn in Oxfordshire and their three children go to a local private school - with fees, estimated at between Pounds 2,900 and Pounds 5,000 a term, being paid by relatives. Investigators have established that five days before the death of her father-in-law Mrs Pandora Maxwell sold Munday Dean, a racehorse she owned, at the Newmarket sales for 14,000 guineas. Bankruptcy trustees are meanwhile dicussing the 26,000 Irish guineas proceeds of a second horse, Great Max, earlier this year. Mr Ian Maxwell still lives in the Belgravia house he occupied at the time of his father's death, but he is losing a FFr2.5m chateau in France he owned with Kevin and their respective wives. Bankruptcy trustees are preparing to put it up for sale.</p>

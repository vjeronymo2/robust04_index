On June 8, 1994, the Service published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Registers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these species and for other early seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This document is the third in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for migratory bird hunting regulations and deals specifically with proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. It will lead to final frameworks from which States may select season dates, shooting hours, and daily bag and possession limits for the 1994&hyph;95 season. All pertinent comments received through June 23, 1994, have been considered in developing this document. In addition, new proposals for certain early-season regulations are provided for public comment. Comment periods are specified above under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Final regulatory frameworks for early seasons are scheduled for publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on or about August 16, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This supplemental proposed rulemaking consolidates further changes in the original framework proposals published in the April 7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The regulations for early waterfowl hunting seasons proposed in this document are based on the most current information available about the status of waterfowl populations and habitat conditions on the breeding grounds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Presentations at Public Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Four Service employees presented reports on the status of various migratory bird species for which early hunting seasons are being proposed. These reports are briefly reviewed as a matter of public information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. John Bruggink, Woodcock Specialist, reported on the 1994 status of American woodcock. Age-ratio information from harvested woodcock indicated that the 1993 recruitment index (ratio of immatures to adult females) was 23.5 percent below the long-term average in the Eastern Region and 11.8 percent lower than the long-term average in the Central Region. Daily hunting success in the Eastern Region decreased from 2.0 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1992 to 1.9 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1993 (&hyph;5 percent). The seasonal-hunting-success index decreased from 9.7 to 7.0 woodcock per hunter (&hyph;27.8 percent). In the Central Region, the daily-success index decreased from 2.4 birds per hunter in 1992 to 2.3 birds per hunter in 1993 (&hyph;4.2 percent), and the seasonal success index decreased from 11.7 to 11.0 woodcock bagged per hunter (&hyph;6 percent). Analysis of data from the Singing-ground Survey indicated that the number of woodcock declined between 1993 and 1994 in the Eastern and Central Regions. Ten-year (1985&hyph;94) trends from the Singing-ground Survey also indicated declining populations. Since 1968, breeding population indices declined 1.9 percent per year in the Eastern Region and 1.1 percent per year in the Central Region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. David Dolton, Dove Specialist, presented the status of mourning doves in 1994. The report summarized call-count information gathered over the past 29 years. Trends were calculated for the most recent 10&hyph;year interval and for the entire 29&hyph;year period. Between 1993 and 1994, the average number of doves heard per route did not significantly change in any of the 3 management units. No significant trend was found in doves heard in the Eastern or Central Units for either the 10&hyph; or 29&hyph;year time frames. In the Western Unit, no trend was evident over the most recent 10 years, but there has been a significant decline over the past 29 years. Trends for doves seen at the unit level over the 10&hyph; and 29&hyph;year periods agreed with trends for doves heard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Dolton also presented the status of western white-winged doves in Arizona. Whitewing populations declined rapidly in the 1970's, and have since remained relatively stable at a reduced level. In 1993, the Arizona whitewing harvest of 91,000 birds declined 3.7 percent from the harvest in 1992 and was 30 percent below the 1980&hyph;89 mean. The 1994 whitewing call-count survey indicated an 18 percent decrease from 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Dolton then reported on the status of eastern white-winged doves and white-tipped doves in Texas. Results of the 1994 whitewing call-count survey indicated that 615,000 birds were nesting in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy Counties. This estimate represents a 40 percent increase from 1993 and is 22 percent above the 33-year average of 501,000. In upper south Texas, more than 577,000 whitewings were nesting throughout a 19&hyph;county area. This is a 20 percent increase over last year's population and marks the sixth year of a population expansion in this portion of the State. West Texas supports a small population of whitewings. The 1994 estimate of 17,000 birds was 10 percent below the 1993 estimate. For white-tipped doves, an average of 0.78 birds were heard per stop in both brush and citrus locations in 1994. This is 30 percent below the 1993 level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, Mr. Dolton presented population and harvest information for band-tailed pigeons. This species is managed as two separate populations: the Coastal Population (California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) and the Four-Corners or Interior Population (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah). For the Coastal Population, the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicated a significant decline between 1968 and 1993. However, the population apparently has stabilized in the 9 years from 1985 to 1993. Mineral-spring counts conducted in Oregon suggest that bandtails experienced a precipitous decline in 1973 and again in 1985. Since 1985, these counts indicate that the population has been increasing gradually, but it remains at a lower level than during the 1970's. The 1993 count decreased 1.6 percent from 1992. Washington's call-count survey yielded a 1993 index 44 percent above that of 1992, although this change was not statistically significant. Two indirect population estimates in 1992 suggested that the population ranged between 2.4 and 3.1 million birds. The estimated harvest in 1993 was 6,000 birds in California and 3,200 in Oregon. Washington did not have a bandtail season in 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Four-Corners area, BBS data indicated a stable population between 1968 and 1993. The combined harvest for all four States in 1993 was 828 birds. This was a decrease of 60 percent from more than 2,000 bandtails harvested in 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Jim Dubovsky, Waterfowl Specialist, presented information on 1994 habitat conditions for waterfowl and preliminary estimates of blue-winged teal abundance and harvests. A video was shown depicting wetland and upland conditions in the Dakotas and the Prairie Provinces of Canada. Generally, nesting conditions were favorable throughout most of the survey area, with abundant wetlands and improved upland cover. Biologists in several regions stated that conditions were the best they have observed since the 1970's. There were approximately 6 million ponds in Prairie Canada and the northcentral U.S. This estimate is significantly greater than the estimate for 1993 and the long-term average. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1994 May breeding population survey yielded an estimate of 4.6 million blue-winged teal, 45 percent higher than the 1993 estimate of 3.2 million. The 1994 estimate was also 14 percent above the long-term average. The estimated harvest of blue-winged teal during the 1993 September teal season was approximately 134,000 birds, 30 percent below the outcome of the 1992 teal season. The combined September and regular-season harvest of all teal was approximately 1.03 million, 42 percent below the 1985&hyph;87 average. Harvest rates of blue-winged teal remained low during 1993&hyph;94 and were not different from those of last year or the 1985&hyph;87 period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. David Sharp, Central Flyway Representative, reported on the status and harvests of sandhill cranes. The Mid-Continent Population appears to have stabilized following dramatic increases in the early 1980's. The preliminary 1994 spring index for the Central Platte River Valley, uncorrected for visibility, was about 384,850. This index is 52 percent larger than the 1993 index of 253,800. The photo-corrected 3&hyph;year average for the 1991&hyph;93 period was 375,300, which is within the established population-objective range of 343,000&hyph;465,000 cranes. All Central Flyway States, except Nebraska, elected to allow crane hunting in portions of their respective States in 1993&hyph;94; about 19,000 permits were issued and approximately 7,200 permittees hunted one or more times. Compared to the previous year's seasons, the number of permittees increased about 10 percent and active hunters increased 35 percent. About 19,000 cranes were harvested in 1993&hyph;94, a 53 percent increase from the 12,433 harvested in 1992&hyph;93. In Canada, the retrieved harvest fell (51%) from 5,600 in the 1992&hyph;93 seasons to 2,800 in the 1993&hyph;94 seasons. Also, Mid-Continent cranes are hunted in Alaska and Mexico. Data for these areas are not yet available, but the combined harvest should not exceed 3,500 during the 1993&hyph;94 seasons. The total North American sport harvest was estimated to be about 30,200 cranes, which is near (&hyph;5%) the record high reported in the 1990&hyph;91 seasons (31,700), and only the second time the total has exceeded the 30,000 level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Annual surveys of the Rocky Mountain Population, which migrates through the San Luis Valley of Colorado in March, suggest that the population has been relatively stable since 1984. The 1994 index of 17,214 cranes (uncorrected for visibility bias) was near the established objective range of 18,000&hyph;22,000. Limited special seasons were held during 1993 in portions of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, and resulted in an estimated harvest of 704 cranes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Received at Public Hearing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Charles D. Kelley, representing the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, reiterated the request made by a majority of States in the Southeast to prohibit dove hunting over top-sown wheat and urged the Service to include this prohibition in its final revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR). He also expressed opposition to the proposed inclusion of wounded birds in the daily bag limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mr. Ron Stromstad, representing the Central Flyway Council and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, stated that he appreciated the work of the Service Regulations Committee in developing this year's annual hunting-season proposals. He indicated that the Central Flyway Council looked forward to working with the recently established Mid-Continent Population Sandhill Crane Working Group to revise the harvest strategy for this population. He supported the Central Flyway Council's recommendations regarding the conduct of September teal seasons and emphasized that evaluation of any proposed changes to these seasons should be undertaken on a flyway basis. He supported the Texas request for dove hunting during 3 time periods in the Central and Southern Zones. He appreciated the proposed change in the aggregate bag limit for white-winged doves from 2 to 6 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. He noted that over the past 3 years, whitewings have expanded their range and populations have grown significantly. In the Rio Grande Valley, numbers are now well above average. With regard to the proposed revision of 50 CFR, he encouraged the Service to proceed slowly in the development of the proposed rule and suggested that the Service continue to work closely with the States. He supported the recommendations from the other Flyway Councils, with the exception of the proposed changes in the woodcock season in Tennessee. He emphasized that the record should clearly indicate that the Conservation Reserve Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is providing secure nesting habitats for grassland-nesting migratory birds. Improved water conditions on the prairies, coupled with the millions of acres of secure nesting cover, will undoubtedly have a significant beneficial effect on this year's recruitment of nesting birds in the northcentral States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Written Comments Received <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the April 7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , opened the public comment period for migratory game bird hunting regulations. As of June 23, 1994, the Service had received 22 comments; 6 of these specifically addressed early-season issues. These early-season comments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the April 7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Only the numbered items pertaining to early seasons for which written comments were received are included. The Service received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support for continuation of last year's frameworks is also assumed for items for which no recommendations were received. Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An individual from Minnesota expressed concern that the Service is de-emphasizing waterfowl in terms of habitat, predator control, enforcement of regulations, and support for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. He noted that waterfowl hunters help pay for management programs through purchase of ``duck stamps,'' excise taxes, and donations to private conservation organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

States will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours during their September seasons under the condition that they conduct studies or provide information that demonstrates a negligible impact on nontarget duck species during the one-half hour period prior to sunrise. Three States in the Mississippi Flyway (Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) and five in the Central Flyway (Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico) conducted hunter observations during the 1993 September teal season that demonstrated that the attempted harvest of non-target species was no different between pre- and post-sunrise periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Council Recommendations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Central Flyway Council recommended that September teal season shooting hours begin one-half hour before sunrise to sunset without further evaluation for all non-production Central Flyway States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Central Flyway Council recommended that the Service review the guidelines for establishing a September teal season for any new requests for seasons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Michigan be permitted to hold an experimental September teal season in southeastern portions of the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that September teal season shooting hours beginning one-half hour before sunrise be made operational and that no further evaluation of shooting hours be required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An individual representing a group of duck hunters from Wisconsin expressed concern that some States with a September teal season are allowed shooting hours that begin one-half hour before sunrise.

September Duck Seasons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A cooperative Wood Duck Initiative undertaken by the Service and the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils in 1991 is designed to improve banding programs and evaluate techniques for obtaining estimates of breeding population size and production. The Service does not propose to discontinue the September wood duck/teal seasons in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida or expand seasons elsewhere until this initiative has been completed. Furthermore, the Service requests an updated report on these seasons for Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida, by February 1, 1995. These reports should contain wood duck recovery and survival rates, harvest, and the derivation of banded birds harvested during these seasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has published a strategy concerning shooting hours which indicates that during species-specific duck seasons, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. The Service received information from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida regarding the effect of presunrise shooting hours. This information was deemed sufficient to demonstrate a negligible impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species during seasons directed at both teal and wood ducks. Therefore, Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours during their September seasons without further evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Council Recommendations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Iowa be permitted to hold a portion of their regular duck season in September to increase harvest opportunity on blue-winged teal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Written Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One individual and a petition with 467 signatures requested nine additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin. The request notes that the efforts of duck hunters, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited, and various sportsmen's organizations have resulted in record levels of duck production.

In 1993, the Service reduced bag limits on scoters from 7 to 4 within an overall 7&hyph;bird sea duck limit. Although data needed to monitor these species remain less than satisfactory, the Service reiterates its request that the Flyway Councils continue to review the status of sea ducks and complete management plans.

They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving in the Upper Peninsula during September 20&hyph;24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24 opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region by early November. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington.

Sandhill Cranes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during the 1982&hyph;92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of data collection efforts at the subspecies level.

They noted that the Central Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons and asked for clarification of the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore, the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies level. Biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level. They indicated that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 14.

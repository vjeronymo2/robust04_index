			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unquoted capital losses I UNDERSTAND that capital losses on unquoted investments can be set against income for tax purposes. Does this apply to overseas unquoted investment losses? No. One of the many conditions (set out in sections 574 to 576 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) is that the company has never been non-resident: 576 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (4) For the purposes of sections 573 to 575 and this section a qualifying trading company is a company none of whose shares have at any time in the relevant period been quoted on a recognised stock exchange and which: (a) either (i) is a trading company on the date of the disposal; or (ii) has ceased to be a trading company at a time which is not more that three years before that date and has not since that time been an excluded company or an investment company; and (b) either (i) has been a trading company for a continuous period of six years ending on that date or at that time; or (ii) has been a trading company for a shorter continuous period ending on that date or at that time and has not before the beginning of that period been an excluded company or an investment company; and (c) has been resident in the UK throughout the period from its incorporation until that date. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

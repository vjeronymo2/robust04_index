			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> SCANNING THE GLOBE FOR GIFTS  </P> <P> SHOPPERS WHO NEED a break from their neighborhood mall but are not quite ready  for Melrose Avenue might want to try the Guildhouse. Housed in a converted  men's dormitory next to Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park, the Guildhouse doesn't  stock the dusty trinkets found in most hospital gift shops; retired  doctor-and-nurse couple Arnold and Margaret Freed scour the world for  treasures, from hand-carved wooden birds from China to hand-carved ceramics  from Uruguay.  </P> <P> "Every place I go -- all over the world -- I stick my nose in shops and see  what they're selling," Margaret Freed says. The beautifully handmade Polish  boxes finished by chip carving are one such recent Guildhouse addition. "The  government put sanctions on these things years ago," she explains. Now, with  the changes in Eastern Europe, tariffs have been lifted, and the boxes are once  again available. "This is the first shipment we've been able to get in a long  time."  </P> <P> Gifts from the Guildhouse (open weekend afternoons only) are priced to suit  even the tightest budgets, and proceeds benefit Barlow Hospital.  </P> <P>  Guildhouse, 2000 Stadium Way, Los Angeles; (213) 250-3894.  </P> <P> DIANE BAILEY  </P></p>

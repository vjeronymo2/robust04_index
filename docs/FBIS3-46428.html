Statistics from related departments show that this year the  state will continue to inject a large amount of funds in key  transport and telecommunications construction projects.    The planned infrastructure construction budget for the  Ministries of Railways, Communications, Posts and  Telecommunications and Civil Aviation Administration of China  (CAAC) have all risen by a large margin, compared with the sum  applied in 1993.    While last year the Ministry of Railways made use of an  infrastructure investment of 22.5 billion yuan, this year the  state has ratified a huge sum of 41.7 billion yuan; and while  the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications applied an  investment of 40 billion yuan in fixed assets last year, this  year the planned budget has risen abruptly to 53.6 billion yuan.    Transport and Telecommunications have long been  "bottlenecks"  restricting China's economic development. With the constant and  high-speed development of the country's economy in the past few  years and the implementation of a market economy system, the  problem has become increasingly serious.    To remove the "bottlenecks", Chinese leaders have put  infrastructure construction in these fields under special  protection and drafted a series of preferential policies for  project approval, supply of funds, personnel allocation and some  other aspects. Among the state's 210 key capital construction  or technological remolding projects for the period between 1993  and 2000, which must introduce technologies and equipment from  overseas, 52 are distributed throughout the Ministries of  Railways, Communications, Posts and Telecommunications and CAAC,  nearly one fourth of the total.    Last year construction on a large number of key projects in  these fields was started, including more than a dozen  long-distance optical telecommunications cables, 10 railway  construction projects, and expansion or building of a large  number of airports, high-grade highways and deep-water berths.  The majority of these construction projects have entered the  phase requiring the most extensive funding.    Sources from the Ministry of Railways said that this year  tracks will be laid on 2,100 km of new lines and more than 1,300  km of multiple-track lines, and over 190 km of railway lines  will be electrified. Some 19.6 billion yuan will be put into  seven key construction projects. One of them, the  Beijing-Kowloon Railway, will be 80-90 percent complete by  year's end.    Last year the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications laid  eight long-distance optical cables, and this year construction  on four cables will be continued, and two will be remolded and  nine newly constructed. This year's plan also includes nine  million new telephone subscribers, an increase of 300,000  long-distance lines, 900,000 long-distance lines in  program-controlled exchanges, and 12 million urban exchange  lines. In addition, mobile telecommunications will also develop  significantly.    By the end of 1993 China had opened 1.07 million km of  highways, of which 1,145 km are expressways. This year the  Ministry of Communications plans to construct 18,000 km of  highways, including 960 km of high-grade routes especially for  automobiles.    To meet the speedily increasing demand for passenger and  cargo transport, CAAC will continue to expand or construct  airports and other related facilities, while adopting measures  to reinforce air safety.    Last year CAAC received 71 new passenger planes of all  kinds,  and at the same time signed contracts on buying or leasing 104  planes, some to be delivered this year.    To raise enough money for these projects, the communications  departments have all announced that more foreign funds will be  used.    Materials show that since the mid-1980s, 23 Chinese  provinces, cities and autonomous regions have used some 1.7  billion U.S. dollars in loans from international monetary  organizations or foreign governments to construct 7,000 km of  highways. The Ministry of Railways has used 3.68 billion U.S.  dollars in foreign funds, and it is predicted that this year  over one billion U.S. dollars will be introduced. CAAC and the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will also inject  foreign funds into construction projects.</p>

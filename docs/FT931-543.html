'Hungarians are still considered inferior citizens not able to fulfil posts of political responsibility,' said the Democratic Union of Magyars in Romania (DUMR) which represents the country's 1.7m ethnic Hungarians. The appointment of the prefects to Harghita and Covasna, where more than 75 per cent of the people are ethnic Hungarians, was only the latest example of continuing discrimination against the minority and contradicted the government's declared wish for integration into European structures, the DUMR said.

Previously ethnic Hungarians had held the two posts.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS PUTS 'UNCLE BUCK' ON HOLD; NBC CANCELS 'WORKING IT OUT'  </P> <P> CBS has put "Uncle Buck" on indefinite hiatus and NBC has canceled its comedy  "Working It Out," network and production company spokesmen confirmed Wednesday.  </P> <P> NBC also said that it has ordered additional episodes of its first-season  comedy series "The Fanelli Boys" and "American Dreamer," and that a "Dark  Shadows" miniseries will air Jan. 13 and 14 as a precursor to a "Dark Shadows"  prime-time series.  </P> <P> Jim Conway, one of the executive producers of the CBS series "Guns of Paradise"  -- formerly titled simply "Paradise" -- also confirmed that CBS will put the  series back on the air sometime in January. Conway said that the Western series  would return with a new title because "after two years, people still thought  'Paradise' was a show starring Richard Chamberlain, set in Hawaii."  </P> <P> Tim O'Donnell, an executive producer of "Uncle Buck," said that CBS has ordered  a full season of 22 episodes of "Buck," and predicted that the show would  return before February in a different time slot. He said both the producers and  CBS agreed that the recent decision to move the show from its former 8 p.m  Monday time slot to 8 p.m. Fridays -- trading slots with the Burt Reynolds  comedy "Evening Shade" -- had hurt "Buck's" ratings, since the Friday slot pits  the kid-oriented show against ABC's popular comedy "Full House."  </P> <P> CBS did not say what will take "Uncle Buck's" place on the schedule.  </P> <P> Nor did NBC offer immediate word on what will replace "Working It Out," a  comedy with Jane Curtin that had been airing Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. The show  had suffered low ratings; last week it attracted only 13% of the available  audience and ranked 71st among the week's 94 prime-time programs.  </P></p>

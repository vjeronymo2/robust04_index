			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar consolidates its gains THE dollar traded in a narrow range of between DM1.64 and DM1.65 yesterday, content to consolidate the gains of recent days, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US currency managed one brief rally to DM1.6565 on the back of a large buying order rumoured to have been the institutional investor, American Trust. However, it soon drifted back to below DM1.65 in what traders described as a 'very, very thin market'. The dollar closed in London a touch stronger at DM1.6495, compared with DM1.6470 on Thursday. Economists stressed that the dollar's quiet day did not mean the market was turning bearish. 'A positive sentiment continues to be driven by the view that the US economy is recovering and interest rates have bottomed out,' said Dr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. There was a subdued atmosphere on foriegn exchanges around the globe with the most notable feature being the lack of movement in virtually all currencies. The dollar/yen rate was slightly stronger, although fears of central bank intervention kept most players away. The Bank of Japan was rumoured to have been checking prices overnight. The dollar closed at Y128.70, compared with Y128.50. Sterling fell against the D-Mark early in the day as an opinion poll suggested a four-point lead for the Labour Party over the Conservatives in the forthcoming general election. The pound fell to DM2.8775 on the news, although it recovered to close unchanged at DM2.8825. 'Opinion polls will become even more important to the market (in sterling),' said Mr David Cocker, treasury adviser at Chemical Bank. The pound remained firmly on the floor of the exchange rate mechanism, even when the peseta eased against the D-Mark during the day. This should have allowed it a greater cushion, said Mr Michael Feeny of Sumitomo Bank. He suggested that, as a result, sterling's recent resilience within the ERM had not been real. 'It has been forced up as the floor has gone up,' he said. By the end of the day, however, the peseta was only slightly weaker at 62.64 per D-Mark, compared with 62.62 on Thursday. The D-Mark continued to strengthen against the Swiss franc, reinforcing fears that the Swiss National Bank was pursuing a policy of back door devaluation. The D-Mark closed at 90.57 centimes, compared with 90.42 on Thursday. The Canadian dollar enjoyed early gains against the US unit, as better than expected inflation figures gave the currency support. Trade was thin, however, as the market was looking ahead to the budget next week.</p>

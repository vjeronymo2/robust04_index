			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television No doubt about the most watchable show tonight. Hollywood Kids (ITV at 9pm) is exploitative television at its most cringing but since the subjects beg to be filmed everyone can relax and enjoy. This week we move on from those sad kids of stars to kids who are themselves stars. In Rhodes Around Christmas the modish chef and professional good bloke Gary Rhodes ignores the turkey in favour of dishes involving pork scratchings, tiger prawns, and Christmas pudding ice cream - and why not? Comfort and Joy (12 midnight ITV), is an exercise in Bill Forsyth cosiness, never mind the pseudo-world weary trimmings. And keep a bleary eye on Newsnight (10.30pm BBC2), taken for granted as a serious programme, though its supercilious vox pop at the Dudley by-election threw up a slip of the tongue from a voter who confused Lionel and Tony Blair. It passed director, editor, producer and presenter, all of whom depend on appearing superior to the lumpenproletariat, and doubtless got a good cheap laugh. News and current affairs programmes, if not cub reporters, should know better.</p>

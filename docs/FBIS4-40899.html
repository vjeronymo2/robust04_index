			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Wages for South Urals Defense </F> Workers"]    [Text] Some 230 billion rubles have been transferred for  the express purposes of extinguishing indebtedness in respect of  wages due to workers at defense enterprises in the South Urals.  This was announced by Deputy Finance Minister Andrey Astakhov  at a joint sitting of the government commission, the Chelyabinsk  Oblast leadership, and defense sector enterprise directors.  Thus, the first step toward remedying the critical situation  prevailing here has been taken.    The arrival of an authoritative Russian Government  commission  at one of the country's leading industrial regions and its tour  of a number of major enterprises and the Defense Complex Design  Bureau was seen by Igor Velichko, general designer at the State  Missile Center, as a show of genuine interest on the part of the  leadership of ministries and departments in ensuring the  stabilization of the work of the military-industrial complex.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Jersey (12): Price can be something of a shock - It is hard enough for local residents to find affordable property, with even starter homes selling in the range of Pounds 95,000-Pounds 110,000 / Property Fancy a converted farm in secluded parkland for Pounds 2.5m? If so, Jersey has a good number of properties on offer. For those with more modest means, accommodation is not so easy. 'The housing market has not performed as in the UK,' says Mr Colin Powell, chief adviser to the States of Jersey. 'Prices did not fall in Jersey because of the underlying pressure for accommodation. It looks as though prices were pretty flat in 1993.' He admits there has been some 'downward price adjustment' in some of the middle price-range housing. Mr Roger Trower, head of Broadland, one of the largest local estate agencies in Jersey, says: 'We have not suffered nearly as badly in Jersey as elsewhere.' But he warns of the sometimes excessive expectations of prospective residents. 'It is very difficult to compare here with the UK,' he says. 'If people come from a fairly rural area, they have difficulty coming to terms with it.' In the past, he says Jersey could be compared to outskirts of inner London in price, although certainly not in quality. It is hard enough for local residents to find affordable property, with even starter homes selling in the range of Pounds 95,000-Pounds 110,000. Even for wealthy individuals, the price can be something of a shock. Mr Trower says those travelling to Jersey spend a little time on the island deciding whether or not they could live locally and judging the house prices. 'They normally want to spend up to Pounds 1.5m. When they realise what they get for that they go into a slight panic wobble to say the least.' The housing market has been subject to strong government control. Mr Powell says that until 1970, non-residents were restricted to buying houses above a certain price range. But he said this had the effect of pushing up all prices above this barrier. As a result, housing regulations were introduced which approached the matter from another direction: by classifying all accommodation so that only certain categories of residents could buy or rent it. Much of the lower priced property is reserved for locals. J-category or 'essential employees' and K-category residents - those granted entry on 'economic or social' grounds - are restricted to a relatively small number of generally higher priced property. At the other end of the scale, 'non-qualified' people who are neither local, nor in categories J or K, cannot buy or rent any property, but must instead live in lodging houses regulated by the States housing committee or rent a room in someone's house. As a result, a network of letting agencies has sprung up on the island. The government is still actively involved in providing accommodation for local residents. It builds some state housing and oversees means-tested rent rebates on these and on the private rental market for those who cannot afford to buy. It offers first-time buyers access to a loan scheme with low rates of interest on the mortgages based on a sliding scale currently from as low as 3 per cent, which is also dependent on the income of the buyers. 'The States have always been very encouraging of home ownership,' says Mr Powell. While Jersey is sensitive about the need to prevent over-development, its current housing plan estimates that about 100 private sector housing units will be built in each of the next four years. Mr Trower says he has fought the government regularly on housing matters. Until a few years ago, there was price control on houses: regulations stipulated that a house could only be sold for its previous purchase price plus additional amounts for rebuilding, contents and other costs. If the States disagreed with the price, a panel of quantity surveyors was brought in, creating a protracted process which often frustrated buyers and sellers alike and caused deals to be called off at the last minute. It also led to evasion techniques such as 'wheelbarrows sold for Pounds 1,500 and sheds for Pounds 5,000.' He admits that this did prevent prices 'galloping away' during the property boom. To avoid the housing classifications limiting acquisition of properties by non-locals, a number of ingenious techniques were developed. Under the ancient principle of degrevement, a creditor can take over the property of a debtor. By holding the property through a company and then transferring the shares, it falls outside the jurisdiction of the States. This loophole has now been closed. Mr Trower says there is one other way for those wanting to become Jersey residents. Those with some hotel experience can live in any properties with at least 60 bedrooms. He says there are at least two such properties currently available.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Tao (0719 3447): "At Panel Discussion, </F> Military Deputy Chi Haotian Urges Doing a Good Job in National  Defense Building and Army Work"]    [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--We should  unwaveringly support the state in speeding up the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure; do a good job of  stabilizing the situation with all our hearts and all our might  to provide a stable, reliable, and safe environment for China to  deepen reform and develop the economy; and, while promoting the  overall interest of economic construction, we should strive to  increase national defense capabilities and create more favorable  conditions for resisting aggression and defending the  motherland. That is the central topic of a speech by [Defense  Minister] Chi Haotian, an army deputy to the National People's  Congress, when the People's Liberation Army delegation held a  panel discussion this afternoon to deliberate the government  work report.    Chi said that in the government work report, Premier Li Peng  pointed out: "Reform and opening up is the motive force behind  the development." Given that the economies of many countries in  the world develop slowly, stage weak recoveries, and even  register negative growth, the Chinese economy, full of vigor and  vitality, has maintained a strong momentum of growth. This is  thanks to the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to reform  and opening up. At this crucial juncture, when the state is  expediting reform of the economic structure, we should bear in  mind President Jiang Zemin's remark that revolutionary  servicemen should hold aloft the banners of patriotism and  socialism, regard the interests of the party and the people as  their own, and contribute to the deepening of reform and the  economic prosperity of the state.    Chi pointed out: Reform, development, and stability are an  organically-linked entity in which reform is the motive force,  development is the fundamental, and stability is the  prerequisite. Only by accurately grasping and correctly handling  the relationship between them can we maintain the sustained,  rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang 2170 4958, 1816  6643, 0256 1660] development of the national economy. Stability  plays a special role in reform, development, and the overall  interests of accomplishing the work of the whole party. It is  especially necessary for leading army cadres at all levels to  bear in mind Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea that "stability is of  paramount importance" and conscientiously regard the maintenance  of stability as an important duty, so that the party and state  can concentrate their energy on reform, opening up, and economic  construction. Chi said: All army comrades should, in answer to  the call of the party Central Committee and the Central Military  Commission, launch activities of learning from Lei Feng and Xu  Honggang and resist the corrosion of money worship, pleasure-  seeking, and ultra-individualism using a correct outlook on life  and correct values. Leaders at all levels should enhance their  awareness of the masses, direct their eyes downward, show  solicitude for soldiers, do practical things for grass-roots  units and help them solve problems, increase the cohesiveness of  army units, and maintain a high degree of stability and unified  centralism in the army.    Strong national defense is a reliable guarantee for the  country's long-term political stability. On the issue of  stepping up national defense modernization while putting the  overall interests of economic construction first, Chi Haotian  said: It is necessary to consistently take as our guide Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and his idea on army building in the new period  and strive to explore the special features and laws of defense  building under the conditions of socialist market economy and  modern warfare, so that defense building can be adapted to the  new situation. It is necessary to perseveringly launch  education in national defense, the focus of which is on cadres.  The idea that "there is no security and stability without an  army" and the ancient teaching that "despite peace in the world,  it is dangerous to forget about war" should first strike root in  the minds of cadres at all levels. We should rely on the party,  the government, the army, and the forces of all social sectors  in keeping up mass, regular education in national defense and  play a positive role in exerting a subtle influence. It is  necessary to step up the building of a legal system for national  defense, persist in grasping the formulation and enforcement of  laws while, at the same time, paying equal importance to both.  With regard to national defense statutes that have been  adopted, we should firmly uphold them and exercise management in  accordance with them. While stepping up education in national  defense and engaging in defense building according to statutes,  we should adapt the building of reserve forces to the  development of a socialist market economy through vigorous  readjustments and reforms.    At the panel discussion this afternoon, Zhang Baokang, Zhou  Yibing, and Zhang Xusan said: The government work report is  encouraging. The fact that China scored a series of  achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive  last year has once again proved that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a  powerful ideological weapon for guiding reform and construction.  It shows that the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, and the new government are firm, strong, and  highly effective in their leadership. It also shows that, led  by the new Central Military Commission, the whole army has  carried forward the fine traditions and played the role as a  "pillar," a "great wall," and a vital new force in defending  state security, safeguarding social stability, and supporting  state economic construction.</p>

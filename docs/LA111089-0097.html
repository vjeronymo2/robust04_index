			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> CHERYL BENTYNE COVERS WIDE RANGE AT LE CAFE  </P> <P> Cheryl Bentyne perched on a high stool next to the piano, tossed back her mane  of red hair, sighed and launched into the verse of Billy Strayhorn's "Day  Dream."  </P> <P> This laid-back mood at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks marked the start of another of  her occasional one-nighters away from her home base, home being Manhattan  Transfer. More than ever before, she demonstrated her exceptional talent as a  purveyor of a wide range of songs, from Gershwin and Ellington to Ivan Lins.  </P> <P> For well over an hour Tuesday evening, she kept an intimate group of fans  entranced as she wove her way through familiar standards and newly lyricized  instrumentals. In the latter category were Dore Caymmi's "Love's River" and  Michel Legrand's "Les Enfants Qui Pleurent."  </P> <P> Her sound is pure, her phrasing indicative of a jazz sensitivity, with Corey  Allen's understated but rhythmically compelling accompaniment as her sole and  totally adequate support. At times Bentyne would offer surprising evidence of  her considerable range, as she did in a sudden, unpredictable upward thrust  toward the conclusion of "My Funny Valentine."  </P> <P> Le Cafe could have been a New York Eastside lounge in the 1960s as she applied  her velvet timbre to "Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most" and "Blue  Prelude." During the Brazilian interlude Allen switched to electric keyboard to  supply soothing organ harmony. Later he had his own solo spot, bringing gentle  intelligence to his treatment of "That's All." He co-wrote with Bentyne the  brief and engaging final tune, "Good Friends." By the end of this magic set the  French had clearly extended to everyone in her small but delighted audience.

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Bosses unmoved by Euro-plans MOST UK employers do not believe European Community proposals on employee participation and involvement - including the draft works council directive  -will make any impact on job opportunities in their companies, Industrial Relations Services says. In a survey today of 62 companies the pay analyst says that half do not believe such proposals would add to their labour costs, nor reduce their right to manage. A third added that the plans would improve employee relations.</p>

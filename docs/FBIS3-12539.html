Vojko Plevel reports  that he met with Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin this  morning:    [Begin Plevel recording] After yesterday's meeting with  Israeli President Ezer Weizman and two meetings with Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, President Kucan also met with  Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin this morning. The two  exchanged views and assessments on the current international  situation, especially the circumstances in the Middle East and  in the Balkans and, naturally, in Europe. They both agreed that  the belief that the mere collapse of the Berlin Wall would  resolve the situation in Europe proved to be an illusion and  that we need to further strengthen our efforts to assert  democracy as an alternative to war, as well as equality of  smaller and less developed nations. Russia remains the biggest  puzzle, to which recent events can attest.    Regarding bilateral contacts and possibilities for their  strengthening, President Kucan after these talks assessed that  with the Israeli partners he found understanding and interest  for Slovenia that exceeded a mere bilateral interest. They have  also shown an interest to intercede on behalf of our economic  and political interests in their international contacts,  especially where international policy is being decided and where  they are present because of their specific position. They also  fully support our efforts for integration into Partnership for  Peace, which they, just like ourselves, assess as preparation  for a new collective security system in the world.    President Kucan will end his visit to Israel this afternoon  with a speech at the 4th international forum in Jerusalem. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Havelock back in the black HAVELOCK EUROPA, the storefitting company, returned to the black after two years of losses with profits of Pounds 505,000 pre-tax in the first half of 1993, compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.6m. The outcome was achieved on turnover of Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 16.1m), a fall that the Fife-based company attributed to a deliberate policy of avoiding low margin business, and to its practice of recording sales only when contracts are completed. Once again, no interim dividend is declared but a final of 1.5p is proposed for the full year. The company lost Pounds 2.4m in 1991 and Pounds 3m in 1992 and raised Pounds 2.97m via a placing and open offer last October. It also embarked on a programme of reducing overheads, and has cut staff levels from 831 in 1991 to 583. Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, said the latest result showed the company could be profitable on lower turnover and said it represented the first stage in its recovery. Mr Lessels said the company had a heavy workload in the second half of the year which, with sharply improved efficiency at the Nottingham factory, should result in 'a very strong outcome for the year.' Earnings per share were 1.9p (restated losses of 10p).</p>

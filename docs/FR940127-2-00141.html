			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. The services provided pursuant to the Plans will augment or replace (and not be duplicative of) the services to be provided to the Portfolios by Mellon Bank, the Distributors, or FRIMCo. Applicants propose to ``unbundle'' services provided to the Portfolios to permit Organizations to select services they wish to provide to their Class Shareholders, with such services to be tailored to their Class Shareholders' needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. With respect to each class of shares, a Portfolio will pay an Organization for its services and assistance in accordance with the terms of its Plan and related Plan Agreement (``Plan Payments'') and the expense of such payments will be borne entirely by the owners of the class of shares of the Portfolio to which each Plan Agreement relates. Plan Payments will not exceed 0.50% per year of the average daily net asset value of shares owned by Class Shareholders covered by such Plan Agreement. In addition, for any Organization having both a 12b&hyph;1 Plan and Administrative Plan, aggregate Plan Payments will not exceed 1.00% per year. Such maximum limits on Plan Payments might be increased in the future, upon compliance with the provisions of the related Plan, but will not be increased over the limits stated above unless the requested exemptive order is amended, or a no-action position obtained from the SEC staff permitting such increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants at all times will comply with Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as amended, with respect to asset-based distribution charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. All expenses of the Funds that cannot be attributed directly to any one Portfolio (``Fund Expenses'') will be allocated to each Portfolio based on the relative net assets of such Portfolio. Fund Expenses could include, for example, directors' fees and expenses, audit and legal fees, insurance premiums, SEC and state blue sky registration fees, and dues paid to organizations such as the Investment Company Institute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Certain expenses may be attributable to a Portfolio, but not to a particular class (``Portfolio Expenses''). Portfolio Expenses will be allocated to a class based upon the relative percentage of net assets of such class. Portfolio expenses could include, for example, advisory fees, accounting fees, custodian fees, and fees related to preparation of separate documents of the Portfolio. In addition, the gross income of each Portfolio will be allocated on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class, and then divided by the number of outstanding shares in each class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. In addition to the cost of Plan Payments, each class will bear certain expenses attributable specifically to such class, as set forth in Condition 1 (``Class Expenses''). The determination of which Class Expenses will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be determined by the Board of Directors of the Fund in the manner described in Condition 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Funds' investment adviser may choose to reimburse or waive Class Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by the investment adviser may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. In addition, the investment adviser may waive or reimburse Fund Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Fund Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Fund Expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of a Portfolio based on the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Portfolio Expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of that Portfolio according to the relative net assets of the classes. Fund Expenses and Portfolio Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Portfolio. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund Expenses or Portfolio Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 18. Dividends paid to each class of shares will be declared and paid on the same days and at the same times, and except as noted below, will be determined in the same manner and paid in the same amounts. Because different Plan Payments and Class Expenses may be borne by each class of shares, the net income of (and dividends payable to) each class may be different from the net income of the other classes of shares of a Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda  is asking for an increase of UN troops in Rwanda. In a report  presented to the UN Security Council yesterday, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali supported the idea. [passage omitted]    Among the countries which are likely to send troops are  Guinea, Australia, and France. The president of the latter says  that France would send its troops to Rwanda if requested.  However, we hope that the United Nations would not dream of  sending French troops to Rwanda, as Rwandans and the world  community saw for themselves what the French troops did when  they were there.    The lack of interest by the world community in sending  international troops is mainly due to a lack of understanding.  It is the clique in power which continues to ask for the  international troops. This is in turn due to the pressure of  the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] troops on their troops.  Recently, in Arusha, the so-called government thought that it  was going to meet the RPF. But the RPF refused to meet that  government. They [the government] asked that the international  community station troops between the two warring sides believing  that this could stop the war that they had themselves started  through their countrywide massacres. An end to the fighting,  they hope, would permit the talks between the RPF and the  government which have not taken place yet, to go ahead. The RPF  believes that the most urgent assistance that could be given to  Rwandans is not the dispatch of troops but of relief assistance  consisting of food, medicine, and other necessities.

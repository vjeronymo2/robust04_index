			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> OLD GLOBE'S 'SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL' GOES LIGHT ON THE VITRIOL  </P> <P> How refreshing. Craig Noel's staging of "The School for Scandal" that opened  over the weekend at the Old Globe, under the stars and under the path of  airplanes headed for Lindbergh Field, doesn't go for the jugular. It goes for  the glitter. Occasionally, it hits the gold.  </P> <P> Aside from benefitting hugely from the large and unmatched presence of Paxton  Whitehead, who as Sir Peter Teazle is given an impromptu prologue that sets the  tone of the production ("It is with deep regret," he quips, "that the role  usually played by Paxton Whitehead will be played by Paxton Whitehead"), this  is as sunny a version as you're likely to come across of Richard Brinsley  Sheridan's attack on the bad behavior of the 18th-Century upper crust. But  alfresco, under an August moon, vitriol is easier to forget.  </P> <P> What this "Scandal" is, is mostly what it's not: a benevolent, rather than  malevolent, comedy. No gimmicks. No serious echoes of "Les Liaisons  Dangereuses." No lurid symbols of outrageous decadence. Only a deliberate  cross-period connection with the National Enquirer, People magazine and  Hogarth's "Marriage a la Mode" (in designer Steven Rubin's sumptuous, mirrored  sets) and an inconsistent urge towards caricature with make-up and costume (the  work of the excellent Robert Wojewodski).  </P> <P> The cartooning is particularly emphatic when it comes to those fervent apostles  of gossip and rumor: Snake (a weaselly Robert Phalen), Sir Benjamin Backbite  (Nicholas Martin, all bows), his uncle Crabtree (Mitchell Edmonds, all  furbelows) and the bloated Mrs. Candour (Linda Hoy, venomously understated in  pink hair and chartreuse gown).  </P> <P> A jolly "Scandal," then, and only mildly poisonous, in which the text is  streamlined to contain mostly the juicy, farcical parts, and in which some  scenes -- leave it to the impish Noel -- are cleverly transposed from the terra  firma interior of rooms to the rocking interior of a moving coach.  </P> <P> Its comedy runs on the customary two tracks: the war between the Teazles and  temperamental differences of the Surface brothers and how they are tricked and  uncovered by their newly arrived uncle, Sir Oliver (Henry J. Jordan). William  Anton is just enough of a dullard as Joseph Surface to be believably  transparent in his hypocrisy, while Ray Chambers has sexy good looks (if not  real pizazz) as the profligate Charles.  </P> <P> Between them they deliver serviceable performances that never quite hit any  peaks. The timing on the famous screen scene in Charles' quarters seemed  laggard on opening night, with the laughs a beat or two behind the action.  </P> <P> That kind of slight miscalculation suggests a need still for fine-tuning.  Between the Teazles as well. Whitehead, of course, is splendid -- a big basset  of a Sir Peter, with a voice like a bassoon, but Lynne Griffin, who has the  motions in place as Lady Teazle lacks the vocal thunder to match. This  undermines her imperiousness and weakens their scenes together. One brainstorm  that steals the show is the cunning puppy dog Sir Peter takes for walks. Not a  real one, but almost.  </P> <P> The balance of the cast ranges from excellent to bland. Navarre T. Perry is a  solidly faithful friend as Rowley and Erica Rogers a perfectly-named Lady  Sneerwell, her face perpetually contorted, but Karen Vesper's Maria is so  colorless as to almost fade from the stage.  </P> <P> Such minor inconsistencies mar what is otherwise a spirited concoction for a  summer night. And all is, after all, still fixable. . . .  </P> <P>  At the Lowell Davies Festival Theatre in Balboa Park, Tuesdays through  Sundays, 8 p.m., until Oct.11. Tickets: $14-$25; (619) 239-2255.  </P> <P> </P></p>

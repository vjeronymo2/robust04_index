			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Tomas Granados: "U.S. Immigrants, a </F> Terrorizing Monster Called Alien"]    [Text] In the past decade, the word immigrant has virtually  disappeared from daily use as a way of identifying the foreigner  who arrives in the United States in search of achieving "the  American dream." Now they are called "aliens," as if they are  attempting to equate immigrants to the repulsive film monster,  the lethal threat to humans, through evil semantic manipulation.    It is not the fault of Hollywood director Riddley Scott, who  intended to make money and provide fun to moviegoers when in  1979 he launched his film "Alien." He never insinuated a  similarity between the immigrants and that repulsive  gelatin-like creature that was willing to annihilate the human  species.    Anyway, what is certain is that starting some years ago the  word "immigrant" has been used less and less in the United  States when referring to a foreigner who arrives in that nation  possibly attracted by the cliche words of Emma Lazarus written  at the base of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your  poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free." Now,  instead of being called "immigrants," they are called "aliens,"  with all the disdain contained in the semantic value of the  word, which means "strange," "unrelated"....    According to Victor Inzunza, director of the  Mexican-American  Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF, from its name in  English) there is a "vicious evil" directed against immigrants  in the United States. He added that "what I find more  disquieting is the almost absolute lack of compassion and  reasoning in the national debate on immigration."    What has happened in this country where, according to what  many experience, over 60 million immigrants of 120 ethnical  backgrounds have molded the United States' national identity  from the 1500's all the way to the present?    A CBS Television Network poll, which was conducted in  January  of this year and whose results were disclosed 22 May, shows that  53 percent of those interviewed say immigrants cause problems,  while 22 percent believe they should be deported back to their  country of origin, especially those who arrived in the United  States during the last five years. The rejection of these  immigrants seem to have a racial tone because a majority of the  1,210 people interviewed associate immigrants with Latin America  or Asia. This, perhaps, could be the reason why 43 percent  agree with U.S. officials' introducing selective criterion into  their immigration policy.    This issue of "selectiveness" is not a new suggestion in  dealing with immigration-related problems. Following the Los  Angeles earthquake in January of this year, the controversial  issue of whether or not illegal immigrants were entitled to  public assistance was raised, as if to say the immigration  status of an individual were enough to exclude him or her from  receiving subsidies in the aftermath of such a tragedy.    There are even those who have proposed worse solutions. One  such individual is California Governor Peter Wilson, who  supports denying medical and educational services in order to  compensate the lack of federal subsidies to cover the public  expenses that illegal immigrants create. Furthermore, he  supports the idea of not granting U.S. citizenship to the  children of illegal immigrants.    To prevent the "aliens" from doing away with the "noble"  human race in the United States, Janet Reno, the enthusiastic  U.S. attorney general, announced in February a $540 million  program directed at virtually sealing off the Mexican border.  Democratic Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming proposed a plan to  cut back the number of legal immigrants allowed in the United  States, estimated at over 675,000 per year.    There are several very ill-intended proposals, such as that  of Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, who presented  a reform bill that would oblige education authorities to  identify high school students who are unable to prove their  legal status in the country and thus expose them to deportation.  Rohrabacher's bill also included the suspension of federal  funding for high schools that serve the illegal alien community,  but a group of U.S. congressmen and women of Hispanic origin,  led by Democrat Jose Serrano, was able to avert this  anti-immigrant attempt for now.    They were also successful in defeating a draft bill  sponsored by Toby Roth, Republican representative for Wisconsin,  which would have eliminated the $215 million budget earmarked  this year for the bilingual education system, which mostly  benefits the children of Latin American immigrants.    "As a teacher and a Latin American, I believe it is an  insult  for people to propose ending bilingual education," according to  Edwin Espaillant, vice president of the United Federation of New  York Teachers, where 36 percent of the million students are  Hispanic and where there are 67 bilingual education programs.    Other measures include greater sanctions against people who  employ undocumented individuals, more restrictions for work  permits, and a charge of up to $170 to political asylum seekers,  the number of whom according to federal statistics, surpassed  150,000 last year.    "This policy is nothing more than part of the current move  against immigrants that, in addition, has a deeply racist  component, considering that most of them are from the so-called  Third Word," according to Franklin Velazquez, policy director  for New York's Immigrant Rights Center.    The anti-immigrant offensive against "aliens" is mainly seen  in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, where the  greatest number of people from Latin America have arrived either  legally or illegally.    A Federal Census Bureau report issued in April forecasts  that  by the year 2020 the Latin population in the United States will  surpass 51.2 million to become the country's largest minority  group.    Perhaps this could be one of the reasons for the  anti-immigrant campaign, which in its offensive, includes a  study by the Carrying Capacity Network [preceding name published  in English] organization, which is led by Dr. Donald Huddle, an  expert of the Economics Department of Rice University in Texas.  The study blames "aliens" for the 914,000 people who were  unemployed in California in 1992, with losses exceeding $42  billion.    This is simply another flank attack by this trend. The  extended use of words such as "aliens" or "illegal" not only  serves to perversely deform the meaning of the word immigrant  until it makes it sound as if it were a criminal, but it also to  presents them as people from another world and greatly to blame  for U.S. economic problems.    Jesus Hernandez Cuellar, editor of the Metropolitan Section  of LA OPINION newspaper in Los Angeles, believes that the hidden  purpose of this cloaked xenophobia seems to be aimed at trying  to "use foreigners as scapegoats for a problem that has its  roots in administrative inefficiency and in the weight of the  unsupportable government bureaucracy."    Hernandez recalls that a study published in July 1992 by  BUSINESS WEEK showed that immigrants in the United States  comprise a labor force that surpasses 11 million people who pay  more that $90 billion in taxes every year, much more than the $5  billion the government spends on social assistance to these same  people.    With more than 3 million undocumented foreigners in the  United States, the authorities face a problem with considerable  social and economic implications. "The authorities have every  right to regulate and protect borders, as well as to try and  restrict immigration, but they should act humanely and with  compassion," Victor Inzunza of MALDEF [expansion unknown] said.    "We, in the United States, speak of human rights violations,  but is it not a violation to deny immigrants their human  dignity?" asks Jose Serrano, leader of a group of U.S.  congressmen of Hispanic origin.    According to Izunza, U.S. authorities must understand that  the most effective method against illegal immigration is to  support the countries from which they come. "The government  should concentrate on aiding these countries to enable their  citizens to keep their families and not have to look for a new  way of life in the United States."    There should not be any arbitrary actions either, such as  the  so-called Cuban Adjustment Law, which because of ideological  differences between Washington and Havana, legal and illegal  Cuban immigrants receive preferential treatment over other  foreigners such as Haitians and Central Americans.    That law states that any Cuban immigrant who remains in the  United States for more than one year may request and receive the  work permit known as the "Green Card," a privilege that for  Democrat Representative Alan Simpson is "absurd."    The struggle against "aliens" also has its share of  political  opportunism.</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Banks press for Polish debt talks POLAND'S commercial bank creditors want to start 'constructive negotiations as soon as possible' on re-scheduling the country's Dollars 11.8bn (Pounds 6.6bn) bank debt. However, Mr Jeffrey Stockley, head of a working group of the London Club of official creditors, said in Warsaw yesterday talks would not resume until the government reached agreement with the IMF. Poland is seeking a 50 per cent cut in commercial bank debt to match the 50 per cent cut in its Dollars 33bn official debt agreed last year with the Paris Club of western governments. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, acting finance minister, said final consultations with the IMF would take place next month. Officials from the IMF talks said an agreement with Poland could be completed by the end of July, provided the IMF board accepted a Polish letter of intent.</p>

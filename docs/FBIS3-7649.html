			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Song Yong-tae, vice minister of </F> the National Unification Board and chief South delegate to the  North-South working-level delegates contact, by Hwang Chae-hong,  head of TONG-A ILBO political department, at Song's office in  the Unified Government Building -- date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hwang Chae-hong] There are  rumors that the Korean peninsula is in a crisis due to the  rupture of the South-North dialogue. What is the true nature of  this matter?    [Song Yong-tae] It is a fact that North Korea increased its  military exercises by 50 percent and that it is strengthening  air defense exercises around Pyongyang and Yongbyon. Normally  at this time, North Korea would be making a fuss in preparing  for Kim Il- song's birthday, 15 April. This year, however,  rather than concentrating on preparations for Kim Il-song's  birthday, it is exerting efforts in the production of military  supplies, such as military uniforms. North Korea is increasing  domestic tension. No special signs of military provocation have  been detected.    [Hwang] How do you analyze North Korea's ulterior motives in  making violent remarks, such as it will be ready for war?    [Song] When analyzing North Korea's intentions in detail, it  seems that this kind of remark was made as a warning to the  international community, which is showing moves toward sanctions  against North Korea. Also, this is to consolidate internal  solidarity, and assumes a psychological characteristic to  agitate the South from within. In particular, the nuclear card  is a very important strategy for its existence. If the  effectiveness of the nuclear card is diminished, North Korea has  no other alternative. Therefore, it seems that to maintain  nuclear suspicion to some degree, North Korea ruptured the  South-North dialogue and insincerely accepted inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. [end Song]    He emphasized that regardless of rumors of a crisis on the  Korean peninsula, "the people are not agitated and are able to  maintain their positions, which proves that the people's  awareness has increased and that this will act as a strong  message to North Korea."    [Hwang] Ordinarily, the content of North-South dialogue is  not made public. What was the reason for publicizing the  content of the recent North-South dialogue? Comments have been  made that making public the content of the contact may have  amplified the people's uneasiness.    [Song] As this is an issue related to the country's  security, I felt that it was necessary to let the people know  the content of the working-level delegates contact. It is in  line with the reasoning that when a fire breaks out, it is  necessary to let the people in the surrounding area know that a  fire has broken out. It was a decision made by the National  Unification Board [NUB] after consulting with related  ministries. We also considered the fact that if we did not make  public the content of the contact, there was a possibility that  North Korea might have made it public to the people first.  North Korea has a past record of publicizing the whole content  of the sixth working-level contact. [end Song]    When asked if making public the content of the contact,  which  was unprecedented, was used to achieve change in the current  situation, such as to overcome the problem of price instability,  NUB Vice Minister Song strongly said: "It is unthinkable for  the civilian- ruled government to use the reunification issue  internally." [passage omitted]    [Hwang] What is the future schedule surrounding the North  Korean nuclear issue?    [Song] It seems that a statement by the president of the UN  Security Council [UNSC] or a resolution by the UNSC urging North  Korea to accept nuclear inspections will be adopted soon. Then,  the scenario will change in accordance with how the situation  develops between dialogue and sanctions. If the situation turns  to dialogue, dialogue can be carried out between the United  States and North Korea, and between the IAEA and North Korea.  However, if the situation turns to sanctions, the intensity of  the sanctions will be strengthened gradually.    [Hwang] If UNSC economic sanctions are applied against  North Korea, many people predict that our economy will be  considerably weakened because of a sense of uneasiness. Also,  because of military tension, it seems that consumption of  national power will be great. What is the government's position  on economic sanctions against North Korea?    [Song] If a resolution is adopted at the UNSC on applying  economic sanctions against North Korea, we will agree to it. Of  course, we will open our doors for dialogue. We hope that North  Korea will respond to dialogue before sanctions are applied. We  will carry out diplomatic efforts regarding this matter.    [Hwang] People point out that we do not have a sufficient  card to lure North Korea into holding North-South dialogue.  Therefore, have we even reached the point of requesting the  United States to ask North Korea to resume North-South dialogue?    [Song] Basically, North Korea views North-South dialogue as  a political struggle, not negotiations. Therefore, if it is not  of their interest, North Korea will not respond to our efforts,  however we try. When considering such an attitude by North  Korea, we can say that we have such cards as the Team Spirit  exercise, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks, and North-South  economic cooperation.    [Hwang] If North Korea shows change in its attitude now and  agrees to receive additional IAEA inspections and shows  sincerity in North-South dialogue, will our side once again  withdraw our plan to resume the Team Spirit exercise this year?    [Song] The condition for suspending the Team Spirit exercise  is for North Korea to receive IAEA inspections and realize the  exchange of special envoys of the North and South. Since these  two conditions were not met, this year's Team Spirit exercise  will be carried out. The time for holding the exercise will be  decided upon after President Kim Yong-sam returns from his visit  to China.    [Hwang] While holding a news conference with ROK  correspondents in Japan, President Kim said that 'there are  unusual signs in Kim Chong-il's succession system.' In this  connection, what are signs that can be viewed in North Korea?    [Song] When synthesizing information obtained through  various channels, there are signs that there are problems in Kim  Chong-il's succession system. Because of this, we can sense  that there is confusion in North Korea's policy on the nuclear  issue and its policy on the South. [passage omitted]</p>

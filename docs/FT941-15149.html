			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: BBC builds on public's interest - Architecture What do opera and architecture have in common? They have both been seen as elitist and remote and both face a battle to gain public appreciation. Opera seems to be winning. There is now a vast popular interest in opera throughout the UK, which is increasingly well-served by new and improved theatres. The interest has also spawned magazines, tapes and discs and more television coverage. Much the same thing is happening to architecture. There is enormous public interest in old and new buildings and landscapes, town planning, transport and environmental concerns. The starting gate of this interest is often do-it-yourself and home improvements, but it soon runs to wanting to understand Baroque or gain a glimpse of Gaudi. At last, television has caught up with the public's appetite and last week we were offered two vastly different but significant programmes. The new series of Building Sights is set in the US. This promises to be a very enjoyable series and an important one because it demonstrates a literate, amusing and enticing approach to wonderful buildings. But worst things first. Last Tuesday's Late Show on BBC2 was a classic demonstration of how not to interest your audience in architecture. It was a significant programme because it must, surely, mark the end of the media whinge about the state of architecture and the pathetic nature of the profession's gloom. The programme was presented by Martin Pawley, whose view that it is all up for architects and that the decline in quality is largely the fault of politicians and the public, is a deeply flawed one. He continued his crusade against the sane criticisms of the public and the Prince of Wales, and seemed to want to close the architecture debate for ever. The recession was scarcely mentioned as a cause of the collapse in the building industry and the temporary falling off of building projects. Many professions have been marginalised since the Thatcher years and have had to question their reasons for existence. Architects are suffering unemployment but they also suffer from being trained to think they are gods before learning through experience that they are merely mortal links in the construction chain. These arguments were misrepresented by this one-sided programme. Many of the more ancient architects in the programme struggled to justify their terrible mistakes of the 1950s and 1960s. Will they never give up? The contempt they seem to feel for the public sends shivers up and down my spine. The BBC must surely learn from this dreadful programme that there is another way to encourage interest, concern and enjoyment in architecture. The good news is that someone in the BBC has seen the light, and it must be three cheers for the director of Building Sights, Sandra Goldbacher, and the executive producer Clare Paterson. They had the good idea of asking eight US architectural enthusiasts to look at their favourite 20th-century American building and tell the viewers why they liked them. The formula is a simple one. In the British series the atmosphere was usually stilted and cool: this series is more professional and more fun. The first programme was on that old rascal of American architecture, Philip Johnson, telling us why he loved Grand Central Station in New York. Johnson is over 80 but he was a spry, funny and sharp commentator on the passing show in the 'most beautiful room in New York'. Seeing the station (built in 1913 by Warren and Wetmore) as the belly button of New York, Johnson praised, not just the non-stop urban ballet but also the profligate sumptuousness of the station. He saw the whole place in operatic terms - and wonderful music accompanied his views. You could imagine the Lady of the Camelias coming down that vast double staircase. The glory of the station does 'give a vicarious graciousness to the ordinary man'. Grand Central is 'oysters for everyone'. Philip Johnson compared the sumptuousness and mad generosity of the station to today's thin and poverty-stricken architecture and thought that we lacked enough 'papal tyrants, insane monarchs and dictators' ever to see this sort of grand architecture again. For Johnson it was enough that Stalin built the magnificent Moscow Metro. It was a fine idea to let actress Diane Keaton show us the Ennis Brown House by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Hollywood Hills (to be shown on Wednesday January 19, BBC 2), and Jeff Koons, the kitsch artist, to show us the Hancock Tower in Chicago (Jan 26). Keaton sees the concrete Mayan style Hollywood house as one long sexual tease. It filled her with, 'prolonged, unceasing, desire'. Frank Lloyd Wright you should be living at this hour. All I need tell you about Jeff Koons and the Hancock Tower is that, in his view, 'Mozart would have had a condo on 93rd'. There are eight of these gems on BBC2 this winter - they have broken the mould of architectural programmes on television. They have done architecture a great service and they illuminate with humour. Watch them; they are also blissfully short.</p>

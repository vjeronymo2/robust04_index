			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pakistan has lodged a strong protest over Indian  President Shankar Dayal Sharma's remarks against the person of  its prime minister. Indian High Commissioner S.K. Lambha was  summoned to the foreign office in Islamabad yesterday and was  told that the assault on the person of the prime minister is not  only unjustifiable but is also against the civilized norms of  behavior between sovereign nations. The Pakistani foreign  office has also said that the campaign launched by India to  malign the Pakistani prime minister cannot misguide world public  opinion, which has openely held India responsible for the human  rights violations in occupied Kashmir. The government of  Pakistan very much regrets that the Indian president also has  involved himself in the campaign.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: In tune with nature - Gareth Hugh Davies meets a man who ensures the call of the wild can be heard loud and clear DUNCAN Macdonald, a vet and keen ornithologist, has created an immediately successful business out of his hobby. He runs Wildsounds, Britain's biggest mail order company for recorded bird song, from his home, at the birdwatcher's Mecca on the north Norfolk coast. His is an unlikely, pain-free story for a recession. First, Macdonald launched his business without recourse to his bank manager, financing it entirely out of his salary and the cash flow it generated. Then he went on quickly to achieve the sort of sales figures most small businessmen can only dream about in these grim days. In just 22 months, Macdonald has sold 2,000 of his sets of compact disc recordings of the birds of Britain and Europe at Pounds 50 each. In his first full year of trading, he showed a 25 per cent profit on turnover; he expects to do even better in the current year. Macdonald had the good fortune, as a dissatisfied consumer, to happen upon a vacant market niche waiting to be exploited. As bird watching took him to more exotic and remote destinations overseas, he turned increasingly to the tape recorder as an aid to identifying birds. But tapes were hard to find. To obtain bird sounds for a trip to Venezuela, for example, Macdonald had to write to a small company in the US. The rigmarole of international money orders almost doubled the price of the tapes. So he researched the market in bird sounds and put together the first comprehensive catalogue of all the available recordings, worldwide. Then he bought some stock and took it to the 1990 Bird Fair at Rutland Water, where he set up a table and tentatively launched Bird Recording Services. He sold out within six hours on the first day of the three-day fair. One of the suppliers Macdonald had contacted was Jean Roch, by general agreement the world's leading commercial bird-sound recorder. Roch invited Macdonald to his studios near Grenoble and offered him exclusive distribution rights in the English-speaking world. That visit gave the business (by now renamed Wildsounds) instant lift-off. For more than a year, Macdonald had the CD bird-sound market to himself in Britain. One of his mainstays was the four-CD set of European birds Roch had just released. Wildsounds's sales of the set have been phenomenal: in the whole of the rest of Europe, where there is less interest in bird watching, Roch has sold fewer than 500 sets. Macdonald grew up and trained as a vet in South Africa, coming to Britain in 1986. When he started Wildsounds, he was working as a locum vet in east London, processing orders from two rooms on the practice's premises during slack periods. With orders flooding in, he resigned his post and moved to his brother's house. His brother ran the business during Macdonald's bird-watching trips and his sister-in-law worked full-time packing and processing. Last summer, as Wildsounds outgrew those premises, Macdonald moved the operation to a house at Salthouse in Norfolk. He employs three people part-time. His start-up costs were small. He bought two computers, on which he generates the catalogue and literature that accompanies the tapes and CDs. In keeping with the conservationist philosophy which permeates his business  -he sends out most of his orders in recycled packaging - he fitted out his office with second-hand chairs, tables and filing cabinets for about Pounds 60. His biggest spending is in stock - he buys large quantities in order to take maximum advantage of discounts and can hold as much as Pounds 20,000 worth of CDs and tapes at a time. He has managed to run the business largely on cash flow 'by balancing and juggling funds'. He says: 'When I started, Roch would give me 60 days credit. I found I could sell my stock in two or three weeks. It has been running like that ever since.' Only now is he thinking of an overdraft facility to buy up stock and master discs in lines which Roch is discontinuing, to prevent them being sold elsewhere. Setting up offices in his garden is likely to be his first substantial capital expense. Wildsounds' success is based on the CD, which, with its instant access and high clarity, has revolutionised the identification of bird song and calls. When a bird sings in the garden, the listener can now rush to the CD programme a few possible tracks and identify the bird before it flies away. 'With a tape, you wound backwards and forwards, got lost and confused and then forgot the sound you heard in the first place,' said Macdonald. His customers range from dedicated ornithologists, who use portable CDs to attract and locate birds in the field, to the general birdwatcher who wants to identify birds seen from the kitchen window. He offers two 'satisfied customer' stories. Late one night in August, his solicitor heard swans flying over his house. He ran to the CD to check his hunch. It gave aural confirmation that they were Bewick's swans, one of the earliest sightings in Britain of this winter visitor. A group of Scottish bird watchers had been playing recordings to stimulate the elusive water rail to call from a reed bed, in order to assess its numbers, by playing its sound from a tape recorder. Fewer than 30 birds responded. When they switched to a portable CD player, which can be played very loud with little or no distortion or background noise, the number of water rails heard calling increased to 147. Macdonald admitted he was unprepared for the rapid growth of Wildsounds. 'We missed out walking and went straight into flying,' he said. But until the last few months, he has hardly felt the effects of the recession. One problem inherent to Macdonald's business is the small number of titles. Macdonald offers about 200. He has added many recordings of bird sounds from specific locations, and has moved into the sounds of other creatures, including whales and frogs, as well as soundscapes of particular wildernesses. (One customer told him his perfect experience was reclining in the bath listening to the creatures of the rain forest on CD.) When he takes on extra staff at Salthouse, he plans to prepare some of his own recordings from his world trips for commercial release. They have remained untouched while he has been running Wildsounds. Then he wants to re-edit some of Roch's work, and co-produce some new lines for the UK market. To test the demand for the latest technology, he has just put out the world's first mini-disc recording of birds entitled Our Favourite Garden Birds. Was it wise to make a business out of a hobby? (Ironically the business has grown to such an extent that he now has no free time to pursue the very hobby which spawned it.) He admits he has had to learn fast, for instance in obtaining redress for spoilt adverts. One problem remains. He has not found a way to make some radio stations pay for broadcasting recorded bird sound. 'Exactly the same rules apply as govern broadcast music. They would not dare do it to Madonna,' he says.

			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Taiwan acts on corruption Taiwan's cabinet yesterday passed an administrative reform plan calling for stiffer penalties for official misconduct and big rewards for those informing against corrupt officials, Dennis Engbarth reports from Taipei. The move follows a series of high-profile corruption cases that have damaged the ruling Kuomintang's standing. A recent poll of 1,145 respondents by a leading business monthly showed that over 46 per cent felt the KMT was 'unclean'. Premier Lien Chan said the anti-corruption effort will reach into all fields of government. The government will offer rewards of up to NTDollars 6m (Pounds 147,500) for information leading to conviction of a corrupt official, pending legislative approval. Officials at all levels will have to report any non-family gift worth more than Dollars 75, to the head of their ministry or agency and its anti-corruption office. The plan also mandates strict supervision and punishment of officials in 14 categories of public service, including big public construction projects and procurements by government agencies.</p>

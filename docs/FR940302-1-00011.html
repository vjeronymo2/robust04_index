			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are also proposing to add Austria to another list, this one in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;94.1(d)(1). All countries in which rinderpest or FMD has been known to exist that have been declared free of rinderpest and FMD on or after September 28, 1990, must be added to this list. Adding Austria to this list would mean that no llama or alpaca could be imported or entered into the United States from Austria unless in accordance with 9 CFR 92.435. We are not, however, aware of any llamas or alpacas in Austria that are available for export.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the proposed changes set forth above, we would make several nonsubstantive editorial changes in &sect;94.13 for the sake of clarity or to correct grammatical errors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule, if adopted, would amend the regulations in part 94 by adding Austria to the list of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD and to the list of countries declared free of SVD. This action would remove the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Austria, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of ruminants, although those importations would be subject to certain restrictions. This proposed revision would also relieve restrictions on the importation, from Austria, of milk and milk products of ruminants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Austria into the United States as a result of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1992 was about $2.0 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Austria during 1992. In fact, with the exception of a small number of cattle imported from the former Czechoslovakia, no cattle or sheep were imported into the United States from any country in Europe during 1992 (USDA, Economic Research Service [ERS], ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Clearly, Europe is not a source of ruminants for the United States, and it is unlikely that declaring Austria free of rinderpest and FMD would have any effect on the existing trade patterns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to current APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import any uncooked meat or meat products from Austria. Total U.S. meat production in 1991 (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while Austrian meat production in 1991 reached approximately 230,000 metric tons, about 2 percent of the U.S. total (USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992,'' 1992). Therefore, even if Austria exported a significant portion of its meat production exclusively to the United States, which is unlikely, the effect of those exports on U.S. domestic prices or supplies would be negligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As with the ruminants and meat products discussed above, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Austria into the United States as a result of this proposed rule. The importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Although the importation of casein into the United States is not regulated by quotas, world prices of casein are competitively set. The United States does not produce casein, but does import more than half of the casein produced in the world. The regulations currently allow casein and other caseinates to be imported into the United States from countries where rinderpest or FMD exists if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator. The United States did not import any casein from Austria in 1992 (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Declaring Austria free of rinderpest and FMD, thus removing the requirement for written permission from the Administrator, is not expected to have any effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States from Austria because the current restrictions do not substantially impede imports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from countries affected with rinderpest and FMD is restricted under 9 CFR part 98. Although this proposed rule would have the effect of removing certain restrictions on the importation of bovine semen and cattle embryos from Austria, the economic effect of this proposed rule on the bovine semen and cattle embryo industries is also expected to be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine semen and cattle embryos. In 1992, the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo imports was $4 million and $195,000, respectively, while the value of U.S. bovine semen and cattle embryo exports was $49.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively (USDA, ERS, ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1992 Supplement,'' 1992). Although it is likely that a few U.S. importers would be interested in importing bovine semen or cattle embryos from Austria if this proposed rule is adopted, the amount of each that might be imported would be minimal when compared to U.S. domestic production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; (2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this proposed rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and there are no new requirements. The assigned OMB control number is 0579&hyph;0015.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

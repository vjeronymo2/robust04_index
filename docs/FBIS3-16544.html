			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Izgarshev: "Who Has Nuclear Buttons"] </F>   [Text] "Will there be a third way?" "What will happen to  the Russian Army if the Duma approves the Ministry of Finance's  version of the defense budget?" "With whom is it easier for the  defense minister to deal -- his counterparts from remote foreign  parts or from nearby foreign parts? "Did the supreme commander  take the nuclear button with him to Sochi?..."    Russian and foreign journalists put an extremely large  number  of questions to Defense Minister Pavel Grachev at yesterday's  press conference. Perhaps the fact that it is three months  since the minister met with the press had an effect, but most  likely the keenness of the questions was caused by the acute  nature of the moment our Russia is living through now.    Everything taking place in society is visibly reflected in  the life of the troops. A tendency has emerged toward the  normalization of the crime situation in the troops (the number  of some types of gross law violations was reduced from 25 to 40  percent last year). As a whole, the fall and winter draft  proceeded in a better and more organized manner. Pavel Grachev  honestly and frankly described all of the Army's "sores" and the  main tasks that the troops are resolving.    Regarding the putsch the minister put it like this: Their  time has passed. We must work and do our job or we shall all be  left without bread. As for nuclear buttons, we have three of  them. One of the buttons "went" with the president to Sochi.  Grachev has the second, Chief of General Staff Mikhail  Kolesnikov has the third, but since he is on a visit to France  the minister has been left with the button and that is why his  previously announced visit to the Leningrad Military District  was deferred.    In conclusion, I report to readers that it is a long time  since the military from PRAVDA were invited to the Defense  Ministry. Yesterday, our correspondent was there for the first  time after a lengthy "vacation." We shall consider relations  restored.</p>

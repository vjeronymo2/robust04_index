			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Domokos Gyorgy Varga, director of the </F> National Information Office, by H.H.; place and date not given:  "Polls Apt To Influence Public Opinion"]    [Text] The validity of polling data was disputed many times  by many people who asked whether polls really reflect the will  of the voters and if so, whether voters who are still undecided  are influenced by their publication. In connection with this  matter we visited Domokos Gyorgy Varga, director of the National  Information Office, who had expressed the opinion earlier that  various polls are suited to influence public opinion.    [H.H.] In one of your earlier articles you expressed the  opinion that the Szonda Ipsos polling agency was being used not  only to poll but also to influence public opinion. As a  response, the firm brought a suit against you. Did your opinion  change at all now that one or another poll's results are being  published almost every day in certain nationwide newspapers?    [Varga] I consider the present situation unquestionably  worse. Not only Szonda Ipsos, but other agencies, as well, are  being used diligently. Through various diversions, by skillfully  presenting polling data, one of the opposition parties  represented itself as if the entire country had put its trust in  it. It would have been possible to protest, because, for  instance, the polling firm in question protested immediately  when the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] highlighted and  interpreted data according to its own taste.    [H.H.] Yesterday morning Adam Levendel, director of the  Szonda Ipsos firm, was a guest on "Chronicle" on Hungarian Radio.    [Varga] I had the opportunity to hear it, and to realize  sadly that the situation in Hungarian public media is beginning  to seem more and more absurd. Governments in democracies usually  do not allow the publication of polling data one week before  elections because the data unequivocally influences public  opinion. Recently, the BBC even included in its code of ethics  not to broadcast such data on major news programs even outside  campaign times. On the other hand, the director of the firm in  question took the liberty of not only enumerating data, but also  of picking and choosing data, interpreting it, and even of  adding his inapplicable comments. It is almost comical that we  hear about how unreliable the radio is from the programs of the  radio itself. In the words of the firm's director: From a fool  according to his folly.    But the way he treated the data is also clear propaganda. He  talked about the advance of the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ], and also mentioned the Workers' Party and the Agrarian  Alliance as having chances of getting in to the parliament.  Well, the strange thing about this advance is that according to  details published in the "most popular daily newspaper," among  voters who are certain to vote and would vote for a certain  party, the SZDSZ is in the same place today as it was in the  beginning of March, because in the meantime it had a 3 percent  setback. However, interestingly enough, the pollsters, and of  course the press as well, were silent about this setback. I did  not see huge headlines such as "X Party's Popularity Declining!"  anywhere. And as far as the Agrarian Alliance is concerned,  according to the figures it has no more support than the other  small parties. If that is so, on what scientific grounds was it  spotlighted? So much for objective information, or rather, for  manipulation.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / French shun holiday reform Four out of ten French companies will close for the summer holiday for part of July or August this year, according to official figures, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. Despite government's efforts to encourage industry to spread holidays more evenly throughout the year, thereby lessening the financial disruption caused by long stoppages over the summer, the French are still attached to their traditional long summer breaks. August is still the most popular holiday period with 50.4 per cent of workerstaking time off. July comes second with 28.6 per cent.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (17): Signs that all is not well - The impact of private banks on the economy is still very small DAVID BOGATIN, the Russian-American owner of the FirstCommercial Bank in Lublin, recently proved that being a banker in Poland requires special skills. Recently, for several anxious moments he had to harangue a crowd of anxious depositors from the windows of his head office. Using all his powers of persuasion he succeeded in calming the crowd and stopping the run on the bank which was started by newspaper reports that he was being sought by New York state for tax avoidance. But subsequent revelations about Mr Bogatin's alleged links with the Mafia and his incarceration pending extradition to the United States provide a clear sign that all is not well with Poland's private banking sector. The number of private banks grew rapidly in 1990 and 1991. There are now about 80. They benefited from the general political climate favouring the private sector which helped pressure the NBP, the central bank to issue licences where its better instinct counselled prudence. Indeed, Mr Stanislaw Bereza, formerly of Barclays Bank, who headed the NBP's supervisory section until a few weeks ago, now argues for more caution in bank licensing. 'There aren't enough experienced people in the country to run that number of banks,' he says. Western aid schemes to banking tend to bypass the private sector which needs advice on banking as much as state banks, he adds. The bank supervision department is seriously understaffed with just over 60 people to keep an eye on the 80 or so private banks. This may not yet be as serious as it seems. The impact of the private banks on the economy is still very small. They handle only 5 per cent of total personal deposits. But they also sometimes act as 'money shops' for small groups of people, Mr Bereza says. In some cases private banks have been involved in transferring funds abroad. The Art-B company, for example, is estimated to have transferred some Dollars 200m which the banking authorities are now trying to get back. The private BHK bank, recently closed down by the central bank, also helped Art-B conduct its cheque-kiting operation. (This type of operation involves drawing cheques on an account which does not have sufficient funds and banking them in a second account. The account-holder then makes use of the 'non-existent' funds in that account before the cheques can be cleared and dishonoured.) Some of the private banks, such as the BIG bank, are working to bring their capital base into line with capital adequacy requirements, and some such as the Kredytbank whose experienced staff came from the Export Development Bank, have a growing degree of in-house expertise. But western bankers in Warsaw tend to give the sector generally a wide berth, preferring to work with the established banks. 'The private sector is too small and there's no point in worrying about the risks,' says one. Indeed, it may be left to Poland's bank privatisation programme to give the sector the boost it needs. The government expects to raise 1,200bn zlotys from sales of banking institutions this year. The well-regarded Export Development Bank is expected to be sold first through a public share offer. Two other state-owned banks, the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy and the Bank Slaski, are also looking for western investors to take up to a 20 per cent share. Government policy is to retain a 30 per cent stake in these two banks leaving up to 40 per cent to be sold to the general public and 10 per cent for the staff. For the moment, though, it is up to the foreign banks in Poland to create competition for the state sector as well as training staff for Polish banks. Among foreign banks Citibank and the Dutch NMB bank concentrate on serving the larger foreign companies as well as Polish corporate clients while Amerbank, a joint venture which is in effect being run by Banker's Trust, has developed a retail banking operation to individual clients. The Austrian Creditanstalt seems to be following suit while Raiffeisen, also from Austria, is providing a mixture of services. These operations are small and some are waiting for the telecommunications infrastructure to be put into place. The foreign banks are grateful for the new state-owned Polish Development Bank, which channels World Bank and other foreign funds through to other banks, because this is helping to develop a money market. But before Poland has a full-blown private banking sector worthy of confidence it seems likely more bankers will find themselves like Mr Bogatin, having to plead from window sills.</p>

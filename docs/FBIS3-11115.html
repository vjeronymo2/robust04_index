During a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina,  who made a stopover in this capital before continuing his trip  to Laos, Prasong termed his colleague's visit as "timely in  discussing trade links."    At the same time the chief of the Thai Foreign Ministry  expressed his regrets the United States is still maintaining its  blockade against Cuba when the international scene is totally  different than in 1962, when the pressures were initiated, the  source has said.    Although Robaina's visit was not official, the local  authorities seemed interested in talking with the Cuban foreign  minister, who said: "We have come to learn and receive an  update on the economic transformation process that is occurring  in the region, of which there are matters we can learn and  assess."    Cuba has a great interest in strengthening its political  relations and trade ties with the Asian nations, the Cuban  foreign minister said.    Likewise, Robaina said a visit such as the one to Indonesia  and a passing through Thailand during the first leg of his tour  through Asia guarantee the tour's success, which began this  week. This tour includes seven regional nations.    Robaina termed as very satisfactory the results of his visit  to Jakarta, saying there are export possibilities of products  Cuba can offer, such as pharmaceuticals.    Thailand, a founding member of the organization of the  Southeastern Asian Treaty, maintains together with Indonesia an  accelerated economic growth and stands out as one of the  followers of the so-called Asian Dragons or new industrialized  nations.</p>

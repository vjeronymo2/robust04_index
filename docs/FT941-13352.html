			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / People: New Dell Euro-man Dell, the US personal computer maker which introduced direct marketing to the computer business, has named Martyn Ratcliffe, 32, its top man in Europe. As vice-president of Dell Europe, he takes the place of Bruce Sinclair, injured while holidaying in the West Indies. Sinclair, acknowledged as the architect of Dell's European reorganisation, is in the UK's Stoke Mandeville hospital, with a broken back. His injury, although serious, should not prevent a good recovery; but it will take time. Joel Kocher, Dell's president of worldwide marketing, paid tribute to Sinclair's professionalism, adding that he would return to Dell in a position commensurate with his experience and contribution. Ratcliffe was president and chief operating officer with personal computer company Zeos International; his other past experience includes president and chief operating officer of Vtech Computers, and posts with Nokia Mobile Phones. Educated at Bath University and the City University Business School, Ratcliffe's first three months at Dell will be spent immersed in its European activities.</p>

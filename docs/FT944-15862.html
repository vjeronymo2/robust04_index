			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Personal rivalries hamper Slovak struggle to form a coalition: Meciar is finding it difficult to attract political partners Boland Two weeks after its first general election as an independent country, Slovakia's byzantine political scene has yet to yield a new government. Coalition talks among the seven parties that won seats in parliament have foundered over long-standing personality rivalries concerning the country's president, Mr Michal Kovac. Mr Vladimir Meciar, whose party got most seats in the election on September 30 and October 1, is almost certain to become the country's prime minister for a third time. His Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has 61 seats in the 150-member Slovak national council, more than three times as many as its nearest rival. But so far it has failed to attract any coalition partners. Talks between HZDS and the moderate Christian Democrats (KDH), which won 17 seats, have stalled, despite Mr Meciar's offer of the foreign affairs and transport ministries. Negotiations with the second biggest party, the Democratic Left (SDL), which consists mainly of former communists, are also in limbo. Ms Brigita Schmognerova, a deputy prime minister in the outgoing government representing the SDL, says the party is 'still open' to joining with HZDS but that 'the personality of Mr Meciar is a problem'. Analysts say the biggest obstacle to an HZDS-led coalition is the party's threat to remove President Kovac from office. He was instrumental in ousting Mr Meciar as prime minister in March, amid allegations that the HZDS leader was 'abusing' the privatisation process. Mr Meciar has not forgotten the insult, and in his campaign speeches he vowed revenge. But Mr Kovac retains strong support among moderate Slovak parties. HZDS could form a government immediately by entering a coalition with the extreme right-wing Slovak National Party and governing with the support of the socialist Union of Slovak Workers. The three parties have a combined 83 seats. If no agreement can be reached between HZDS and more mainstream parties, such a coalition is likely to assume office, ushering in a period of instability. If, as seems likely, HZDS dominates the new government, it will seek to retain control of key ministries, such as finance and privatisation. This could result in a major shift in privatisation policy, a central plank of the outgoing administration's economic reforms. The departing prime minister, Mr Jozef Moravcik, revived voucher privatisation, in which Slovak citizens buy coupons they can exchange for shares in state companies. Over 1m Slovaks have registered to take part in the programme. Senior HZDS officials have indicated the programme would be curtailed if the party came to power, with many enterprises scheduled for sell-off staying in state hands. Any government's room for manoeuvre in reshaping economic policy is limited. It will have to abide by tight constraints on public spending imposed in July by the International Monetary Fund in return for a Dollars 168m (Pounds 112m) standby loan. This will leave little scope for wage rises or higher pensions, which Mr Meciar promised during the election campaign. 'Whatever the new government, it will want to retain its access to international capital markets,' says a western economic adviser in Bratislava. This is why foreign investors are sanguine about Slovakia's economic potential, despite the political uncertainty. In a report on the country in August, ING Securities urged investors to 'look beyond the rhetoric' of politicians and focus on economic realities. 'We are fundamentally positive towards Slovakia,' says Mr Jean-Christophe Ganz, manager of ING Bank's branch in Bratislava. Slovakia's gross domestic product has expanded 4.4 per cent in the first half of 1994, reversing four years of decline. Foreign reserves have climbed from Dollars 415.3m at the end of 1993 to Dollars 1.38bn on September 28; inflation is down from an annual 16.4 per cent in January to 13.5 per cent in July. Unemployment remains high at 14.5 per cent. If things begin to go wrong for the new government there is concern it might seek scapegoats among Slovakia's 560,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority. Though they have 17 seats in parliament, ethnic Hungarians remain outside the political mainstream. It is to areas such as this, as much as to his attitude to investors, that observers will look for evidence that Mr Meciar has learned lessons from his short break in Slovakia's political wilderness.</p>

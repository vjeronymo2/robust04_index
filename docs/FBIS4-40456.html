			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays by </F> unidentified correspondent on the "Topical Interview" program in  Moscow; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] The words freedom, property,  legality are written on the party's banner.    [Anatoliy Chubays] These words epitomize the essence of what  the party sees as a goal for Russia as a whole and what the  party has to offer as Russian values. [ passage omitted on  Chubays expanding on the importance of the above concepts]    [Correspondent] Anatoliy Borisovich, the party has changed  its name from Russia's Choice to Russia's Democratic Choice....    [Chubays, interrupting] Yes, there were long and heated  debates about the name. As a result, I believe a very correct  version was chosen. Many people said that we should not do that  because the word democratic had lost its attractiveness, and  many people did not respond to it any longer. But I agree with  those who argued that we should not try to recruit supporters  from among those who are not our supporters. We have a position  and a policy and our own view of things which we offer to anyone  who is ready to listen to it. Yes, we support the democratic  choice. We supported it when it was popular and continue to do  so after it has lost its popularity, perhaps. Generally  speaking, a true politician should not seek popularity, but  popularity should find its politician, the one who does not  change his position even in difficult conditions. That is why  the new name Russia's Democratic Choice appeared.    [Correspondent] Upon whom do you rely most?    [Chubays] A report at the party congress [held 12-13 June]  was devoted to just this question. We were told about a  large-scale sociological study of those who voted for the  Russia's Choice, that is, those upon whom we rely. What  transpired was that if a general image of supporters of the  Russia's Choice were drawn, it would show an educated person,  though not necessarily a doctor or candidate of sciences. It  could be a well-trained worker, or engineering and technical  personnel, aged 25 to 45-50, as a rule. This person understands  that the country and the economy are in a difficult situation;  nevertheless, he does not think that everything has collapsed  catastrophically, that life is over, and that the only thing to  do is to commit suicide. This person is inclined to believe in  himself, in his own capabilities, and has certain grounds for  this, like education, positive thinking, and so on. In other  words, this is the strata that has saved Russia and our economy  through its work. So this sociological study we were told about  is very encouraging. It shows that the party relies upon the  people to whom the future belongs.    [Correspondent] Why should a vice premier, who has problems  up to his ears, want to deal with party affairs?    [Chubays] I will not hide that I was a little sceptical,  especially looking at our numerous parties, which are  mushrooming and disappearing without having really changed  anything. I will tell you frankly that the congress itself, the  people who gathered and the serious, substantial, and committed  way the congress' real work was done had a very strong effect on  me. There were fears that it could turn into some kind of  democratic tea party, with senseless discussions of procedural  matters, like why Article Five or Six of the Charter uses a  comma instead of an and or why this wording was chosen over  another. However, it turned out that the overwhelming majority  of the people who gathered at the congress and who devoted  themselves to the cause are people who understand very well what  is really important and significant, people who are ready to  devote themselves to this work. Being fully aware that, on the  whole, this work is unlikely to be a bed of roses, and many can  even expect to be hurt because many of them have difficult  relations with local authorities, people came, nevertheless, and  people are and will be working. They have already had the  experience of last October and March 1993 and many other events  which they have lived through in Russia where they work and  live. Looking at these people, one understands that this is not  empty talk, not a ticket to an ego trip, but a real cause which  requires real strength and work. That is why I worked, work  now, and will continue this work despite all my government  duties.    [Correspondent] When do you think a breakthrough will come  and in what shape? When will the country see a better life?    [Chubays] Naturally we discussed this issue. I must say,  though, that the congress discussed such noneconomic issues as  military reform, relations with CIS countries, the  countryside--a lot of attention was paid to this. As regards  your question, there is the following view: If the policy that  is being implemented in Russia today, the government's and the  president's policy, retains a reformist component of the kind  represented by the latest package of presidential decrees,  experts from the Russia's Choice believe that there is quite a  real possibility that 1994 can become a year of stabilization  and 1995 can become a year when the Russian economy starts  overcoming the crisis.    [Correspondent] What other steps should be taken to make  reforms irreversible and then to bring if not prosperity then at  least a certain amount of well being the shortest possible way?    [Chubays] A lot has to be done. First, the legislative base  of reforms is still very inadequate, that is, the very word,  legality, we mentioned earlier. Today, unfortunately, the  largest part of economic foundation is made up of presidential  edicts, not laws. After six months of work the Duma can  scarcely credit itself with any major legislative decisions.  But this is very important because law is a kind of stable  long-term foundation on which stable economic relations, stable  investments, and so on can be built.    [Correspondent] Does the president support you?    [Chubays] One must mention that Yegor Gaydar has discussed  with the president more than once our work within the framework  of Russia's Choice. The president supports our activity, and  the party supports a reformist president, something that was  stated officially at a news conference. I am convinced that if  Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is a candidate in the 1996  presidential elections, Russia's Democratic Choice will be a  party which will unequivocally support Yeltsin's candidature.    [Correspondent] Are you going to nominate a candidate of  your  own?    [Chubays] But Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is our candidate.</p>

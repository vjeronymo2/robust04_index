			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Second-liners reach anotherrecord high Wall Street US SHARE prices continued to build on recent gains in the wake of more economic good news, with secondary stocks setting a new record high for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 17.56 at 3,266.26. Although the Dow is still more than 150 points short of its all-time peak, the Nasdaq composite rose 2.38 to 648.32, another record for the index. The broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 climbed 1.59 to 429.18, and the American composite index put on 1.35 at 392.88. Turnover on the NYSE was 207m shares, heavy for what is normally one of the quietest weeks of the year. The market is closed today for Thanksgiving. Advances led declines by 1047 to 749. Stocks surged on Tuesday on unexpectedly good economic news, which prompted hopes that the economic recovery, having been disappointingly weak for more than a year, is finally picking up. Yesterday's statistics on the economy did nothing to dispel that notion. The most bullish news came from the Commerce Department, which reported that Gross Domestic Product - the best measure of economic growth - rose by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter of this year, and not by 2.7 per cent as originally estimated last month. The figures surprised analysts, who had been expecting only a modest upward revision of the GDP number. The day's other good news included a big 9.1 per cent increase in October existing home sales, and the 12,000 drop in the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance during the second week of this month. This combined with traditional pre-Thanksgiving Day buying, and share prices advanced across all fronts. Among individual stocks, blue-chips and cyclicals continued to benefit from strong demand, although most ended off their highs for the day. International Paper climbed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 63, General Motors firmed Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 31 7/8 , IBM edged Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 65 1/4 , and Westinghouse, which has fluctuated up and down recently following the announcement of a major restructuring, rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 1/2 , aided by a ratings upgrade from the broking house, PaineWebber. Berlitz International soared Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 20 7/8 on news of an amended merger pact with Fukutake Publishing of Japan. Gap Stores fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 in turnover of 1.5m shares after the broking house, Goldman Sachs, removed the stock from its recommended list. Canada TORONTO stocks ended flat after a session of thin volumes as the market bides time until the end of Thanksgiving holidays in the US, dealers said. 'We're just moving sideways for the time being,' one dealer said, adding that fears of rate rises are also capping gains. The TSE-300 Index ended up 1.2 points or 0.04 pct at 3,260.4 on turnover of 18.3m shares valued at CDollars 222.6m compared to Tuesday's volume of 31.8 million. Declining shares led advances 300 to 264 with 286 unchanged. Eight of the TSE's 14 subgroups climbed, led by a rebound in thereal estate and construction sector.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Tokyo to consider PoW compensation payments JAPAN yesterday agreed to consider British proposals to encourage voluntary compensation payments from Japanese companies which exploited prisoners of war during the second world war. During talks in Tokyo, Japanese prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa told Mr John Major, his British counterpart, that the issue had been legally closed by the 1951 San Francisco treaty. That provided a lump sum of Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 970m) to be shared by 12,000 former British prisoners and is regarded as unacceptable by PoW organisations. However, Mr Major said Mr Hosokawa had agreed to consider 'non-government measures' to defuse the issue. Under the UK plan, companies such as Mitsubishi and Nissan, which benefited by PoW labour during the war, would donate voluntarily to a non-government compensation fund. However, the offer failed to satisfy the Japanese Labour Camp Survivors' Association, which said it would take legal action unless further progress were made quickly. British officials said agreement on voluntary compensation was unlikely before Mr Major leaves Tokyo today for a two-day visit to Malaysia. Britain accepts that Mr Hosokawa took a political risk by apologising formally for the behaviour of Japan's imperial army during the war. Tokyo's freedom of movement is also constrained by the likelihood that any agreement with Britain would set off an avalanche of similar claims from PoW organisations.</p>

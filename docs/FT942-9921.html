			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Challenge on Sinn Fein ban rejected A legal challenge to the government's broadcast ban on Sinn Fein has been rejected by the European Commission of Human Rights. The commission has declared inadmissible an application to charge the government with breaching freedom of expression, safeguarded by the European Convention on Human Rights. The challenge, mounted by seven broadcasters and journalists and one member of the public, was backed by the National Union of Journalists. The commission, which vets all applications to the European Court of Human Rights, has followed an earlier decision that the broadcasting ban was acceptable in the Irish Republic. It had been argued that the Irish ban was effectively removed in January by the Dublin government.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Declaration to fight malnutrition A world declaration expressing determination to eliminate hunger and reduce all forms of malnutrition was adopted in Rome yesterday by 1,400 delegates from 160 countries at the close of the first International Conference on Nutrition, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The ministerial conference, organised by United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation, condemned wars and civil strife as being major causes of both hunger and malnutrition.

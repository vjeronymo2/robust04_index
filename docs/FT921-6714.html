			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM defends a 'prudent' rise in PSBR  -Economy MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday further heightened expectations of substantial tax cuts in the March 10 Budget by saying Britain was in a better position than ever before to 'borrow prudently'. The prime minister's forceful justification of an increased Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) followed Labour accusations that he was back-tracking on comments last year that extra borrowing would lead to higher taxes. However, Downing Street said there was no conflict, arguing that the PSBR depends on other factors besides tax levels. Mr Major quoted comments he made when chief secretary to the Treasury in 1987 that it would be right in a recession to increase borrowing. A senior Downing Street official said the disciplines of European exchange rate mechanism membership justified the use of fiscal policy to offset the deflationary impact of using interest rates to control sterling. Expectations of substantial tax cuts as the centrepiece of a Tory manifesto for an April 9 election are now widespread. Mr Major told the Commons: 'we are now in a better position to borrow prudently than we have been at any stage in the past - to borrow prudently and maintain our commitment to a balanced budget in the medium term'. Mr Major gave his ritual assurance that he could not anticipate the proposals to be introduced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. This was brushed aside by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, who predicted that the additional money borrowed would be used to finance election 'bribes'. To Labour cheers, he called on the prime minister to explain which taxes would go up to pay for the 'bribes'. Mr Kinnock cited a Conservative pamphlet, Transforming Britain, published last year. In it Mr Major wrote: 'If borrowing takes the strain, taxes - not just our taxes, but the next generation's too - have to go up to service the debt. And inflation rises with equally calamitous results.' Last night, however, Conservative Central Office defended Mr Major's comments, saying they in fact highlighted 'the point we wish to drive home about Labour' over the need for sensible tax and spending policies. Two former Conservative chancellors, Sir Geoffrey Howe and Mr Nigel Lawson, listened from opposite ends of the Commons chamber as Mr Major recalled how between them they had reduced the PSBR. Later, however, Mr Major said that Mr Lawson's decision to cut interest rates following the 1987 stock exchange crash had been a mistake. Mr Major also reminded Mr Kinnock that the PSBR of the last Labour government amounted to 9 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product - Pounds 55bn at current prices. Mr Chris Smith (Lab Islington South and Finsbury) equated borrowing to buy votes at a general election to 'fiscal philandering of the worst kind'. The prime minister countered that the last Labour government had cut taxes in advance of the 1979 election 'on the back of a huge borrowing requirement'.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, February 14--The Indian Air Force (IAF)  is expected to induct Akash, the multi-target surface-to-air,  missile (SAM), before year end. About 75 Akash missiles are  expected to be inducted in the initial phase.    The Akash is to replace the Russian Pechora SAMs which  comprise the bulk of the IAF's air defence missile system. The  IAF has about 35 squadrons of the Pechora or SAM-III squadrons.  The Pechoras first inducted into IAF in 1974, would be ready for  a phase out in another ten years.    The indigenously developed Akash is meant to replace the  Pechora missiles. While the Pechora has a kill range of 18 km,  the Akash has an enhanced range of about 25 km. Apart from other  aspects of technological superiority, the development of Akash  saves foreign exchange.    The defence research and development organisation (DRDO),  the  developing agency, successfully test-fired the Akash on February  3. Significantly, the Akash is to be integrated with the  multi-target handling Rajendra phased array radar system which  will enhance the IAF's air defence capability.    The Akash will have a wider attack cone thereby enabling it  to neutralise more than one aircraft at a time. The concept  involves exploding the missile's warhead close to the targeted  aircraft and hitting it with shrapnels which spread in a conical  form.    The Akash and the Rajendra radar combine to provide a  state-of-the-art air defence system to the IAF. Though the Akash  has been tested on an earlier occasion, the February 3 test  marked a breakthrough in the technology of "integrated two-stage  rocket-ramjet." While a normal rocket has an inbuilt oxygen  (oxidiser) supply, the ramjet rocket draws air during flight for  combustion in conjunction with a fuel rich propellant. The  integrated rocket (booster)-ramjet (sustainer) technology has  weight and range advantages over conventional missile systems.</p>

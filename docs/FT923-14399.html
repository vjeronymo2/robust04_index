			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / UK Company News: P&amp;P turns round to Pounds 1m P&amp;P, one of the UK's largest distributors of personal computers, saw pre-tax profits shrink from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 1m in the six months to May 31. However Mr David Southworth, chairman, stressed that profits this time represented a sharp turnround - in the second half of last year P&amp;P incurred losses of Pounds 2.6m. Many people had been writing the company off, he said, 'but P&amp;P is far from dead.' However, the interim dividend is almost halved to 0.7p (1.33p). He said the company was now over the worst, though he added that in a recession where manufacturers reduced prices, the competition was squeezed. 'Vigorous cost reductions' and 'a revision of the whole cost structure' had been implemented to achieve the turnround. This resulted in the loss of almost 200 jobs, though this figure is clouded by the acquisition of ICI Computer Systems. The ICI deal - a four-year agreement whereby P&amp;P supplies the chemicals company with its PC needs - is a model for future P&amp;P partnerships. The European operations are seeing the same drop in prices and margins as the UK side, said Mr Southworth, but were reacting more quickly, because lessons had been learned. Last time's pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 2m greater but for an exceptional charge relating to a stock write-off for discontinued lines. Turnover this time slipped to Pounds 119m (Pounds 121m). Earnings shed 2p to 0.9p per share.</p>

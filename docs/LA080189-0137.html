			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOUSE HALTS BAR TO ALIENS IN CENSUS  </P> <P> In a move potentially affecting future political power of individual states,  the House blocked an effort today to bar the Census Bureau from counting  illegal aliens during the 1990 census.  </P> <P> Proponents of an amendment to exclude illegal aliens said their numbers should  not be used to determine the states' representation in the House. The  Constitution provides that the 435 House seats are apportioned among the states  based on their population as determined by the census.  </P> <P> The issue was debated during consideration of the 1990 appropriation bill for  the Department of Commerce, which includes the Census Bureau. Rep. Tom Ridge  (R-Pa.) sought to offer an amendment prohibiting the counting of illegal  aliens, but in a series of parliamentary maneuvers and votes his amendment was  not allowed.  </P></p>

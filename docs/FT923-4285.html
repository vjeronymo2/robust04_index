			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Legal advisers go on trial - Solicitors are trying to make themselves more accessible to entrepreneurs The need for an audit ensures that most business owners are familiar with accountants. But with no regulatory requirement to employ a solicitor, businessmen and women frequently regard the legal profession with distrust and incomprehension. Only 14 per cent of small businesses made regular use of a lawyer, according to a survey by the Small Business Research Trust. A further 78 per cent made occasional use of solicitors but most small business owners remained extremely cautious in their dealings with the law. 'People don't want to consult a solicitor because they are worried about the cost, the time it will take and a fear that they won't get a clear answer,' says Hugh Elder, litigation partner at London solicitors Gordon Dadds. The legal profession has responded with schemes intended to make the law more accessible to the small business owner. The Law Society runs a Lawyers for Enterprise scheme which puts business people in touch with a local solicitor and provides a free introductory half hour of advice. More than half of the questions handled by the 2,500 solicitors in the scheme relate to business start-ups. The Institute of Directors (IOD) provides free legal advice to members as part of its business advisory service. It handles about 50 legal queries a month, half relating to employment issues. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has a phone-in legal advice line which is extensively used by its 50,000 members. Small business owners may want to start their search for a lawyer through one of the directories to the legal profession. These vary in their usefulness to the business reader - some are intended more for lawyers or aspirant lawyers - but one, The Legal 500, is subtitled The Client's Guide to UK Law Firms. It lists law firms by region and by specialism. The directories may provide a start but personal recommendation probably remains the most common method of finding a law firm. It needs, however, to be backed up by visits, preferably to two or three firms, to compare the service they offer. These visits will not be charged for. 'If you don't know a firm, say you want to meet one of the partners for half an hour,' says Vincent O'Callaghan, commercial and litigation partner at the London firm of Davies Arnold Cooper. 'You will soon see if they are any good and whether they have the necessary expertise.' 'Most solicitors would be happy to talk to a prospective client so he can assess how they would handle things, who would be involved, what they would charge and whether they were the right size of firm,' explains Elder. 'If a small company goes to a large firm of solicitors, it is likely to find that its affairs are dealt with by a junior member of staff.' Large companies frequently entrust their legal affairs to several different specialist firms though most small businesses would be better off establishing a long-term relationship with one law firm. The better the solicitor knows their business, the more useful the legal advice can be. But companies should beware of keeping their legal affairs with a solicitor if the nature or scale of their business changes and their original lawyer is no longer appropriate. Finding a lawyer is only the start. It is equally important to manage the relationship. Many businesses are poor at this and end up paying too much or obtaining a less efficient service. Responsibility for dealing with the lawyers should be allocated to one person in the company, advises Elder. This might be the company secretary, finance director or, in the smaller company, the managing director. This prevents confusion over who has said what to the lawyer and means the lawyer does not run up large bills telling the same story to several different people. If the company has called in a lawyer to handle a dispute, then it is best not to make the manager most closely involved responsible for dealing with the solicitor. The manager will be too close to the issue, may want to protect his or her position and may not prove an objective intermediary. A solicitor will normally be happy to give advice over the phone if the matter is simple and all the background is known, says Elder. But it does not make sense to attempt to handle a long-running, complex issue by telephone. Messages may not be passed on to all the people involved and there may be arguments later over who said what. Better to write, fax or meet. Businessmen cannot be expected to discuss every contract with their lawyer before signing but if a deal is unusual, valuable enough to damage the company if something went wrong, or is carried out under the other party's terms and conditions, then it makes sense to check with your lawyer, says Elder. It is best to involve the lawyer at an early stage before a dispute arises or before relationships with the customer or supplier have broken down irretrievably. Businesses frequently do not provide proper instructions or proper documentation to their lawyers. The company and its lawyer need to agree a common strategy and the company must then provide all the information to help the lawyer. Trickling out documents over a period of weeks or months means the lawyer cannot take early action. Companies are sometimes reluctant to give their lawyer access to an employee who has already made a statement to the company or who works in a far-flung location. But the lawyer frequently needs to speak directly to the employee involved to find out what happened. The client must get the solicitor to provide an estimate of costs. They should agree in advance the likely overall cost or the hourly fee - though it is difficult to forecast litigation expenses - and the client should insist on receiving quarterly or even monthly bills. Regular bills not only avoid unpleasant surprises, but they are a reminder of the cost of pursuing a particular action. 'It is sometimes difficult to tell a client who has got the bit between his teeth when to stop,' says O'Callaghan. Clients sometimes forget that going to court should be the last resort and that a settlement may make more commercial sense. Finally, says Elder, don't hand over the decision-making to your lawyer. He or she is there to give advice but not to decide whether the risk of a particular course of action is worth taking. 'If you rely too much on lawyers you would never do anything,' he says.

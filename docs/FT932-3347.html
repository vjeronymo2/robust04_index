			<p>930615 FT  15 JUN 93 / New payphone for people with speech or hearing defects A PAYPHONE for people with speech or hearing defects is being tested by British Telecommunications at six sites in the UK including Heathrow Airport, Kings Cross station in London and a college for the deaf in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Alan Cane writes. The company said if the trial proved successful it would install the payphones in sites such as shopping centres and bus and rail stations. Operated by a BT phonecard, a drawer in the base of the device opens to reveal a keyboard and two-line screen. Messages can be sent either to a textphone, BT's existing screen and keyboard-based system for private subscribers, or to a human operator who will relay the message to a recipient with normal hearing.</p>

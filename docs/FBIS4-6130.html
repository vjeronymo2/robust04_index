			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- On 12 April, a delegation led by Ginowan  Mayor Seiken Tobaru called at the Foreign Ministry and the  Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] to meet Tsutomu  Hata, the foreign minister, and Eisuke Tsuruta, DFAA Chief  Facilities Coordination Officer.    In reaction to a recent helicopter crash on Futenma Marine  Corps Air Station [MCAS], the mayor strongly urged the  disclosure of the investigation reports and an early reversion  of Futenma MCAS, stressing "accidents happen repeatedly because  U.S. bases are there." In reply, Foreign Minister Hata said:  "We really understand Okinawan people's feelings. To ease the  people's uneasy feelings, we would like to continue our efforts  to meet their demands."    In addition to the mayor, the Ginowan delegation included  municipal assembly Speaker Shunshin Nakamura, Chairman Seiei  Chinen, and Vice Chairman Shinsho Chibana of the municipal  assembly special committee on U.S. base problems. Delegation  members strongly protested the accident, saying: "U.S. Forces  are continuing military exercises as if they pay no regard to  Okinawan people's anger at repeated accidents. The Japanese  Government must bend constant efforts to reversion of U.S.  bases." They then petitioned for the disclosure of  investigation reports, an immediate halt to flight training in  residential areas, and the early reversion of Futenma MCAS.</p>

For the  Commission, there was President Delors, Mr. Van den Broek and  Sir Leon Brittan. Mr. Tobin, moreover met European Commissioner  for Fisheries Mr. Paleokrassas. The Transatlantic meeting  allowed for an overview on:     -  the economic situation in the  EC, Canada and at world level;    -  strengthening Euro-Canadian  relations;    -  the prospects for NAFTA (North Atlantic Free Trade  Association);    -  APEC's role (Forum for Asia/Pacific Economic  Cooperation which held a meeting in Seattle, the United States,  in November, without Europe having been invited). Mr. Delors  said that the Community would like to have a "minor role" in  these meetings, at least as observer: Mr. Chretien said that,  given the traditional links between his country and Europe, it  was up to Canada to transmit European concerns to the APEC  countries;    -  the situation in Bosnia (Canadian troops are in  Srebrenica), Russia and Ukraine (Canada has a large Ukraine  minority).    At the specific meeting over fishing, the following subjects  were raised:    (a) ratification of the new EC-Canada fisheries agreement.  Both parties hope that the ratification will be over on both  sides sometime this year;    (b) access for Community vessels to Canadian ports, as  provided for in the new agreement (this access has been closed  since 1987);    (c) the question (raised by Minister Tobin) of European  vessels fishing off the Canadian coast under flags of  convenience.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): Bridging the savings gap INTRODUCTION TO STOCK EXCHANGE INVESTMENT by Janette Rutterford (2nd edition) Macmillan,Pounds 45/Pounds 15.99 Investment books fall into one of two categories. First, there are the basic primers, which skim across the spectrum acquainting the reader with stock market concepts and proffering practical advice. Then there are the more sophisticated investment manuals, crammed with mathematical formulae and arcane theory. Introduction to Stock Exchange Investment is one of the few books which usefully bridge the gap. The title of the book, though, is somewhat misleading. As Rutterford makes clear, her book is aimed at final-year business students. A general reader will find much of interest, but be warned: the book does presuppose a fair degree of knowledge about stock market functions and terminology. The book is divided into three parts. The first concerns the attractions and pitfalls of various classes of assets. Equities, futures, and options are covered in detail as the author delves into such delights as straddle options and hedge ratios. The second part, on investment strategy, discusses portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and efficient markets. This contains much interesting argument, although the text is heavy going. The third part consists of a straightforward overview of international investment opportunities and the investing institutions. Although it has been updated for the second edition, a few anachronisms remain. Some are minor: Hanson Trust is no longer named as such, for example. Others are more serious: some of the FT charts and tables sprinkled through the text are already out of date. The book is written as a textbook and, at times, reads like one. There are few examples drawn from real life to enliven the prose. It lacks the verve of A Random Walk Down Wall Street, which covers similar ground in a far more relaxed style. But those wishing to broaden their understanding of the practice and principles of investment will consult it with profit.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> b. The project is national in scope and provides a significant benefit to the State courts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. There is a continuing important need for the services, programs or products provided by the project as indicated by the level of use and support by members of the court community;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. The project is accomplishing its objectives in an effective and efficient manner; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. It is likely that the service or program provided by the project would be curtailed or significantly reduced without Institute support.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each project supported by an on-going support grant must include an evaluation component assessing its effectiveness and operation throughout the grant period. The evaluation should be independent, but may be designed collaboratively by the evaluator and the grantee. The design should call for regular feedback from the evaluator to the grantee throughout the project period concerning recommendations for mid-course corrections or improvement of the project, as well as periodic reports to the Institute at relevant points in the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An interim evaluation report must be submitted 18 months into the grant period. The decision to obligate Institute funds to support the third year of the project will be based on the interim evaluation findings and the applicant's response to any deficiencies noted in the report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final evaluation assessing the effectiveness, operation of, and continuing need for the project must be submitted 90 days before the end of the three-year project period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, a detailed annual task schedule must be submitted not later than 45 days before the end of the first and second years of the grant period, along with an explanation of any necessary revisions in the projected costs for the remainder of the project period. (See also section IX.B.3.h.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Application Procedures_Letters of Intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board will consider awarding an on-going support grant for a period of up to 36 months. The total amount of the grant will be fixed at the time of the initial award. Funds ordinarily will be made available in annual increments as specified in section V.C.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In lieu of a concept paper, a grantee seeking an on-going support grant must inform the Institute, by letter, of its intent to submit an application for such funding as soon as the need for renewal funding becomes apparent but no less than 120 days before the end of the current grant period. The letter of intent should be in the same format as that prescribed for continuation grants in section IX.A.2.a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Application Procedures and Format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An application for an on-going support grant must include an application form, budget forms (with appropriate documentation), a project abstract conforming to the format set forth in section VII.B., a program narrative, a budget narrative, and certain certifications and assurances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program narrative should conform to the length and format requirements set forth in section VII.C. However, rather than the topics listed in section VII.C., the program narrative of applications for on-going support grants should address:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description of Need for and Benefits of the Project.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Provide a detailed discussion of the benefits provided by the project to the State courts around the country, including the degree to which State courts, State court judges, or State court managers and personnel are using the services or programs provided by the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An application for on-going support of a package grant should explain, in addition, how the proposed projects are related; how their operation and administration would be enhanced by the grant; the advantages of funding the projects as a package rather than individually; and the disadvantages, if any, that would accrue by considering or funding them separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Demonstration of Court Support.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Demonstrate support for the continuation of the project from the courts community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Report on Current Project Activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Discuss the extent to which the project has met its goals and objectives, identify any activities that have not been completed, and explain why. An application for on-going support of a package grant must describe separately the activities undertaken in each of the projects included within the proposed package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaluation Findings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attach a copy of the final evaluation report regarding the effectiveness, impact, and operation of the project, specify the key findings or recommendations resulting from the evaluation, and explain how they will be addressed during the proposed renewal period. Ordinarily, the Board will not consider an application for on-going support until the Institute has received the evaluator's report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Objectives, Tasks, Methods, Staff and Grantee Capability.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Describe fully any changes in the objectives; tasks to be performed; the methods to be used; the products of the project; how and to whom those products will be disseminated; the assigned staff; and the grantee's organizational capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An application for on-going support of a package grant must address these issues separately for each project included in the proposed package, using the same alphabetic identifiers and project titles as in the original application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

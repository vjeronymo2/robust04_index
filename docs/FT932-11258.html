			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Europe cut down to size: Alan Cane examines the likely consequences of significant retrenchment by IBM in a leading market The gloomiest entry in International Business Machines' catalogue last year came under the heading of western Europe. In a collapse both sudden and shocking, IBM's most profitable region in 1990 had become, in only two years, a salesman's nightmare. Purchases of mainframe computers and large memory systems declined steeply towards the end of the year, contributing substantially to the computer company's Dollars 5.46bn fourth-quarter operating loss and its overall loss in 1992 of almost Dollars 5bn. This year started no better. Revenues declined by 14 per cent in Europe in the first quarter compared with a decline of only 3 per cent in the US and Asia. Europe, however, is now the world's largest information technology (IT) market with a value last year estimated at more than Dollars 150bn. For IBM, the challenge of turning its recent poor performance into an effective product and distribution strategy has the added bonus that the region could serve as a model for its global recovery. At the moment, however, IBM is chiefly concerned with trimming ('downsizing') operations worldwide to match reduced sales expectations, cutting staff and closing plants. This will be one of the first tasks facing Mr Jerome York, recently hired as IBM's new finance chief from Chrysler motor company, who has a reputation as a cost-cutter. According to Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM vice-chairman, Europe must take a fair share of the restructuring measures: 'We are downsizing ourself in all the countries in which we operate, not just those in Europe. We are trying to be even-handed in downsizing across all the geographies in which we do business, but there is no way of treating one region significantly different to another when you are trying to downsize your company.' The clear implication is that western Europe will not be treated as a special case despite the size of its market and its importance to IBM's recovery plans. So what are the likely consequences of significant retrenchment by IBM? The US company, the world's largest computer maker, is, after all, the dominant force in European IT, with total IBM sales of Dollars 25bn last year. Sales of computing services were more than Dollars 2.5bn, making it the only company with more than 5 per cent of the European market. It employs about 100,000 and operates 11 manufacturing plants in six countries. There are 12 research and development facilities, including telecommunications research at La Gaude in France and applications software development at Warwick in the UK. Four scientific centres cover topics including scientific computing in Rome and applied mathematics in Paris. The first signs of IBM's retrenchment in production are evident. Some 10,000 jobs are to go in western Europe this year, 2,600 of them in manufacturing. The company has in the past three months formally abandoned its time-honoured policy of setting up identical manufacturing operations in the US, Europe and Asia. Mr Kuehler said: 'The trade-off from manufacturing in three regions is that you can carry out development and manufacturing in the countries you serve. But it leads to excess capacity which in today's world, we cannot afford.' Four European plants - Havant in the UK, a division of the Montpellier installation in France, Valencia in Spain and Jarfalla in Sweden - have been told they are only to remain open as 'independent business units' run by their local managements. If they do not make a profit in 12 months they will close. IBM's cool appraisal of the viability of its European plants is a break with its recent past. For two decades the company has tried to show that it is a 'good European' with local roots. It has lobbied, often successfully, to be allowed to take part in research programmes aimed at improving the quality of European technology. Its rigorous attention to detail has helped improve the quality of the output of European components suppliers. Will, therefore, retrenchment damage Europe's technological infrastructure? Mr Michel Carpentier, director-general for IT industries at the European Commission, does not think the danger should be overstated. He says there is no sign that IBM intends to reduce its investment in Europe in a heavy-handed fashion. The emphasis on downsizing might be a good omen for Europe's small and medium-sized companies which could compete in software and systems engineering without the need for heavy investment. He is concerned, however, that manufacturing might be transferred to developing countries with adverse consequences for jobs in Europe. Industry observers also play down the threat. Mr Glenn Cuthbertson, vice-president and services director at the Gartner Group, a US consultancy, sees IBM's downsizing as a form of creative destruction: 'It will release in Europe a lot of poorly used assets,' he says. 'We are not witnessing the break-up of a successful company. We are seeing the coming apart of a very inefficient producer of IT goods and services. It should be a net plus for the European economy.' As for IBM's sponsorship of academic research, the view is that a dash of realism can do nothing but good. 'Some of those guys,' one executive said, 'did not know that IBM is a commercial company.' An important factor is that Europe seems at last to be set for growth in computing. According to Mr Dennis Exton of Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage house, the European IT market will grow by 6.8 per cent in 1994 compared with a forecast of 4.3 per cent this year. A result will be that good ex-IBM staff will have no difficulty finding jobs. Mr Cuthbertson argues: 'IBM is already seeing a level of attrition that it does not want. It is losing bright young salesmen with two or three years' experience who are going off to work for competitors. In a couple of years there will be a substantial rebalancing of resources. In this coming decade the factor limiting growth of the IT industry will be the availability of skilled people.' Mr Cuthbertson is among those who believe that IBM could bounce back quickly in Europe. IBM depends heavily on mainframe sales for its profitability and Europe has few large mainframes. There are perhaps only 200 very large mainframe sites in Europe compared with at least 1,000 in the US. How, then, have IBM and other US mainframe manufacturers found Europe so profitable? By charging more for mainframes and disk memories in Europe than in the US. The cost of a unit of computing power was typically 34 per cent more in Europe than in the US through the 1980s. Then as the competitive pressures grew, IBM threw away the price book. In February, it launched 18 mainframes but did not publish a single price. That was left to negotiations between the buyer and IBM's sales team. The result has been a price war between IBM and companies making machines of similar design - chiefly the Japanese companies Fujitsu and Hitachi and the US company Amdahl in which Fujitsu has a stake. In the past two years the European mainframe market has suffered from the effects of both the recession and the price war. The damage has been widespread. Mr Rolf Brillinger, managing director of Comparex, a German computer company which markets mainframes made by Hitachi, snapped exasperatedly: 'These companies will have to consider whether it makes sense continually to cut prices. It is forcing them into losses and reducing the resources available for research and development.' Comparex, owned by chemicals giant BASF, saw profits after tax halved last year. The positive side of the coin is that without a substantial legacy of mainframe systems to be maintained and supported, Europe is ready to migrate quickly to information systems based on smaller, less expensive mid-range computers. The move would benefit smaller companies that have so far found mainframe computing too costly. It could also benefit IBM; it has the products and the services staff to help customers install and run them. Mr Cuthbertson of Gartner says: 'If IBM focuses on a mid-range strategy and gets it right, it could rebound quickly in Europe.'  ------------------------------------------------        IBM EUROPE: A MODEL FOR RECOVERY?  ------------------------------------------------ UK  ------------------------------------------------ 1992  ------------------------------------------------ Turnover Pounds 3.75bn (down 6 per cent) Loss Pounds 616m Principal sites: Greenock, Havant, Winchester  ------------------------------------------------ GERMANY  ------------------------------------------------ 1992  ------------------------------------------------ Turnover DM13.8bn (down 6.8 per cent) Operating profit DM272m Loss DM443m Principal sites: Berlin, Mainz, Sindelfingen  ------------------------------------------------ FRANCE  ------------------------------------------------ 1992  ------------------------------------------------ Turnover FFr36.7bn (down 7 per cent) Operating profit FFr2.4m (before restructuring costs) Principal sites: Montpellier, Corbell-Essonnes,                  La Gaude  ------------------------------------------------ ITALY  ------------------------------------------------ 1992  ------------------------------------------------ Turnover L8,500bn (up 1.5 per cent) Operating profit Not available Principal sites: Rome, Santa Palomba, Vimercate  ------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: Israeli banks post advance at interim stage ALL BUT one of Israel's four main banks have reported sharply improved net profits in the first half of 1992. The exception was Bank Mizrahi which the government earlier this month agreed to sell to an Israeli businessman in a deal intended to begin the long-delayed process of divesting the state's majority states in all four big banks. The agreement to sell Bank Mizrahi to Mr Gad Ze'evi, who owns the small Maritime Bank and other private businesses, requires the approval of the Knesset finance committee which this week delayed a decision while it reviewed the price of the deal. Mr Ze'evi agreed to pay Dollars 100m for a 26 per cent stake in Bank Mizrahi, the smallest of the four leading banks. He has an option to purchase another 25 per cent for a further Dollars 85m and, meanwhile, will be able to exercise the votes of government shares sufficient to give him majority control. If the deal goes through, it will mark a breakthrough in the government's efforts to sell off the bank holdings it acquired for Dollars 7bn to rescue the banks from a share price collapse in 1983. Under a share preference arrangement, control of the banks was left in the hands of the original owners. But government shares will have full voting rights as soon as they are sold back to the private sector. The bank sale process is seen as a test of the government's commitment to reducing the state's role in the economy and as an important fund-raising project, but it has been dogged by delays and setbacks for the past three years. Bank Mizrahi, to date controlled by the Mizrahi world religious Jewish organisation, lagged behind its larger competitors in performance over the first half. Net profits were Shk26.6m (Dollars 11m) compared with Shk24.9m last year. Israel Discount Bank, previously owned by the Recanati family of Tel Aviv, did best, posting a 57.6 per cent rise in net profits to Shk49.7m, thanks to improved revenue from financing activity at home and profits of Dollars 8.5m from Israel Discount Bank of New York. Continued losses in its New York subsidiary dragged down profits at Bank Leumi, controlled by the Jewish Colonial Trust, but it still posted a 35 per cent increase to Shk81.7m. The biggest of the four, trade union-controlled Bank Hap-oalim, reported a 29 per cent rise in net profits to Shk111m.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television Last week Michael Parkinson looked forward with keen anticipation to the start of a new series of Rab C. Nesbitt and was surprised when I did not share his enthusiasm. Had I never been stuck in a lift with a drunk Glasgow football supporter, he asked. Yes, I said, I had, and while that was merely unpleasant, this series was unpleasant and also packed with incomprehensible dialogue. Somehow the attractions of drunkenness combined with stupidity and aggression seem to have passed me by. But since Mr Parkinson is far from alone (the yobbish Scot is now regarded as such a draw that the cover of the current Radio Times is devoted to him) I will have another look (9.00 BBC2) and try to plumb the hidden depths. Earlier on the same channel viewers in the south-east get a regional programme, First Sight (7.30) about British quarantine regulations being relaxed under EC law and the prospect of '70 rabies free years' coming to an end. The way some of the British talk you would think that people in continental Europe were dying like flies from rabies. Actually the chances of dying in an air crash are much higher.</p>

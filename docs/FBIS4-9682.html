			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry [International] Economic  [Relations] Directorate is seeking to increase exports of  services, enhance the NAFTA negotiations, and explore new  markets in Asia and other parts of the world.    This was reported by attorney Juan Salazar, the  International  Economic Relations director, who gave a broad description of the  Foreign Ministry International Economic Relations Directorate's  guidelines.    Salazar reported a substantial increase in the sale of  Chilean services abroad, specially transportation and software  sales, among other lines.    As an example, he mentioned that last year our country  exported services worth $3.2 billion, which represents 40  percent of our country's exports.    Salazar believes this Chilean impetus toward the world  requires that entrepreneurs and the private sector conform to  the new international requirements. He said it is necessary for  executives to be more aggressive and penetrate new markets in  other parts of the world like Asia, specially China and  Malaysia. He said:    [Begin Salazar recording] We have tried to tell them about  this new emphasis. For example, we have strongly mentioned  Asia. There are new programs that [former International  Economic Relations director] Jaime [Lavados Germain] already  mentioned like market (?intelligence) and our country's image.  There are negotiations that we will have to conduct.    We also talked about NAFTA. We talked about countries  outside our region, outside Latin America. We talked about  services, which is a very important area. Instead of using a  meaningless phrase, let's say that this is our second phase.  [end recording]    To implement these programs, for example, PROCHILE  [Institute  for Export Promotion] currently has 35 offices which it plans to  increase to 200 across our country. Juan Salazar said a new  entrepreneurial attitude is required. He said:    [Begin Salazar recording] There is a discrete deterioration  of the Chilean export process. Some people want to blame this  problem on the exchange rate, for example. As international  trade increases, I believe Chile will be facing increasing  competition. We have to refine both the state instruments and  the private sector actions in order to face this competition.  [end recording]    He said it would even be desirable if PROCHILE were  privatized.</p>

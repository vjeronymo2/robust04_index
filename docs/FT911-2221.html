			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Equities: Maxwell breaks monopoly with Pounds 245m offer MIRROR Group Newspapers, the UK newspaper publisher controlled by Mr Robert Maxwell, yesterday broke the monopoly of US companies offering equity to international investors. MGN is raising Pounds 245m in total, with 78.5m shares or 40 per cent of the offering being placed internationally, more than the 30 per cent previously anticipated. Salomon Brothers has underwritten the international tranche and is leading a group of international banks on the deal. Shares were priced yesterday at Pounds 1.25 per share, giving the company a capitalisation of Pounds 501m (Dollars 837m). Mr Maxwell will retain a 51 per cent holding in the company. At the issue price, the company has a notional dividend yield of about 7 per cent. Salomon expects strong demand from international investors attracted by the high dividend yield. As an equity market sector, US newspaper publishing firms trade on a dividend yield of about 3 per cent. In addition to anticipated buying from US institutions, Salomon said yesterday that there were early expressions of interest from Swiss and German investors. Elsewhere, Duracell, the US battery company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is expected to price its 25m share offering later today. The size of the issue has been increased from 20m shares, and now 5.625m shares will be offered internationally via Merrill Lynch. The indicated price range has been increased from Dollars 12-14 per share to Dollars 15-16 per share. There is no sign of a slackening in the pace of medium-sized US companies filing share offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For example, Viacom, a media and communications company, filed for an offering of 9m shares on Friday, 1.8m of which will be placed internationally via Morgan Stanley. The issue will raise Dollars 285m in total. Supply of convertible bonds also continues in the international market. On Friday, Chubb, the US insurance and development group, came with a Dollars 250m seven-year convertible bond issue lead managed by Morgan Stanley. The bonds carry a coupon of 6 per cent and the right to convert into Chubb equity at a Dollars 86 per share, a conversion premium of 24.4 per cent over the Dollars 69.8 share price when the deal was launched. However, the company's share price had slipped back to Dollars 67 yesterday and the bonds were trading at 97.5 bid, having been launched at par.</p>

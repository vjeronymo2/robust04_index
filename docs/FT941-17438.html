			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: A seamless transition to the new year - New York After plodding ahead for most of the year, it was somewhat ironic that Wall Street finished 1993 with a flurry. The final hour of trading brought a wave of program-related selling, and an 8-point gain in the Dow industrials was transformed into a 21-point decline in minutes. If the swing seemed to presage a more mercurial tenor for 1994, the first day of trading in the new year brought reassurance. Blue-chip stocks were inching ahead yesterday, resuming the steady course that characterised the market through most of last year. Analysts generally anticipate a seamless transition from 1993 to 1994. In contrast to years past, there were no flights of euphoria in the waning days of December, when investors traditionally load up on their winning positions and pick up bargains among under-achievers. A 35-point jump in Dow Jones Industrial Average last Monday 'its biggest gain since July ' may have whet appetites for a strong year-end rally. But true to current form, the advance was followed by two miserly days when the Dow added just fractions of a point. The road became rockier on Thursday when the US Treasury market, after weeks of resilience, suddenly grew skittish on news of a burst in new-home sales. The inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond took a pounding. In turn, the Dow dropped 18 points, and a further 21 points on the last day of the year. Bond prices weakened further yesterday after the National Association of Purchasing Management revealed a strong December composite index, and equities were again constrained. Nevertheless, the Dow could very well reach the 3,800 level for the first time ever in the next few days. One of those who takes this view is Mr Laszo Birinyi, a Connecticut-based market strategist, who says the focus on the fixed-income markets has been overplayed. 'The bond market really has been a very convenient excuse. When we want to ignore it, we do so.' He believes the cautious optimism that helped the market last year will continue to push stocks forward in the early part of 1994. 'The market must accept the importance of faith at this point,' he says. Mr Birinyi sees more steady gains across the board, with particular improvement in some of consumer non-durable issues, such as Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products, which have largely been overlooked in recent months. Mr Greg Nie, technical analyst for Kemper Securities in Chicago, agrees that the market will maintain a positive bias. He says the it should survive the first quarter without a big correction, but he sees stocks as growing increasingly vulnerable as the quarter progresses. 'The market will have a tough time handling mistakes. Any surprises - whether political or economic - will cause problems,' he warns, citing a string of technical danger signals. His theory may be put to an early test Friday, with the release of December non-farm payroll figures.</p>

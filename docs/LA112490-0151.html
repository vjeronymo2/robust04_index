			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KITCHEN HELP;  </P> <P> KEEPING DRAINS DRAINING AND GARBAGE DISPOSALS DISPOSING  </P> <P> The holiday season usually is the busiest time of the year in America's  kitchens. It's also the time most kitchen drains get clogged and garbage  disposal systems need fixing.  </P> <P> Here are four tips from Roto-Rooter Corp. to avoid problems:  </P> <P> Don't put banana peels, carrots, celery or other hard-to-grind fibrous waste  into your garbage disposal.  </P> <P> Always run water for 20 seconds before and after using the unit, and never  start it with a full load of garbage.  </P> <P> Never try to sharpen disposal blades by putting in items such as broken glass,  marbles or bones, which can damage the unit.  </P> <P> Avoid putting any grease down drains. It builds up a coating on pipes, which  leads to serious clogs. Put grease into a container and place with the trash.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Perovic, leader of the Liberal </F> Association of Montenegro, by Slobodan Rackovic; place and date  not given: "Montenegro Is Occupied!"]    [Text] Slavko Perovic -- founder and leader of the Liberal  Association of Montenegro [LSCG], 38-year-old lawyer from  Cetinje, 100 percent Montenegrin, one of the most frequently  denounced politicians in former Yugoslavia, robust and  courageous as a lion, eloquent as Demosthenes -- is a man whom  you do not have to like or agree with, but you have to respect  him. The same is maintained by many of his political opponents,  even enemies, who breathlessly listen to his debates in the  Montenegrin Assembly and other state bodies. Journalists flock  to his news conferences, while those who dare not do that are  most happy to have the opportunity of interviewing him.... This  is the first time he has given an interview to DANAS, which, to  his regret, is not on sale in Montenegro, but he manages to get  hold of a copy through Slovenia from time to time.    [Rackovic] What is the argument the LSCG uses to justify the  attitude that the LSCG is the strongest opposition party in the  republic? The pro-Serbian National Party in the Montenegrin  Assembly holds one seat more than your party (the liberals have  12 out of 85 seats).    [Perovic] We have 20,000 registered members, an enviable  figure for a state with 630,000 inhabitants, and some 400,000  voters. Our membership is still growing, and that is a rather  puzzling fact for us. Besides, at the latest undemocratic  elections in December 1992, the ruling Democratic Party of  Socialists [DPS] literally arranged the votes in the way that  best suited it -- 16 percent of votes to us, 17 percent of votes  to the National Party -- in order to build its central position  on the unprecedented grounds -- on the national [word  illegible]. The LSCG now holds 26 to 30 percent of the  Montenegrin political market, which is an extraordinary  advancement. Besides, I remind you that in Montenegro it is  only our party's members who have been facing the street  barricades, it is only our rallies that have been undermined.  The police and the press have been paying most attention to our  party, which clearly speaks for our objective strength, rather  than the advantage in the Montenegrin Assembly. However, if it  comes to the extraordinary elections, like those that happened  in Serbia, we do not expect a victory of the Montenegrin bloc.  The DPS still has its secret police, spies, the media...  through which it can easily control public opinion. However,  the next time the DPS will have to agree to give more number  seats in the Assembly to the LSCG, so that no government can be  formed without the liberals.    We would not go for forming any coalitions in the elections,  we simply want to contribute to the stratification of the  so-called Montenegrin opposition bloc. All of us who belong to  that bloc see Montenegro as a Mediterranean, European country,  as an open society with unlimited private ownership, which is to  say, we see it as a modern, liberal capitalist country. Our  allies in the Assembly -- the Social Democratic Party of  Montenegro -- vary in their orientations, ranging from the model  of confederation up to the model of sovereign Montenegro with  the social-democratic system, by which they are hopelessly  trying to manipulate the feelings of the Montenegrin citizens,  who are still pining for the former, socialist Yugoslavia, not  realizing that the former Yugoslav leadership actually planned  and brought about the bloody disintegration of the union of the  south Slavs.    [Rackovic] If you attain power, what will be your attitude  toward the former Yugoslav republics?    [Perovic] We will recognize all the states that have  developed from the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia], within their AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of  National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders. The principle of  the unchangeability of borders is undisputable for us, and if  that principle happens to be annulled, the region of former  Yugoslavia will be open for war and catastrophe. As for the  reintegration of Yugoslavia in terms of as it used to be, we do  not even think about that, because we think it is hypocritical  even to use that word. Simply, former Yugoslavia cannot be  restored upon hundreds of thousands of graves. We think that  each former Yugoslav state should be recognized, international  recognition should be made possible for them, and we should  leave it to time and the will of each of those states to decide  whether they will go for the reintegration following their  interests, or not. I would like to stress once more that I  refer to the reintegration in terms of joint interests, rather  than reintegration into a joint state.    [Rackovic] Belgrade simply does not allow Montenegro to  cooperate with Croatia, Italy, and Albania. Some incidents have  even been fabricated, like the one near Debeli Brijeg, by the  border with Croatia.    [Perovic] Well, it is well-known that Montenegro is an  occupied state in which there are 60,000 Serbian soldiers, while  the lovely Montenegrin coast has been the place with the  greatest concentration of naval forces and equipment.... Which  is to say, we have been definitely under occupation. However,  within that occupying force there is a lot of people who in  their hearts support the policy of the LSCG. That trend in the  Yugoslav Army is still active. That is not so great a surprise,  because it is obvious that the entire state mechanism is falling  apart, that is, a metastasis of the idea of the FRY [Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia]. Nobody can halt that process, not even  Slobodan Milosevic, and his tanks and aircraft. In the entire  situation Montenegro has a great chance to accomplish its  historic goal in a peaceful way -- the independence that  Montenegro enjoyed for centuries.    [Rackovic] Jevrem Brkovic [Montenegrin poet, opponent of the  Montenegrin regime] claims that Montenegro cannot accomplish  that goal without bloodshed.    [Perovic] Using the opportunity to express my sincere  regards to my friend Brkovic, I pray to God that he is not  right. I think that weapons should be put aside. We must not  allow bloodshed in Montenegro, because in the first place it  would be directed against the interest of the Montenegrin  people, regardless of who would eventually win. That victory  would do to us much more harm than good, so we are doing  everything we can to convince our members and supporters that  the way to the sovereign and independent state of Montenegro  leads only through a referendum. We are absolutely convinced of  our success.    [Rackovic] Belgrade, however, is constantly putting pressure  on Montenegro by inciting the chauvinist Serb circles in Boka,  Zeta, and Vasojevici, which reminds one very much of the prewar  situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Perovic] In Montenegro there are no such tensions as were  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The great Serbian design has been  politically defeated in Montenegro. Simply, it takes time for  that defeat to reflect itself among the people. It is precisely  those pitiful rallies in Boka, Zeta, and Vasojevici, having  amassed a miserable number of troublemakers, that best speak for  my being right. These are desperate moves, a consequence of the  fact that the supporters of the great Serbian policy are losing  their hold on Montenegro. Those rallies are organized by people  whom the locals call Montenegrins from Terazije [a district of  Belgrade]. Those are Belgrade's hirelings, and the interest of  Belgrade is much more important for them than their own interest.    [Rackovic] Your old theory is: Not an inch more of  Montenegro, not an inch less.    [Perovic] That is right. We accept Montenegro within the  existing borders, with which we are completely satisfied. For  us the issue of Prevlaka has never been a problem. It is a  fictitious problem that was supposed to justify the shameful  raid on Dubrovnik. The issue of our borders with Croatia can be  settled only through negotiations between the sovereign states  of Croatia and Montenegro, provided, of course, that both states  are interested in that. As early as at the beginning of the war  in Dubrovnik, a delegation of the Croatian Parliament came to  Podgorica, and proposed the settlement of the Prevlaka issue  through bilateral talks, but the Montenegrin officials, being  Milosevic's marionette, went for the option that was supposed to  settle some mythical relations of theirs, rather than some real  Montenegrin relations, because of which Montenegro is still in  such a difficult position. I repeat, the issue of Prevlaka was  invented as a justification of the great Serbian territorial  claims. However, that does not justify those Montenegrins who  set so many houses on fire in the region, and killed the people  there. Behind every single crime there stands a concrete  person. And one day they will have to take the consequences for  what they did. For a long time Montenegro will be paying for  its thoughtlessness, for its having attacked Dubrovnik and its  people, who were our friends for centuries. When the  Montenegrin borders were proclaimed administrative, we protested  against that, because we understood that is the introduction to  a war. We did not manage to influence the course of events, but  we still did a lot to make the Montenegrin citizens understand  in time what a ploy it all was, and to diminish in this way the  immense tragedy of Dubrovnik.    [Perovic] We are now making efforts to improve relations  with Croatia, and to make the border crossing at Debeli Brijeg  completely open, which also applies to all the border crossings  to the neighboring countries. Being occupied in such a way,  fettered, driven into this quasi-state, we have no chance. We  have to find a way to apologize to Dubrovnik and Croatia for  what we did there. After all, even before the war started we  had established excellent relations with the Croatian  Social-Liberal Party [HSLS], then with the Slovene liberals,  with the Muslim Bosniak Organization and the liberals led by  Rasim Kadic in Bosnia- Herzegovina, with the liberals led by  Stojan Andov in Macedonia, and in Serbia with the parties of  Nenad Canko, Vesna Pesic, while we still cooperate with Vuk  Draskovic, regardless of his nationalism.... Despite the war,  we have managed to maintain those relations, to my great  pleasure, while with Drazen Budisa's HSLS we have even managed  to improve those relations.    [Rackovic] You do not recognize the FRY, and you call it the  so-called FRY.    [Perovic] I feel about the FRY that it is a result of a  great deceit, and war-mongering policy. From the point of view  of law and politics, it is a farce, which is best shown by the  fact that even last year we celebrated the Day of the Republic  on 29 November [the day when AVNOJ Yugoslavia was established in  the Bosnian town of Jajce], a holiday of the republic that does  not exist any more! Jajce is not to be found in that state any  more, it is devastated and burnt down. That is an example of  hypocrisy unprecedented in the history of mankind. The  authorities in Montenegro announced a referendum (which was  boycotted by the democratic opposition), at which the citizens  had to state their opinion about the future of their fatherland.  Let me not remind of the fact that only seven days passed from  the day when the decision on the referendum was made, to the day  when the referendum eventually took place. The question was so  ambiguously formulated that the government could not but win.  Or, for instance, one man voted for entire families, or even  for his entire village. It was an incredible farce, so today  many people come up to me and apologize for having voted for the  federation of Montenegro with Serbia, that is, for the FRY.    We do not want to live in that state, because when we look  at  Belgrade, we understand that Serbia is politically contaminated,  that it will take decades for it to be politically  decontaminated. For a long time it will be impossible to  establish Serbia as a lawful, democratic state with a European  orientation. We want to leave the union, because Montenegro  still has a considerable chance to get away, and to win  international support. Of course, we do not demand the life of  a single soldier for Montenegro, we do not demand intervention  by either NATO or anyone else. We also do not want our people  to get killed for Montenegro, but we have to clearly express our  political will, and to bring Milosevic to a halt: either he will  send tanks to kill us, or he will eliminate the most  distinguished Montenegrins with the help of his secret police.  Yet, tyranny will solve nothing here, and I am happy to assess  that the movement for independent Montenegro has grown so strong  and huge that nobody can halt it any more. The situation is  exactly the opposite: The greater the pressure that Belgrade  puts on us, the stronger the people's awareness of the need for  the Montenegrin state to become independent.    We are proposing to the authorities that they examine public  opinion now, precisely two years after the referendum, but they  persistently refuse to do that, fabricating with the help of the  media a monstrous lie that, in the case of the liberals'  victory, a civil war will break out. We say that there will be  no war, because for a war two parties are needed, whereas for  carnage a single one will do.</p>

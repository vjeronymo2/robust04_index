			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Tycoon with a disdain for cash - Taikichiro Mori Fabulous wealth apparently amounts to nought for Mr Taikichiro Mori, the Japanese property developer who was named this week by Forbes magazine as the world's richest businessman. He acknowledged the announcement with a short, self-effacing statement that a land-price spiral had probably exaggerated his riches. Mr Mori, 88, is worth an estimated Dollars 13bn (Pounds 6.8bn). Most of that money is built into the 82 buildings owned by his private company, Mori Building; little of it has trickled down to the self-consciously simple habits of the tycoon, who brings a lunch box to work. The alcohol-free Mr Mori lives in a modest but comfortable apartment in an upper-class area of Tokyo. He listens to classical music, watches sumo wrestling, drives a Nissan not a Rolls-Royce, and wears a hakama, a traditional pleated skirt, on the three days a week that he now goes to the office. He and Hana, his wife, had an arranged marriage in 1932 and rarely eat out. The executive work of Mori Building is gradually being handed down to their two sons. Having accumulated his buildings over 33 years - continuing the family landlord tradition - Mr Mori has a dislike for the younger Japanese speculators and their dedication to the accumulation of money, imported luxury cars and French impressionist paintings. While many speculative empires have crumbled in Tokyo over the past year, the cautious Mr Mori has survived in the face of the property-market downturn. The enigma of Mr Mori and his generation of postwar executives is that such regard for Japanese tradition is combined with an eagerness to bulldoze over the past. Many Mori buildings stand on what used to be one of Tokyo's more colourful districts, full of craftsmen and small merchants. Views differ over whether he has efficiently modernised an ageing city or cemented over its character. Along with his industrial contemporaries, Mr Mori's disdain for money is balanced by a remarkable ability to create and accumulate wealth. Like the founders of Honda, Matsushita Electric and YKK, the world's largest zipper company, Mr Mori has contempt for fancy financial engineering, and faith in the virtues of 'making things' and 'contributing to society'. 'I became sceptical about receiving unearned income from the renting business. But it was explained to me that, while profits are important, it is more important to contribute to society and make people happy. We will gain profits in accordance with the degree of the contribution,' he explained in a recent autobiography. His desire to contribute grew naturally out of a Japan devastated by the second world war. There was a shared conviction that the defeated country must be rebuilt, physically and spiritually, and there were significant opportunities for those property developers able to convince small landholders to sell in the interests of modernisation and the new Japan. Mr Mori took over the family business in 1959, inheriting 5,000 sq m of real estate. He left an academic career that had included a specialisation in sericulture, or silk production, and a post as professor of business studies at Yokohama City University. The academic background gave a sense of intellectual distance from the struggles of other developers, and his sophisticated manner helped convince small property owners to take the money or trust in his vision, or both. Having studied the volatile Japanese textile market during the early 1950s, Mr Mori concluded that companies attempting to make money by exploiting price fluctuations tended to go bankrupt, while those concentrating on the quality of their product were less vulnerable. 'It is the same in urban development and building management. First you think about creating a good environment, not about making money from the land. And once you have started, you can't stop half way. You must believe in your success,' he said. His first 45 office buildings were named by their numbers. Number 1 Mori Building was followed by Number 2 Mori Building, although the nomenclature has since become more creative. He explains that the buildings are 'children', in the tradition of Number One Son and so on. The time taken to complete a project, he says, equals that of childhood - from the first negotiations to the christening of one complex takes about 20 years. Mr Mori believes that construction and redevelopment are a god-given responsibility. It is his belief in this responsibility that has driven an otherwise humble man to impose his will, and his architectural taste, on Tokyo. The semi-spiritual sense of vocation, along with the 'build a strong Japan' nationalism, has been an important source of economic motivation. It is in evidence at YKK, where the corporate slogan is 'Cycle of goodness', spreading prosperity to all, and at Matsushita Electric, with its 'Human electronics for the benefit of mankind'. Cultivated from a blend of Buddhism and Confucianism, this type of value system is not burdened with reservations about the importance of money as a commodity, but regards the relentless pursuit of money itself to be as destructive of character as excessive drinking or obsessive womanising. But vaguely defined 'goodness', 'happiness' and 'prosperity' do not explain how Mr Mori managed to deal with the often brutal Japanese gangsters and their demands for protection money, or to argue with his bankers over interest rates. Nor does it explain the lack of remorse at closing down a district's last kimono maker to create space for Number 36 or Number 37 Mori Building. 'In building a new city, the trust of the small landowners is indispensable. You could compare this developer-owner relationship with that between a man and a woman,' he said. 'In order to survive in a severe environment, you must contribute to society by making a superior management plan that others can recognise. We should show them the reason for our existence, then we can feel proud.'</p>

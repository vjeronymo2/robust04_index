			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Government seeks early signal of tour group failures THE GOVERNMENT is to seek early warning of tour operator collapses by asking insurers if they are refusing to trade with particular holiday companies. The move follows the disclosure that General Accident stopped taking policies from Land Travel, the failed coach tour operator, some two days before the Bath-based company went into liquidation last Friday. The collapse left about 50,000 people who had booked holidays with the company with no prospect of recovering their money. General Accident, the Perth-based insurer, said yesterday that it withdrew Land Travel's authority to issue policies at 5pm on July 22 after the company stopped a 'fairly substantial' cheque due on that day. It was still owed 'a substantial amount of money' by Land Travel, the insurer said. The government also undertook yesterday to look again at the detail of proposals to improve protection for holidaymakers. A European Community directive that makes bonding compulsory for tour operators is due to be implemented on January 1. Defending the government's attitude to last week's collapse, Baroness Denton of Wakefield, a junior trade and industry minister, held out no hope of compensation for those affected but said her department would 'continue to monitor the situation carefully'. In a letter to Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour consumer affairs spokesman, she acknowledged there was always 'a difficult balance' to strike in deciding whether or not to investigate a company's financial affairs. 'There is the risk that knowledge of an investigation by my department could undermine confidence and exacerbate a company's problems,' she said. Baroness Denton admitted the DTI had not been aware that one of the principals of Land Travel had previously been a director of a travel company which had gone bankrupt. Her comments were seized on by Mr Griffiths, who claimed that the government's monitoring of companies in trouble was 'almost non-existent'. 'The government's hands-off approach has left the field wide open for the Arthur Daleys of the travel world,' he said. 'My concern is that if another Land Travel goes bust next week, a number of people will end up in exactly the same position.'</p>

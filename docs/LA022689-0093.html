			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVICES SECTOR GOES HIGH TECH TO STAY AHEAD OF GLOBAL RIVALS  </P> <P> Ask your insurance man a tough question about your policy these days and you're  likely to get a long answer in short order. If Bill Pfordt has his way, you'll  get a complete computer printout, too.  </P> <P> F. William Pfordt, director of computer systems at Philadelphia's Provident  Mutual, is planning the company's third-generation computer system, to be  installed in a year or so. He envisions the day when every field agent will be  able to work out all the financial and actuarial details of a policy within  minutes by tapping into the company's electronic data bank with a portable  laptop computer.  </P> <P> "We all realize now we're in a fight competitively for our lives," said David  Mahan, Provident's director of policy services, whose 800-member staff is  closely wedded to Pfordt's computer bank so that it can generate continuously  updated information about every policy and every client on the company's books.  </P> <P> What is happening in the insurance business is happening in newly competitive  service industries across the board.  </P> <P> At the beginning of the decade, it was the U.S. manufacturing sector that first  felt the lash of global competition. But now the economy's huge service sector,  responsible for more than 70% of the country's economic output and about  three-fourths of all jobs, is well along toward a radical restructuring.  </P> <P> Signs of this are everywhere. Automated teller machines on every other downtown  street corner make 24-hour bank services commonplace in most cities. Travel  agents equipped to calculate the cheapest and most direct air fares And  routings with the flick of a computer key also make and confirm hotel  reservations worldwide.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Becoming More Useful  </P> <P> Arnold &amp; Porter, Washington's largest law firm, is busily redefining and  expanding what a lawyer can do for a client, offering real estate and financial  management, market research and public relations counseling.  </P> <P> Laser scanners have speeded supermarket checkout lines for 10 years, but  industry leaders are now using them to track selling patterns, control  inventory and provide store managers with a complete database from which to  plan orders.  </P> <P> For manufacturing industries, the payoff of modernization is already clear.  Manufacturers, particularly of durable equipment, have rebounded so thoroughly  from the productivity slump of the inflation-ridden 1970s that increases in  output per hour since 1981 have outstripped the legendary productivity record  of the 1950s and 1960s.  </P> <P> Between 1981 and 1987, according to the Labor Department, manufacturing  productivity soared 4.8% a year, compared to a growth rate of 2.8% from 1948 to  1973.  </P> <P> Yet by official measures, productivity in the services sector lags. In the  aggregate, the Labor Department says, services productivity advanced only 1.2%  a year between 1981 and 1987, substantially short of the 2.6% annual growth  rate from 1948 to 1973.  </P> <P> Stranger still, the productivity record is poorest for some of the service  industries -- such as financial services, insurance and retail food marketing  -- where new techniques and technologies have led to improvements that are  obvious to any client or customer.  </P> <P> By some measures, productivity of insurance companies and supermarkets has  actually declined over the past 15 years or more.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult to Measure  </P> <P> But tell that to managers at Provident Mutual or Washington's Giant Food, and  they will stare at you in bewilderment. They know that they are operating more  productively, and they have balance sheets to prove it.  </P> <P> One cause of the apparent contradiction lies with the way productivity is  measured in the services sector. For manufacturers, it is easy to count the  number of widgets produced per man-hour. And it is even possible to take into  account the quality of the widgets.  </P> <P> "To improve productivity in manufacturing, it's obvious enough that you  substitute a machine for a person," says David L. Birch, a one-time  Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who runs a consulting firm in  Cambridge, Mass. "But what do you do to improve service productivity?"  </P> <P> Apparently, you do not do what the insurance industry and supermarket business  have done. By one measure -- value added per person employed -- productivity  among insurance agents declined by 0.4% a year from 1979 to 1987. And  productivity declined about 0.1% a year for retail food stores.  </P> <P> "The insurance industry seems ideally suited to the data-handling capabilities  of modern computers," Brookings Institution economist Martin Neil Baily has  written. It is "implausible," he argues, that the insurance industry should  show up as unproductive as the statistics suggest.  </P> <P> As for the grocery business, Baily observes that the advent of the supermarket  after World War II boosted productivity substantially. But "we could only  invent the supermarket once," he says, and the supermarket so raised  productivity that future growth was difficult to achieve even though the range  and quality of products and the ease of shopping for them have continued to  improve.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problems With Standards  </P> <P> In fact, most successful supermarket operations, such as Giant, have  deliberately added personnel to their retail stores -- and therefore, by  definition, made them less productive -- in the interest of providing better  quality service to customers. That has more than offset streamlining in the  inventory and management ends of the business.  </P> <P> But if measurements of insurance industry and supermarket productivity do not  square with what seems to be going on, the fault may lie with the measurements.  As Baily of the Brookings Institution concedes, there are serious problems with  the standards used to measure exactly what it is that many service industries  produce.  </P> <P> Should the output of a school teacher be measured by the number of students in  the class? Should the output of a government worker be measured by the number  of memos that move from the in-box to the out-box?  </P> <P> Harder yet are measurements of quality. When is one supermarket twice as good  as another? What makes one insurance policy twice as good as another?  </P> <P> The dollar value that society attaches to services might provide one means of  measuring them. But University of Maryland economist Mancur Olson argues that  the value of many services simply cannot be "brought under the measuring rod of  money."  </P> <P> Money, by Olson's reasoning, is not an adequate measure when an insurance  company improves the quality of service to its customers. Nor does the price of  food reflect the added attractions of a food store that offers customers an  opportunity to buy a wider variety of goods more quickly in a more pleasant  setting.  </P> <P> Regardless of how productivity is measured, service companies make management  decisions to improve the product, increase market share, speed up profits --  whatever meets the competitive needs facing the industry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Efficiencies Aren't Visible  </P> <P> Giant's management team, operating from unpretentious company headquarters in  Landover, Md., have other objectives than improving their formally measured  productivity as they seek to dominate the grocery business in the Washington  area.  </P> <P> "If anything, we are today more labor-intensive in all our stores than we have  been in years," says Alvin Dobbin, senior vice president for operations. Most  Giant stores have been adding behind-the-counter butchers, fresh seafood, salad  bars and ready-to-cook specialty foods.  </P> <P> The efficiencies are behind the scenes: in the automated warehouses, the  in-house production of dairy and bakery products, a radio-controlled trucking  fleet and the computer-linked central inventory control system. Yet the  government statistics that measure productivity show that the supermarket  industry has one of the worst records in the services sector.  </P> <P> Department stores, by contrast, show improving productivity.  </P> <P> "But have you tried to buy anything in a department store lately?" Dobbin asks.  "There's nobody to help you find what you want, and when you find it there's  nobody to buy it from."  </P> <P> At Provident Mutual, an old-line, middle-sized life insurance company that  recently abandoned a wooded campus in a posh Main Line suburb for a sleek glass  tower in Philadelphia's regenerate downtown, the company's main object these  days is to improve services to old customers and devise ever more flexible  insurance products to attract new customers.  </P> <P> That is the point of the computers, the newly experimental telephone service  call with the electronic simulated voice that reads out the status-to-date of  each client's account, the laser printouts, the laptop computer each sales  agent is urged to carry.  </P> <P> "Even 10 years ago," says Pfordt, "we couldn't do any of this."  </P> <P> In the insurance industry as with supermarkets, official productivity is  lagging. But with Provident, as with Giant, the services being offered are  succeeding in the one place that counts -- the marketplace.  </P> <P> "If you're going to measure the service sector by productivity," consultant  Birch says, "and the future of America is supposed to hinge on that, then you'd  better eliminate the best hospitals, the best schools, the best newspapers --  because none of these is productive if you apply an industrial standard."  </P></p>

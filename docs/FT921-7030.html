			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: South American problems lift copper and zinc prices COPPER AND Zinc prices rose strongly on the London Metal Exchange yesterday following news of wildcat strikes in Chile and supply problems in Peru. Analysts thought prices of both metals were likely to continue rising in the next few days. Copper for delivery in three months, which yesterday reached Dollars 2,237 a tonne, its highest level for two and a half months, could jump by another Dollars 100 a tonne, driven up by technical factors, they said. In Chile the world's biggest underground copper mine, El Teniente, owned by the Chilean Copper Corporation, was hit by a protest against the weekend sacking of 150 miners. About 2,000 of El Teniente's 9,500 employees downed tools for an hour to demand the their colleagues' reinstatement. The stoppage affected production at the mine, the crushing and concentrating plant, and at the Caletones smelter. Union leaders were due to meet today to consider further action. The protests were sparked by Codelco's attempts to impose a voluntary redundancy scheme to reduce overmanning. The state-owned company says it wants to shed 800 workers at El Teniente by mid-year. But Mr Jose Donoso, a union leader at the mine, said Codelco was victimising miners who had been ill in the past. 'Workers are being forced to take the redundancy package. The scheme is not voluntary at all,' he said. El Teniente's refined copper output in 1991 totalled 278,765 tonnes, about 25 per cent of Codelco's total. The mine was also hit by pay strikes last year. Production has declined in recent years because of the exhaustion of reserves and rock bursts that have closed down important sections of the underground tunnels. Meanwhile, Peru's biggest zinc refinery, Minero Peru's Cajamarquilla, declared force majeure on metal shipments. It said output was being cut by power rationing. Cajamarquilla raised production last year to 93,000 tonnes of zinc from 60,964 tonnes in 1990 when Minero Peru suffered a two-month strike and frequent electricity cuts. Power supply problems are caused mainly by attacks on electricity pylons by the Shining Path, an extreme left-wing guerrilla group. On the LME zinc for immediate delivery closed last night at Dollars 1,120 a tonne, up Dollars 11.50, while three-month metal was Dollars 1,139.50 a tonne, up Dollars 12. Copper ended Pounds 16.25 up at Pounds 1,277.50 a tonne for spot metal while three-months metal was Pounds 13.50 ahead at Pounds 1,298.75 a tonne. Analysts suggested that copper's reaction to potential supply problems was reasonable in that stocks were low and falling on both the LME and the New York Commodity Exchange. However, zinc stocks were likely to go on rising.</p>

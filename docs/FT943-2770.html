			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Policy change a threat to home owners Sir, Your report, 'Plan to base mortgage benefit on 'standard' interest rate' (September 14) raises a number of issues. In December 1991 the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the government took a number of initiatives to help solve the problem of rapidly increasing mortgage possessions and arrears. Since that time the number of possessions has fallen by more than 35 per cent. A key policy change was the agreement of the government to make the payment of income support direct to mortgage lenders rather than to unemployed borrowers. In the knowledge that income support would be paid direct, lenders agreed not to take possession in cases where mortgage interest payments are covered by income support. Mortgage lenders generally currently adhere to that agreement. However, it will not be possible for them to do so if, as reported, income support payments are made on the basis of a 'standard' interest rate which is less than the mortgage interest due. Under those circumstances no borrower claiming income support will be in a position where their interest payments are covered by the Department of Social Security. The inevitable result, in what now seems likely to be a period of rising interest rates, is an increase in the number of arrears and possessions, with consequent increased pressure on the government's social housing budget. There is no getting away from the fact that, having encouraged people out of public rented accommodation into home ownership, the government is now considering cuts which will pull their hearth rugs from under them. For many, losing their job will mean losing their home if income support for mortgage interest is cut back. Andrew Longhurst, chairman, Council of Mortgage Lenders, 3 Savile Row, London W1X 1AF</p>

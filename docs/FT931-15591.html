			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Tomkins ahead in spite of sales fall TOMKINS, the conglomerate, yesterday reported an 8.2 per cent increase in earnings per share in the last set of figures before it includes Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling baking and grocery product group it acquired last month. Earnings per share in the six months to end-October grew 8.2 per cent to 4.87p and pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 43.75m to Pounds 47.07m. The interim dividend is to be increased 12.1 per cent to 1.805p. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said that the earnings increase was the product of 'pure organic growth' and demonstrated Tomkins ability to grow without acquisitions. The six-month period had been 'one of the toughest six-month periods we have ever had in Tomkins', Mr Hutchings said. Nevertheless, nearly half its companies had managed to increase profits in spite of these recessionary pressures. Mr Hutchings said little about the integration of RHM other than that it was 'a great opportunity to develop the profitability of a company that has lost its way'. The group expected to end up with net cash in the bank after the RHM acquisition. At the end of the reporting period and before the bid, Tomkins had Pounds 184m of net cash. Mr Hutchings was cautious about economic recovery even in the US where a number of its companies, particularly in the industrial products division, performed well. The overall operating profit rose to Pounds 39.01m from Pounds 37.04m on sales 3.2 per cent lower at Pounds 575.5m. The sales reduction was partly due to the stronger dollar and partly because Tomkins was controlling the level of activity on both sides of the Atlantic. This in turn meant operating companies were returning cash to the centre, allowing interest income to rise 51 per cent to Pounds 6.29m in spite of falling rates. Recreational vehicles and bathware helped the industrial products division to Pounds 14.75m of operating profit, a 33 per cent increase. Operating profits of Pounds 9.20m, in fluid controls, and Pounds 7.44m in services to industry were both down, although margins were more or less maintained. Professional, garden and leisure products were marginally ahead at Pounds 7.63m. Lex, Page 18</p>

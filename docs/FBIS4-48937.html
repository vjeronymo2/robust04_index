			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- To relax the strained  telecommunications situation and make it easier for people to  get information, China is quickening steps in constructing a  34,000-km first-class optical cable telecommunications network  connecting all of the country's provincial capitals.    China has set an ambitious target for telecommunications  construction in its eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), that is,  building 22 national-level trunk lines of optical cable within  five years, to connect all the provincial capitals.    Assessed from present achievements, China is moving smoothly  towards this goal.    So far 11 of the 22 optical cables have been opened, of  which  eight cables were opened in 1993. This year the construction or  remolding of 15 optical cables is being successfully carried out.    Experts said that, compared with traditional  telecommunications means such as electrical conduits and  microwave relays, optical fibers made from quartz glass have far  more advantages. For example, a pair of optical cables with the  thickness of a hair can provide thousands of digital telephone  lines simultaneously.    China began to study optical fibers and related equipment in  the early 1970s. In the 1980s China built the first two optical  cables, the Wuhan-Nanjing and Lanzhou-Xining lines.    China's construction of optical cable has witnessed  surprising development since 1990. In the past few years China  opened the trunk lines of Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Fuzhou,  Fuzhou-Guangzhou, Beijing-Jinan-Nanjing,  Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, Guangzhou-Haikou, Guangzhou-Nanjing,  Zhengzhou-Xian, Xian-Chengdu and Chengdu-Kunming, and the  submarine optical cable connecting China and Japan was also  opened last year.    Presently China is intensifying the construction of a number  of optical cables including the first-class trunk lines of  Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin, Nanjing-Kunming, Xuzhou-Zhengzhou and  Xian-Lanzhou.    To ensure successful construction of telecommunications  projects, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has  decided to put 53.6 billion yuan into fixed assets this year,  compared with a 40 billion yuan investment last year.    China's optical cable construction speed is said to be the  fastest in the world--most of the cables have been finished in  about one year from laying the cable to installing equipment.    The 2,800-km optical cable along the south China coast runs  through five provinces and cities and was constructed and opened  in only one year.    Another example is the 4,700-km Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin  optical cable, whose construction was started last October. To  date, the laying of cable has basically been finished. The  total construction term for this line is predicted to be only  eight months.    Construction of optical cable has greatly promoted the  development of China's posts and telecommunications. Statistics  show that in 1993 alone long-distance automatic exchanges  increased by 548,000 lines, bringing the total capacity to 1.06  million lines, while newly-increased long-distance  telecommunications lines reached 200,000, bringing the total  capacity to 420,000 lines.</p>

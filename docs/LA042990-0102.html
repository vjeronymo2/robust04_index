			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN CLINCHES SOFTBALL TITLE WITH SWEEP  </P> <P> The Cal State Northridge softball team secured its ninth consecutive California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. title Saturday by sweeping a doubleheader from UC  Riverside at Lady Matador Field.  </P> <P> Overall, Northridge pounded out 21 hits -- including four doubles -- and  pitchers Debbie Dickmann and De Dow held Riverside to 10 singles as the Lady  Matadors claimed their eighth undisputed conference championship in the past  nine years with 3-1 and 7-0 wins.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors have won 11 of their past 12 games and 10 conference games in  a row.  </P> <P> Northridge, which has four conference games left, holds a four-game lead over  Cal State Bakersfield, which has concluded conference play. Third-place Cal  Poly San Luis Obispo is five games behind heading into a doubleheader today at  CSUN.  </P> <P> In the first game, Dickmann surrendered six hits and struck out six to improve  to 20-7, and Erin McGuire went two for three with two runs batted in.  </P> <P> Dow (8-5) scattered four singles in the second game to record her fifth shutout  of the season, and Lisa Erickson went three for three with an RBI and two runs  for the Lady Matadors (40-18 overall, 15-1 in conference play).  </P> <P> UC Riverside threatened briefly in the fourth inning of the opening game,  trimming an early CSUN lead to 2-1. But Erickson scored on McGuire's single in  the home half of the inning to provide the final margin.  </P></p>

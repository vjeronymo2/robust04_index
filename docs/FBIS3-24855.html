The change of program is due to the  absence of UN Special Representative in Angola Alioune Blondin  Beye, who leaves for Cote d'Ivoire where he will attend the  funeral of Cote d'Ivoire President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who  passed away on 7 December 1993. UNITA Information Secretary Dr.  Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who is also attending the Lusaka  talks, says the sides have decided to discuss a less  controversial topic. Dr. Valentim says the sides might discuss  the future role of UN Angola Verification Mission-3. Meanwhile,  Alioune Blondin Beye is scheduled to return from Yamoussoukro  after the burial of the historic leader of the Ivorian  revolution on 7 February. Meanwhile, UNITA and the government  reached an agreement yesterday on the composition of the  national police. Dr. Valentim described the agreement as  important.</p>

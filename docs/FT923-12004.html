			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Boutros Ghali attacks EC peace plan: Letter underlines doubts over usefulness of Lord Carrington's efforts A SHARP exchange between Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, and Lord Carrington, the European Community's mediator on Yugoslavia, has underlined the growing doubts about the usefulness of the EC's peace efforts. The disagreement is likely to fuel the arguments of those, such as France, who want the EC peace conference to be expanded into a wider international forum under the umbrella of the UN. Following the abortive ceasefire agreement reached by the three warring factions in Bosnia under Lord Carrington's presidency in London last Friday, Mr Boutros Ghali has criticised both the EC for failing to consult him and the UN Security Council for endorsing the EC's ceasefire plan. In a letter addressed to Security Council members on Monday, the UN secretary-general also expressed 'serious misgivings' on the substance of the plan, the most important element of which was its provision for placing the heavy weapons of the combatants under UN supervision. Mr Boutros-Ghali's main complaint was that the UN was given too little time to implement the plan. He said no UN representative had participated in the London talks and he was not aware of the EC seeking any technical advice from the UN before the agreement was concluded. Moreover, Mr Boutros-Ghali said he had told Lord Carrington by telephone last Friday that the EC proposal on UN peacekeeping duties was 'not realistic'. 'I now find myself in the invidious position of having to advise the Council on the implementation of a mandate behind which the Council has already thrown its political support,' Mr Boutros-Ghali said. Though the Security Council endorsed the London agreement last Friday, the plan drawn up by UN officials has not yet been approved by the secretary-general. The UN secretary-general's criticisms appear to have taken Lord Carrington completely by surprise. When he told Mr Boutros-Ghali of the London peace deal, the UN chief said he was 'absolutely delighted', Lord Carrington said in a radio interview yesterday. Mr Boutros-Ghali's outburst clearly reflects the frustration he feels at the inadequacy of the resources put at his disposal in Yugoslavia and his irritation with the lack of understanding by EC and Security Council leaders of the practical difficulties involved in putting their political decisions into effect. As far as UN officials are concerned, such difficulties could be avoided if the whole peace negotiations were handled by the world organisation. Lord Carrington yesterday said he was 'discouraged' after Yugoslav and Serbian leaders rejected an international conference on Kosovo, the mostly ethnic Albanian province in southern Serbia, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. After talks in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, Lord Carrington said he was 'increasingly worried over these last few months about Kosovo'. He went on: 'President Milosevic said he was very willing to negotiate with the Kosovans, although he did not think there was much to negotiate about because they have all their human rights under the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). But he was not prepared for a conference in which the EC peacekeeping conference was involved on the grounds that it was purely a Serbian matter which affected their sovereignty.' However, Lord Carrington was encouraged that leaders from Krajina, self-proclaimed Serb regions of Croatia which are now UN peacekeeping zones, had agreed to negotiations on their status without making independence a condition.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;How the disposition of civil money penalties will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented to assure that money collected by the State is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used appropriately;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What State costs are included at proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.230(j)(6)(ii);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether a priority would be assigned to the items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the State's use of civil money penalties (such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as, relocation of residents and resident reimbursement); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How resident reimbursement would be accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These questions raised by the commenters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues that need not be addressed through the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory process. The Act permits each State to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its own procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter supported the application of civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties as specified in the regulation; however, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter was concerned that this provision conflicts with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this party's State constitution which requires all civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forfeitures to be placed in the State's school fund. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter asked which provision takes precedence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Medicare and Medicaid are Federal programs,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so when a civil money penalty is collected as an enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action because a participating SNF or NF is out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the Medicare or Medicaid requirements, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal regulation takes precedence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters recommended amending proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.230(j)(6)(iii) to include the reimbursement of lost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident property. A few commenters suggested replacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``including'' at &sect;488.230(j)(6) with the words ``such as.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 1919(h)(2)(A) of the Act specifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that civil money penalties collected by the State be applied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the protection of the health or property of residents of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing facilities that the State or Secretary finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficient. We believe the Congress intended that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include the State reimbursement of a resident for personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property and funds lost at the facility as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions by the facility or by individuals used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to provide services to residents. We are revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We accept the suggestion to replace the word ``including''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the word ``such as'' in the paragraph that discusses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of civil money penalties collected by the State. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revision does not alter the meaning of the provision, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does provide needed clarity. The Act, as referenced above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enumerates certain specified activities for which a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected civil money penalty may be used; however, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not an exhaustive list. As long as the intended use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds may be said to relate to protecting resident health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property, it is not necessary that each use of the civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty be expressly stated in the regulation. Using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the words ``such as'' more precisely conveys the intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision and allows the State to have flexibility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining what activities relate to protecting residents'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health or property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.444&blank;Settlement of Penalties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters said that the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision at proposed &sect;488.230(k) does not offer guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on how civil money penalties may be settled and that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is no control over the States' or Secretary's discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A consumer organization commented that granting States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete discretion to settle cases whenever and however  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they choose undermines the effectiveness of civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties. They added that this regulatory provision opens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the door too wide for parties interested in not paying fines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make inappropriate deals with decision-makers and avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for their noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested deleting this regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision, and a few commenters specifically suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section be deleted in accordance with their changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed at &sect;488.230(e) which provide for settlement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a facility pays the civil money penalty that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed (less the 35 percent), and corrects the deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which led to the penalty, within 10 days of receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We cannot accept these comments. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority provided HCFA or the State to settle any case at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any time prior to a final administrative decision, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified at redesignated &sect;488.444, is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other regulatory provisions pertaining to civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties. Regarding the comment that this provision opens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the door for decision makers to make deals with providers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we contend that the survey, certification and enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is built on a system of integrity and implements the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary controls to assure that this integrity is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained. To remove this provision, as suggested by a few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, would deny providers the opportunity to promptly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settle their cases. We believe that the suggestion to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settle by deducting 35 percent from the civil money penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the deficiencies which led to the penalty are corrected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 10 days does not allow a facility enough time to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a decision regarding whether to waive or request a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the provision in redesignated &sect;488.436 deals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically with a provider waiving its right to a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Redesignated &sect;488.444 provides the opportunity to settle a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, even if the hearing right was not previously waived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision was incorporated into the regulation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest of resolving disagreements at the stage in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process before sizeable expenditures of time and money are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devoted to hearing procedures. Even if a hearing had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested, if, before the proceeding, all parties can reach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement over the deficiencies to be corrected and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty to be paid until corrections are made, costly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings procedures can be avoided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A commenter requested that press releases and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a notice to the long term care ombudsman accompany  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settlement, and if the civil money penalty was imposed as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of a complaint investigation, notice should be given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the complainant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not accept this comment. Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(g)(5) and 1919(g)(5) of the Act provide for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure of information regarding inspections and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities of skilled nursing facilities and nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. Survey and certification information, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes but is not limited to statements of deficiencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans of correction and appeal results, is available to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public. The regulation at &sect;488.325 expands disclosure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include among other things, notice of SNF or NF  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance and adverse action(s) imposed to the long term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care ombudsman. Existing State survey agency procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that a notice be sent to the complainant informing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> him or her of the disposition of the allegation. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain that the present methods of disclosure used for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance situations provide ample opportunity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public awareness, and we do not believe that any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefit is derived by having separate disclosure procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for those cases in which civil money penalties are used as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy (see discussion for &sect;488.325 Disclosure of results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of surveys and activities).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

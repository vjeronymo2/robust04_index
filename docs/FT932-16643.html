			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Women managers 'fare worse outside London' COMPANIES outside London are significantly less likely to employ female managers than those in the capital, a survey of directors and personnel managers in England has found. More than a quarter of companies outside London said they employ no women at all at managerial level, compared with about a tenth in London which had no female managers. In only 10 per cent of organisations throughout the country were half of all managers women. Women remain rare in the boardroom too. More than 70 per cent of companies in the survey have no female board members. In manufacturing companies women are less likely to be in managerial positions. Less than 3 per cent of manufacturing companies have half of managerial positions occupied by women, compared with nearly 15 per cent in service-sector companies. The survey of more than 200 companies, carried out by the Select employment agency, shows that companies set up since 1979 do not hire or promote more female managers than longer-established organisations. The survey also found that far fewer companies are planning redundancies this year. In the last two years half of the companies surveyed cut staff, compared with only a tenth who plan to do so this year. Salaries were found to be falling in line with inflation, with less than a tenth of companies reporting that they intend to give pay rises above the rate of inflation this year.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Dollar hits 2-year low against D-Mark The US dollar slipped to fresh lows against the D-Mark and the yen yesterday amid pessimism about the outlook for US financial markets. The US currency touched a postwar low of Y96.35 and a two-year low of DM1.4845, before recovering to close in New York at Y96.86 and DM1.4972. Most analysts believe the dollar will fall further, and said the rally from yesterday's lows was the result of technical factors rather than any shift in investors' view of economic fundamentals. Traders have blamed the recent weakness in the dollar and the US Treasury bond market on the belief that the US Federal Reserve was acting too slowly to combat inflation. On Monday, the long US Treasury bond yield closed above 8 per cent for the first time since 1992, leading to weakness in European bond and equity markets yesterday. European markets finished above their lowest levels for the day. Nevertheless, German government bunds and UK gilts dropped about three-quarters of a point. In New York, the 30-year Treasury bond had receded a further  1/32 of a point by late yesterday and was yielding 8.043 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 4.71 lower at 3,850.59.

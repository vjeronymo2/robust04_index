			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Multipart turns in Pounds 1.5m in maiden results since rescue Multipart, the UK vehicle parts distribution company rescued from the collapse last year of Daf, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, achieved a net profit of Pounds 1.5m on a turnover of Pounds 48m in its first trading period, the five months to the end of December, 1993. It has long-term supply contracts with the three manufacturing businesses salvaged from the former Daf group, namely LDV, the Birmingham-based van producer, Leyland Trucks, the Lancashire truck assembler, and Daf Trucks, the Dutch heavy truck maker. Multipart said that it was seeking to expand by winning additional logistics contracts both inside and outside the motor industry. The company is investing Pounds 5m in computer systems. Multipart was rescued by a management buy-in team led by Mr Alan Simpson, former managing director of Land Rover Parts, with the backing of Pounds 17.3m in equity capital provided by Phildrew Ventures, the UK venture capital arm of Union Bank of Switzerland, and a Pounds 20m long-term loan from National Westminster.</p>

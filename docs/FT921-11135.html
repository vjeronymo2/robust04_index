			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Italian elections called for early April ITALIAN President Francesco Cossiga dissolved parliament yesterday and called general elections on April 5 and 6, Reuter reports from Rome. He said in a televised speech he had decided to call early elections because the present parliament was 'politically exhausted'. Mr Cossiga confirmed that the four-party coalition government, led by Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti, would remain in office until the new parliament convened. At the 1987 elections the Christian Democrats won 33.9 per cent of the votes, to 27.4 per cent for the Communist party, now called the Democratic Party of the Left. The Socialists, the Christian Democrats' largest partner in the coalition, polled 12.6 per cent.</p>

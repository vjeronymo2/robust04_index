			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Reagan Thought Sudan Was </F> an Asian State Neighboring India; Explosive Dialogues Between  al-Turabi and U.S. Envoys to Khartoum"]    [Text] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- Melissa Wells, the  special U.S. envoy to Sudan, yesterday left Khartoum for  Washington concluding a three-day visit to the Sudanese capital  during which she met with a number of Sudanese officials  including [President] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, to  whom she delivered a message, and Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah,  speaker of the Transitional National Assembly (parliament).    The visit coincided with significant military victories for  the government forces against the rebels in southern Sudan, in  which the government forces recaptured the city of Kajo Kaji and  12 other cities and villages.    It has been reported that the U.S. officials who now visit  Sudan have begun to change their old threatening tone and talk  about improvement of relations.    A highly placed Sudanese source has told AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI  that the change of tone came after heated and explosive  dialogues between these envoys, including Assistant Secretary of  State Pelletreau, and President al-Bashir and Dr. Hasan  al-Turabi, the well-known Islamic figure and secretary general  of the Arab and Islamic People's Congress.    The source said that in one of these dialogues Dr. al-Turabi  told a U.S. envoy that by pursuing a course hostile to Sudan and  its Islamic government and by criticizing the application of the  Shari'ah [Islamic law], the United States is moving into  quicksands dangerous to it and its interests.    Dr. al-Turabi made that remark after the U.S. envoys  expressed concern about Christian human rights in Sudan and  about violation of human rights and implementation of the  Shari'ah.    The source added that Dr. al-Turabi told one of the U.S.  envoys that Sudan is concerned about the violation of black  rights in the United States and about the persecution of  American Muslims; and that he reminded him that the white  Americans had killed all Indian males and taken their women  prisoners, and that what Sudan is doing now to preserve its  territorial integrity was what George Washington did when he  liberated the United States and safeguarded its territorial  integrity.    Dr. al-Turabi told the envoy that some U.S. officials did  not  even know what Sudan was, so why this hostile attitude toward it?    He added that when he was foreign minister he once met  President Ronald Reagan during President Numayri's visit to the  United States, and he made great efforts to explain Sudan's  location to President Reagan who thought it was adjacent to  India.    The highly placed source said that Dr. al-Turabi protested  strongly when President Bill Clinton received the British author  Salman Rushdie, who is of Indian origin. He said that receiving  a writer who offended the Islamic faith and the prophet was a  provocation to the entire Islamic nation confirming a  deep-seated grudge against Muslims.    The U.S. Government had addressed a strongly worded  ultimatum  to the Khartoum government accusing it of terrorism and of  opening training bases for extremist organizations. President  'Umar al-Bashir's reply to that ultimatum was that he told the  U.S. ambassador in Khartoum that Sudan would defend itself  against any U.S. interference and that what the Americans faced  in Somalia and before that in Vietnam would be a "picnic"  compared with what they would face in Sudan.    AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI has learned that Washington's recent  change  of tone came after it became certain that threatening language  is futile with Sudanese officials.    It seems that the Sudanese Government has begun to react  positively to the new U.S. line. President al-Bashir told U.S.  Envoy Wells that his government is committed to any U.S. move to  settle the dispute in southern Sudan peacefully. He also said  that threats of blockade against Sudan would not help but would  complicate the problem.</p>

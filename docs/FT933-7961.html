			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Californian insurer loses battle over rebates ALLSTATE Insurance yesterday became the biggest insurer to concede defeat in the battle with Californian regulators over Proposition 103, the controversial state legislation which decided that premiums on motor and other types of property/casualty insurance should be rolled back, and rebates made. Allstate and the California Department of Insurance said the company had agreed to repay Dollars 110m in rebates to 2.9m policyholders who held policies in the year to November 1989. This represents 5.3 per cent of the company's written premiums during the period. The agreement marks the biggest single victory for Mr John Garamendi, the politically-ambitious Californian insurance commissioner, in his battle with insurance companies over rebates under Proposition 103, which was passed in 1988 on a 'voter initiative'. It takes to 7m the number of people who will have received rebates. Allstate, which had been one of the most vociferous opponents of the legislation, said it had decided to settle to put the dispute behind it. The cost of the settlement, which had been provided for in previous years, would not affect 1993 earnings. The company will pay rebates averaging Dollars 66 on each auto policy, Dollars 26 per homeowners policy, and Dollars 207 on each commercial policy. Mr Garamendi, while welcoming the settlement, said: 'This agreement should send a signal (to other insurers) that either through the courts or directly with companies, we will see to it that rebates are paid.'</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Observer: Laying down the law Observer's 'Clean Breast' award for chairmanly frankness goes to former Consolidated Gold Fields director David Lloyd-Jacob. Since April 1991 he has been heading the UK's lesser known Butte Mining, whose London quote was suspended at 1 1/2 p last August compared with a Pounds 1 flotation price five years before. Here's how he spells out his future plans in the company's annual report: 'Management intends to rebuild net worth in the next few years, primarily by litigation.' He has hired a New York contingent-fee law firm to sue some of Butte's former directors, advisers and investors in the US. But it is not only the lawyers who'll be banking on the Montana court granting the damages claim of about Dollars 1bn in full. Lloyd-Jacob and two other executives are also in for a slice of the action. He will get 3 per cent, and finance director Graham Andrews 1.5 per cent of the gross proceeds over Pounds 15m. The president of Butte's US operations Chuck Tatman is booked for  3/4 per cent of the gross. The reason, the annual report explains, is that the trio 'have critical expertise without which the company and the lawsuit would not have been viable'. What's more, with Butte living from hand to mouth, all have cut their incomes and are now paid only as part-time consultants. Indeed, Lloyd-Jacob's own salary from the company has been halved to a mere Pounds 50,000 a year.</p>

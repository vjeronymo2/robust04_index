			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANNUAL QUOTA ON BUILDING PERMITS WEIGHED  </P> <P> Glendale officials, who have been wrestling with a zoning plan to reduce the  number of apartments or condominiums that could be built on a single lot,  returned their attention this month to a second growth-control tool -- a  building cap ordinance.  </P> <P> Such a law would limit the number of residential building permits issued each  year.  </P> <P> City Council members have asked for both measures -- the so-called "downzoning  program" and the building cap ordinance -- to be ready for final review at the  end of August. Council members want to have the new limits in place before they  lift a freeze on apartment and condominium construction enacted in September,  1988.  </P> <P> Both measures are aimed at reducing traffic congestion, crowded schools and  other problems that have resulted from Glendale's boom in apartment and  condominium construction. Councilman Jerold Milner said developers cannot be  trusted to voluntarily refrain from constructing apartments.  </P> <P> "The thing you come down to is that all laws are written for people who cannot  use good judgment," he said. "There does need to be a maximum on how many can  be built at one time. Left to the free market, you run the risk of excesses  being driven by individuals who have no concern for the overall community."  </P> <P> The council finished the bulk of its work on the downzoning plan last month and  is preparing to consider the building cap, which it instructed the staff to  prepare last year.  </P> <P> On July 9, city staff members presented the proposal to the Glendale Planning  Commission, which will make recommendations to the council. At that meeting, no  members of the public spoke in favor of or against the measure, under which the  city annually would issue building permits for no more than 1,400 new housing  units through 1994.  </P> <P> Commission members said they wanted more time to study the proposal and  postponed a vote until a special meeting at 3 p.m. July 30.  </P> <P> "I believe that a building cap ordinance is one of the better ways of  accommodating managed growth," Commissioner Don M. Pearson said. "My biggest  concern is whether the rate is appropriate."  </P> <P> The cap is designed to slow the apartment construction boom that began in  Glendale during the 1980s. A peak was reached in 1986 when the city issued more  than 4,500 residential building permits.  </P> <P> In theory, the cap would allow schools and city services to keep up with the  population increase.  </P> <P> "It regulates the rate or pace of the city's growth," said James Glaser, a  Glendale city planner.  </P> <P> He said the measure is also designed to encourage construction of more  affordable housing and higher-quality projects.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, Glendale would annually issue building permits for up to  740 apartment or condominium units that meet the city's definition of  affordable housing. These would be issued on a first-come, first-served basis  to projects in which at least half of the units are guaranteed to be affordable  to lower-income households.  </P> <P> The city would also issue permits for up to 660 units in which the rent or sale  price would be based on prevailing economic conditions. The City Council would  allocate these market-rate units each quarter after city staff members review  and rank the proposed projects.  </P> <P> Higher rankings would be given to apartment and condominium projects that have  less impact on schools, parks and utility services, have plenty of off-street  parking, make use of attractive landscaping and water-conserving plants, and  have energy-efficient equipment such as solar heating units.  </P> <P> A project would also be ranked higher if it provides for special housing needs,  such as accessibility for disabled people and opportunities for moderate-income  families to purchase their units.  </P> <P> City officials said the competition for permits will encourage developers to  propose their best-designed projects, instead of just meeting minimum building  standards.  </P> <P> Glaser said a developer could not upgrade his design immediately after it is  reviewed in order to get a higher ranking. The developer would have to submit  it again with modifications during the next quarter's review period.  </P> <P> During a study session on the building cap proposal, Planning Commissioner Gary  Tobian expressed concern that the additional review could pose a hardship for  some developers. "We're adding three months to the process," he said.  </P> <P> Permits for single-family detached houses would be subtracted from the 660-unit  annual allocation, but such houses would not have to undergo the ranking  review. Some types of housing, such as hotels, affordable senior citizens  projects and condominium conversions, would be exempt from the allocation  process.  </P> <P> Since the July 9 commission meeting, some members of Glendale's business  community have criticized the building cap proposal.  </P> <P> "If you put a cap on it, the free-market economy doesn't work," said Aulden  Schlatter, executive vice president of the Glendale Chamber of Commerce. "I'm  not sure you accomplish what you want to do. You trade one set of problems for  another."  </P> <P> If developers want to build more apartments or condominiums than the city  allows, "you force the prices up for those who want to rent or buy," Schlatter  said.  </P> <P> He said a chamber committee is studying the building cap ordinance and will  likely comment on it to the Planning Commission or the City Council.  </P> <P> "I believe there is enough restriction already, enough limitations, enough  reductions," said Hamo Rostamian, a Glendale developer and real estate broker.  "The cap is just something that is maybe an overkill."  </P> <P> Rostamian said apartment building in Glendale has already slowed considerably  because of savings and loan scandals, financing difficulties, and rising land  and operating costs. He estimated that there are 350 apartment buildings for  sale in Glendale, contrasted with about 150 two years ago.  </P> <P> "It's not very attractive to get into building apartments in Glendale," he  said.  </P> <P> The proposed building cap and its accompanying review process would further  discourage apartment construction, Rostamian said.  </P></p>

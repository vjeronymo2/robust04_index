			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Intel steps up legal battle with AMD INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, has thrown more legal hurdles in the path of Advanced Micro Devices, a rival Silicon Valley chip maker that last week began shipments of its own version of Intel's top selling 486 microprocessor chip. Intel said it had filed a new copyright infringement suit against AMD, continuing a seven-year litigation feud between the two companies over intellectual property rights. AMD said that Intel's latest lawsuit was not unexpected. AMD's entry into the 486 market last week followed a judge's decision setting aside a jury verdict favourable to Intel in a related copyright licensing dispute. The judge ruled that a new trial should be held because Intel had failed to produce documents that could have been relevant to AMD's case. Intel said yesterday it had asked the judge to reconsider his decision. Separately, in another legal dispute with a competitor, Intel said Cyrix, a small semiconductor company that makes clones of Intel's microprocessors, was denied a preliminary injunction that would have prevented Intel from making patent infringement claims against Cyrix's customers. Intel claimed it held patents covering the design of personal computers that run the popular Microsoft Windows operating system. It maintained that by selling clones of its microprocessors, Cyrix was encouraging its customers to infringe on these patents. Cyrix charged that Intel was harassing its customers. AMD has filed an identical suit against Intel in a Texas court. That case has yet to go to trial, but the decision in the Cyrix case could make potential AMD customers wary of becoming entangled in the Intel-AMD legal battle. Intel said it was seeking royalty payments from Cyrix and AMD customers, rather than threatening law suits.</p>

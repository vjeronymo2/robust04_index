			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, by </F> Igor Dunayev; place and date not given: "Croatia Open to Russia"]    [Text] Two years ago, on 26 May, diplomatic relations  were established between the Russian Federation and Croatia.  Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic answers questions from  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA.    It is easy for journalists to speak with the 43-year-old  prime minister. The conversation proceeds as though with an old  colleague. Because immediately after graduating from the legal  faculty at Zagreb University, the future head of state worked  for two years on the radio and for three years after that he was  editor in chief of the journal PRAVNIK (lawyer). At the very  beginning of our discussion, Nikica Valentic especially  emphasized that from 1990 through the spring of 1993 he headed  up the largest oil company in Croatia, INA, which has almost 30  years of experience in successful partnership with Russia.    I was interested in the possibility of obtaining firsthand  information about the economic situation in the country. If we  recall the recent past, Croatia accounted for about $2 billion  in Soviet-Yugoslav commercial exchange.    [Dunayev] What were the economic results with which Croatia  celebrated its anniversary? After all, it acquired independence  even before Russia did--30 May marks the fourth birthday of the  young European state...    [Valentic] Like all former socialist countries, we inherited  an economic mechanism from the past. But, in spite of the  consequences of war and destruction (about half a million  refugees are in the country, living on state welfare) and the  fact that one-quarter of the internationally recognized  territories of Croatia are occupied, we are conducting radical  economic reforms, although we have not received a single dollar  of outside aid. We are also consistently implementing  privatization of enterprises and banks. About one-quarter of  them already have been privatized.    Croatia has one of the lowest inflation rates as compared to  other former socialist countries, which became possible as a  result of rather tough macroeconomic monetary policy. While just  recently the inflation rate approached 3,000-4,000 percent, it  now has declined to the European "standard" of 10 percent. We  have stopped printing money and realistically appraise labor  remuneration and enterprises profitability. Over the past two  years, foreign currency reserves have reached $2 billion. At the  same time, our foreign debt is no more than $2 billion. The  average wage rose to 400 marks [currency as published] a month,  and, by the end of the year, will increase by another 100 marks  [currency as published], which will place our country among the  leaders of the former socialist bloc states. Croatian experience  has attracted world attention, since it is a unique example of a  successful economic reform in extremely unfavorable  circumstances.    [Dunayev] What are the prospects of economic reform in  Croatia?    [Valentic] This depends to a large extent on the success of  privatization, as well as structural changes in key industrial  sectors: shipbuilding, food processing industry, and  metalworking. Croatia possesses exceptional economic resources.  First and foremost, it has about 4,000 kilometers of Adriatic  shoreline, famous throughout the world for its clean water and  appeal to tourists. Croatian agriculture can produce European  quality foodstuffs in quantities twice as great as the domestic  need. Two-thirds of the gas and oil used in the country is  produced in Croatia. Therefore, we can maintain that, under  "nonwar" circumstances, Croatia could be an unquestionable  economic reform leader among the former socialist countries.  Income from tourism alone can bring up to $5 billion annually.    Croatia's geographic position is extremely favorable--it  sits  at the crossroads between the West and the East; at the same  time, about 3 million Croatians, whose experience is invaluable  for the country, live in the West. You have already noticed that  we do not have any problems with foreign currency, which can be  purchased and sold freely. Croatia is a European country that is  small but open to international cooperation. Our goal is to join  European structures, without any borders or customs. And I have  no doubt that in the final count economic progress in Croatia  will succeed.    [Dunayev] What is your opinion of the state of  Russo-Croatian  economic relations?    [Valentic] I see it as exceptionally fruitful. I am also  certain that the process of change both in Croatia and in Russia  will bring the business circles of our countries closer together  in a variety of spheres. Both our friendly relations and good  political contacts, which we value very much, work in favor of  it. I would like to particularly emphasize the opportunities for  tourism in Croatia, since lately we have noticed an increase in  the number of visitors from such countries as Slovenia, Hungary,  Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. They are confident of  the comfort and complete safety of their vacationing in Croatia.  We hope very much to see Russian tourists as well in our  Adriatic region; they are welcome and are well-known here.    ...The prime minister presented us with a gift--a photo  album  with colorful photos of the Adriatic shore and islands. And  confessed that hardly anyone can tell these days how many there  are of these islands. Even the official figure quoted by tourist  reference books seems fantastic--1,185. To see for yourself that  all this is true, we invite you to watch a special report  devoted to tourist attractions of Croatia, which will be shown  on Russian television in the program "Business in Russia" on 30  May. Precisely on the day of the national holiday--Croatia's  Independence Day...</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Chairman of Tory group under fire Sir George Gardiner's future as chairman of the rightwing 92 Group of Tory MPs looked in doubt last night after a meeting on Tuesday with the prime minister which was deferred after a few minutes. Group members condemned the way the engagement was handled after Mr John Major had been angered by publicity suggesting that he was being offered terms for his survival as leader. One group member said the meeting should have been cancelled as soon as reports appeared that the group was demanding changes.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Women's trouser ban out of style in City One of the last bastions of male sartorial exclusivity in the City of London has fallen with a decision by Linklaters &amp; Paines, the law firm, to allow women employees to wear trousers. Linklaters, one of the five biggest City solicitors' firms, has joined other institutions in dropping a rule that all female staff must wear dresses or skirts. It had thought that clients would regard trousers as too informal. The firm, two thirds of whose 1,200 employees in London are female, changed its policy after some employees protested that it was archaic. None of the other big law firms has a formal policy on how women dress. 'An awful lot of women have been wearing trousers around here in the past two weeks (since the ban was lifted), so it must have been causing some discontent,' said one female lawyer at Linklaters yesterday. An informal survey by the Financial Times found no large City firm that still had a formal ban on women wearing trousers, although some said there was still pressure for women to dress traditionally. Large investment banks such as SG Warburg and Schroders allow women to wear dresses or trousers. But one banker said that he had 'heard senior people say that if our women bankers dress like secretaries, they will be taken for secretaries'. Mr Stephen Edlmann, a Linklaters partner, said that the firm had been updating its staff handbook, and had taken the opportunity to change the rules. He said Linklaters had become 'progressively more female' and that 37 per cent of its lawyers were women. The rule had applied because clients often visited the firm for meetings. Other law firms said they had no formal rules. 'I think it has probably become more acceptable in the City for women to wear trousers. After all, nobody wears bowler hats any more,' said Mr Melvyn Hughes, a partner at Slaughter and May. The union MSF, which represents employees in finance companies, said it was aware of one insurance company that encouraged women to avoid trousers.</p>

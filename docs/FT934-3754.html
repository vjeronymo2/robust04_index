			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Haitian premier insists on quitting Mr Robert Malval said yesterday that he still planned to resign as Haiti's prime minister on December 15, despite US pressure to remain in office, but would continue as acting prime minister until a compromise successor could be found, George Graham reports from Washington. 'According to law, I have to stay as acting prime minister until a successor is named,' he said, after talks in Washington with Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the Haitian president, who was ousted two years ago by a military coup. Mr Malval had intended to serve as temporary prime minister to oversee Father Aristide's return to Haiti, set for last October but not yet effected. However, the premier's position has been uncertain, amid much violence in Haiti, local military leaders having reneged on their agreement to this UN-brokered plan.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRICES CLIMB ABOVE $30 BARRIER  </P> <P> Oil surged above $31 a barrel on Wednesday, leapfrogging the $30 price that had  stood for years as a psychological barrier between the oil price shocks of the  late 1970s and the more recent era of cheap energy.  </P> <P> The latest leap in prices was not driven by any dramatic new events or change  in oil supplies but by a continuation of the panicky psychology that has  pervaded the oil markets since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, analysts said.  </P> <P> The possibility of a long siege in the Middle East gave oil experts little  reason to think that prices will fall any time soon. And they said that even  minor disruptions in the movement of oil around the globe could drive prices  far higher.  </P> <P> "With the continued possibility of combat, the upside potential is a long way  from where prices are today," said John Redpath, oil analyst at Energy Security  Analysis in Washington.  </P> <P> The price of a 42-gallon barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped by  $2.51 to $31.22, the highest level in nearly five years. The price is that  fetched by a contract traded Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange for  delivery of crude oil in October.  </P> <P> Futures contracts for gasoline also were up sharply, climbing nearly 3 cents to  $1.042 a gallon for unleaded regular. In normal markets, that price would  eventually mean $1.50 to $1.60 at the pump, industry spokesmen said, once  taxes, transportation and profits are added. Retail prices peaked in 1981 at  about $1.45 a gallon, but industry spokesmen pointed out that, adjusted for  inflation, that would be about $2 a gallon in 1990 dollars.  </P> <P> Traders blamed Wednesday's sharp increases on fresh signs of disarray in the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and news that Saudi Arabian oil  bound for Japan had been diverted to serve as jet fuel for the U.S. and Saudi  military buildup.  </P> <P> Neither event signaled a new assessment of how much oil will be available to  meet world demand. In fact, the latest crude oil and gasoline inventory report  Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute was more favorable than expected.  </P> <P> But nervousness in Japan over the diverted oil cargoes drove prices up  dramatically in Tokyo, then in London and New York. Traders said that  Wednesday's press conference by President Bush didn't help, even though there  was no major news.  </P> <P> "You add the continuing fears that we could have the destruction of the oil  fields in Saudi Arabia, and people just keep buying and buying," said Peter  Beutel, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. "Every time Bush gets on  TV, it seems like it heightens the tension."  </P> <P> At $31, crude oil prices have virtually doubled since mid-June.  </P> <P> The $30 barrier is deemed important because it was the rough starting point for  a steep collapse that began in November, 1985, and bottomed out six months  later at $9 a barrel. Since then, prices have bounced between $14 and $20, far  below the levels that ravaged the world economy in the 1970s and early 1980s.  </P> <P> Even Wednesday's price was moderate compared to the oil-shock years. Adjusted  for inflation, the price of oil would have to reach about $35 a barrel to be  comparable to the 1985 level. And, to match the peak of $37 reached in 1981,  oil today would have to hit about $50 a barrel, Tom Burns, head of the economic  staff at Chevron Corp., estimated.  </P> <P> "It still is cheaper" than it was in 1985, Burns said, "but we're getting  close. There wasn't that much inflation in the last five years."  </P> <P> One reason that oil traders are so jumpy is that promises by OPEC members Saudi  Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates to increase oil output -- to  make up for oil lost from Iraq and Kuwait -- remain clouded by uncertainty and  OPEC politics.  </P> <P> Analyst Redpath said that, if the 4.2 million barrels of oil a day from Iraq  and Kuwait -- barred from the market by a worldwide embargo -- is not made up  somewhere else, the reserve of world crude oil supplies that existed at the  time of the invasion will be worked off by about Oct. 1.  </P> <P> He said another factor in Wednesday's big price jump was that it was the first  day on which traders considered October -- instead of September -- to be the  "near-term month," the main focus of contract trades on the mercantile  exchange.  </P> <P> In other words, Redpath said: "The longer out you look, the worse the situation  appears."  </P> <P> By October, fall and winter will add their own uncertainties to the market.  They include the threat of hurricanes in the U.S. Oil Patch states and storms  in the North Sea oil-production areas, both of which could interrupt  production, and cold spells, which can drive up oil prices even in normal  markets.  </P> <P> "There's no good time for this sort of thing to happen, but going into  wintertime is one of the less desirable," Burns said.  </P></p>

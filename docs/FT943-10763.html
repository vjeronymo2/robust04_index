			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Sky's the limit as MacKenzie leaves News Corp Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, who dominated The Sun for 13 years, has run out of Sky after less than seven months. The UK's most notorious and successful tabloid newspaper editor - surprisingly appointed managing director of British Sky Broadcasting in January without any television experience - abruptly left the satellite broadcaster last night. Mr MacKenzie's Sun earned a unique place in the history of British journalism with headlines such as 'Gotcha' and 'Stick It Up Your Junta' during the Falklands war; 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster' and 'Up yours, Delors'. Last night's parting comments left, like the Sun's Page 3, little to the imagination. The slightest glance between the lines suggested that Mr MacKenzie's short television career had not been a success. In what amounted to a corporate goodbye, Mr Rupert Murdoch was already looking backwards at Mr MacKenzie's achievements as he praised his brilliant editorship of The Sun. 'His hard work and determination will long be remembered. I count him as a friend and wish him every success,' Mr Murdoch said. It is unlikely that Mr MacKenzie could have been hired for such a senior position without the explicit approval of Mr Murdoch or that he could be now leaving News Corporation without Mr Murdoch's involvement and agreement. Mr MacKenzie said he had worked for News Corporation for 20 years and that his leaving did not 'cast any shadow over my very fond memories of the company and its personalities'. Mr MacKenzie blamed a personality clash for his resignation. The biggest personality at BSkyB to clash with is Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive, who handled the merger with BSB and is widely credited with having turned around the company's fortunes. Not many people have emerged on top from a personality clash with Mr Chisholm, whose vocabulary is as ripe as any tabloid editor's. At the time of his appointment Mr Chisholm spoke of Mr MacKenzie as 'highly creative'. Mr MacKenzie was probably appointed managing director of BSkyB, a venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, partly as a reward for his performance at The Sun and partly in the hope that his populist touch would translate into television. There was speculation last night that Mr MacKenzie might be on his way back to writing tabloid headlines - with the Daily Express, where his brother Craig is an executive.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: CENTRAL COSTA MESA  </P> <P> When early residents of central Costa Mesa needed to shop, they couldn't just  dash out to the corner store. Going to the marketplace was an all-day ordeal,  requiring a trip into downtown Santa Ana by horse and buggy. But now this  neighborhood is a shopper's mecca, and bargain-hunters from all over Southern  California attend the Orange County Marketplace, an upscale weekend flea market  that attracts 4.5 million customers every year.  </P> <P> The neighborhood is also home to the 18,800-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre, one  of the largest outdoor concert venues on the West Coast. In addition, the  Orange County Fairgrounds are located here, adjacent to the amphitheater.  </P> <P> But the local attractions have drawbacks for residents of the nearby Mesa del  Mar housing tract. Some homeowners complain about traffic generated by the swap  meet and noise from the outdoor concerts. In 1987, Orange County Superior Court  Judge Gary L. Taylor ordered noise-level restrictions at the amphitheater at  the request of a homeowners group. Since then, residents have complained that  the amphitheater has violated the order on several occasions.  </P> <P> But not everyone in Mesa del Mar is up in arms about the noise. Some consider  the musical overspill a fringe benefit, since it's possible to enjoy a favorite  performer without buying a ticket.  </P> <P> Central Costa Mesa began its transition from sparsely populated farmland into a  bustling hub of activity during World War II, when the government hastily  transformed 1,335 acres of land here into the Santa Ana Army Air Base. From  1942 to 1944, more than 126,000 aviation cadets were classified here to receive  further training as pilots, bombardiers or navigators after several weeks of  testing.. Local residents were hired as civilian employees, generating jobs and  income. Big-name performers such as Tommy Dorsey and Duke Ellington entertained  troops here, and Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen and Bob Hope made live radio  broadcasts from the base theater.  </P> <P> The base stopped taking new recruits in 1944 and served as a rehabilitation  center for wounded veterans until 1946.  </P> <P> A portion of the grounds and many base structures were then transformed into  Orange Coast College, the fairgrounds and the original Costa Mesa City Hall.  Eventually the Mesa del Mar and College Park housing tracts, Southern  California College, Costa Mesa High School, Davis Intermediate School and  Charles TeWinkle Memorial Park appeared in place of the air base.  </P> <P> Many of the original base structures have since been replaced, but several of  the old buildings, like the Orange County Fairgrounds Administration Building,  are still in use. A plaque and a memorial garden at the fairgrounds commemorate  the role the base played in the area's development.  </P> <P> Residents of Mesa del Mar occasionally find pieces of the old air base parade  grounds when digging in their yards. The neighborhood is a living monument to  the process of turning swords into plowshares.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Population:  </P> <P> Total (1990 est.): 4,550  </P> <P> 1980-90 change: +3.6%  </P> <P> Median age: 32.2  </P> <P> Radical/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 64%  </P> <P> Black: less than 1%  </P> <P> Latino: 26%  </P> <P> Other: 10%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Income:  </P> <P> Per capita: $14,282  </P> <P> Median household: $44,714  </P> <P> Average household: $47,351  </P> <P> Income distribution:  </P> <P> $100,000-and more: 6%  </P> <P> $75,000-99,999: 9%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 27%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 39%  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 19%  </P> <P> </P> <P> By sex and age: in hundreds  </P> <P> Males: Median age: 31.0 years  </P> <P> Females: Median age: 33.5 yearsJANICE L.

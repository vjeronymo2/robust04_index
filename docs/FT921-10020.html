			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses concentrate on individual issues BOURSES concentrated on individual issues yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT reported thin turnover as a single order for Volkswagen pushed the shares up DM5 to DM342 and helped the DAX index to close 4.39 higher at 1,685.52, down 0.2 per cent on the week. At midsession the FAZ was 1.75 lower at 687.40, up 0.6 per cent on the week. Volume fell from DM8bn to DM4.6bn. Apart from continued gains in construction, where Bilfinger &amp; Berger rose DM17 to DM977 and Hochtief by DM29 to DM1,228, a feature of the day was the recovery of individual stocks after varying periods of severe pressure. VW, one of the worst performing German blue chips in 1991, has recovered from a 1991 low of DM280 and its resilience yesterday was remarkable against an embattled background for the industry. Mercedes said on Thursday that it was reviewing methods of cutting production this year, and after hours yesterday BMW said it would cut about 3,000 jobs by the end of this year. In retailing, Asko added to another strong 1992 rebound with its shares up DM20 to DM720 against a 1992 low of DM607. The airline Lufthansa rose DM6 to DM157 after a three-day drop of DM30 to DM151 on Thursday, after it confirmed that 1991 results would show a DM400m loss against earlier hopes of a break-even. PARIS traded in a narrow range which disguised volatility in some smaller stocks. The CAC 40 index ended 1.00 higher at 1,861.61, down 0.7 per cent on the week, in turnover of around FFr1.7bn. The builder Spie Batignolles sank FFr18.80 or 5.8 per cent to FFr307 with 80,975 shares traded following the news late on Thursday that it was likely to have lost FFr950m last year, double market forecasts of losses of FFr400m. Schneider, which has a controlling stake in Spie, fell FFr5 to FFr616 with 130,275 shares traded. Michelin ran into profit-taking after its recent gains, dropping FFr3.90 or 2.4 per cent to FFr160.10 with 526,650 shares traded. But Valeo, the car components maker which has lagged behind Michelin, rose FFr24 or 3.6 per cent to FFr684 with a relatively heavy 66,600 shares traded. Total built on overnight gains in New York, rising FFr17 to FFr1,059 with 79,050 shares traded. Its shares are due to be split into four on Monday. MILAN closed weaker in thin pre-weekend trading. The Comit index fell 4.01 to 547.58, up 1.1 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at less than Thursday's L131.8bn. Fiat fell L89 during the session to L5,046, and lost another L6 after hours, depressed by the previous day's industry data which showed that its share of the domestic market was still declining. But Generali and Mediobanca withstood selling pressure and gave some support to the market. Generali fell L90 to L31,100 while Mediobanca eased L80 to L15,670. The telecoms sector fell 1.4 per cent in the wake of Thursday's confirmation of Stet's big warrant bond issue. Stet and Sip both fell L11 to L2,384 and L1,476 respectively. OSLO was depressed by lower tanker rates and worries about 1991 company results. The all-share index fell 3.66 to 434.43, down 2.8 per cent on the week. Hafslund A shares rose NKr1 to NKr267 after announcing record profits on Tuesday, and made up NKr50m of the total turnover of NKr290m. Norsk Hydro fell NKr2.5 to NKr144 ahead of its results due on February 20. AMSTERDAM followed the dollar lower. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.9 to 121.3, little changed on the week. The national carrier KLM fell Fl 1.40 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 38.20 in heavy trading on reports that there was a delay in its agreement with British Airways. The grocer Ahold gained 50 cents to Fl 81.00 in spite of the weaker dollar, ahead of its press conference on Monday at which it might announce another acquisition in the US. ZURICH recovered on a boost from Wall Street after trading lower for most of the session. The all-share SPI index ended 1.1 up at 1,120.2 for a rise of almost 1 per cent on the week. Leu Holding bearers rose SFr50 to SFr1,750. Its principal unit, Bank Leu, announced a 1991 net profit of SFr33.1m after SFr2.7m in 1990, when it had to make provisions of SFr61m for fraud. STOCKHOLM was pushed both ways, up by Merrill Lynch's expressed liking for Astra and down by jitters ahead of next week's results from Ericsson. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 2.0 to 966.8, down 0.3 per cent on the week. Astra B rose another SKr10 to SKr580 and Ericsson B closed steady at SKr118. ISTANBUL jumped 4.5 per cent in active trade, on the second day of a correction after a 14.4 per cent fall in the seven trading days to Wednesday. The index closed at 4,576.13, up 195.09, but it was still 7.1 per cent down on the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open      10 am    11 am     12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1137.72  1137.28   1138.03  1137.62  1137.70  1137.25  1136.99  1137.10                Day's High  1138.65    Day's Low  1134.22              Feb 6     Feb 5     Feb 4     Feb 3     Jan 31             1138.76   1138.71  1132.79    1134.04   1137.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

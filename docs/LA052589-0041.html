			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVE POTATO-FILLED PASTRIES FROM INDIA AS APPETIZERS FOR HOLIDAY PARTY  </P> <P> These deep-fried, potato-filled pastries are traditional snacks in India, but  here they serve as tasty appetizers on Memorial Day.  </P> <P> Diced, cooked potatoes are simmered briefly with peas, onion, ginger, cilantro,  cumin, turmeric and cayenne pepper to make the pungent filling. Evaporated milk  helps bind these ingredients together and tempers the spicy taste. The Samosa  filling is cradled in a crisp and flaky pastry.  </P> <P> The pastries can be prepared several hours ahead, frying them only until very  lightly golden. Then, just before serving, briefly fry again 1 to 2 minutes.  Or, fried and cooled Samosas can be reheated in the oven at 375 degrees for 8  to 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Yogurt, cucumber and mint serve as a refreshing dip.  </P> <P> SAMOSAS  </P> <P> 2 3/4 cups flour  </P> <P> 1 1/4 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 3/4 cup evaporated milk  </P> <P> 3/4 cup water  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon minced ginger root  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> 2 cups diced, cooked potatoes  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped cilantro  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon cumin  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon turmeric  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 3/4 cup peas  </P> <P> Combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt in medium bowl.

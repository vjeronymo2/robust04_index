			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb forces shelled the  airport and town of Tuzla in northern Bosnia Thursday after an  observation post of a Nordic UN battalion there came under brief  artillery attack, a United Nations spokesman said.    Eleven shells fell on the airport mid-morning and three fell  on the market in Tuzla, said Major Dacre Holloway with the UN  Protection Force. There were no injuries, Halloway said.    He said the Nordic UN troops' observation post was hit with  artillery fire early Thursday but gave no other details.    Elsewhere Thursday, Serb forces seized 17 UN peacekeepers  guarding a weapons stockpile at Cifluk, northwest of the capital  Sarajevo and just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone around  the capital ordered by the UN in February.    Tuzla's airport, closed since the start of the conflict two  years ago, was opened under the threat of NATO bombardment of  Serb positions only last month, allowing UN relief flights to  bring humanitarian aid to hard-hit northern and central Bosnia.</p>

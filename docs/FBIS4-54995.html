			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina today received Sergio de Mello, head of the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] sector for civilian affairs.  They discussed the situation in Gorazde, Sarajevo, and some  other locations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in particular the  respect for adopted UN documents and their implementation on the  ground.    After the talks they briefly met with reporters. Here is a  report by Arijana Barukcija:    [Begin Sergio de Mello recording, in English with  superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have just ended  a lengthy and detailed exchange of views with President  Izetbegovic. These talks came after the meeting with Prime  Minister Siljadzic in Vienna yesterday morning and the meeting  with Karadzic in Pale last night. As we had planned, we  discussed some very difficult and urgent matters. These  obviously included the problem of the passage of tanks through  the 20km exclusion zone around Sarajevo, the question of  Gorazde, and some other seemingly small, but, in fact, very  important difficulties, which need to be resolved. I even held  talks with a representative of the Bosnian Serb forces about the  withdrawal from the three km zone. (We also discussed) the  problem of a possible, but very difficult return of refugees in  conditions where heavy weapons are still present in the 20km  zone around Gorazde, something that we still cannot confirm.  [sentence as heard]    We also discussed the situation in Brcko. You know that we  deployed a certain number of observers there yesterday and  today. I informed President Izetbegovic about the agreement on  this area, and also about the proposals by the Bosnian Serb army  on a cease-fire in the Posavina corridor. We also discussed  some other important issues, such as the freedom of movement  within and out of Sarajevo as a result of the agreement signed  at Sarajevo airport on 17 March, where he, himself, was present.  These are the basic questions we discussed with President  Izetbegovic yesterday and this morning. [end recording]    President Izetbegovic also commented on the talks.    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Yes, we discussed exactly what  Mr. de Mello said. As regards the mistakes made here in the  Sarajevo exclusion zone, we adhere to our position. We demand  that the UN control the behavior of the Serbs in the Sarajevo  zone more effectively than has been the case so far. As regards  Gorazde, of course, we insist on the removal of all armed  individuals, whether they wear blue or green uniforms on the  Serb side. They must be removed from the three km zone so that  our people can return there. In that respect we still have had  no reply. As I understood, Mr. de Mello is expecting an  (answer) today. We will see what happens. We will, of course,  continue to insist on this. This is the minimum level of  justice that we expect in Gorazde. Our people have been  squeezed into a very narrow, small area on the left bank of the  River Drina. The Serb side will try to settle their population  there. This has to be prevented by all means and to protect the  parts where the Muslim population live in the Gorazde area.    It would be positive if the situation in Brcko were to calm  down. We do not want any war, any fighting there. They have  made contact with our local commanders in the area. General  Hazim Sadic [2d Corps commander] informed us about this  initiative. We said they should inform us here about the  initiative and we will then give them a definite answer on what  else could be done in the Brcko area. [end recording]</p>

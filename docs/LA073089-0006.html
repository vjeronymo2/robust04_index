			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: PERLMAN, CLOSE TO HOST OVATION AWARDS  </P> <P> Itzhak Perlman and Glenn Close will host the third annual Ovation Awards --  honoring current recordings of classical music and the performers who make them  -- at Carnegie Hall in New York City Oct. 26.  </P> <P> The awards show will be taped for later broadcast on radio and television,  according to Sharon Dec, coordinator of the awards for Ovation magazine. In  1988, the awards program was shown on cable (Arts &amp; Entertainment). This  year, Dec says, the management is seeking sponsors for network distribution.  </P> <P> With awards scheduled in 14 categories, voting by a 250-member panel made up of  music professionals and Ovation readers, begins this week.  </P> <P> "The voting, in a window of time between Saturday and Aug. 15," says Dec, "is  by a computerized telephone system. The voters have an access code as a group,  and each one has another, individual access code. After each participant has  voted, the separate code will be destroyed."  </P> <P> The voters fall into two groups. The first, which Dec refers to as the  "credentialed group," comprises 125 professionals -- music critics from  newspapers and magazines, professional record buyers from retail outlets and  program directors from classical music radio stations. This group's votes are  "weighted two to one," Dec says, against the votes of the second group of 125  music-lovers who are subscribers to Ovation magazine.  </P> <P> None of the names of the voters can be revealed, another spokesman for the  awards show told The Times last week. This in accordance with the rules laid  down by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, which will tabulate the  results and keep them secret until the Oct. 26 event.  </P> <P> The nomination procedure, according to Dec, was this: More than 55 record  companies submitted more than 300 recordings for consideration. A panel of six  judges from the national music community -- Robert Conrad, Dave Conant, Israel  Horowitz, Denise Pineau, Paul Turok and John von Rhein -- listened to these  recordings and submitted their rankings. From these, the list of competitors in  14 categories was made up.  </P> <P> What each of the 14 winners -- plus 11 recipients of special, uncategorized  awards -- will take home is a silver sculpture designed by Vivianne Bulow-Hube  of Georg Jensen Silversmiths.  </P> <P> The nominees:  </P> <P> Recording artist of the year  </P> <P> Leonard Bernstein  </P> <P> Neeme Jarvi  </P> <P> Charles Mackerras  </P> <P> Anne-Sophie Mutter  </P> <P> Roger Norrington  </P> <P> Recording of the year  </P> <P> Barber: Symphony No. 2, etc.; Andrew Schenck/New Zealand Symphony.  </P> <P> Beethoven: Nine Symphonies; Overtures; Riccardo Muti/Philadelphia Orchestra.  </P> <P> Berlioz: "Symphonie Fantastique"; Roger Norrington/London Classical Players.  </P> <P> Kern: "Show Boat"; John McGlinn/London Sinfonetta.  </P> <P> Mahler: Symphony No. 2; Leonard Bernstein/New York Philharmonic.  </P> <P> Debut recording artist of the year  </P> <P> Yefim Bronfman  </P> <P> Evgeny Kissin  </P> <P> Ute Lemper  </P> <P> Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment  </P> <P> Melvyn Tan  </P> <P> Orchestral  </P> <P> Barber: Symphony No. 2, etc.  </P> <P> Berlioz: "Symphonie Fantastique"  </P> <P> Ives: "Central Park in the Dark"; Michael Tilson Thomas/Chicago Symphony  </P> <P> Mahler: Symphony No. 2  </P> <P> Mahler: Ten Symphonies, "Das Lied von der Erde;" Eliahu Inbal/Frankfurt Radio  Symphony  </P> <P> Opera  </P> <P> Britten: "Paul Bunyan"; Philip Brunelle/Conductor  </P> <P> Mozart: "Die Zauberflote"; Nikolaus Harnoncourt/Zurich Opera  </P> <P> Strauss, R.: "Ariadne auf Naxos"; Kurt Masur/Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra  </P> <P> Strauss, R.: "Die Frau ohne Schatten"; Wolfgang Sawallisch/Orchestra and Chorus  of Bavarian Radio  </P> <P> Wagner: "Die Walkure"; James Levine/Metropolitan Opera  </P> <P> Concerto  </P> <P> Brahms: "Haydn" Variations; Horacio Gutierrez, piano: Andre Previn/Royal  Philharmonic.  </P> <P> Glazunov: Violin Concerto; Oscar Shumsky, violin: Neeme Jarvi/Scottish National  Orchestra.  </P> <P> Lutoslawski: "Chain 2": Partita; Stravinsky: Violin Concerto: Anne-Sophie  Mutter, violin: Witold Lutoslawski/BBC Symphony (Lutoslawski); Paul  Sacher/Philharmonia Orchestra (Stravinsky).  </P> <P> Mozart: Horn Concertos; Lowell Greer, horn: Nicholas McGegan/Philharmonia  Baroque Orchestra.  </P> <P> Tchaikovsky: Violin Concerto; Wieniawski: Violin Concerto No. 2; Joshua Bell,  violin: Vladimir Ashkenazy/Cleveland Orchestra.  </P> <P> Chamber  </P> <P> Bartok: Six String Quartets; Emerson Quartet.  </P> <P> Dvorak: Piano Trios; Emanuel Ax, piano; Young-uck Kim, violin; Yo-Yo Ma, cello.  </P> <P> Mozart: Piano Trios; Beaux Art Trio.  </P> <P> Music of Gabrieli and his Contemporaries: Empire Brass and friends.  </P> <P> Shostakovich: Sonata for Cello and Piano; Emanuel Ax, piano; Isaac Stern,  violin; Yo-Yo Ma, cello.  </P> <P> Instrumental solo  </P> <P> Albeniz: "Iberia"; Alicia de Larrocha, piano.  </P> <P> Bach: Sonatas and Partitas; Itzhak Perlman, violin.  </P> <P> Beethoven-Liszt: Symphonies; Cyprien Katsaris, piano.  </P> <P> Scarlatti: Keyboard Sonatas, Andras Schiff, piano.  </P> <P> Weber: Complete Piano Sonatas; Garrick Ohlsson, piano.  </P> <P> CONTINUITY: The board of directors of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra has  extended the present contract of music director Iona Brown for another two  years, through the 1991-92 season.

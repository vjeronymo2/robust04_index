			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM correspondent Vladimir Glod for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 30 Jan -- For three days following his  removal from the post of Supreme Soviet chairman of the Republic  of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich gave no interviews. The  reason: The need to let the emotions cool, calm down, and think  about many things.    I found Stanislav Shushkevich at his dacha, 45 kilometers  from Minsk. Here he has 450 square meters of land in a  university allotment society. Compared to the other buildings  here, his looks like a toadstool among chanterelles. "I do not  have any other dachas," the ex-speaker explained. "Neither I,  nor my family, ever lived in the one issued to me by the Supreme  Soviet Presidium. It was only used as a residence for official  receptions."    Almost everything at the dacha is Shushkevich's own work. He  did use the services of the Maintenance and Construction  Department attached to the Council of Ministers when he needed  welding and plastering work done, and paid for it in full. "If  anyone thinks that this department works for cheap, then they  are completely wrong. Over the past two years all my wages have  been ploughed into this dacha. We are living on my wife's  money."    When Vice Rector Shushkevich moved out of his two-room  apartment in a university block for a new home he did not leave  it to his mother-in-law, as was alleged in parliament by  Aleksandr Lukashenko, the chairman of the Commission on  Organized Crime, but handed it back to the university. It is  now occupied by a Mr. Klevchen, a lecturer at that establishment.    I deliberately mention this in detail, because one of the  allegations made against Shushkevich when he lost his post was  of personal immodesty. To my puzzled question of why he is  telling me this instead of the Supreme Soviet, the former  speaker answered: "That is the way I was brought up. I was  taught that there is a presumption of innocence. So I think it  below my dignity to get involved in a debate on this dirt. But  I also cannot prove that I am not a camel."    Stanislav Shushkevich said that if time were to transport  him  back to his university lecture theater, he would still have  taken the same path. "There was a lot I wanted to do, but it  was impossible to escape the realities when my options were  restricted. My main goal was to create Belarusian statehood, so  that a sovereign, democratic, and civilized state appeared in  Europe. I really wanted our Supreme Soviet to be democratic,  and less polarized, unruly and confrontation-minded, I wanted it  to be centrist. But unfortunately, in this I failed."    Asked about the true reasons for his departure, the former  Supreme Soviet chairman replied: "I do not suit the majority in  this Supreme Soviet. It does not want to build a new society,  and most of the deputies we have now want to return to the old  order. To this day I cannot understand how I managed to get to  lead the Supreme Soviet. The Communist majority in Autumn 1991  was fantastically frightened, and my election was a chance  occurrence, not an inevitability."    Shushkevich acknowledged that he now realizes that he  underestimated the bureaucratic games. "It was hugely difficult  for me. My first deputy was often ill. On at least 10  occasions I proposed candidates for the vacant post of deputy to  the head of the Supreme Soviet, and every time these people,  including the current chairman, Myechyslaw Hryb, blocked me.  Now I realize that most of them were doing this deliberately,  so that I could not rely on an assistant to handle the economic  or organizational issues."    Two other circumstances were a strong hindrance to the  ex-speaker. First, there was no centrist bloc in the Belarus  Supreme Soviet, which instead was split into a huge majority and  small opposition. Secondly, the Supreme Soviet, which was not  made up of professional MPs, became an offshoot of the  executive. I asked Shushkevich whether, realizing his  powerlessness, he had ever wanted to just quit and slam the door  behind him. He answered: "No, I did not, and for one reason  alone. I felt that as the Supreme Soviet head there was,  nonetheless, a time when I would be able to counter the  anti-reformists."    Stanislav Shushkevich thinks that the ideal system for  Belarus is a parliamentary republic. But mindful of the overall  instability and fractiousness, it is essential to temporarily  elect a president. Will he run for election? "I have not yet  made up my mind," he replied.    Asked whether his departure is a precedent for Boris Yeltsin  or Leonid Kravchuk, Stanislav Shushkevich said that the events  in Belarus should not be compared to those in Russia or the  Ukraine.    The ex-speaker confessed that he expected to have to go at  least a month earlier. The parliamentary majority was strongly  against U.S. President Clinton coming to Minsk and recognizing  Belarus as an independent European state. "I am delighted that  Clinton's visit and the talks between our countries went ahead  and that he was able to form an opinion about Belarus,"  Stanislav Shushkevich said.    Comparing the pace of economic reform in Belarus and Russia,  the former speaker said that Russia, under the guidance of Yegor  Gaydar, for whom he has enormous respect, has moved on ahead.  Belarus has noticeably lagged behind its partner to the East.  Over 70 years of Communist influence have shown itself to have  had a far from good impact on the psychology of the Belarusian  people. "If the market reforms are scrapped, then I would have  the gloomiest of forecasts for the future," Stanislav  Shushkevich said.    "The market reforms in Belarus were never properly  formulated," Shushkevich commented, which is why he fears that  Belarus could fall behind in this process.    Stanislav Shushkevich said this of his successor, Myechyslaw  Hryb: "We get on normally, although we differed on the  Collective Security Treaty. Myechyslaw Ivanovich can adapt to  any situation and, I have to think, his candidature is fully to  the liking of the present Supreme Soviet."    On his plans for the near future, he said, "I have only had  10 days vacation during the past year, and now I want to take a  break for a while. I will probably go to Bonn for a week,  because I have a long-standing invitation to read some lectures.  After that, we will see."</p>

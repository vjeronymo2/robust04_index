			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Old thinking In December 1992 Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, stunned the world with a fiercely nationalistic speech. He publicly renounced previous pro-western policies, demanded an end to the arms embargo on Serbia, and accused western countries of planning to strengthen their military presence in the Baltic and other regions 'on the territory of the former Soviet Union'. Forty-five minutes later he announced that it had all been a hoax, intended to warn the west what sort of foreign policy it could expect if President Boris Yeltsin were to fall. Neither Mr Yeltsin 'nor I myself, as minister for foreign affairs, would ever agree with what I read out in my previous statement', he added. Not everyone saw the joke at the time, and it has become steadily less amusing since. The Mr Kozyrev who is still foreign minister in 1994 sounds more like the 'hoax' than the 'real' Mr Kozyrev of 1992. Russian troops should not withdraw, he declared on Tuesday, from regions 'which have been in the sphere of Russian interests for centuries'. Both main Russian news agencies reported this statement as including the Baltic states, which would have directly contradicted assurances given to President Bill Clinton by Mr Yeltsin last week. Let us hope the agencies were mistaken, as Mr Kozyrev's office yesterday insisted they were. Even so the language used is chilling, as is the blithe assumption that Russian interests must prevail over the wishes of neighbouring states which Russia has recognised as sovereign. If Mr Kozyrev wanted to put the case for an enlarged Nato, with guarantees to states that feel threatened by Russia, he could hardly have done it better.</p>

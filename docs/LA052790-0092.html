			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: DISRAELI BY JOHN VINCENT (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $5.95)  </P> <P> In this stuffy biography, John Vincent traces the motivations behind Benjamin  Disraeli's political actions to passages in his novels, which few people in  England, and even fewer in America, still read. Oxford's "Past Masters" series  is supposed to provide "concise, lucid, authoritative introductions to the  thoughts of leading intellectual figures of the past whose ideas still  influence the way we think today." But Vincent fails to explain the issues and  crises that his subjects faced: Anyone who could follow this stolid account of  Disraeli's career wouldn't need an introduction to the colorful statesman's  career.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 23 (YONHAP) -- Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae said Wednesday that the South Korean and U.S.  Governments are discussing when to resume the Team Spirit  military exercise, which will include Patriot missiles.    Yi told the National Assembly's National Defense Committee  that the exercise may begin in late April, mid-May or sometime  after that.    He said, "as North Korea failed to fulfill the two  preconditions for suspension of Team Spirit, resumption of the  exercise has become inevitable. The maximum number of U.S.  Forces possible will take part in the exercise for maximum  effect."    He explained that Team Spirit will include command post  exercises and such practical maneuvers as river crossings and  emergency landings.    North Korea walked out of the latest inter-Korean  working-level contact on Saturday, rupturing the dialogue on  exchanging special envoys, and warned Monday that it would  withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) if Team  Spirit was resumed this year.    In response to threats by Pyongyang, South Korea and the  United States plan to deploy Patriot missiles near Seoul soon in  preparation for an emergency.    The Patriots are expected to arrive here next month in time  for Team Spirit.    Yi said, "Patriot anti-missile missiles will also be part of  the exercise. One Patriot battalion can fight 55 incoming  aircraft simultaneously and has the incidental capability of  intercepting Scud missiles."    The government will decide the date for resumption of Team  Spirit after considering the effect on farmers and likely  outcome of the joint exercise.    "Once the government officially announces the resumption of  Team Spirit, it will be difficult to suspend the exercise  again," he said.    He did not rule out the possibility of North Korean  provocation after the United Nations discusses possible economic  sanctions.    "The government is working out countermeasures of two kinds  -- one before the U.N. Security Council decides on sanctions  against North Korea and the other after the decision," he said.    Yi said Seoul and Washington will hold consultations after  the Security Council makes a decision on sanctions.    If sanctions are imposed, he said North Korea may try to  endure the pressure but would eventually be compelled to accede  to the council's demands.    "But if Pyongyang judges the United Nations' deterrent power  is not enough to defeat it, you cannot rule out that possibility  and it may choose military provocation," he said.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Major will try to build on success - Britain THERE are no easy triumphs on offer in Europe for Mr John Major. Until Britain has ratified the Maastricht treaty, the prime minister will be unable to dispel the suspicion of his continental colleagues that he remains a reluctant participant in the European enterprise. But it would be churlish to suggest that the summit was anything but a personal success. After the chaos and confusion of recent months, Mr Major could claim with justice that his government - and the Community  - had begun to regain their balance. Mr Major deserves much of the credit. The basic impetus for the deals struck at Edinburgh was a recognition by all 12 leaders that the price of failure was too high. But the prime minister provided the skilful chairmanship which allowed each delegation to dress up collective compromises as individual successes. Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, described Mr Major's handling of the summit as 'elegant and effective'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, offered a similar judgment. Even President Francois Mitterrand allowed himself a grudging compliment. Mr Major intends to capitalise on the plaudits - and on the substantive deals struck in Edinburgh. Doubts over Maastricht and Black Wednesday handed the initiative to the Tory Euro-sceptics. Now Mr Major thinks he can regain it. The balance sheet he will present to the Commons later today will list a string of successes for his brand of pragmatic Europeanism. British ingenuity ensured that Denmark had another opportunity to move forward with the rest of the Community. The declaration on subsidiarity met demands that Brussels give substance to the commitment to decentralise authority. All 12 governments are pledged to push ahead with negotiations to enlarge the Community, initially to include Austria, Finland and Sweden. Mr Major defended successfully the British budget rebate. With the eventual help of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he resisted demands that he set a firm timetable for ratification of Maastricht at Westminster. He found time also to settle long-standing disputes over the sites of the EC's main institutions and to give Germany extra European MPs to reflect unification. The balance sheet carries its minuses also. The Tory sceptics seized yesterday on the concessions which he was forced to give on the size of the budget. They will make much of the concession to Brussels 'profligacy' during the interminable New Year debates at Westminster on Maastricht. For many other European leaders subsidiarity is a useful but essentially unimportant concept. Negotiations on enlargement may begin before Maastricht is ratified but progress remains contingent on the treaty coming into force. On the admission of some of the participants the economic initiative drawn up by the finance ministers will do little to dispel the gloom over European growth prospects. There was no doubt though that Edinburgh was a summit shaped much more by Mr Major's pragmatism than by the European idealism of Mr Mitterrand or Mr Kohl. That will give the prime minister a powerful weapon in his attempts to detach from the irreconciliable Tory critics of Maastricht a much larger group of waverers. His message now to his party will be simple: the great mass of the Conservative party wants a decentralised, wider, Community with the bureaucratic wings of Brussels clipped. He can deliver it. The Tory doubters in return must ensure that Britain retains its voice in Europe by ratifying the treaty. If the Danish people vote Yes in a second referendum the message will be unanswerable. The Maastricht treaty could well be on the British statute book by the end of July. Mr Major's problem is that all-important 'if'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, acknowledged that the government would abandon ratification in the wake of a second Danish No vote. He accepted also that the other 10 probably would push ahead with a new version of the treaty from which Britain as well as Denmark might be excluded. The uncomfortable implication is that Britain's future in Europe for moment may rest with the tiny Danish electorate.</p>

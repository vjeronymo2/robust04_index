			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Sihanouk blow to UN peace force PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's head of state, delivered another blow to the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) United Nations mission in Cambodia yesterday with the announcement that he would no longer be co-operating with UN peacekeepers in his country or with the Vietnamese-installed administration in Phnom Penh. In a letter to Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), Prince Sihanouk said he had made his decision because of Untac's failure to do anything about a series of attacks on the royalist party Funcinpec led by his son, Prince Ranariddh. 'I am obliged to cease co-operation with Untac and the party administration of the state of Cambodia,' the prince said in his letter, released in Beijing, where he is now living. Untac officials are organising elections in Cambodia scheduled for May and have succeeded in registering about four-fifths of eligible voters. But the UN has been unable to impose a ceasefire. Fighting between the Phnom Penh administration and Khmer Rouge guerrillas has continued, and several Funcinpec offices have been attacked - apparently by Phnom Penh government forces afraid of losing power in the election. Several Funcinpec party workers have been killed. Prince Sihanouk, complaining of a variety of illnesses, retreated to Beijing in November. While he may have some genuine illness, many observers believe he is sulking because of the lukewarm reception which was given to his suggestion that Untac should arrange a presidential election - with himself as the prime candidate - as well as the general election so that he could supervise Cambodia while a new constitution is debated. A spokesman for Prince Sihanouk in Beijing was careful to emphasise that the prince would continue to have personal relations with Mr Akashi and other parties in Cambodia and that the letter to Mr Akashi did not affect the prince's standing as head of state. But even if allowances are made for a certain amount of grandstanding by Prince Sihanouk, the situation has changed markedly since he returned in triumph to Phnom Penh in November 1991. Then, there was optimistic talk of an alliance between Prince Ranariddh and Mr Hun Sen, prime minister in the Cambodian administration. Nowadays suggestions of an alliance are muted and the Supreme National Council, which includes the four main factions - the Hun Sen government, Funcinpec, the Khmer Rouge and the KPNLF - has ceased to meet on a regular basis.</p>

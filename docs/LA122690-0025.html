			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSICDON'T BE BASHFUL; THE CALL IS OUT FOR ALL STUPID  SONGS  </P> <P> Aspiring songwriters, take note: Here's a chance to make a name for yourselves  in the music industry and, at the same time, give your funny bones a good  workout.  </P> <P> "The Stupid Song Contest" is the brainchild of three veteran San Diego  tunesmiths: Peter Dubow, a keyboardist who has played with Blonde Bruce Band;  Robert Savery, who plays with the traditional country band the Savery Brothers,  and a third party who asked to remain anonymous. (He's written some really big  songs for some really big stars and, I'm told, doesn't want anyone to know he's  involved in something so frivolous.)  </P> <P> Here's how it works: Send a cassette and a lyric sheet of your stupid song,  along with a check for $10, to The Stupid Song Contest, 270 North Canon Drive,  Suite 9000, Beverly Hills, 90210. The deadline is March 31. Winning entries  will appear on a nationally distributed compilation album, appropriately titled  "The Stupid Song Contest Album."  </P> <P> "There are plenty of contests for serious songs, but all songwriters have  stupid songs just lying around with no place to send them," Dubow said. "And  now, thanks to our contest, there is a place for stupid songs to go. It was  something we felt needed doing, something we wanted to do."  </P> <P> And what constitutes a stupid song?  </P> <P> "We're not looking for unintentionally stupid songs by people like Neil Diamond  or Madonna, but intentionally stupid songs, like the novelty songs on "Dr.  Demento," Dubow said. "People around town might know David Bradley's "Shut Up  and Get Me a Beer," stuff like that. Songs that are just, well, stupid."  </P> <P> The only caveats: no vulgarity and no parodies of existing songs. "Vulgarity is  just too easy, too often done," Dubow said. "And, with the no parodies rule, we  don't want to have problems with copyright infringements -- and besides, Weird  Al Yankovic sort of has that territory covered."  </P> <P> The Stupid Song Contest is being advertised in national songwriters magazines  as well as regional publications like the L.A. Weekly and Nashville's Song  Talk. Posters and flyers are being distributed to music stores and nightclubs  in San Diego, Los Angeles, Nashville and Austin, Tex., four cities in which  Dubow, Savery and their unnamed co-conspirator have music-biz connections.  </P> <P> "We're hoping to place the album with some national label like Rhino Records;  that would be the logical choice," Dubow said. "If not, we're going to put it  out ourselves, any way we have to.  </P> <P> "We're confident that there are plenty of stupid songs out there to generate  legitimate interest, and that there are enough people who want to hear these  stupid songs to make this project worthwhile."  </P> <P> If your idea of a hip way to spend New Year's Eve involves listening to live  music, here are some suggestions:  </P> <P> * The Beat Farmers, who recorded their "Loud and Plowed and . . . LIVE!!" album  at the Bacchanal last New Year's Eve, will be at the Kearny Mesa nightclub this  New Year's Eve as well. They will ring in 1991 along with two other promising  local bands, Comanche Moon and the Travelin' Salesmen.  </P> <P> * Another fine San Diego roots-rock band, the Paladins, will be at the Belly Up  Tavern in Solana Beach. The trio has long been known for its invigorating live  shows, and because this is only its second hometown appearance in as many  months, expect it to really tear the place apart with its ferocious  rockabilly-r&amp;b hybrid.  </P> <P> The folks at Belly Up have also put together a package deal that includes a $50  gift certificate for dinner at the Boathouse Restaurant, admission for two to  the concert, a night at the Radisson Inn Encinitas, and transportation to and  from the club. The cost per couple is $180.  </P> <P> * Bobby Vinton, the sentimental pop crooner whose 30-some Top 40 hits include  "Roses Are Red (My Love)," "Blue on Blue," "Blue Velvet," "Mr. Lonely" and "I  Love How You Love Me," will headline the Hotel del Coronado's annual New Year's  Eve bash in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. Joining him will be the Bill Green  Orchestra, featuring vocalist Shirley Saunders, and Bart Hazlett and the Dixie  Hasslers.  </P> <P> Again, there's a package deal, albeit a considerably more pricey one: Dinner,  tickets to the show, a night at the Hotel Del and champagne brunch the next  day, for $545 per couple ($350 for dinner and the show only).  </P> <P> * Owners of the Pink Panther, the trendy hangout for post-punk types that's  scheduled to close for good Saturday night, are throwing a huge New Year's Eve  party at the Ramada Hotel downtown. We're talking three ballrooms, three  levels, five bars.  </P> <P> Los Angeles funkmeisters Dino Lee and His Luv Johnson, featuring the Oingo  Boingo horn section, will perform in the Thunderdome Concert Arena, along with  San Diego's Loose Barbaric Love Fish. Deejays Kelleigh Reed and George Shea  will play the latest hip-hop, house and funk dance tunes in the Nonstop  Industrial Dance Zone. And the Hoods, another local group featuring former  members of the Tell-Tale Hearts and the Trebels, will play vintage r&amp;b, ala  the Yardbirds and early Stones, in the Fab Lava Lounge.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Rhino Records has released a promotional CD to stir up press  interest in Buddy Blue's upcoming solo album, "Guttersnipes 'n' Zealots," due  out in February. The CD includes an interview and four songs from the new  album. It's being sent to rock critics and radio stations all over the country.  . . .  </P> <P> Mojo Nixon has a new backup band, the Toadlickers. Three of the four members  were formerly with the Neptunes, which for several years was one of the top  roots-rock bands in Austin, Tex. The local looney tunesmith and his new  colleagues just wrapped up a two-month U.S. tour with a Dec. 13 appearance at  the Belly Up Tavern. . . .  </P> <P> Thirty years ago this month, "Angel Baby" by Rosie and the Originals, the first  San Diego rock band to have a national hit, entered Billboard's Hot 100 singles  chart. The tune eventually peaked at No. 5. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: Blues Deluxe, featuring Southside  Johnny, Doug Hamblin, Marc Jordan, Rick Slosser and Dave Hayes, tonight at the  Belly Up Tavern; Mary's Danish, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern; Beat Farmers,  Friday and Monday at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Bonedaddys with Mango Bang,  Friday at the Belly Up Tavern; Dread Zeppelin with Lock Up, Saturday at the  Bacchanal; Poison with Warrant, Sunday at San Diego Sports Arena; Eddie Money  with the Down Beat, Sunday at the Bacchanal; and Bhundu Boys, Sunday at the  Belly Up Tavern.  </P></p>

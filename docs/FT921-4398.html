			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian bank to expand overseas BANCO do Brasil, Brazil's largest bank, is to step up its overseas operations to take advantage of the country's re-emergence into the international financial community. This follows its recent accords with the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club. 'We believe Brazil will take off this year and we want to make sure we're at the vanguard,' said Mr Emilio Garofalo, the bank's international director. As a start, the bank plans a Dollars 150m Eurobond issue next month, in what will be its first entry on the international capital markets since 1981. Mr Garofalo said the bank hoped to lead Eurobond issues of Brazilian private companies, and has already had requests for Dollars 400m. 'The principle objective is to prolong the debt profile of Brazilian companies so they are paying 12 or 13 per cent interest per annum, which, while high by world standards, is low by Brazilian standards.' It also plans to create a new European bank, with headquarters in Brussels, to co-ordinate its 12 European agencies. 'We want to be in position to benefit from the new unified Europe with access to credit lines,' said Mr Garofalo. He said to stimulate Japanese investment, a Japan desk would be set up in the main Sao Paulo branch, and a Brazil desk in the Tokyo office. 'We want to take advantage of the extraordinary upsurge in interest in Brazil. We have branches all across the country so we know Brazil best and intend to be investors' first port of call.' Mr Garofalo said the bank was also capitalising on the large number of Brazilians now living abroad, and the increase in international operations by Brazilian companies attempting to compensate for the domestic crisis of recent years. As a result, the net worth of the bank's foreign branches has grown from Dollars 925.6m in 1986 to Dollars 3.09bn last year. Mr Garofalo described the bank's liquidity as 'the most tranquil in its history'. 'We have Dollars 6bn in Brazilian debt, but Dollars 6bn of resources; so for the first time we do not need funding to sustain our portfolio.' However, the bank is under scrutiny by the federal audit tribunal, which is demanding increased efforts to collect Dollars 1.56bn in debts owed by sugar mill owners and fuel alcohol producers. A court could order the blocking of the bank's accounts.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Observer: Well matched Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission is always being attacked for its lack of clear direction, so the government deserves some credit for its imaginative choice of new commissioners. Chris Chope, a former minister and before that leader of Tory flag-waving Wandsworth borough council, has been paired with Margaret Hodge, former leader of Islington borough council (no Tory councillors at all at the last election). Both are undeniable local government heavyweights, unlike the other commissioners, and have a public stature to rival Sir John's. Chope has a reputation for attacking unnecessary costs in local government - a subject dear to Sir John's heart - while Hodge is a veteran of numerous rows with the government over poll tax capping. Hard to believe that this deadly combination will help the commission's increasingly disobedient chairman toe the government's party line.</p>

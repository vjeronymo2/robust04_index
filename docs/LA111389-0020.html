			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLTS LOSE THREE FUMBLES AND FALL TO BILLS, 30-7  </P> <P> Three fumbles in the game's first seven minutes Sunday gave Indianapolis Colt  Coach Ron Meyer a mountainous problem.  </P> <P> "As I said coming in, it looks like a very steep hill," Meyer said in reference  to Indianapolis' playoff chances after a 30-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills. "It  looks like Mount Everest right now."  </P> <P> The Colts (4-6) are three games behind the first-place Bills (7-3) in the race  for the AFC East title and two games behind second-place Miami.  </P> <P> "It is best when you control your own destiny," Colts' offensive tackle Chris  Hinton said. "But now we have to win the rest of our games and we also need  some help from other teams if we are going to catch Buffalo."  </P> <P> The game's turning point may have come on the opening kickoff, when Mark Pike  ripped the ball out of Indianapolis returner James Pruitt's hands. Mickey  Sutton recovered for Buffalo on the Colt 22-yard line.  </P> <P> "That fumble was a big emotional lift for us," Sutton said. "Both teams came  out all psyched up and that play set the tone for the whole game."  </P> <P> Jim Kelly took advantage of the mistake, connecting with Thurman Thomas for the  first of Kelly's three touchdown passes on the day with only 2:12 gone in the  game.  </P> <P> That fumble was forced by a hard hit. The Colts, especially running back Eric  Dickerson, had no such excuse on the fumbles that ended their next two  possessions.  </P> <P> Leonard Smith recovered Dickerson's first fumble, giving Buffalo the ball at  midfield, and Scott Norwood kicked a 42-yard field goal to make it 10-0.  </P> <P> On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Dickerson, who didn't talk to  reporters after the game, fumbled again when the ball bounced off his knee.  </P> <P> The Bills turned that into a 40-yard field goal by Norwood for a 13-0 lead.  </P> <P> Touchdown passes of 32 and three yards from Kelly to Andre Reed in the second  quarter made it 27-0 at the half.  </P> <P> The Bills rushed for 232 yards in 51 carries. Thomas had 127 yards in 29  attempts.  </P></p>

In Sarajevo, Muslims and  Serbs have agreed on reopening three important access roads and  the strategically important bridge of brotherhood and unity --  which could mean the end of the siege. In Herzegovina's  capital, Mostar, Muslims and Croats have stopped shooting at one  another; in the Muslim ghetto in the eastern part of the city  people can once again move about freely.    For two years we could only report bad news from Bosnia,  until, in early February, following the massacre in the  marketplace, NATO issued an ultimatum to the Serbs around  Sarajevo. Since then, things seem to have started developing in  a completely new direction. It is still too early to talk about  lasting peace -- there is still heavy fighting going on around  Maglaj and Bihac. But chances that the war could come to an end  are better than ever before. This is not only confirmed by the  latest reports from the Balkans. Something else inspires  confidence: For the first time, there are mediators involved  whose voices carry weight with the warring parties, while those  whom nobody would have believed any more moved into the  background.    American mediator Charles Redman and Russian special envoy  Vitaliy Churkin have taken on the role of strategists --  representing their governments. One must remember that they  have levers at their disposal that Lord Owen and his mediator  colleague Thorvald Stoltenberg never had. And this is the only  reason that the Americans could mediate the federation agreement  between Croats and Muslims. Both sides had something to lose:  Zagreb had to be afraid of sanctions, and the Bosnian  Government knows that it depends on the Americans' support.    The relationship between Belgrade and Moscow runs along  similar lines: The Serbs see Russia as their only potential  patron and thus have to follow the demands of the Russian  Government. Belgrade has to accept that Moscow is not pursuing  pro-Serbian policies mainly in the sense of a Slav brotherhood,  but that it wants to mediate peace.    What is the progress so far worth? The agreement between  Croats and Muslims is comprehensive, and it tries to regulate  life in the common federation almost down to the rotation  principle for the village mayors. But this does not mean much.  Earlier plans had laid down grand principles too; refugees were  to be allowed to return to their homes, the results of "ethnic  cleansing" were not to be accepted. The problem was that nobody  wanted to keep these principles. What is important is that both  sides will have to take things seriously this time -- because  they will feel American pressure. If this pressure eased off,  their enthusiasm for peace could die down very quickly.    Also, this pact can be an interim solution at best, because  none of the major issues have so far been at the center of  negotiations. The issue of distribution of territories made all  earlier mediations fail. In Vienna it was agreed that the  federation is to make up 60 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Considering the share of the Muslim and Croat populations in  Bosnia, this would be a just solution. But: The Serbs would have  to give up part of their captured territories.    This means that the most difficult task still lies ahead of  Churkin and Redman. They will have to get the Serbs to  participate in the talks on possible solutions as quickly as  possible. In doing this, they will once again have to use  pressure. It has already been signalled to Belgrade that it has  a clear choice: Either it gets the Bosnian Serbs to compromise,  or it will remain isolated in the long run.</p>

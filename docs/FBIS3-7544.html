There is no question that the world body is showing its age  and urgent reforms have to be carried out to bring it more in  tune with the current scenario and be more responsive to its  members' aspirations. Indeed, it is a wonder that while nations  are rising and falling, governments and societies are changing  and history written and rewritten since its founding, an  organization supposed to be at the forefront of these  developments has been allowed to retain and be saddled by the  relics of its past.    The first anomaly which might have served its purpose in the  past but which should have been discarded once it outlived its  usefulness and which has been found to be inimical to the  interests of the majority of its members is the Security Council  and the composition of its members. It is the heart of the  organisation as it has been given powers far greater than the  General Assembly to which all members belong. In matters  involving world peace no action can be contemplated without the  agreement of the Security Council. Its members of 15 countries  literally can, and in many cases, have ignored the wishes of the  majority in the General Assembly.    Of the 15, five are permanent members dating back to the day  of its formation and 10 are rotating members elected every two  years from the rest of 179 countries. As if that is not  anomalous enough the permanent members have assigned to  themselves the veto power. If just any one of them, acting on  sectarian and narrow national interests, choose to exercise it,  it could effectively frustrate and paralyse the organisation.  This has happened so often in the past that in due course it  has goaded many nations to press for reforms of the world body.    For this very reason Malaysia and many other reform-minded  countries have targeted the Security Council. Our permanent  representative has called for the restructuring of the council  to bring equitable representation and ensure fairness to all  nations which in turn should forge a new consensus on power and  burden- sharing. The current over-representation -- seven  members in the council from the Western and European group of 47  countries and the remaining eight seats from the rest of 132  countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America -- is unacceptable.    While the question of the equitable representation, which  will mean an increase in the membership of the Security Council  is important, equally important are issues pertaining to  permanent members and the veto power they wield. Are these  relevant at all and should not they be done away with for good  in these days of democratic rights and equality?    By right, the proposed reforms to make the United Nations  more democratic should be welcomed and readily accepted by  nations which have otherwise appointed themselves champions and  guardians of democracy but who seem to be singing a different  tune when their narrow self-interests are being questioned.  Malaysia and other reformers should not be discouraged by the  opposition shown by the big powers and slacken their efforts.  In time, an unreasonable stand, however stubborn, against what  is right and just surely will be embarrassed into acceptance.</p>

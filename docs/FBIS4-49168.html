			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ying Qian (2019 6197)] </F>   [Text] Washington, 2 May (XINHUA) -- In meeting with Zou  Jiahua, visiting vice premier of the Chinese State Council, on  the afternoon of 2 May in Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen said there are many points in common between the  United States and China and hoped the two countries could  establish long-term and constructive relations of friendship and  cooperation.    Lloyd Bentsen welcomed Zou Jiahua's visit. He happily  recalled his visit to China not long ago and said he saw great  changes taking place in China and he gained a lot from the visit.    Lloyd Bentsen held that the United States and China should  expand cooperation in various fields because it is not only in  accord with the basic interests of the people of the two  countries but also conducive to peace and development in the  Asia-Pacific region and the world.    Zou Jiahua pointed out that the current level of relations  between China and the United States are the result of joint  efforts of the two countries. The two sides should cherish such  relations. He said: Since the Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last  November, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in  various fields have made headway. However, the two sides should  continue their efforts to further improve and develop relations  between the two countries.    Zou Jiahua hoped both China and the United States would,  based on the fundamental interests of the people of the two  countries, gradually overcome their differences at present  through negotiations, set their eyes on the future, and promote  the healthy development of relations between the two countries.</p>

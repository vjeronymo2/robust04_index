			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Twenty years of muddle over pensions - Pensions Correspondent Eric Short, who retires this week, looks at the industry he has covered for nearly two decades WHEN I started writing on pensions nearly two decades ago the UK pensions scene was in complete turmoil. As I leave the pensions world today, it is still in a state of chaos in spite of the best endeavours over the intervening 20 years of the government, the European Community and industry practitioners. At the beginning of the 1970s, there were two worlds for pensions - those employees in occupational pension scheme who could look forward to a good pension if they stayed with their employer until retirement - and those who had to rely on totally inadequate state benefits. While everyone agrees that there should be one world in pensions, no-one can agree on how to reach it. Twenty years ago, the political vision was for a comprehensive state scheme providing earnings-related pensions - complemented by occupational schemes - and individual provision for those such as the self-employed. After three abortive attempts, the notorious State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme, known as Serps, was started in 1978. Those of us who should have known better, thought this was a pensions framework, which, with improvement, could provide the necessary stability to enable people to receive adequate pensions. That stability proved to be extremely brittle. Although the benefits provided under Serps are far from generous, the present Tory administration says they would present too large a financial burden on the working population by 2020. So in the late 1980s pensions were back in the melting pot. Sir Norman Fowler undertook his famous review, the result of which was the emasculation of Serps, the ending of compulsory membership of occupational pension schemes and the introduction of a new style personal pension which could be used to opt out of Serps. Indeed, employees not previous contracted-out of Serps were entitled to receive a 2 per cent incentive contribution, labelled a bribe by the Labour party and trade unions, if they used a personal pension to contract-out of Serps. Under the present framework, the involvement of the state in pension provision has been severely cut back and individuals have to make their own arrangements to get an adequate retirement income. The government can claim success for its changes in that about four million employees have contracted-out of Serps with personal pensions, though at a cost estimated at Pounds 6bn to the National Insurance fund  - a bonanza for life companies and their salesmen. However, this framework is extremely unstable. Elements in the Conservative Party want the government to continue its reforms by abolishing Serps. There are also whispers that state benefits should be cut even further by enabling people to opt out of the basic pension. The Labour Party is pledged to return to 1978 by restoring Serps to full benefits, ending incentive payments and making it impossible for employees in the future to use a personal pension to contract-out of Serps, though existing arrangements will continue. One can sympathise with the appeal by Alan Fishman, chairman of the Association of Consulting Actuaries, for a national pensions policy which would agree in broad outlines the level of pension to be provided and the roles of the various groups in providing that pension. However, I feel that a national pensions policy is as remote as a political consensus on how to finance local authorities. The government has two major pension difficulties to settle - equalising pension ages and resolving the question of who owns and operates company pension schemes. Last year's European Court judgment in Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange has forced company schemes to have a common retirement age and equal benefits for men and women, though there is still confusion about the phasing-in of this equalisation. Social pressures and employment policy have already influenced many schemes to bring in a common pension age and some degree of flexibility in age at which employees retire. However, although the debate on equalising pension ages in the state scheme commenced in earnest in the mid-1970s, the government has given no indication about whether and how it intends to move away from the present system of a pension age of 65 for men and 60 for women, with no facility to take the state pension before these ages. One feels that the lack of action by the government is because it does not know how to change without incurring immense logistical and financial difficulties and upsetting a many women voters. I fear that nothing will happen until the government is forced to equalise by the European Community - and the relevant third draft directive on this subject has already been several years in gestation without any sign of birth. Company pension schemes providing salary related benefits have enjoyed substantial surpluses arising from the favourable investment conditions in the 1980s and reduced membership caused by widespread redundancies. Such companies have taken contribution holidays which have caused resentment among members who did not receive a corresponding share of the surplus. The result has been a debate about who owns the surplus and the correct relationship between employer, trustee, employee and pensioner in the management of schemes. A series of High Court judgments over the past two or three years on various aspects of this difficulty have failed to produced a clear answer. Legislation appears inevitable.</p>

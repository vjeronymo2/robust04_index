			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Selling of BP Some further determined and sizeable selling pressure, said to have emanated from the US, was thought to have been behind the heavy turnover and underperformance of British Petroleum shares. They eventually settled a net 4 off at 365p, roughly in line with a poorly performing oil sector. However, it was the weight of the selling pressure which caught dealers' attention, with a block of 7.7m shares sold into the market early on, followed by a series of smaller blocks via the inter dealer broker system. Oil specialists said the big US energy funds had continued to lighten their holdings in BP, one of the FT-SE 100's best performers over the past 18 months, ahead of the company's fourth-quarter and full-year figures scheduled for February 2. They also pointed out that UK institutions were happy to increase weightings in BP. Shell Transport continued to attract widespread selling, closing 6 off at 718p. 'They feel awful,' noted one specialist. What discouraged oil analysts was the sector's performance against a marginally firmer oil price, which was trading around the Dollars 14.35 a barrel mark towards the close, boosted primarily by the continuing cold weather in the US.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Late rally enlivens uninspiring day Wall Street In spite of lower bond prices, US share prices ended the week mostly firmer yesterday, although it took a late rally in blue-chips to drag the market out of its summer doldrums, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.56 at 3,753.81, at its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also rallied late to end up 0.74 at 454.15, while the American Stock Exchange composite finished up 1.51 at 431.55, and the Nasdaq composite down 0.20 at 721.36. Trading volume on the NYSE was 275m shares. The market opened in a subdued mood, in large part due to computer problems, which delayed the start of trading on the Nasdaq market for almost two-and-a-half hours. Sentiment, however, was affected by early declines in the bond market and a modest drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the D-Mark. The day's economic news was mixed, with a 0.5 per cent gain in June industrial production warmly received but a jump in the June capacity utilisation rate from 83.5 per cent to 83.9 per cent - the highest level since June 1989 - deepened concern about inflation. A mid-morning rally in bonds which temporarily pushed the 30-year yield down below 7.5 per cent, failed to stimulate much interest, and the market ignored a retreat in bonds later. It was only a last minute rush of demand for blue-chips that added some respectability at the close of an uninspiring day. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 57 as investors began to worry about the company's second quarter earnings, which are due out next Thursday. Other big technology stocks were also weaker, with Hewlett-Packard down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 76, Compaq off Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 34 3/8 , and Unisys Dollars  1/8 lower at Dollars 8 7/8 . Hardest hit was Texas Instruments, which tumbled Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 80 1/4 after a big increase in second quarter net income to Dollars 184m failed to satisfy investors, who were troubled by the company's forecast of a likely moderation in the semiconductor market. The decline in the stock hit other semiconductor issues, with Motorola down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 49, National Semiconductor off Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 17 3/4 and Dallas Semiconductor down Dollars 2 at Dollars 16 3/8 . Altera, quoted on the Nasdaq market, dropped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 25 1/2 . Canada Toronto stocks closed with little change in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index was off 2.33 points, to 4,193.41. Winning issues led losers today by 404 to 308. Volume was 53.209m shares and trading value was CDollars 683.5m. Financial services and mining were lower, consumer products and energy were steady and golds and industrial products were higher. Brazil Brazilian stocks pushed up after another poll for the October 3 presidential election showed former economy minister Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso cutting the lead of the left-wing candidate. Growing confidence in his introduction of a new currency at the start of this month, and the rise on Wall Street also helped the Bovespa index to close 634 up at 40,799 in heavy turnover of 300m reais (Dollars 317.4m).</p>

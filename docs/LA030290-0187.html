			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AFTER 8 SEASONS, 'NEWHART' BIDS FAREWELL, DESPITE CBS URGING  </P> <P> Bob Newhart said today that he'll say goodby to Vermont after eight seasons as  innkeeper and talk show host Dick Loudon on CBS' Monday night comedy "Newhart."  The series will end production in April with the filming of its 184th episode.  </P> <P> CBS advised both Newhart and MTM that it wished the series to continue into a  ninth year, but demands made by MTM, the British- owned television company  which produces "Newhart," complicated the deal, according to an MTM spokesman.  Discussions are already underway between CBS and Newhart's representatives for  a series commitment to be activated within a year or two.  </P> <P> "Our series was the perfect example of how much fun episodic television can be.  We've had a wonderful cast, great writers and the spirit of family which made  coming to work a pleasure," said Newhart.  </P> <P> "If my experience in ending this series is similar to one I had upon completion  of 'The Bob Newhart Show' (1972-1978), I know that first I'll miss the  comraderie of the group, second, I'll enjoy several months of rest and playing  stand-up performances around the country, and then I'll be anxious to develop  another project that brings me back to television."  </P> <P> Newhart has starred in other television series: The original "The Bob Newhart  Show," comedy and music series in the early '60s; "The Entertainers," an hour  variety program in the late '60s; the previously mentioned "The Bob Newhart  Show," where he played Chicago psychologist Bob Hartley.  </P></p>

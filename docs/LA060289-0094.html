			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF BALTIC ANNEXATIONS PLANNED  </P> <P> The Congress of People's Deputies moved Thursday to investigate whether the  Baltic republics willingly joined the Soviet Union, after historian Roy A.  Medvedev and other deputies charged that the Kremlin forcibly annexed them and  then doctored the truth.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, responding to a request from an Estonian  deputy, supported setting up a commission to look into whether secret clauses  in a 1939 pact with Nazi Germany assigned Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to the  Soviet Union, paving the way for annexation a year later.  </P> <P> "The Baltic republics are stirred up by this issue. It is not an easy question,  but we should not evade it," Gorbachev told the congress on the seventh day of  its inaugural session. "There should be both a political and legal analysis."  </P> <P> But the Kremlin chief said he doubted that the peoples of Lithuania, Estonia  and Latvia had opposed joining the Soviet Union five decades ago. "This is  hardly the case," he said.  </P> <P> The United States has never formally recognized the move.  </P></p>

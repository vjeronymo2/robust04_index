			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Caldera accuses international media of 'anti-patriotic' campaign Mr Rafael Caldera, president of Venezuela, said at the weekend that his country was the target of a 'detestable, perverse and anti-patriotic campaign' carried out by 'certain sectors' through the international media, Joseph Mann reports from Caracas. Mr Caldera who began a five-year term in February of this year, did not say what those 'sectors' were. However, he and other officials have indicated in the past that some supporters of former President Carlos Andres Perez, who was forced out of office in 1993, have used the media to sully the image of the new administration. Official references to an international 'campaign' have surfaced several times. Earlier this year, Mr Caldera said that Venezuelans who used the international press to attack the country were 'traitors' and 'criminals'.</p>

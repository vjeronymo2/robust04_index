			<p>CSO     [Text] Bombay, February 12--A plant for recovery of uranium  from phosphoric acid is proposed at Alwaye, Kerala, where a  pilot plant set up by the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre is in  operation for about three years.    The technology used is developed by BARC [Bhabha Atomic  Research Center], which will be joining hands with a few  fertiliser companies in putting up the plant. The project report  is under consideration.    The pilot plant is in the campus of FACT (Fertilisers and  Chemicals Travancore Limited), which is one of the companies  interested in the new project. SPIC [expansion not given] and  Paradip Phosphates are said to be the others. The proposed plant  will be put up adjacent to the factory.    India is one of five countries to have the technology for  extracting uranium from phosphoric acid produced by fertilisers  companies. The rock phosphates used by the companies contain  some amount of uranium which has to be recovered to make the  acid as also the effluents radiation-free.    There is also interest abroad in the BARC technology. For  instance, the chairman of the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission,  during his visit to the city last month, evinced a keen interest  in getting the technology. The proposal is being examined.    A special reference to the technology was made by Mr A.N.  Prasad, director of BARC, at the inaugural function yesterday of  the three-day national symposium on "organic reagents--synthesis  and use in extractive metallurgy," organised by the Board of  Research in Nuclear Science (BRNS).    While Prof M.M. Sharma, director of the University  Department  of Chemical Technology, dealt with the important role played by  solvent extraction in the field of extraction metallurgy, Mr  Prasad highlighted applications of solvent extraction techniques  for nuclear and common metals and materials production and  processing.    Prof Sharma stressed the need to take into account  techno-economic aspects while developing production processes  for various organic reagents.    Dr C.K. Gupta, director, materials group, BARC, recalled the  pioneering work by the Uranium &amp; Rare Earth Extraction  Division  in the field of solvent extraction and synthesis of organic  reagents used in the process and said technology for production  of some organic solvents was ripe for passing on to industry.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE END OF A BATTLE ROYAL  </P> <P> A 2 1/2-year-old girl has won the right to the first name Princess after a  battle royal between her parents and officials from Buckingham Palace and the  Scottish bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Princess Dulcima Rosetta Manwaring-Spencer claims no royal connections but her  parents liked the name and never imagined they would run into problems with the  Royal Family and the government.  </P> <P> But Audrey and Hugh Manwaring-Spencer emerged triumphant when Scotland's  registrar general of births, deaths and marriages recently backed down and  decided there was no authority banning names such as Princess.  </P> <P> "They're very pleased that it's finally been resolved and they can finally call  their little girl Princess," said Martin Johnson, a family spokesman. "They  always assumed common sense would prevail."  </P> <P> Princess and her parents remained unavailable for comment to the non-paying  media. They were on their farm on the Isle of Skye off Scotland's west coast,  which is better known for its rugged beauty than its courtly graces.  </P> <P> Shortly after the girl was born on July 5, 1986, the registry clerk on the Isle  of Skye duly recorded Princess Dulcima Rosetta on her birth certificate and she  was baptized with those names.  </P> <P> "We simply liked the name," Mrs. Manwaring-Spencer said last year when the  battles began. "Every family argues over what to call their children. We liked  Princess."  </P> <P> The birth certificate was sent to the registrar general in Edinburgh, which  replied five months later saying the name was unacceptable because its use was  part of the "Crown's royal prerogative." Officials demanded that the  Manwaring-Spencers, tenant farmers with four children, hand over their copy of  the certificate.  </P> <P> They took up the challenge and wrote to Queen Elizabeth II. In December 1987,  royal aide Robert Fellowes wrote back: "You may rest assured that you have  caused no offense to the queen and you may continue to use the word as your  daughter's Christian name."  </P> <P> But three weeks later, Fellowes wrote again to inform the Manwaring-Spencers  that the 1965 Scottish birth registration law ruled out the name Princess.  </P> <P> They continued their battle and last week, after an investigation by the  registrar general, the Manwaring-Spencers were informed that the name Princess  could remain on the registry of births, said a Scottish Office spokesman.  </P></p>

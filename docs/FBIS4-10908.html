			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "TCS News" program] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government announced last week that  Salvadorans were excluded from the list of preferences to obtain  U.S. resident visas. The Foreign Ministry has explained what  this measure means:    [Begin Deputy Foreign Minister Rafael Alfaro recording] El  Salvador was not excluded due to a lack of preference or as a  political measure against the country. This was a measure to  provide an opportunity to countries that have a lower number of  immigrants in the United States. [end recording]    This decision does not in any way affect the treatment  Salvadorans receive in the United States.    [Begin Alfaro recording] This does not mean any delay,  because there is the [word indistinct] program, which grants  Salvadorans the possibility of working while it is in effect.  It was previously known as the [word indistinct]. In this  case, I think this is directed more toward citizens of countries  of Eastern Europe, Africa, or other continents. [end recording]    The deputy foreign minister also announced the creation of a  tourist card for U.S. citizens who want to visit the country.    [Begin Alfaro recording] This will benefit the country not  only concerning immigration, but it will also help tourism.  This will enable anyone to buy a tourist card with dollars.  [end recording]    The card might cost $10 and will be sold at travel agencies  and U.S. airports. It is hoped it will become effective before  the end of President Cristiani's term.</p>

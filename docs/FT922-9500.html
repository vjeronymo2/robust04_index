			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / White House reviews domestic policy in wake of riots THE Bush administration is working on a new domestic policy programme to deal with problems exposed by last week's violence in Los Angeles and to counter criticism of its lack of ideas or action. President George Bush, who left for Los Angeles last night for a two-day visit to tour the riot-torn areas of the city and discuss reconstruction measures with local officials and community leaders, said he wanted new ideas, not a continuation of existing welfare programmes that have not worked. 'It is far more important to give people a piece of the action than it is to have the federal government simply dump largesse on them,' he said. The Republican administration has been put on the defensive by criticism of its neglect of urban problems during 11 years in the White House. Party strategists had been hoping the violence in Los Angeles would rebound to their advantage by heightening concerns over law and order, a traditional Republican strength. But the haste with which the administration has struggled to define a new urban policy agenda reflects a worry that voters might blame the incumbent president for failing to tackle the underlying social problems. The debate over how best to respond to the Los Angeles riots has now erupted into a partisan argument over the social safety net programmes of the 1960s and 1970s. Mr Bush's Democratic opponents had at first reacted cautiously to the riots, fearful of the dangers of appearing to politicise the issue. Goaded by the White House's attack on President Lyndon Johnson's 'Great Society' programmes as the cause of today's urban problems, however, the Democrats have punched back. 'When domestic problems become too visible to ignore, all this administration does is look for somebody else to blame. First it was Jimmy Carter, today it's Lyndon John-son. Who is next? Grover Cleveland, maybe?' sneered Congressman David Bonior, Democratic whip in the House of Representatives. Mr Bush said yesterday that he did not want to 'play the blame game,' but went on to reaffirm his criticism of Great Society programmes. The administration has, however, shifted its position to emphasise that it has increased spending on many of these programmes, such as Medicaid and food stamps. 'Every single agency of the federal government is spending more today than it was in 1980 and spending more than it was in 1988,' said Mr Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development. Mr Kemp has long been the principal, and sometimes only, advocate within the Bush cabinet of a more active domestic policy agenda, based on the 'empowerment' of poor people by helping them accumulate capital to buy homes and start businesses. His ideas are now likely to receive more enthusiastic support from the White House as it seeks to play up Mr Bush's response to domestic problems. The programmes have their critics, but the more devastating charge against the president is that he is once again following a pattern he has perfected in his three years in office: create a paper trail by proposing legislation, do nothing to push for its enactment, then blame the Democratic- controlled Congress for not passing it.</p>

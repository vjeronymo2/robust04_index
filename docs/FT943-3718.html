			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / BR freight revenue hit by dispute The signal workers' strikes are causing more problems for British Rail than for its industrial customers, many of which have found alternative ways to transport bulk materials, it emerged yesterday. But the stoppages are damaging customer confidence in rail as an alternative to road transport at a time when the opening of the Channel tunnel should provide positive images of rail transport. 'Freight customers are questioning whether they should continue to give their business to the railways when we cannot deliver,' Mr John Welsby, BR chief executive, says in the latest edition of Railnews, the staff newspaper. Mr Welsby put the weekly loss of freight revenues at Pounds 1m and said BR had lost freight contracts worth a total of Pounds 3m. BR estimated that it had been able to run only 10 per cent of trains carrying bulk freight in the north-east of England on strike days and only 60 per cent in the south-east. Railfreight Distribution, which moves container trains from the ports to inland terminals, had moved only 20 per cent of its normal volumes. Trainload Freight North East said the strikes were costing it Pounds 200,000 a day in extra overtime and other expenses, but the most serious damage was being done to rail's reputation in the longer term. Railfreight Distribution said it had been unable to develop Channel tunnel business as it had hoped. Bell Lines, a shipping company, said it was unable to make long-term commitments to customers about its Channel tunnel service. British Steel described the strikes as 'an inconvenience' but said it had moved much of its transport to road after the 1984 miners' strike. But ARC, the aggregates company, said difficulties in moving shipments from its Mendips quarries to depots in the south-east meant some depots had almost run out. Meanwhile, on the eve of the next two consecutive days of disruption, Railtrack again warned signal workers that they faced losing up to Pounds 1,700 a year of their pension entitlements from September 30 if agreement on restructuring had not been reached.</p>

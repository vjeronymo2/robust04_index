			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> VERDI REQUIEM FOR ROSSINI IS REBORN IN U.S. PREMIERE  </P> <P> The collaborative Requiem Mass that Verdi planned for the first anniversary of  Rossini's death suffered a death of its own, and now a resurrection more than a  century later.  </P> <P> Written in 1869 by 13 Italian composers, the "Messa per Rossini" encountered  insurmountable obstacles that prevented its premiere as scheduled, and the work  was never heard until German conductor Helmuth Rilling led a reconstruction  last year in Germany and Italy.  </P> <P> The United States premiere came Thursday as Rilling led the Stuttgart Bach  Choir (Gachinger Kantorei), the New York Philharmonic and a quintet of  impressive vocal soloists in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York.  </P> <P> A performance tonight will be televised at 10 p.m. (PST) on KOCE Channel 50, in  Orange County, and at 8 p.m. on KPBS Channel 15, in San Diego. (KCET, Channel  28, in Los Angeles, will not carry the broadcast.)  </P> <P> Conducting from memory, Rilling led an incandescent first performance. But this  is not to say that the work is a masterpiece.  </P> <P> With 13 composers involved -- each wrote a different movement according to a  prearranged plan, and all of them, except for Verdi, have vanished into  obscurity -- the work is uneven and presents some glaring stylistic  differences.  </P> <P> The sudden chromaticisms and expanded orchestration (full brass section -- four  horns, four trumpets, three trombones and tuba -- plus cymbals and gong) in  Carlo Pedrotti's "Tuba Mirum," for instance, come as quite a jolt after the  tamer musical idioms of Antonio Buzzola's "Requiem" and Antonio Bazzini's "Dies  Irae."  </P> <P> And who would guess that the saccharine "Lacrymosa" for unaccompanied male  voices and the ensuing severe, academic fugal "Amen" are by the same Carlo  Coccia, the oldest composer represented in the work?  </P> <P> Even Verdi's contribution, the "Libera Me," familiar in its revised form in his  "Manzoni" Requiem, offers disconcerting surprise. The earlier version contains  passages edited out later, including little brass fanfares in the "Dies Irae"  section; correspondingly, there is new material in the later version.  </P> <P> Listeners also will sense something different in parts of the soprano solo,  even if not everyone will realize that she is singing a half-tone lower than in  the later version.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most obvious and significant difference is that the basses -- not  the soprano -- chant the final "Libera me domine di morte," ending the work by  encompassing mankind communally rather than from an individual point of view as  in the revision.  </P> <P> No matter who the composer or what the style, and despite the issue of whether  or not they were first-rate, Rilling addressed them all with maximum commitment  and insight, and without a trace of condescension.  </P> <P> It is difficult to imagine that there is an ounce of musical expression or  possibility that eluded his keen vision. And the results often were  electrifying, not only in Verdi's closing section but also in Buzzola's "Kyrie"  and Pietro Platania's "Sanctus."  </P> <P> The Stuttgart chorus, augmented with 14 Americans, sang with alertness,  full-bodied tone and responsiveness to the text.  </P> <P> Soprano Gabriela Benackova brought a soaring expressivity to her solo duties,  particularly in the "Libera Me."  </P> <P> Mezzo Florence Quivar sang with power, steadiness and particular urgency in  Lauro Rossi's "Agnus Dei." (In the televised broadcast, Cornelia Kallisch is  scheduled to be the mezzo soloist. Kallisch, a young German singer, was an  impressive soloist in Bach's B-minor Mass led by Rilling on Tuesday at Avery  Fisher Hall.)  </P> <P> Tenor James Walker, an American who sang the first performances in Europe,  offered an expressive "Ingemisco," marred at times by some spread tones.  </P> <P> Baritone Jacob Will sang with warmth, power and sensitivity. Bass Brain  Matthews, in relatively minor duties, offered solid, strong support. Will and  Matthews also are young American singers.  </P> <P> The New York Philharmonic responded to Rilling's leadership with prismatic  transparency, sweetness, suavity, precision and force.  </P> <P> Whether or not the "Messa" takes a place in the repertory, at the least Rilling  has made a case that not all of these 19th-Century Italian composers deserve  the oblivion into which posterity has cast them.  </P></p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / MCC pensioners face cut in benefits as scheme closes ADMINISTRATORS for Maxwell Communication Corporation have terminated its pension plan, saying the company cannot be preserved and that there will be no source of contributions to replenish those siphoned off by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. The move will probably deprive the company's employees and deferred pensioners of benefits, leaving them to rely mainly on the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. Employees have been paying 5.75 per cent of salaries into the scheme. The independent trustee for the pension fund, Law Debenture Trust Corporation, has said it will immediately begin a legal challenge to the move. The administrators for MCC, Price Waterhouse, have found that Pounds 40m of the fund's Pounds 75m in assets are missing. In a letter to employees yesterday, Price Waterhouse said that some parts of MCC might find new owners and that this offered the best hope for its employees. However, Price Waterhouse earlier said it would not give preference to bids for MCC companies simply because they promised to honour obligations to the pension fund. Pension contributions paid by workers in January will be refunded. Meanwhile, Mirror Group Newspapers said yesterday it would wind up its pension schemes to protect its employees, and that it would 'so far as it is able' protect all current and future pensions. A new scheme for current workers would be established which would invest their contributions along with those of MGN. Winding up the scheme will force the government to pay a portion of the pensions, known as the Guaranteed Minimum Pension, providing an indirect cash infusion to the scheme. MGN has asked British International Helicopter to contribute a 'substantial' sum to the pension fund to cover the scheme's shortfall in assets for its own employees. BIH workers and pensioners are members of the MGN scheme, but the company is a subsidiary of Robert Maxwell Group, currently in administration. The fate of these pension payments is unclear, MGN said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Federation Council approved Friday changes and  amendments of the Russian Criminal and Criminal Proceedings  Codes.    Nearly 40 articles of the former and nine of the latter were  amended. At the same time 19 Criminal Code articles were  annulled and 15 new ones included.    The Council's Constitutional Legislation and Legality  Committee issued a statement saying that among important new  articles were 17 on crimes committed by a conspiring group of  people or by an organized group and 213 (3) on terrorism that  were aimed at combatting organized crime. Article 13 on  necessary defense was revised. The notions of socialist and  personal properties were removed.    The committee said that some changes and amendments of the  Criminal Code were fundamental in that they had a bearing on the  main institutions of criminal law and would enhance the  suppression of crime.    Also Friday the Federation Council passed without debate a  bill adopted by the State Duma on foreign borrowings and credits  granted by the Russian Federations.</p>

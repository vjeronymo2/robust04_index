			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Observer: Baronial When it comes to shareholders' ballots, Trafalgar House chief executive Allan Gormly acknowledges being akin to a trade union baron in the matter of commanding block votes. True, small shareholders may vote against the official line, as Trafalgar's did over the reappointment of Touche Ross as its auditors. But the massive votes of the institutions can be relied on to toe the line. While Gormly admits the position is less than ideally democratic, that may nevertheless be as well - especially with shareholders being asked to approve yet another rights issue.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The SANDF [South African National Defense Force]  says that almost half of the MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of  the Nation; ANC Military Wing] members who reported to the  Wallmannstal assembly point north east of Pretoria had to be  turned away.    The SANDF said that their names had not been on the list  provided by Umkhonto we Sizwe. In terms of constitutional  discussions, this list was to have been provided by each armed  movement including MK and the former TBVC [Transkei,  Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] countries. Earlier, the ANC  criticized the chief of the defense force because MK officers  had not been accepted by the SANDF. Two-hundred fifty youths  claiming to MK members demonstrated in front of the ANC  headquarters in Johannesburg because the SANDF had turned them  away.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PHONE FIRMS GET CABLE TV LIFT  </P> <P> Most Americans would welcome cable television competition, according to a  Gallup Poll released today by one of the telephone companies eager to get into  the business.  </P> <P> A majority of those surveyed also said they would like to have two-way video  services -- such as movies on demand, library services and office-in-the-home  -- that could be provided through a network of high-capacity, fiber-optic  telephone lines.  </P> <P> "This is a clear indication that the public would favor competition and  innovation," said Kent B. Foster, president of GTE Telephone Operations, which  commissioned the study.  </P> <P> The poll results were released as congressional committees, beset by  constituent complaints of high prices and poor service, consider legislation to  re-regulate the cable industry.  </P> <P> A proposal by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-Mont.) would lift some provisions of the  1984 Cable Act that prohibit companies such as GTE from providing video  programming within their telephone service areas.  </P> <P> Other federal laws prohibit the seven regional Bell companies from selling  cable TV programming. In April, 1989, GTE won a five-year waiver from the  Federal Communications Commission to build a cable TV system and test a  state-of-the-art fiber-optic cable system in Cerritos, Calif., where GTE also  offers phone service.  </P></p>

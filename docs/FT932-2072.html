			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Survey of Nordic Banking and Finance (8): Insurers rocked to the core - Misjudgments have led to losses in the sector THE NORDIC insurance industry faces a period of consolidation and recovery after being rocked to its core by the dramatic events of the past three years, which have caused enormous losses to creditors and shareholders and serious damage to the industry's international reputation. Paradoxically, however, the outstanding dramas of the past year, the collapse of UNI Storebrand in Norway and Hafnia and Baltica in Denmark, had less to do with the business of insurance than serious misjudgments by the over-ambitious managements of the holding companies of the three groups. Similarly, Sweden's Trygg-Hansa SPP suffered heavy losses as a result of a large investment in Gotabanken just before the bank collapsed. But the insurance companies themselves, leaving aside the results of the holding companies, have suffered from the recession, the state of financial and property markets and collapse of the banking sector. Investment income has been slashed and there have been heavy losses on credit risk insurance, especially in Sweden. In addition, losses on international reinsurance business have been so big that the companies are cutting back drastically on reinsurance commitments. Of the six largest insurers in the Nordic region, Trygg-Hansa SPP and Skandia in Sweden, UNI-S and Gjensidige in Norway, Pohjola and Sampo in Finland, and Baltica and Hafnia in Denmark, only one, Gjensidige, made a profit last year. But the first months of 1993 have brought signs of a recovery. With interest rates falling and bond and equity markets strengthening, the insurance companies face a better year. And, of course, things are looking up, now that the mess left by the UNI-S and Hafnia raid on Skandia has been sorted out. The 43 per cent of the shares in Skandia held by UNI-S and Hafnia were sold this month to European institutional investors, which means that Skandia's ownership problems are settled and the management can concentrate on restoring the group to profit. Hafnia's insurance companies have been taken over by Codan, the Danish company controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, which has become Denmark's largest insurer with about 18 per cent of the accident market and 12 per cent of life assurance business. Hafnia Holding, meanwhile, has gone into bankruptcy. UNI-S is in the process of a financial reconstruction which will put the group, which made a profit in the first quarter, back on its feet. Baltica's and Hafnia's fates were linked. Hafnia tried to gain control of Baltica in 1990-91, buying 34 per cent of Baltica Holding before mounting the raid on Skandia. The collapse of Baltica's share price, at the same time as the value of Hafnia's 15 per cent holding in Skandia collapsed, wiped out Hafnia Holding's equity capital in August 1992. By acquiring 34 per cent of Baltica Holding, Hafnia could block decisions by Baltica's shareholders, so that when Baltica acquired the state's pensions and life assurance group, Statsanstalten, in 1991, it had to finance the DKr4bn deal with bank loans, not by raising new equity capital. Borrowing short to finance long-term investments subjected Baltica to an unsustainable liquidity squeeze. But, in the end, Baltica Holding was brought down by losses by its banking arm, Baltica Finance; by injudicious investments in office and residential property investments in Gibraltar; and by involvement in Scanexco, a Danish property investment project. Baltica Holding was reconstructed in March in a rescue masterminded by Den Danske Bank. Its stake in Baltica Insurance was reduced to 26 per cent, and the holding company's name changed to Gefion. The ownership of Baltica Insurance has yet to be finally resolved. Currently, Den Danske Bank owns 32 per cent, while Baltica Insurance owns 27 per cent of its own shares. Both these stakes must be sold to other owners within two or three years. The motive for the UNI-S-Hafnia raid on Skandia was to establish a pan-Nordic insurance giant, which, it was said, would prove a bulwark against any attempt by continental insurers to establish a commanding presence in the Nordic market. The Nordic insurers (excepting Denmark) have so far been protected by national restrictions on foreign ownership, but this protected status is coming to an end with implementation of the European Economic Area agreement between the EC and the Efta countries. Unfortunately, the raiders failed to ensure that Mr Bjorn Wollrath, Skandia's chief general manager, would play ball. The omission was crucial, as Skandia's voting restrictions in effect leave the company in the control of its management rather than its shareholders. 'The most tragic aspect of the raid is that for a generation we have lost the opportunity to form a strong pan-Nordic insurance business,' argues Mr Eigil Molgaard, director general of the Danish Financial Industry Supervisory Authority. He blames the Baltica and Hafnia disasters on the fact that the holding companies, established in the mid-1980s, expanded into business areas with which they were unfamiliar and attempted to undertake 'the almost hopeless task' of rapid expansion in the midst of an economic recession; and on incompetent management, both at supervisory board and board of director level and in some staff functions as well. The collapse of UNI-S and the Danes leaves Skandia again at the centre of the Nordic stage. Skandia owns Norway's accident insurance company Vesta and Denmark's KGL Brand. Vesta has a market share in Norway of about 16 per cent and was profitable last year. KGL Brand's market share is about 5 per cent and it made a substantial loss. Skandia has previously discussed co-operation or merger with Baltica. With a controlling shareholding in Baltica coming onto the market within two or three years, Skandia may again look at this option. But Mr Wollrath said recently that in present circumstances Skandia was not interested. International banks and investors have suffered from the events of the past year, helping to bring Nordic finance into disrepute. The largest foreign shareholder in UNI-S is also outraged by the plan to refinance the Norwegian group, which involves writing down the face value of the shares to NKr10 from NKr20 while giving existing shareholders the right to subscribe to only half the NKr1.8bn new share issue, with the rest going to Norwegian institutions. Mr Leon Genoud, chairman of Zurich's CB Capital Bank, which holds 4.1 per cent of UNI-S's shares, has described the UNI-S scheme as 'robbery' and 'killing the rights of the present shareholders'. However, if it brings retrospective comfort to the international financial community, a repetition of the events leading to the collapse of the Baltica, Hafnia and UNI-S does not seem likely. A factor in the developments is that holding companies controlling financial institutions were not subject to the finance industry's supervisory authority, although the insurance companies themselves were. That is being changed. The European Community has already approved a directive giving powers to banking industry supervisors over holding companies that control banks or savings banks. The Commission is now working hard on a directive that will do the same for the insurance sector.</p>

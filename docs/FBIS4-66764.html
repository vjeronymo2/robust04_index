			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Catherine Simon: "Murder of Two French Religious </F> in Algiers Shocks Catholic Community"; first paragraphi is LE  MONDE introduction]    [Text] At the same time that a march for "dialogue"  was taking place in Algiers under the sponsorship of about 10  political movements, some of which represent moderate Islamists,  two French religious were being murdered in the Casbah on Sunday  8 May.    Algiers--Sitting right on the sidewalk, a group of  adolescents was quietly playing dominoes. From the nearby mosque  could be heard the chant of the muezzin calling the faithful to  evening prayers. The city was calm. Algiers was winding down as  though nothing had happened. As though death were another story.    Helene Saint-Raymond, a nun belonging to the Little Sisters  of the Assumption, and Henri Verges, a Marist priest, were very  familiar with the city. Sister Helene, 67, arrived here in 1968,  while Father Verges, 64, came in 1969. Both were perfect Arabic  scholars, and they worked at the Ben Cheneb Library in the upper  Casbah--one of the few places were lycee students from the  neighborhood could gain access to books at the cost of a few  dinars. It was there, in their office, "practically before the  eyes of the young people," that they were shot to death in the  early afternoon. Their assailants, "two young terrorists armed  with automatic pistols," according to the French-language daily  EL WATAN, managed to escape.    "We are stunned. I can't find words," sighed one of their  priest friends, who himself has lived for many years in one of  those "working class" suburbs--meaning "deprived" suburbs and  therefore commonly regarded as bastions of armed Islamism. In  all, it is estimated that there are more than 400 French  Catholic religious scattered around the territory. "I pay  attention, yes, of course," the old priest added. But how can  one defend oneself in this lethal lottery that has claimed over  3,000 victims nationwide in the past two years? By restricting  one's movements as much as possible, avoiding "high-risk"  neighborhoods, and constantly changing one's residence and the  routes one takes. But those rules can be followed only by a tiny  minority of privileged individuals, whether Algerian or French.  Obviously, French religious are not in that category.  <H5>  March for `Dialogue' </H5>   Like the some 20,000 registered individuals with dual  nationality, the majority of whom are French women married to  Algerians and in many cases residents themselves of the "working  class" neighborhoods, Catholic religious are easy prey for the  supporters of terrorism.    The shock here is tremendous. Because they are French and  Christian, members of the French religious communities are the  best possible targets from the standpoint of attracting media  attention. The death of two of their number provides tragic  confirmation of what many people were refusing to see: neither  divine providence nor neighborliness protects foreigners.    The massacre of 12 Croatian nationals--of Christian  origin--in the Tamezguida region east of Algiers last 14  December profoundly shocked the Catholic community. But it did  not convince them of the need to pack up and leave. Pending the  return of Algiers Archbishop Tessier, who was in Rome at the  time, no public statement was issued in Algiers.    The spokesman for the French Government, Nicolas Sarkozy,  said that "Algeria is currently one of the most serious topics  of concern for the prime minister." In Algiers, the Ministry of  Interior firmly condemned the double murder and gave assurances  that the perpetrators would be "found and punished." It added  that Algeria, "famous for its hospitality and its respect for  human life, is not and will never be [the Algeria] of murderers."    This new tragedy in the Casbah--where French cameraman  Olivier Quemener was killed last 1 February--occurred barely two  hours after the conclusion of the silent march in support of  "dialogue" and "reconciliation" that had been organized by about  10 political parties, including the FLN [National Liberation  Front] (formerly the single party) and such "moderate" Islamist  movements as Hamas, Ennahdha, and former President Ahmed Ben  Bella's MDA [Algerian Movement for Democracy]. Is that proximity  in time and space (the Casbah is right next to Martyrs Square,  where the demonstration ended) a coincidence? According to the  most probable theory, the murder of the two religious could be  the work of "radical" Islamists hostile to all "dialogue" with  the government and eager to remind people of their presence  following the "clean-up" operations carried out by security  forces in the main cities in the Algiers region.    But extremist "bearded ones" are not the only ones opposing  the potential negotiations that the historic leaders of the  former Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) have reportedly begun in  secret with the military hierarchy now in power.    Some of the French-language newspapers have not hesitated to  denounce the "march of shame" and harshly criticize the  "conservatives" who, under the pretext of dialogue, are calling  on the nation to "shake the hands of terrorists." Judging from  what the newspapers say, the demonstration by the "reconcilers"  attracted only 20,000 people in Algiers, compared to the 100,000  who were expected. While the daily LE MATIN mocks what it  regards as a "fiasco," its rival newspaper LIBERTE sums things  up in a terse headline: "The People Did Not March."</p>

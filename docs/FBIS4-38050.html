			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's,  four-day visit to Moscow from tomorrow will mark a new milestone  in India-Russian relations. This was stated by the Indian  ambassador in Russia, Mr. Ranendra Sen, to newsmen in Moscow.  He said the process had been initiated by President Yeltsin  when he paid a visit to India in January last year. It will get  a new impetus by the prime minister's forthcoming visit.  Referring to cooperation in defense matters, Mr. Sen said there  have been positive developments and the two sides are looking  for a long-term cooperation in the supply and production of  defense spares and equipment.    Meanwhile, officials in Moscow and New Delhi are giving  final  touches to several agreements and a couple of political  documents to be signed during Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit. The  prime minister, besides holding one-to-one talk with President  Yeltsin on bilateral and international issues, will also meet  many Russian leaders.    The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level  delegation which includes Union Ministers Mr. Pranab Mukherji,  Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mr. R. L. Bhatia and Mr. Bhvanesh  Chaturvedi, and defense, finance, and foreign secretaries. Our  correspondent reports that while trade and commerce will be high  on the agenda, cooperation in science and technology, atomic  energy, defense, and tourism will also figure prominently at the  talks.</p>

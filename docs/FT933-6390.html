			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: NEC cuts year's pre-tax profits forecast to Y30bn NEC, the electronics group, has downgraded forecasts for pre-tax profits this year, cutting its estimate for the year ending next March to Y30bn (Dollars 283m) from Y50bn. NEC said the main cause was the prolonged weakness of the Japanese economy. The expected recovery in demand for personal computers had not materialised, and the slump in business activity had kept demand for communications equipment weak. Although semiconductors were seeing buoyant demand from the US and Asia, NEC was not experiencing the kind of growth in the Japanese semiconductor market that it had expected. The high value of the yen was also a factor behind the downward revision. NEC was not, however, as badly affected by the yen as some other exporting companies since it was dependent on only about 18 per cent of total sales on overseas markets. Sales in the year ending March are forecast at Y2,960bn compared with the previous forecast of Y3,030. Net income is forecast to be Y16bn rather than Y28bn expected earlier. On a consolidated basis, sales are expected to be Y3,630bn compared with a previous forecast of Y3,700bn, but consolidated pre-tax profits and net income estimates are unchanged at Y40bn and Y10bn respectively, largely as a result of strong demand for semiconductors in overseas markets and cost-cutting measures by the company. It is of 'paramount importance that the company make a profit this year', an NEC spokesman said. The company is implementing wide-ranging cost-cutting measures in an effort to avoid making a second consecutive loss. One area where the company is charging ahead, however, is the overseas semiconductor business. NEC has revised its capital spending forecast for the year for semiconductor operations on the strength of buoyant demand for memory chips in the US and Asia. It will increase capital spending by about Y10bn to Y80bn, the company said.</p>

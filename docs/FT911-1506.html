			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Cookery: The first whiff of summer salad days THE FIRST glimmers of summer produce have already appeared in the shops, but I rate these imports as pale (and expensive) imitators of the real thing. So I am happy to wait a few weeks until our own aspagarus and strawberry seasons get into full swing. Do not mistake this for an outburst of nationalistic fervour. It is a matter of the taste. Flavour and freshness are what count if you want to eat well, not show-off size and early arrival on the scene. Modest little heart-shaped scarlet strawberries grown in English fields are much more desirable than vulgar gobstopper giants from California - and tiny fragile fraises du bois grown at the feet of other plants in your own garden are the sweetest and most fragrant of all. The sappy deliciousness of asparagus is remarkably fleeting. When the stalks are truly fresh they release a lilylike scent as you scrape them for cooking. Delays render them dull and lacklustre. This is no veg to subject to jet-lag. The first of May and the start of the bank holiday season herald the awakening of summer. The urge to get out and about begins to stir in us all. Picnic hampers are brought out of hiding. Expeditions are planned. Cooks vote for shorter kitchen hours, and dishes that are quick and easy to prepare appeal more than ever. Salads would seem an obvious solution but it is too soon, too cool yet for appetites to fade and feel faint with heat. A flimsy little something light and leafy is not enough. What this hungry early summer season calls for is salads full of gutsy flavours, generously laced with ingredients you can really get your teeth into. Here are two suggestions. Both will make a substantial main course for lunch (the second is also suitable for carrying on picnics) and both can be served as a first course for a dinner party if you prefer. I am reluctant to tell you that the first one is a salad set in jelly lest you think in terms of one of those dreadful nouvelle cuisine vegetable dishes - mostly jelly, usually insipid, with the occasional art-directed bean and baby carrot, usually semi-raw, embedded in it. Such 'hunt the vegetable' dishes may have been thought up to satisfy the aesthete's eye but they do little for healthy appetites. This is a very different affair, essentially a sort of Salade Nicoise presented in an alternative guise, the ingredients simply packed into a mould and held together by pouring a little savoury jelly around them. No designer skills, no effort required - the results look impressive because the ingredients are handsome. For a final flamboyant fling, the salad can be garnished after unmoulding if you like with a blaze of brilliant colour and flavour in the form of peppery nasturtium leaves and a few of their rich red and tawny gold flowers. The second salad is one I was treated to by a great friend at a recent lunch party. Salads of spinach, bacon and quails' eggs are known and loved, as are those of duck or chicken livers with frizzy endive. She took the idea a clever step further to produce a salad chocabloc with goodies, more solids than leaves, a wonderfully felicitous melange of flavours and textures and a rich mosaic of colours. As she says, part of the charm of the dish lies in the fact that it need never be quite the same twice. There is no absolute ingredients list, no fixed weights and measures to follow. The idea is to use whatever is currently freshest and best in the market place and to your particular liking. The ingredients and quantities listed below record my choice when making the salad last weekend. They give you the spirit of the thing - an approximate ratio of leaves to meats and other goodies and the sort of dressing to consider using - to serve as a springboard for your own variations on the theme. TUNA SALAD EN TERRINE (serves 6 for lunch, more as a first course) 1 x 7 oz can of tuna fish, drained and broken into chunks; 1 x 2 oz can of anchovy fillets, drained and rolled up into spirals; 10 oz French beans, topped, tailed and steamed; 2 hard-boiled eggs, each cut into 6 wedges; 1 red pepper, grilled, skinned and cut into strips; 4 oz small cherry tomatoes; 2 heaped tablespoons capers; 14 black olives, stoned; 2 oranges; the leaves of a small bunch of basil, torn in half if large; 2 packets of aspic. Grate the zest of one orange, put it into a measuring jug with the aspic powder and pour on 1 pt boiling water. Stir to dissolve and leave to cool slightly. Squeeze the juice from both oranges. Stir this into the liquid aspic and top up with cold water to make a scant 1 3/4 pt liquid in total. Arrange some of the ingredients over the base of a 3-3 1/2 pt ring mould, bread tin or terrine, enough to quarter-fill the mould. Pour on just enough cooled aspic to 'bind' the solids and bed them down. Refrigerate for a few minutes until semi-set. Pack more ingredients into the mould, enough to half-fill it at least, cover with aspic and refrigerate as before. Repeat a third and maybe a fourth time until all the solid ingredients are used up and the mould is full. I make no attempt to arrange the ingredients in a formal pattern with layers of this, a criss cross of beans or whatever. The colours, shapes and textures of the foods are appetising enough to look lovely however haphazardly you pack them in. The only conscious effort I make is to juxtapose the blander ingredients, like eggs and beans, with the more piquant ones so that when unmoulded for serving every slice will include its fair share of savoury bite. Cover the filled mould and chill until the aspic has set to a firm jelly. Remove from the fridge half an hour or so before serving. Loosen the salad by dipping the base of the tin briefly in warm water. Dry it, run a knife around the inside edge of the tin to release the salad and unmould it onto a serving plate. A bowl of garlicky mayonnaise goes well with this. For lunch I sometimes partner the dish with a potato salad scattered with plenty of spring onions, rocket, slivers of fennel and nasturtium or marigold petals. SERIOUSLY RICH SALAD (serves 6 for lunch, more as a first course)  1/2 lb streaky bacon rashers;  1/2 lb chicken livers; 1 dozen quails' eggs; 1 avocado pear; 1 red pepper; 1 small bulb of Florentine fennel; 4 oranges; 1 1/2 dozen cherry tomatoes; 1 1/2 dozen radishes; 1 bunch of spring onions; a handful of raisins; 2 heaped tablespoons each toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds; 1 bunch watercress; 2 handfuls frizzy endive. Grill the bacon until very crisp and cut into snippets. Clean the chicken livers, cut into smallish pieces and saute until brown on the outside but still tender and pink within. Hard-boil the eggs and shell them; leave whole or cut in half. Dice the flesh of the avocado, pepper and fennel. Remove all peel and pith from the oranges and cut the flesh into segments. Slice the radishes thinly. Chop the spring onions, watercress and frizzy endive. Put the last four mentioned ingredients into a salad bowl or serving dish and dress them generously with a pungent garlicky and mustardy vinaigrette. Add all the other ingredients and toss again. Serve with good breads, home made or something like Marks &amp; Spencer's walnut bread, warm and crusty from the oven.</p>

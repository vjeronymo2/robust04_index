			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It became known that a team has been formed within  the Army to undertake a military intervention. According to  information obtained from military sources, General Dogan  Bayazit, secretary general of National Security Council [NSC],  and General Aydin Ilter, the commander of the Gendarmerie  Forces, are heading the command-level team which is taking  initiatives for a military intervention.    It was reported that there is a deep uneasiness within the  Armed Forces, and that factions have been formed and that  polarization between them has increased.    It was indicated that Dogan Gures, chief of the General  Staff, is trying to keep his post by making concessions to the  team which has set out toward an intervention.    The other faction is mostly made up of staff colonels who  are  influential in the 1st Army Headquarters in Istanbul. It is  believed that with the forced retirement of Ground Forces  Commander Muhittin Fisunoglu, who had distanced himself from the  Americans after the assassination of [former] Commander of the  Gendarmerie Forces Esref Bitlis, the way now has been opened to  the most pro-American forces in the Army.    The second faction, however, has taken a position against  Bayazit for participating in the meetings of the Masonic lodges,  and against Ilter in connection with the murder of General  Bahtiyar Aydin, Major Cem Ersever and Commander of the Tunceli  Regiment Kazim Cillioglu that followed the death of Bitlis.  <H5>  The Most Pro-American Team Is Making Preparations for a Coup </H5>   A source close to the 1st Army Headquarters told AYDINLIK:  "The two factions in the Army are clashing. Preparations are  under way for a coup. The first faction is the Dogan  Bayazit-Aydin Ilter team. This is the most pro-American team.  These are the people who are making preparations for a coup.  They will turn the elections into a bloodbath. They will  eliminate their opponents in May. They have now set out to  install Dogan Bayazit as chief of the General Staff."    General Dogan Bayazit, who was appointed as the secretary  general of NSC set up after 12 September [1980 military  intervention] as a shadow cabinet, is being described as the  "most pro-American officer." Bayazit, who despite coming from  the ordnance service rose in the Army because of his special  warfare capabilities, is known for his disregard for the law.  After having been promoted from commander of the General Staff  Operations Department to the commander of the Aegean Army, he  was unexpectedly appointed as the general secretary of the NSC.  Bayazit revamped the general secretariat. With the established  of the Public Security Unit by a decision made at the latest  meeting of NSC, Bayazit placed the civilian intelligence  organization in Turkey under his control. Bayazit's younger  brother, Admiral Vural Bayazit, is the commander of the Naval  Forces. Both brothers are pro-American and are in close contact  with the Masons.  <H5>  Gendarmerie Is the Strike Force </H5>   Commander of the Gendarmerie Forces General Aydin Ilter had  taken part in a coup attempt during the Gulf War. Ilter, who  had resigned as commander of 7th Army Corps in protest of  President Turgut Ozal, was later promoted. While still the  chief of the Ground Forces staff, he was unexpectedly appointed  commander of the Gendarmerie Forces after the assassination of  Esref Bitlis. Of all the other armed forces units, the  Gendarmerie was transformed into the most effective strike force  against the Kurdish people in the southeast. The Gendarmerie,  with its 180,000 men, has the most advanced equipment and arms.  The Gendarmerie, which in the past was the most neglected  force, has been turned into the most important force because the  regime finds itself bogged down in the Kurdish problem. In a  statement to DEFENSE AND AERONAUTICS magazine, he asked for the  total transfer of the internal security to the Gendarmerie.  <H5>  "They Will Turn the Elections Into a Bloodbath" </H5>   It is being claimed the Army team, which has set out toward  a  military intervention, will use the elections and 21 March  Nowruz [Kurdish new year] to execute its plan. The source that  provided information to AYDINLIK said: "They will turn the  elections into a bloodbath. They will provoke an Alawi-Sunni  clash. They will exploit the Sivas incident [when some 30  people died in a hotel fire last year in protest over a  conference on The Satanic Verses]. Plans are being  made for the death of hundreds of people. The government will  be incapacitated. They are planning major incidents in  Istanbul, Ankara, Sivas, Kahramanmaras, Yozgat, and Erzerum."    The officers who are opposing the coup see the latest  statement by RP [Welfare Party] deputy Hasan Mezarci and the  press' exaggeration of it as a plot hatched by the Bayazit-Ilter  team. They indicated that the distribution of the pro-Ataturk  pamphlets all over Turkey is being done by this team.    It was indicated that under pressure from the pro-coup team,  Dogan Gures, who after taking over as chief of General Staff  tried to strike a balance between the Army factions, has  extracted concessions from the government.    There are speculations that by extending Gures' term of  office the civilians are trying to win him over against coup  attempts. It was claimed that Gures is trying to keep Ilter and  Bayazit under control by appointing many of his own followers to  the Gendarmerie Forces command and NSC General Secretariat. It  is being reported that ground forces officers have been  appointed to the critical posts at the Gendarmerie.</p>

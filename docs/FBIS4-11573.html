			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Kirio Waldo Salgado M.] </F>   [Text] Because of the recent discontent within the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] ranks and the  serious contradictions that are destroying what little is left  of "the revolution," the "front" has been forced to discreetly  abandon Ruben Zamora.    Soon after the "analysis of the situation" of the social  movement became known, everything seemed to indicate that the  prevailing argument is that it is useless to continue wasting  time and money on a losing ticket which does not have the  consensus of the people to represent the interests of the  workers. Perhaps this is why in the 20 March elections the  social movement's support was so weak. But the story goes back  much further. It stems from the "General Command's" alienation  of labor leaders and peasants, who supported the FMLN  organization for 12 years, hiding many clandestine "commanders"  who -- like Zamora -- were engaged in political undercover  actions.    The madness of the leadership of the former guerrilla  movement and the vertical command structure that imposes its  decision from within the FMLN have been the main cause of the  break between union members and the political committee of what  is now a political party. This has reached such a point that  the "coalition" cannot find persons to observe the polls or  individuals to serve on the Voting Table Boards on 24 April.    This has further demoralized Zamora's team. The union  movement, intelligent and in step with democracy, does not want  to become involved in the leadership problems of an FMLN that is  deeply divided, that has made use of confrontation and the  Marxist practice of slandering its opposition. The social  movement has suggested, if not a change in leadership, at least  a renewal of its strategies, more in keeping with the  aspirations of the majority. The workers and peasants demand  from their leaders a serious dialogue, without demagoguery, in  order to better define their positions. They question the  arrogance of those "commanders" who passed to "a better life"  after the peace accords. They want an explanation for the new  ideological posture adopted in favor of imperialism by those who  betrayed the revolution in Santa Marta. The want a new  leadership born of the rank and file, with a different vision,  that will allow freedom and democracy within the organization,  and that will eliminate fundamentalist and "bourgeois" vertical  command structures that are destroying what little is left of  the revolutionary mythology.    But there are those who not want to give up their positions  because if they did they would have to return their armored cars  and sumptuous homes to the revolution. They would be inhibited  from rubbing elbows with the capitalist "bourgeoisie" that they  are serving and would lose their "class" privileges, which has  alienated them from the rank and file and the labor-peasant  movement.    The unions no longer want reprimands from the FMLN leaders.  Perhaps they are a long way from fulfilling their dreams, but  they have reached the conclusion that it is easier to achieve  them by talking directly with the democratic right wing.    They are renouncing, prematurely, any manipulation by the  FMLN, because they proved the "front" was never a reliable link  between the impoverished population and businessmen, between the  middle class and the power of the state.    Doubtlessly, the rectification of the social movement may  once again attract the sympathy of the new government. They  understand that if they are sincere and know how to ask for  things, they may reintegrate into the democratic mainstream and  contribute to strengthening important national objectives.    The breach they opened to undermine the foundation of the  Republic during their 12-year alliance with Marxist terrorism  did not improve the rank and file's living conditions. Now, in  peace and harmony, they can procure a better future for their  fellow union members within the system.    We are sure that good judgment will be the norm for the  social movement to follow. Let's hope this is not merely  rhetoric born of the contradictions of the left wing.    El Salvador will be a great and sovereign nation when the  strategy of brutality, blackmail, and Marxist dogmatism gives  way to sincerity and good judgment. We hope this will happen on  24 April.</p>

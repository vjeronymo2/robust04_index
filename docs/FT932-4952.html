			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Government widens forestry review THE GOVERNMENT is today seeking the views of interested parties on financial incentives for planting trees in Britain. This marks the widening of its review of forestry, which has until now been conducted behind closed doors. The Forestry Commission, which owns Britain's public-sector forests, is launching a rapid consultation exercise, asking for submissions by the end of July. It wants those interested to consider whether planting grants should be more closely targeted, and whether incentives should be redirected to improve the environmental value of existing forests. In March Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary and the lead minister responsible for forestry, said that a committee of officials was reviewing incentives for forestry in-vestment. The committee, he said, would also look at options for the ownership of the Forestry Commission's 900,000 hectares of woodland. Observers believe the options include privatis-ation. Environmental groups are likely to urge the planting of woodlands with a diversity of tree species, and an increase in the provision of facilities for leisure. Responses to the consultation should be sent to: Forestry Review Group, Scottish Office Environment Department, New St Andrew's House, Edinburgh EH1 3TG.</p>

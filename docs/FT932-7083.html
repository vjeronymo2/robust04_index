			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / Polish coalition feels pressure over budget POLAND'S six-party coalition government faced mounting pressure yesterday after Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister, said that she was not prepared to amend this year's budget. The former Communist SLD group has demanded budget changes, in the form of public sector pay increases, in exchange for its 60 votes which could save the government in a no-confidence motion on Friday. The motion is being put forward by the disgruntled Solidarity union group. The government, however, is bound to its budget targets, which include a deficit fixed at 5 per cent of GDP in exchange for a Dollars 660m (Pounds 428.5m) stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. The collapse of this agreement could lead to the cancellation by western governments of promised cuts in Poland's debt next year. The government can count on the support of only around 183 deputies in the 460-strong chamber, where a disunited opposition controls 258 seats. The SLD, which has already voted with the government on its privatisation plans, now needs the concessions on the budget to explain to its increasingly confused supporters why it wants to keep the present cabinet in power.</p>

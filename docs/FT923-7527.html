			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Wesfarmers lifts net profits to ADollars 63.1m WESFARMERS, the diversified West Australian agricultural group, lifted earnings and dividends strongly in the year to June 30 on acquisitions, higher sales and falling costs, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The company posted a 77 per cent net profit rise from ADollars 35.8m (USDollars 25.8m) to ADollars 63.1m in the period. Operating revenues rose by 35 per cent from ADollars 953m to ADollars 1.8bn for the same period. The annual dividend has been boosted from 14.5 cents to 26 cents a share, lifting the payout from ADollars 26.7m to ADollars 48.5m. The company benefited from its increased stake in Bunnings, the timber group, which added pre-tax earnings of ADollars 11.3m to its latest results.</p>

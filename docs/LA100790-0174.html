			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOP PADS LEAD IN O.C. STRONGHOLD  </P> <P> With just three days left to register voters for the November election, the  Orange County Republican machine is expanding its commanding lead over  Democrats in every corner of the county, even closing the gap in the only  district where Democrats now lead.  </P> <P> This weekend, both parties launched their final intensive drives to recruit new  members as they deploy hundreds of workers across the county to knock on doors,  telephone potential voters and staff registration tables at shopping malls,  swap meets and grocery stores.  </P> <P> "This is going to be hectic -- intense is a good word," said Mark Galli,  project coordinator for the Democratic Party's registration drive in Orange  County. "A lot of politics is an abstract thing . . . this is democracy at  work."  </P> <P> Nowhere in California do Republicans have a bigger lead over Democrats than in  Orange County. And since the last general election in 1988, the GOP has  increased the margin by another 2%, or about 25,000 potential votes.  </P> <P> As of Monday, 55.6% of the county's voters were Republican compared to 34%  Democrats. In the 1988 presidential election, Republicans had an edge of 54.3%  to 35.3%.  </P> <P> With such a large pool of Republican votes, the county's registration effort  has been a high priority for the state GOP as well as the gubernatorial  campaign of Republican Pete Wilson. All of the Republican candidates seeking  statewide office need as many votes as possible from Orange County to offset  predominantly Democratic areas of Los Angeles and Northern California.  </P> <P> Republican Party officials say they have spent more than $300,000 this year for  the voter registration effort for the Nov. 6 election. When Vice President Dan  Quayle visited the area last month, he attended a $1,000-per-couple fund-raiser  specifically for local voter registration.  </P> <P> This weekend, the Republican Party had more than 100 paid and volunteer workers  operating phone banks from offices in eight cities -- Huntington Beach,  Fountain Valley, Stanton, Garden Grove, Newport Beach, San Juan Capistrano,  Yorba Linda and Westminster, said Greg Haskin, executive director of the county  Republican Party.  </P> <P> The callers were asking Republican households whether every eligible resident  is registered, appealing to the non-registered people and calling Democrats as  well to try to convert them. Haskins said each office had runners deliver  registration material to any house that sounded interested in joining the GOP.  </P> <P> At least another 100 volunteers were walking door-to-door, Haskins said. And  the party sponsored several registration tables at its regional offices as well  as at grocery stores and the Orange County Swap Meet.  </P> <P> In one bold tactic, the county Republican Party recently sent a letter to  registered Democrats that read: "If you find it difficult to identify with  Democratic leaders such as (Assembly Speaker) Willie Brown, (Assemblyman) Tom  Hayden, (former Vice President) Walter Mondale and your newly elected  California Democrat Party Chairman, Jerry Brown, (Yes, that Jerry Brown), then  consider joining us."  </P> <P> Haskin said Republicans consider this year especially important to register  voters because the tallies will be used to determine the reapportionment that  is scheduled before the 1992 election. The more concentrated Republicans are in  Orange County, the harder it would be to threaten any of the existing  Republican officeholders by redrawing the district lines, he said.  </P> <P> The substantial Republican effort has increased the party's registration in  every legislative district in the county.  </P> <P> In contrast, Democrats are focusing their registration effort almost completely  in the 72nd Assembly District, the only area in the county that has more  Democratic voters than Republican. And even there, Democrats have lost ground.  </P> <P> The defeat of Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) is one of the highest  priorities for state Democratic leaders because he represents one of the most  Democratic districts in California that is still in the hands of a Republican.  The district includes parts of Westminster, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden Grove  and Stanton.  </P> <P> Republicans have had registration workers mining that area for votes year-round  since 1984. In contrast, the state Democratic Party just opened its office in  Stanton on Aug. 7.  </P> <P> As a result, Republicans are 4% closer to the Democratic registration than they  were when Pringle won the seat in 1988.  </P> <P> Democrats now have about 51.7% of the district's voters compared to 39.3% for  Republicans. In 1988, the Democratic lead was 53.6% to 37.3%. In 1984, the last  time Democrats held the seat, they accounted for 56% of the district's voters.  </P> <P> "This is Orange County -- it's tough here," said George Urch, campaign manager  for Pringle's Democratic opponent, Tom Umberg. "We bear the brunt of the whole  statewide Pete Wilson registration effort."  </P> <P> State Democratic leaders had promised to launch a $25,000 registration drive in  the 72nd District last March. Nothing was done until August and party officials  declined to say how much they are spending.  </P> <P> The Democratic project in Stanton has 18 paid registration workers. On  Thursday, they met their goal of registering 3,000 new voters. This weekend,  they set up registration tables at several stores and malls in and near the  72nd District, and canvassed door-to-door.  </P> <P> Democrats in the 72nd District have out-registered the GOP in the seven weeks  since their project was started. But they have not made up the lead Republicans  have gained, especially since the June primary.  </P> <P> "We are holding our own," Urch said. "If we just rolled over and didn't do a  thing, that margin would be huge."  </P> <P> County Democratic Chairman Michael Balmages said his party does not have any  other formal registration effort elsewhere in the county.  </P> <P> Left alone in other districts, Republicans have shown increases even in the  areas they dominated overwhelmingly.  </P> <P> GOP Assemblyman Gil Ferguson's Newport Beach district is the most Republican in  California. There, Republicans increased their 1988 margin by about 1% for the  upcoming election. They now lead in that area by 61.7% to 27.1%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHERE TO REGISTER  </P> <P> Voter registration drives will be sponsored throughout the county by both major  political parties, the League of Women Voters and the county registrar of  voters.

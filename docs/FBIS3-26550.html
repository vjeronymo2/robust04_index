The text comes  from the last essay in the recently published "Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping," Volume III.    Reviewing the significant progress China has recorded on  various fronts over the past two years and a study of the  important theoretical theses expounded in the remarks on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics was an exercise  which was indeed close to our hearts.    It is common knowledge that Deng Xiaoping is the chief  architect of China's reform and opening effort which began 15  years ago. The reform and opening policies have brought  profound changes to Chinese society. Judging from the overall  situation, however, prior to 1992 the basic conditions  concerning China's reform were that the traditional planned  economic system had broken down and the clue to a viable and  vigorous new economic structure was visible. This structure,  however, was far from being fully established. The intricate  clashes and friction occurring during the transformation from  the old system to the new became an important root cause for the  emergence of many contradictions and problems. China's reform  and opening effort at that time had obviously reached an  important turning-point which was the focus of discussion both  at home and abroad. Some expressed worry, others simply sighed  with sympathy, while still others viewed the situation with a  critical eye. Several self-proclaimed prophets claimed that  China's reform and opening cause had collapsed due to the  setback and was thus doomed to failure.    In the spring of 1992, a crucial historical moment, Deng  Xiaoping journeyed to south China on an inspection tour. The  ensuing publication of his important remarks, much like a  southerly, spring breeze instantly replacing the chilling air in  the late days of winter, injected fresh impetus and vigor into  China's reform and opening cause. Deng's south China talks  marked the turning point. China stunned the world with a  dramatic 12.8 percent increase in gross national product (GNP)  in 1992, and an even greater increase in the growth 13 percent  in 1993. While much of the world has been in the grips of an  economic recession, China's high rate of economic growth over  the past two years has turned the heads of China watchers  throughout the world and they now look at the country in  different terms.    People throughout the world marvelled as to how Deng's south  China remarks have created a so-called Deng whirlwind, a  whirlwind which thus far has not subsided. In fact, since the  publication of Deng's south China remarks, China's economy has  entered a new stage of accelerated development, the enthusiasm  of the Chinese people for reform and opening has soared to  unprecedented heights and the face of China has changed  dramatically. Those who look reality in the face can in no way  deny the fact that the common understanding reached by the  Chinese government and the public at large concerning the  irresistibility of China's reform and opening success is by no  means a fabricated boast, but instead is an indisputable fact.    Why did Deng's south China remarks have such a strong appeal  and such a profound impetus? By carefully reading the full  text, one has no difficulty in realizing that the fundamental  spirit of the remarks lies in an emancipation of the mind,  seeking truth from fact, and daring to break new ground and  experimenting to blaze a new trail and initiate new  undertakings. This, in fact, is the keynote of contemporary  China;    From the outset, the south China remarks established the  thesis that as "revolution is to liberate productive forces, so  is reform." This once again clearly defines the nature of reform  as a revolution, and has thereby once again attracted the  undivided attention of people from all walks of life and has  aroused their enthusiasm for participating in reform and opening;    In addition, the famous thesis in the south China remarks  that "a planned economy is not equivalent to socialism, nor is a  market economy tantamount to capitalism" has guided the Chinese  people to surmount otherwise puzzling theory and practice, and  led them to unswervingly proceed with promoting the formation of  a socialist market economic structure;    With regard to the fundamental tasks of socialism and the  strategic steps required for socialist construction, the most  appealing theses expounded in the south China remarks were to  "seize the opportunity for self-development," "development is a  cardinal principle" and "low-speed equals stagnation and even  retrogression." These tenets have guided us to place priority on  the correct emphasis for the tempo of development. They  represent the theoretical motivation that has helped bring about  rapid national economic development in China.    Both the domestic and foreign mass media believe that Deng's  south China talks have once again altered the country's outlook  and have made historic contributions to China's transformation  from a planned economic system to a market economic structure.  Just as the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of China  (CPC) in 1945 established Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding  thought and recorded it in Party history, the 14th National  Congress of the CPC in 1992 completed a scientific appraisal of  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and established the strategic task of using the  theory to arm the mind and unify the thinking of the whole  Party, while at the same time recording Deng's theory in Party  history. It was precisely Deng's south China talks that were  the soul of the 14th National Congress of the CPC.    It goes without saying that China will continue to advance  toward the 21st century along the road guided by Deng's theory.  People worldwide who hope to gain a profound and accurate  understanding of China and who hope to feel the pulse of the  development of China's reform and opening should carefully  analyze Deng's south China remarks and read other related works.</p>

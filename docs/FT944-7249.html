			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Direct Line The figures from Direct Line were splendid, a tribute to the company's success in pioneering the telephone-based marketing which has revolutionised the personal sector of the UK insurance industry. But for all management's confidence in the future, one can sense future stagnation. For one thing, Direct Line failed to meet its target of 2m motor customers. Then there was a slight increase in the company's expense ratio, disappointing in the light of the 48 per cent growth in premium income. All this points to growing competition in the direct sector. This is especially the case in motor insurance, where premiums are coming under increasing pressure and claims levels are set to rise after an unusually favourable patch. Direct Line remains well ahead of its competitors in terms of cost management, but margins are set to fall. These factors alone will not stop growth in pre-tax profits to Pounds 160-Pounds 170m next year and perhaps Pounds 200m in 1996. They point, however, to growing pressures which limit the scope for expansion thereafter. It is not yet clear that Direct Line's new ventures in financial services and life insurance will be able to pick up the slack. Hence the drop yesterday in the shares of Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line's parent. The shares have performed better than those of any other bank in the past two years, chiefly because of Direct Line. But as doubts about Direct Line's future growth intensify, it is likely that RBS will lose some of its premium rating.</p>

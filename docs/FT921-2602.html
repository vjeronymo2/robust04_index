			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries move higher on US industrial output data US TREASURY prices firmed yesterday following the release of a weaker-than-expected US industrial production report for February. In late trading, the bellwether 30-year bond was  5/8 higher at 99 25/32 , yielding 8.01 per cent, while the three-year note was up  1/4 to yield 6.26 per cent. US industrial production rose 0.6 per cent in the month, below the estimated 0.8 per cent the market had expected. Similarly, US capacity utilisation was reported at 78.2 per cent, below the forecast 78.5 per cent. Price movements were exaggerated by the light volume. The market initially moved lower on a report that housing starts for February had risen 9.6 per cent to a rate of 1.3m, well above forecasts. In addition, building permits rose significantly in the month, by 4.4 per cent, to a rate of 1.16m. There was little reaction to an increase of 0.3 per cent in the February consumer price index, which matched with expectations. Stripping out the volatile food and energy components, it rose 0.4 per cent. The Federal Reserve arranged overnight system repurchase agreements when Fed funds were trading at 4 3/16 per cent, above the Fed's perceived 4 per cent target. UK government bonds rallied by up to half a percentage point, helped by the Conservative party's stronger performance in the opinion polls and firmness in the US Treasury bond market. An opinion poll published in the Daily Express newspaper gave the Tories a three-point lead over the opposition Labour party. Traders said the gilt market, which fell back sharply after last week's Budget and is now seen as oversold, opened on a firmer note and strengthened during the day on futures-driven trade. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 94.31, up on Monday's close of 94.23, and traded up to 95.09 by late afternoon. In the cash market, the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 climbed from 112 5/8 at the opening to 113 7/32 . The announcement of a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 1bn for February had little impact on the gilt market, although traders said it was above expectations and seen as an indication of further deterioration in public sector finances. The market is expected to focus on tomorrow's unemployment figures and Friday's retail prices index. THE US bond market's strength helped lift German government bond prices, with the Liffe bund futures contract rising from 88.04 at the opening to 88.20 by late afternoon. Elsewhere in Europe, the Dutch bond market firmed slightly as traders reported further buying interest in the latest tap issue. The Dutch Finance Ministry's debt management agency said it had raised Fl 1.7bn of the 8 1/4 per cent Dutch bond due 2007 so far this week. The tap price, which was set at 100.05 initially, was raised to 100.10. The tap issue has attracted mainly domestic interest, as it appeals to pension and insurance funds. Traders reported switching out of 10-year issues into the 15-year tap. JAPANESE government bonds rose on rumours that the Bank of Japan was about to cut the official discount rate. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue, which opened at 5.42 per cent, traded between 5.37 and 5.42 per cent and ended the day at 5.385 per cent. The futures contract climbed from 102.50 to 102.64. Rumours that the central bank was about to cut the official discount rate by between 75 and 100 basis points circulated in the markets, and traders said the continued stock market weakness reinforced hopes of an easing in rates. Short-term interest rates edged lower, with three-month certificates of deposit trading at between 4.90 and 4.92 per cent.</p>

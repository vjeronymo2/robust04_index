			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Sport: Four views of the southern stars - Rugby / Derek Wyatt saw the best of the League and Union seasons below the equator Two weeks ago, I took one of the Sydney's new double decker trains to North Sydney to watch the rugby union semi-final between Warringah and Gordon. The ground has a Field of Dreams quality to it; it is a quaint and mellow oval which could easily double as a home for a Palm Court orchestra and it is owned not by Warringah or Gordon or by the Sydney or New South Wales RFUs but by the local council. As such it plays home at weekends to the North Sydney professional rugby league team and a host of rugby union sides, something we, in England, find unacceptable, although why we do, is hard to fathom. Although Gordon caused an upset last year by winning the Grand Final - Randwick, the best side, had done a Bath, losing their concentration, and the match, in an early round - this year they have been a shadow of themselves. Warringah, with a strongish pack and fielding the best player, Mark Catchpole (son of the legendary Ken Catchpole), at scrum-half, were favourites. The game was played under floodlights to attract a larger crowd; the first rugby league semi-final, which drew 40,000 to the Sydney Football Ground that afternoon would have offered over-powering competition. As I watched Gordon and Warringah my mind wandered, the game had little attraction for the neutral spectator and I kept thinking that I had seen parts of the ground before. It was not until later that it dawned on me that the stands had come from the Sydney Cricket Ground when the 'hill' was dug-up. In the end, in front of 8,000, Warringah emerged the winners by 29-18 though Gordon were much the better side. Warringah went on to lose to Randwick a week later. It was an unfair comparison but a week earlier I had been in the Bosch hospitality suite at Ellis Park in Johannesburg to watch Transvaal narrowly beat Western Province in the Lion Cup, South Africa's equivalent of the Pikington Cup, in front of 42,000 spectators. That day, there were 20 prospective international players on show. At North Sydney there were none. Sydney is essentially a village, you go to a bar or restaurant and bump into the strangest of people. I ran into Sir Nicholas Shehadie who was Lord Mayor of the city when I first visited in 1975 with the England rugby team. He invited me to a game that weekend, the major rugby league semi-final between Canberra and Canterbury at the SFG, where a month earlier the Wallabies had beaten New Zealand in the Bledisloe Cup with that tackle by George Gregan. There was a buzz in the air. The media was excited and at the many breakfasts, brunches and cocktail parties that morning, the talk was of the game. The ground, by Australia's best known architect, Philip Cox, ranks alongside those at Murrayfield and Old Trafford. Sir Nick chairs the trust that also looks after its neighbour, Sydney Cricket Ground. We were joined at his table for lunch by, among others, a cabinet minister and David Campese, the Wallaby back, fresh, or rather, unfresh from his French Barbarian appearance in Paris against the Barbarians. Big-spending rugby league club, Canberra Raiders, have had the most brilliant season. Their full back, Brett Mullins is the best player in the world and their line up also includes Mal Meninga, although he is well past his sell by date. Canterbury on the other hand are the local side made good, deeply embedded in the culture of their south Sydney suburb. It is not unusual for them to hold Greek or Italian family days. They have established a strong link with the underclass in Sydney and they have carefully exploited their underdog position. The game was played in perfect conditions in front of a capacity crowd of 42,000. With just under two minutes to go to full-time, Canterbury led by 17-12. At the last, they succumbed to a try by the post and with the scores level, the game went to over-time. It was heart-in-the-mouth stuff and a replay seemed on the cards until Canberra's Darryl Harrigan, a former New Zealand rugby union player, squeezed in a drop goal late-on to take the game by one point. All the talk - in South Africa, in Australia and in New Zealand - is about how rugby union will go open. No-one, that is no one administrator or player, has a blue-print that works beyond their own country. In South Africa, the revenue from the provincial games runs into millions of pounds. As a result, players are training five days a week and being appropriately enriched for their full-time commitments. Nowhere else in the world, except perhaps France, is this possible. In Australia, Nick Farr-Jones, the captain of the 1991 Rugby World Cup winners, suggested that the best solution for union, very much the poor relation to League, was to: 'replicate the cricket scenario. We have grade cricket, Sheffield Shield matches and internationals. The grade cricketer gets nothing, the state cricketer receives appearance money and the internationals are paid well. 'Rugby must do the same - club rugby doesn't have the support to pay players; state and national rugby does. We must find a way to compensate the players fairly for their efforts but l would advise against the players giving up their day-job.' Farr-Jones does not believe it would be wise for players just to play rugby and not have some regular employment. David Kirk, the All Black captain of the 1987 world cup winners, said in Wellington, where he works as the adviser to the Prime-Minister, Jim Bolger: 'The change in emphasis in the game where players are seeking payment has brought a greedier, less intelligent player into union. 'Too many of our current squad are unemployed or euphemistically employed by unions or self-employed working somewhere in the so called sports business.' Last Saturday, I watched quite the best game of rugby l have seen since the All Backs demolished London at Twickenham a year ago, when I attended the Auckland versus Otago match in New Zealand. The score, 46-30 to Auckland, belies the quality of the skills on show. This was, I was told, how Auckland, last season' champions, have been playing for three seasons and is the legacy of a previous coach, John Hart. I was fortunate to arrive in time fo the NZRFU Council's vote to decide on who would coach the All Blacks for next year's world cup. Laurie Mains, the incumbent, having lost an unprecedented four out of six Tests this season was returned by 11 votes to eight. Poor John Hart was defeated for a third time and will not stand again. The debate about the 'coach' has dominated the news for three weeks and the decision to re-appoint Mains became the lead story for the 1pm, 6pm and late evening news programmes on all three TV networks. That night, I saw a piece of graffiti: 'To win the world cup in '95, NZ needs a coach not a Lawrie.' But do not write off New Zealand yet.</p>

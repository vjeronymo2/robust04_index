Soledad] </F>   [Text] The Philippine Government has lifted all forms of  trade restrictions against South Africa, the Department of Trade  and Industry announced yesterday.    Trade and Industry Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said  the  resumption of trade ties with South Africa will jack up the  exchange of trade between the two countries to $200 million this  year from the existing cap of $50 million.    He added that Filipino businessmen can also use South Africa  as an entry point for exports to central African countries,  adding that Filipino exporters can already go into  oleochemicals, garments, electronics, and software.    South Africa can then ship in its exports of steel, coal,  phosphate rock, and capital equipment.    Moreover, the lifting of the trade embargo would also mean  the flow of South African investments into the country, said Mr.  Alcantara. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: DuPont plans nylon venture in China DuPont, the US chemicals group, said it has tentatively agreed with China's Liaoyang Petrochemical Fibre and Rhone-Poulenc of France to establish a joint venture to produce nylon salt in China, Reuter reports from Wilmington, Delaware. DuPont said it is pursuing discussions with potential Chinese partners on more than 20 projects in the areas of chemicals, fibres, electronics and polymers. The company said it now has two manufacturing ventures in China - one wholly owned facility at Shenzhen for slitting Riston photopolymer film and Tyvek spunbonded olefin, and a Shanghai joint venture to produce Londax rice herbi-cide. DuPont said a plant to manufacture electronic materials for microcircuits will start up late next year in Dongguan, Guangdong province.</p>

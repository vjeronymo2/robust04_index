			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Poland prepares for reform of economic policy THE Polish government, led by Mr Jan Olszewski, will today announce an important shift in economic policy which reflects growing popular pressures on east European governments. The new policy aims to ease the rigours of market-oriented policies which have led to rising unemployment and declining living standards, especially in state-owned industries. The strategy downgrades the fight against inflation and aims to combat the recession by raising investment and exports. It implies a sharper devaluation of the zloty to improve export competitivity and reduce imports and is part of a wider strategy to speed up the pace of privatisation. The message is contained in a policy document accepted by the government on Friday and sent to parliament at the weekend. The shift in emphasis away from the anti-inflation priorities established by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former finance minister and deputy premier, is expected to gain conditional approval from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF suspended disbursement of its Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.4bn) extended loan package last September when the budget deficit and other indices overran agreed targets. It is concerned that Poland faces a 'severe risk of a return to hyperinflation' but recognised last autumn that the country must boost export earnings to shore up diminishing foreign currency reserves. This year's plan expects inflation to slow to about 40 per cent from 60 per cent in 1991. The aim of reducing inflation to single digits, targeted by Mr Balcerowicz for 1991, has been put back until 1994. Two key elements of the plan are tougher wage controls to cut real income by 5 per cent, and higher taxes on consumer goods. Last year real wages grew by 2 per cent despite a sharp rise in unemployment, while consumer goods imports rose 126 per cent to Dollars 4.1bn on the back of a strong revaluation of the zloty. The government, which hopes to limit the expected budget deficit to Zl 70,000bn (Pounds 3.3bn), or 5 per cent of GDP, plans to raise turnover taxes on alcohol, tobacco, petrol and 'luxury' items in April. The government hopes that the increased flow of money to the economy, lower wage costs, higher exports and less competition from imports will bolster company profits, increase budget revenues and stem the threat of mass bankruptcies. Under the new plan, economic growth could range between zero and a fall of 5 per cent, according to a top government adviser, Professor Stanislaw Gomulka. Last year GDP was estimated to have fallen 8-10 per cent.</p>

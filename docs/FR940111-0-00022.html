A beneficiary of a petition is not a recognized party in such a proceeding. An application or petition presented in person by someone who is not the applicant or petitioner, or his or her representative as defined in this paragraph, shall be treated as if received through the mail, and the person advised that the applicant or petitioner, and his or her representative, will be notified of the decision.

An application which is not properly signed or is submitted with the wrong fee shall be rejected as improperly filed. Rejected applications, and ones in which the check or other financial instrument is returned as not payable, will not retain a filing date. An application or petition taken to a local Service office for the completion of biometric information prior to filing at a Service Center shall be considered received when physically received at the appropriate Service Center.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-payment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If a check or other financial instrument used to pay a filing fee is subsequently returned as not payable, the remitter shall be notified and requested to immediately pay the filing fee and associated service charge within 14 days, without extension. If the application or petition is pending and these charges are not paid, it shall be rejected as improperly filed. If it was already approved, and these charges are not paid, it shall be automatically revoked because it was improperly filed. If it was already denied, revoked, or abandoned, that decision will not be affected by the non-payment of the filing fee. A new fee will be required with any new application or petition. Any fee and service charges collected as the result of collection activities or legal action on the prior application or petition shall be used to cover the cost of the previous rejection, revocation, or other action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

An application or petition form must be completed as applicable and filed with any initial evidence required by regulation or by the instructions on the form. Any evidence submitted is considered part of the relating application or petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submitting secondary evidence and affidavits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The non-existence or other unavailability of required evidence creates a presumption of ineligibility. If a required document, such as a birth or marriage certificate, does not exist or cannot be obtained, an applicant or petitioner must demonstrate this and submit secondary evidence, such as church or school records, pertinent to the facts at issue. If secondary evidence also does not exist or cannot be obtained, the applicant or petitioner must demonstrate the unavailability of both the required document and relevant secondary evidence, and submit two or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by persons who are not parties to the petition who have direct personal knowledge of the event and circumstances. Secondary evidence must overcome the unavailability of primary evidence, and affidavits must overcome the unavailability of both primary and secondary evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Demonstrating that a record is not available. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where a record does not exist, the applicant or petitioner must submit an original written statement on government letterhead establishing this from the relevant government or other authority. The statement must indicate the reason the record does not exist, and indicate whether similar records for the time and place are available. However, a certification from an appropriate foreign government that a document does not exist is not required where the Department of State's Foreign Affairs Manual indicates this type of document generally does not exist. An applicant or petitioner who has not been able to acquire the necessary document or statement from the relevant foreign authority may submit evidence that repeated good faith attempts were made to obtain the required document or statement. However, where the Service finds that such documents or statements are generally available, it may require that the applicant or petitioner submit the required document or statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Translations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any document containing foreign language submitted to the Service shall be accompanied by a full English language translation which the translator has certified as complete and accurate, and by the translator's certification that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into English.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Submitting copies of documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Application and petition forms must be submitted in the original. Forms and documents issued to support an application or petition, such as labor certifications, Form IAP&hyph;66, medical examinations, affidavits, formal consultations, and other statements, must be submitted in the original unless previously filed with the Service. When submission is required, expired Service documents must be submitted in the original, as must Service documents required to be annotated to indicate the decision. In all other instances, unless the relevant regulations or instructions specifically require that an original document be filed with an application or petition, an ordinary legible photocopy may be submitted. Original documents submitted when not required will remain a part of the record, even if the submission was not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Request for an original document. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where a copy of a document is submitted with an application or petition, the Service may at any time require that the original document be submitted for review. If the requested original, other than one issued by the Service, is not submitted within 12 weeks, the petition or application shall be denied or revoked. There shall be no appeal from a denial or revocation based on the failure to submit an original document upon the request of the Service to substantiate a previously submitted copy. Further, an applicant or petitioner may not move to reopen or reconsider the proceeding based on the subsequent availability of the document. An original document submitted pursuant to a Service request shall be returned to the petitioner or applicant when no longer required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

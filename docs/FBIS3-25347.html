Nonetheless, last  Thursday, UN Envoy Jacques Booh Booh had reached a consensus  between all the parties concerned to proceed Monday with the  establishment of these transitional institutions, even if the  two wings of the Liberal Party [PL] could not agree on who would  represent them within these institutions. Originally, the  transitional institutions should have become operational on 31  December 1993.  <H5>  Empty Seats </H5>   On Sunday, the former single party, the National Republican  Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] did not turn up at  the meeting planned by MINUAR (the UN Mission in Rwanda -- LA  LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note), nor was the Hutu branch of the  PL, led by Justin Mugenzi, who has brought off a spectacular  reconciliation with both President Habyarimana and the MRND in  recent months. Consequently, the meeting had to be postponed  and, as a result, the institutions could not be set up on  Monday, as planned. "We do not understand this blockage," said  MINUAR spokesman Gueye.    Gueye added that the MRND "had nevertheless wanted to  present  a code of conduct for the parties at the meeting, stating that  they undertake to vote in favor of a general amnesty, and ensure  the neutrality of the administration" during the transitional  period leading up to the elections scheduled to be held around  20 months from now.</p>

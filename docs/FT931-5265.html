			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Russia, the country that lost its soul to vodka: John Lloyd reads an extraordinary book that purports to be a history of the national drink but is actually a lament on the passing of socialism 'Officials have found a uniquely Russian use for a nuclear power plant (at Nizhny Novgorod). They plan to turn it into a vodka distillery. . . But many townspeople are furious, the Tass news agency said. Nizhny Novgorod has plentiful supplies of liquor but is desperately short of heating.'  -Reuters from Moscow, February 5 1993 FROM THE reign of the tsars to the fall of communism, vodka has been part of Russia's life. It is said to have been invented by monks there. It was celebrated for its exquisite purity on the old estates, and standardised for socialist mass production. It then became a symbol of despair, mass drunkenness and inefficiency during the decline of the Soviet Union. Now, author William Pokhlebkin - in an extraordinary book called, rather misleadingly, A History of Vodka - has turned the story of the 'greatest drink in the world' into a lament for the passing of socialism in his country. The story began in the 1970s when the Soviet state was faced with challenges from foreign vodka companies. They claimed Soviet producers could not call their product vodka because the drink had first been marketed elsewhere well before the Soviet monopoly was established in 1923, following an early post-revolutionary ban. But this challenge was seen off relatively easily. Poland made a more serious claim early in the 1980s when it said vodka had been developed during its 18th century imperial period, when the nation stretched from Silesia to western Ukraine and north to Lithuania. Shaken, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade asked experts to prove Russia was first. It turned for help to the Institute of History and the Higher Scientific Research Institute of the Fermentation Products Division of the Central Department of Distilling of the Ministry of the Food Industry. They failed. Enter Pokhlebkin, a communist of the old regime who, as a civic duty, undertook 'objective historical research.' The result is this book. Without question, the cold simplicity of vodka is an invitation to toss a glassful down the throat and wait, eyes watering, for the lovely blast in the stomach as the liquor explodes. It lacks the subtleties of whisky and the bourgeois splendour of brandy but, in its craggy purity, it stands on a peak of its own. It is worth a defence. Pokhlebkin provides that - and more. He goes about his task rather as an objective Soviet examining magistrate would have described the state's case against a dissident before proceeding to take the 'evidence.' According to Pokhlebkin, western leaders were behind the first challenge, mounted in 1977 just before the 'triumphant festivities' celebrating the 1917 revolution's 60th anniversary and the adoption of the new Soviet constitution. This was done in order to 'take the gloss off the birthday of Soviet socialism.' The Polish attack was worse, coming from a fraternal state. But, in Pokhlebkin's words: 'Only now, more than a decade later, has it become clear to everyone that there was nothing accidental, or even purely commercial, about the Polish action. Anti-Soviet factions had long been gathering strength in Poland. They were closely linked with various reactionary circles in Europe and America, and it was obvious even then that they were acting as agents for the western 'vodka kings' For the Soviet foreign trade organisation, the situation was both unexpected and thoroughly unpleasant: our people were not accustomed to disputes with allies.' Pokhlebkin's knowledge of history appears not to include the invasions of Budapest and Prague but he is better on earlier periods. He says the first alcohol available in Russia was wine, imported from Byzantium and Asia Minor from the ninth century. Mead, a stronger drink brewed from honey, became widespread from the 12th and 13th centuries when wine stopped coming. When honey supplies eventually ran short, kvass, a grain-based mead, became generally popular. Pokhlebkin notes that it became 'more powerful and stupefying' by the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century - in one case, in 1382, causing the surrender of Moscow to besieging Tartars because their promises of gentle behaviour were believed by the drunken defenders. Pokhlebkin claims vodka was first produced in a Moscow monastery between 1440 and 1470, and believes this dating can be deduced from a correct reading of the socio-economic conditions at the time. Only when alcohol could shake off its identification with ritual and religion and become a commodity in a money economy; only when the state required a convenient vehicle for taxation; only when the state itself developed the apparatus for enforcing a monopoly on the drink; only when the ruling class was sufficiently intelligent and ruthless to use vodka to influence social policy - only then, within a grain-based agriculture, could vodka appear. It did - and 'acted like an atomic explosion in the stagnant calm of patriarchal feudalism.' State-employed innkeepers were instructed not to throw out drunkards but keep keep them drinking for the sake of the revenues. This caused a rift with the church, and general cynicism in society. It deepened poverty and created a drunken posadskaya golytba, or urban poor. Finally, the church, having lost its production monopoly early in the piece, was forbidden to distil vodka in the 18th century and the right passed to the gentry (who, in tsarist society, were aristocratic 'serfs' of the ruler). This added further substance to the church's negative attitude to what it regarded as the Devil's poison. Vodka was not called that universally until the 19th century when it went into full-scale industrial production: earlier, it was known widely as Russkoye vino (Russian wine). The name arose when producers, who conducted the process by which a grain distillate was diluted constantly with water (voda), applied the diminutive of that word (vodka) to their product. It quickly became general. Pokhlebkin records how the gentry, with time hanging heavy on their famously underemployed hands, introduced purifying processes for the water 'regardless of cost.' In the industrial period, other refinements were made, such as introducing aerated water. 'All of this contributed to the creation of modern vodkas: that is, of a vodka which is not simply a means of getting drunk but a complex national product embodying the historical and technological imagination of the Russian people.' The gentry, getting grain and labour more or less free from their vast estates and able to tolerate yields of less than 2 per cent, were able to pursue ways of making vodka as pure as possible - a process accelerated when the state banned the general trade in it and all production had to be for the gentry only. This cosy arrangement was disrupted by 19th century capitalism which, Pokhlebkin says, 'was disastrous for the common people.' They were deluged with cheaper-to-make potato and beet vodka, 'leading to the most unrestrained drunkenness.' To raise quality again, the state was forced to intervene and establish a monopoly at the end of the 19th century. Pokhlebkin writes: 'This policy of strict state control was continued and applied consistently after the revolution of October 1917 (and) has saved vodka as a product prepared to a high standard from deteriorating.' Evidently, Pokhlebkin does not think it worth considering that another method is used in capitalist countries to safeguard the quality of their (inferior, in his view) spirits - excise controls on private production. For him, as for so many Russians, there is nothing between the strong state and chaos. 'A monopoly on vodka has always been a distinguishing feature of strong stable regimes and tranquillity within the state,' he writes. 'As soon as something disturbs the orderly course of domestic politics, the state loses control of vodka. And as soon as vodka is torn from control of the state, all conceivable disorders break out in domestic politics. Vodka clearly constitutes an effective index of the state of health and society.' In a resounding climax, he casts aside the skimpy robes of the 'objective scientist' for the battledress of the class warrior. The true Russian drink found its ideal state from 1917 until 1937: it was, after 1923, produced but kept within rational limits by a (Communist) party morality and by severe laws against drunkenness. Only after 1937, when the production of alcohol of all kinds was expanded, did the rot begin to set in - initially among the 'so-called creative intelligentsia . . . and their hangers-on.' What happened was, according to Pokhlebkin, a kind of sub-Stalinist plot in which vodka played its role in the hands of the dictator's henchmen to help finish off the true Leninists. 'They (the henchmen) sought to undermine the puritan spirit and ideology of the Leninist old guard and of the mass of party members, and to divert the Bohemian passions of the intelligentsia into safe channels. With the help of alcohol, they sought to cripple the tongues of potential critics . . .' Still more alarmingly, 100 grams of vodka a day was issued to Red Army soldiers on demand. This state approval eroded the moral stance of the Bolsheviks, who clung to sobriety as part of what was 'essential to being regarded as a true communist.' After Stalin's death vodka prices were kept low and it was widely available in state shops. Heavy drinking spread from the intelligentsia to the working class. The state erred deeply, says Pokhlebkin, in leaving workers increasingly to their own devices (political education was cut back in the 1960s and 1970s) and, at the same time, raising wages. 'During the 1970s,' Pokhlebkin writes, 'the Soviet working class underwent a general transition to a new mentality in which there was no place for moralistic condemnations of drunkenness. Thanks to the passing of new and less draconian laws, people had come to perceive the abuse of alcohol not as a social but as a personal matter. It was no longer possible to evoke a popular contempt for drunkards.' Yet, even a state straying grievously from Leninist ways could not remain indifferent to the vast losses of production resulting from a large degree of open and generally unpunished drunkenness at work. (Since Soviet society had made no distinction between controls at work and outside of it, people naturally make little distinction between work and non-work behaviour.) Yuri Andropov, the former KGB chief who, briefly, succeeded the lax (and heavy-drinking) Leonid Brezhnev as Soviet leader, took the KGB route: harassing drunks. Mikhail Gorbachev, the idealistic back-to-Leninism leader (in his first manifestation), copied Lenin's tactic: he banned it. This excites Pokhlebkin's passionate denunciation, much of it justified. 'In the course of the anti-alcohol campaign, wine-producing state and collective farms were dissolved, thousands of hectares of vines were uprooted, wineries were shut down or assigned to other tasks, and the equipment of vodka distilleries was dismantled. All these measures were undertaken in the spirit of the dawn of industrial capitalism in Britain when illiterate and impoverished Luddites smashed the machines in the factories, thinking that it was the machines that were stealing their bread and putting them out of work.' Pokhlebkin's strange book ends with an insistence that the generally-perceived way in which Russians consume vodka - knocking it back in large quantities - is a vulgarisation practised largely by mafiosi or nouveaux riches 'who know nothing and understand nothing of Russian national culture.' He says vodka should be drunk (and indeed it should) with the salty, spicy zakuski, or tasters, which precede a Russian meal. It was, says Pokhlebkin the Bolshevik, 'during the years when domestic distilling by the gentry flourished . . . and in the high, aristocratic milieu that the proper way of drinking vodka at the table came to be defined. Vodka should be served cold, almost frozen, and drunk in small, barely-perceptible mouthfuls.' Apart from this valuable insight, Pokhlebkin's researches helped the Soviets win their case against the Poles in 1982, and to secure the right to advertise their product as vodka. 'Thus,' he notes, 'an attempt by certain foreign circles to harm Soviet commercial interests . . .ended in failure.' They are still drinking to that, from Gdansk to Vladivostok.

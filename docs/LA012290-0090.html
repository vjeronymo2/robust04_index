			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Home Savings Merger Denied: The federal Office of Thrift Supervision, as  expected, denied Home Savings of America's request to merge with a New  York-based bank that it owns, in a move that would cut its deposit insurance  premiums. The Irwindale-based thrift's merger into Bowery Savings Bank would  roughly halve Home's $47-million annual payment because banks pay much lower  deposit insurance rates than thrifts. Home said it will keep fighting for the  merger through a federal lawsuit filed last summer in Los Angeles.  </P></p>

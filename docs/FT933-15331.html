			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / War hero's desk sells for Pounds 1.76m A DESK made in 1812 for the Marquess of Anglesey, a hero of the Battle of Waterloo, sold for Pounds 1.76m at Christie's yesterday - an auction record for English furniture. The marquess lost a leg when he led the cavalry as second in command to the Duke of Wellington at Waterloo. The Regency mahogany desk is monumental in size and highly crafted with bronze enrichments and ebony and brass inlay. It was sold by the executors of the late Sir John Musker, and had been estimated at between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 600,000. Sotheby's is to hold a series of sales in October disposing of treasures from Schloss St Emmeram, Bavaria, the family seat of the princes von Thurn und Taxis. The sales are expected to raise about Pounds 5.6m.</p>

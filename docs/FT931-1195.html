			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Strong advances in Turkey and Taiwan - The performances of the world's emerging markets in February INTEREST in emerging markets shifted away from Latin America in February, with the best performances coming from Turkey and Taiwan. However, Brazil still celebrated its carnival month, comfortably leading its own region. Taiwan reacted favourably to the resignation of the prime minister, Hau Pei Tsun, and his replacement by Lien Chan, the first native born person to hold the post. Mr Peter Nankervis, of HG Asia in London, comments that the market has been the fastest growing in the region, with a 22 per cent rise in the weighted index in February continuing through to March when it reached an 11-month high. The rally was also accompanied by very high turnover. Turkey was top performer among emerging markets this year according to data supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank. It began to lift itself out of the doldrums at the end of December. Mr Kaya Didman of Baring Securities observes that the market had been looking oversold, given a fall of 52 per cent in dollar terms in 1992. Technical factors accompanied the new mood of optimism as the government cut short-term interest rates, thereby triggering a demand for equities. Mr Didman believes that while the market has recently entered a period of consolidation the outlook for the rest of the year remains favourable, given the forecast of strong corporate earnings growth. Brazil has been fortified by efforts by the new government of President Itamar Franco to press ahead with economic reforms. However, as Ms Else Derrick of Latin American Securities comments, the market's recent rally has followed precedent: in the past a rise has always preceded the announcement of a new economic programme. With Mr Franco likely to publish details of this programme before the April 21 plebiscite on constitutional change, Ms Derrick expects the market's strength to continue for another few weeks. So far, Venezuela leads this year's laggards. First Boston, in a recent strategy document, notes that the market has been volatile pending December's presidential elections. 'Given slower economic growth and higher inflation, export-orientated companies may be the best alternative in a difficult market,' it says. The IFC has launched a new set of stock indices to monitor emerging markets. The new indices will differ from existing local ones by taking into account restrictions on foreign investment. Foreigners are often legally prevented from investing in ways that locals are not, said Mr Daniel Adams, IFC vice-president. IFC will compile the indices from its database of more than 1,000 stocks in developing countries.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- IFC EMERGING MARKETS PRICE INDICES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Dollar terms                        No. of       Feb 28      % Change      % Change Market                 stocks         1993    over month    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                (30)       912.61          -6.5          -4.7 Brazil                   (70)       123.08         +24.3         +21.7 Chile                    (35)     1,883.35          -6.3          +5.3 Colombia                 (20)       966.69          -5.4         -13.5 Mexico                   (74)     1,650.78          -5.4         -10.7 Venezuela                (18)       387.33          +0.9         -14.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea             (134)       380.77          -5.0          -9.5 Philippines              (37)     1,870.90         +11.0         +16.3 Taiwan, China            (78)       605.97         +34.4         +34.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India                   (108)       329.14          -6.8          -5.0 Indonesia*               (41)        65.01          +8.8         +12.8 Malaysia                 (66)       186.90          +2.8          -0.5 Pakistan                 (65)       257.69          -5.9          -6.2 Thailand                 (58)       652.80          -3.1          +7.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                   (36)       344.24          +8.3         +17.9 Jordan                   (29)       131.47          -3.5          +1.8 Portugal**               (38)       471.64          +3.6          +9.4 Turkey***                (36)       213.80         +39.6         +40.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  Local currency terms                        No. of       Feb 28      % Change      % Change Market                 stocks         1993    over month    on Dec '92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina                (30)   50,577,988          -6.4          -4.5 Brazil                   (70)  747,608,498         +57.0         +97.4 Chile                    (35)     5,684.52          -4.8          +7.6 Colombia                 (20)     7,028.75          -4.4         -11.8 Mexico                   (74)    26,371.89          -5.7         -11.4 Venezuela                (18)     4,270.58          +4.4          -9.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Korea             (134)       366.28          -4.8          -8.7 Philippines              (37)     2,387.86         +12.9         +17.1 Taiwan, China            (78)       395.18         +37.2         +37.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- India                   (108)       798.05          -2.2          -0.0 Indonesia*               (41)        74.49          +8.7         +12.5 Malaysia                 (66)       202.66          +3.2          +0.1 Pakistan                 (65)       437.67          -4.8          -4.0 Thailand                 (58)       610.99          -3.4          +7.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Euro/Mid East  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece                   (36)       595.07         +11.5         +21.5 Jordan                   (29)       218.83          -3.2          +1.8 Portugal**               (38)       458.55          +7.6         +12.4 Turkey***                (36)     2,546.79         +44.6         +48.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Finance Corporation.

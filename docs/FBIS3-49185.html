			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mitko Bozhkov] </F>   [Text] Today the authorities are following a double  standard: They forbid political manifestations by Gypsies,  Turks, Vlakhs, and Macedonians, while they permit the DPS  [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] and a number of Christian  parties -- the United Christian Democratic Center, Christian  Agrarian Party, Christian Democratic Union, Christian Republican  Party, and others -- to operate in contravention of the  Constitution. The Sofia Helsinki Watch organization made this  assertion in its review of the state of human rights in Bulgaria  during 1993.    The association considers that the Constitutional Court  should be consulted again for a ruling on how far the DPS  conforms to the Constitution. At the last DPS national  conference Ahmed Dogan declared that the movement is "a party on  an ethnic basis," which is forbidden by the Constitution.    The association points out that at present the courts refuse  to register parties on an ethnic and religious basis.    The Sofia Helsinki Watch considers that the Political  Parties  Act is very liberal. The absence of any meaningful lower limit  for the number of members in a party permits the existence of  dozens of citizens' associations that engage political activity  in theory, but in practice mainly exist to exploit the  privileges of duty-free imports.</p>

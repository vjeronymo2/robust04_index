			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Private consumption The rules on recovering VAT on goods and services bought for private consumption are to be tightened up to ensure private expenditure does not qualify for tax recovery. There will also be a new provision relating to appeals. From now on it will be up to traders to demonstrate that Customs and Excise has behaved unreasonably in refusing tax recovery.</p>

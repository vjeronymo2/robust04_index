			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Sport: An English frenzy is on the way - How teams aim to add to their playing staffs this summer - Soccer Tomorrow afternoon, on the last day of the English league programme, Manchester United can finally take the field wearing the champion's crown. The surprise is not that they have won the prize for the second year in a row, it is that the coronation has been so long delayed. Early this year United were top by more than five wins. Yet their final triumph was delayed until the last week of the season - by dogged pursuit from Blackburn Rovers who were not knocked out of contention until they lost at Coventry on Monday. Manchester United will remain in the spotlight for another week as they pursue the double against Chelsea in the FA Cup final next Saturday. There will be time to consider their strengths and occasional frailties then. The final weeks of the season have shown that the butterflies United suffered when Leeds United closed on them in similar fashion two years ago have flown. Two years ago, while Leeds were wresting the title from United's grasp, Blackburn were clawing their way into the old second-division play-offs. It took a much-debated penalty to beat Leicester at Wembley and make Rovers founder members of the new Premier League as they were of the old Football League. Since then Kenny Dalglish, the manager, has used the millions of Jack Walker to build a title contender. Blackburn, soccer and money have always gone together. The town is the birthplace of the professional game. Rovers were founded in 1875 and turned professional five years later. They were the first northern team to appear in the FA Cup final when they lost to Old Etonians in 1882. The next year Blackburn Olympic beat Old Etonians. It was OE's sixth and last appearance in the final, the end of an era. Rovers won the following season. Hard northern cash had banished the southern amateurs. Even though Blackburn were part of football's old aristocracy, they are now the flashiest of its nouveau riche; a small-town club plucked from obscurity by an extremely wealthy fan and competing with the old money of Manchester United. The fact that the league boiled down to a contest between these two suggests that, just as in 1884, money is a key ingredient of success. But it is no guarantee. A glance down the Premier League table proves that. When Dalglish became Blackburn manager he took over a solid second division team without any stars or the large, talent-stuffed youth programmes which the glamorous clubs are able to run. In the circumstances he has spent his pile of cash with surprising patience. He has given most of the big-money signings a little while to bed down before buying the next one and he has stockpiled young talent. His squad is still shallow. In the first month the club struggled without the wonderful Alan Shearer. Over the last month the majority of its other seven-figure signings - Ripley, Batty, Gallagher, Newell - have been injured. Yet Blackburn plodded on. For the run-in, the core of the side, the central defence and midfield, was made up of men who played in the promotion team. Their sustained challenge is proof that Dalglish can coach as well as shop. His team is big, fast, tough and hard working. Its success is based on relentless pressure. It counter-attacks quickly and makes the most of corners and free kicks. Wimbledon have shown that this formula can turn a team of cast-offs and bargains into a force. Blackburn have shown that even paying players Pounds 8,000 a week need not dull their appetite. While Dalglish was turning round a second division team, his successor at Liverpool, Graeme Souness, was spending large sums of money turning a good side into a mediocre one. Souness has lost his job. So has Howard Kendall who managed Everton to two league titles. Today, Everton need to win while others lose to avoid relegation. Manchester City and Spurs also flirted with relegation. City chucked one last sack of money at the problem and staged a rally which means they should stay up. Tottenham, who scraped clear on Thursday with a win at Oldham, tried the same trick but the more players they bought the worse they played. All three clubs have been weakened by boardroom battles. All three have switched managers in the last year. All three seem locked in an eternal cycle of reconstruction. As each has slipped further behind the top teams, they have become more impatient for success but have found greater difficulty in attracting the very best players. Stability, not money, was the missing ingredient. These three clubs are part of a weak group of eight or nine clubs at the bottom of this year's Premier League. Last season, Crystal Palace were relegated with 49 points: at least eight Premier League clubs will finish with fewer points this year. Most clubs have had little problem spending the increased wealth generated by the Premier League, many have failed to translate it into improved teams. The unprecedented carnage wrought by first and second division clubs on their elite relatives in the two cup competitions suggests that the gap between the rich Premier League and the rest is not widening but shrinking. Many of the talented youngsters who shone for lower-division teams in the cups will make the leap to the Premier League this summer as clubs scramble to close the gap on United and Blackburn by spending. The tenor of the auction has already been set. Queen's Park Rangers are taking bids for Les Ferdinand, sometime England centre-forward. The asking price is Pounds 4m and United and Blackburn have their bids in as do Newcastle United, who are third and Arsenal, fourth. If George Graham, the parsimonious Arsenal manager, feels he must spend such sums on the team which won the European Cup Winners Cup with such grit on Wednesday, then English football is in for a spending frenzy this summer.</p>

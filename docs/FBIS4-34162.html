The source has  also denied rumors that Sam would be dissolved and its employees  laid off. Rafael Carbonel, general director of the labor  office, has said neither Sam nor Avianca has requested a  concurrence to fire employees. An airline source said the  merger would affect maintenance and accounting as well as  regional offices. No massive firings are planned although  certain positions will be abolished. Sam employees have also  denied their contracts had been canceled. (Santa Fe de Bogota  EL TIEMPO in Spanish 6 June 94 pp 1A, 8A)</p>

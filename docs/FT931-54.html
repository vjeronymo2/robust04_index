			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazil Brazilian shares rose another 1.9 per cent in moderate midday trade on the Sao Paulo bourse, following their 3.7 per cent gain on Monday, the Bovespa index putting on 366 to 19,155 at 1300 local time. Telebras, the state-run telecommunications company, rose 2.8 per cent to Cr591. Equities were boosted yesterday by a government decision to set a Dollars 60m cash requirement on the sale of steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN). CSN's privatisation auction is scheduled for Friday, at a minimum price of Dollars 1.6bn. The market was concerned, however, about the possibility of a higher than expected increase in March inflation after overnight call money interest rates rose to 36.13 per cent a month, from 34.03 per cent a month late on Monday.</p>

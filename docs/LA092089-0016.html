			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. CRITICIZED FOR IMPASSE ON CHEMICAL ARMS  </P> <P> On the eve of what the United States had expected to be a breakthrough on a  chemical weapons accord, the Bush Administration is coming under growing  criticism from the Soviet Union, Western European allies and Third World  countries for alleged foot-dragging on a new international treaty.  </P> <P> U.S. officials had expected acclaim for simultaneous arms initiatives at  meetings this week in Wyoming between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and at an international chemical  weapons conference here that, ironically, the United States had asked Australia  to organize in an effort to spur momentum on an accord.  </P> <P> Instead, the Administration is being sharply criticized, both publicly and  privately, for failing to move on several issues that could break a three-year  impasse on negotiations. And the spirit of cooperation between the superpowers  expected in Wyoming has been replaced by a rivalry at the Australia conference,  which opened Tuesday.  </P> <P> "This is not what we expected. We expected to be awarded, but instead we're  getting burned unjustifiably," one American delegate said.  </P> <P> The Administration has encountered its greatest criticism for refusing to agree  to a deadline for concluding a new international chemical weapons treaty.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union, France, West Germany, Australia and several Third World  nations have pressed the U.S. delegation to offer a target date for concluding  an accord on one of the world's most controversial types of weapons, most  recently used with deadly effect in the eight-year Persian Gulf War. Several  delegations came out of private bilateral talks charging that the United States  is stalling.  </P> <P> The United States is also being accused of:  </P> <P>  -- Slowing down agreements on mandatory short-notice inspections of any site  suspected of hiding deadly poison and nerve gases.  </P> <P>  -- Failing to agree to help Third World nations develop alternative chemicals  used only for peaceful purposes in an industry vital to economic development.  </P> <P>  -- Refusing to provide mandatory financial or military aid to countries  victimized by violators of a chemical warfare treaty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'As Soon as Possible'  </P> <P> "We reject charges that we are foot-dragging. We would like to complete an  agreement as soon as possible, like everyone else," Ambassador Max L.  Friedersdorf, U.S. representative to the Geneva disarmament conference, told  The Times in an interview.  </P> <P> "We feel we have taken the lead on the negotiations," he added. "When they say  we are foot-dragging, that means the U.S. does not agree with their positions."  </P> <P> But the chief delegate from a leading Western nation charged: "The Americans  have been struck by inertia for almost three years."  </P> <P> The U.S. delegation expected two specific proposals put forward here to  demonstrate the Bush Administration's commitment to a chemical weapons ban.  Instead, the Soviet Union has stolen the limelight by going even further.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, U.S. chemical manufacturers announced a five-point self-regulation  plan to prevent the spread of poison gases.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moscow Export Controls  </P> <P> The Soviet Union then revealed that Moscow has already introduced new export  controls on 40 controversial chemicals. Sales will have to carry so-called end  user certificates guaranteeing that they will not be resold or used for  development of chemical weapons. The provisions are now the strictest controls  in the world, Australian officials said.  </P> <P> The Soviet delegation chief, Nikolai P. Smidovich, also called for  international cooperation among chemical industries.  </P> <P> In a second initiative, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Clarke  proposed a new interim body to coordinate sensitive pre-verification issues. In  a speech scheduled for delivery today, the Soviets are expected to again go  further.  </P> <P> A Bush Administration official conceded before the conference began: "We are  not negotiating seriously. Strong presidential leadership is necessary to move  fast on negotiations. We could wrap it up in a year if we really wanted to."  </P> <P> The U.S. refusal to set even a target date for concluding an accord has  elicited the deepest concern here. "We were ready to try to make an agreement  this year," Smidovich said in an interview.  </P> <P> "Everyone who saw the United States hold up the negotiations over the past  three years hoped that, with a change in administrations, the U.S. would be  ready to move more speedily," he said.  </P> <P> Even U.S. officials concede that progress since 1987 had lagged in part because  of a lack of impetus from the Reagan Administration. Then, after taking office  last January, the Bush Administration argued that it needed time to review U.S.  policy.  </P> <P> "The U.S. keeps saying that there are too many details to be worked out. We  said, 'OK, how about 1992?' We were told the U.S. does not want to set  artificial deadlines," Smidovich complained.  </P> <P> The U.S. delegation has responded that it does not want to repeat the mistakes  of the 1972 biological weapons convention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Sloppy Job'  </P> <P> "We rushed to sign a piece of paper, but it sits today without a means of  verification," Clarke told the conference. "A sloppy job of verification on a  chemical weapons convention would damage the entire structure of arms control."  </P> <P> But European allies and several Third World nations claim a tentative deadline  is now needed to inject momentum into talks that have crawled along in Geneva  under U.N. auspices for 18 years.  </P> <P> "We need to feel there is commitment from the U.S.," said one Asian delegate,  who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "So far, we feel there is more talk  than action. The U.S. is prepared to address its agenda but not our concerns,  which have to be taken into account to win our agreement. It will not feel  vulnerable without chemical weapons, but we will."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 68 States Involved  </P> <P> The disagreements underscore the complexity of a multilateral treaty, the first  such attempt since the 1963 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The current  Geneva talks involve 40 nations, plus 28 observer states -- and the disparate  concerns of each.  </P> <P> Several Third World nations, which have increasingly turned to chemical weapons  as a cheaper and more accessible alternative to nuclear arms, now argue that  there is limited incentive to agree to an international ban -- particularly if  regional rivals possess the deadly toxins.  </P> <P> "If a party is attacked by someone who has developed chemical weapons  clandestinely, then we believe all parties to a treaty should commit to come to  their aid with either financial or military aid," Iranian delegate Hassan G.  Mashhadi said in an interview. "So far, the U.S. has talked only about  voluntary or humanitarian aid."  </P> <P> Iran was repeatedly the victim of Iraqi chemical weapons between 1984 and 1988,  according to U.N. reports.  </P> <P> "We need more guarantees that we will not be left exposed," Mashhadi said.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union and several other nations support collective responsibility  for victims of chemical weapon violators. As an alternative, Moscow has backed  proposals for an international fund to contribute money or support to countries  attacked.  </P> <P> "We are prepared, through the Red Cross or other agencies, to provide  humanitarian aid," Friedersdorf said. "But what some of these countries want is  for the industrialized nations to set up a slush fund. A fund is a possibility,  but we don't like the mandatory approach."  </P> <P> Another concern is that various restrictions on up to 40 chemicals -- some of  which are basic to production of everything from fountain-pen ink and plastics  to fertilizers -- will impede Third World development.  </P> <P> "The chemical industry accounts for $90 billion a year worldwide. It is the  largest industry in the world, and the Third World wants its share," said one  Latin American delegate, who requested that his name not be used. "With  restrictions, we may have a ban on simple things we are finally capable of  producing for ourselves. Then we will have to rely on buying materials that  others have. This is colonization again.  </P> <P> "Industrialized nations should be more generous in supporting us, rather than  making us more dependent," he said.  </P> <P> The U.S. delegation has countered that banning the inherent threat of chemical  weapons should be incentive enough to agree to an accord.  </P> <P> "We don't see arms control as part of a welfare program. We're not into the  game of bribing countries to sign up for a chemical weapons treaty by providing  aid or technology," Friedersdorf said.  </P> <P> Administration officials also contend that Congress would not ratify a treaty  that added what amounts to a multimillion-dollar foreign aid project. Another  problem is that the technology is in the hands of private U.S. industry, over  which the government has no control.  </P> <P> But at least one country, Pakistan, has indicated privately that it will not  agree to an accord without transfer of alternative chemical technology.  </P> <P> "The Pakistanis were quite blunt. They said that this was the price for signing  up," a U.S. official said.  </P> <P> The main dispute here between the U.S. and Soviet delegations centers on "any  time, any place" inspections of suspected secret caches of lethal toxins, an  idea first put forward at the disarmament conference by then-Vice President  Bush in 1984.  </P> <P> In 1987, during the last major breakthrough in talks, Moscow accepted the  concept. The Soviets are now charging that Washington is balking.  </P> <P> "There are concerns because of proprietary rights and the secrets of private  industry that might be violated because of intrusion," Friedersdorf said.  "Proposals have been made by various delegations in Geneva which would provide  that there be ways to protect civilian or military installations (that are) not  pertinent but which may have to be part of access during an inspection. In no  way has this slowed down talks."  </P> <P> But the Administration official conceded: "We put forth the idea without fully  thinking it through. Then the Soviets accepted it. Now we're trying to figure  out what it would mean. For example, does that include Langley (the Virginia  town where the CIA is headquartered)?"  </P> <P> A U.S. spokesman attempted to counter the criticism, saying: "We regret that  other countries have felt compelled to make unfounded charges about our  performance at the disarmament conference, which we reject. For our part, we  hope our negotiations presented in Canberra will advance the Geneva  negotiations even further."  </P> <P> But the leading Western official charged: "On each of the important issues, the  U.S. delegation has repeatedly told us over the past three years, 'We have no  instruction on that issue.' The U.S. still has a long way to go on addressing  the issues that have been on the table for years."  </P> <P> ARMS CONTROL -- U.S. policy calls for slow but steady progress. Page 12.  </P></p>

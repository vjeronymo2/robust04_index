			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / People: Inland Revenue hires critic as tax practice watchdog The Inland Revenue has made a daring choice in hiring Elizabeth Filkin as its independent adjudicator to deal with complaints from taxpayers. It can expect little respite from her once she starts work on July 1. She was chief executive from 1983 to 1988 of the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux, an organisation which has been critical of Revenue in the past. But Filkin stressed yesterday she would approach the job with an open mind. 'I come with a chunk of knowledge but not any preconceived views or assumptions. I believe the hearts of the Revenue professionals are in the right place.' The Revenue selected her in open competition from more than 700 applicants. 'I have always been interested in consumer rights and justice. And the Inland Revenue is the biggest business in Britain, with a turnover of Pounds 18bn a year,' she says. 'An organisation with 25 million phone calls a year and 400 outlets is going to have bits that go wrong,' she says. 'It is vital that we can be confident the tax system is administered as fairly and efficiently as possible and that, when mistakes are made, they are rectified.' Filkin, 52, has a broad portfolio of activities, ranging from chairing the Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Committee and membership of the Advert-ising Standards Authority. She is a director of Hay Management Consultants, focusing on customer service, and a non-executive director of the Britannia Building Society. She was director of community services and then assistant chief executive of the London Docklands Development Corporation between 1988 and 1992. At the Citizen's Advice Bureaux, she set up a national internal complaints procedure and co-ordinated the 1,000 bureaux nationwide. The Revenue envisages the position will provide a last post of appeal to deal with complaints in the way tax affairs are handled by its staff. Ms Filkin will be paid Pounds 55,000 pro rata, and is currently expected to work a three-day week.</p>

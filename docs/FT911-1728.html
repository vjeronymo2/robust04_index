			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Canada's oil and gas M&amp;A activity rises THE PACE of mergers and acquisitions in Canada's oil and gas industry soared to a record in the first three months of this year. Sayer Securities of Calgary reported that 222 deals, valued at CDollars 910m (Dollars 791.30m) were signed in the first quarter, compared with 174 in the previous three months. The biggest transaction was Gulf Canada's CDollars 100m sale of its working interest in the Caroline natural gas field in Alberta to Shell Canada. Sayer estimates that assets and companies worth CDollars 3.6bn were still up for sale at the end of March, down from CDollars 4.1bn three months earlier. Since then, however, Olympia &amp; York, the real estate and natural resources group controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family, has disclosed that it has received offers for its controlling interest in Home Oil of Calgary. Amoco Canada Petroleum has also announced plans for a further reorganisation. On the other hand, PanCanadian Petroleum, the energy arm of Canadian Pacific, has expressed interest in making a sizeable acquisition. Merger and takeover activity in Canada's oil and gas industry has been at a high pitch for the past three or four years. The main sellers have been companies such as Esso Resources, Amoco, Gulf Canada and Petro-Canada. The most active buyers have included fast-growing companies, such as Chauvco Resources, Inverness Petroleum and Poco Petroleums.</p>

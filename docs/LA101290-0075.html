He said a new drainage system  has been installed, food storage areas have been improved and new quality  control methods have been put in place during the last few weeks.  </P> <P> Over the last two years, the zoo was cited more than 100 times for various  violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the USDA.  Until recently, however, few of the violations had been corrected.  </P></p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sprint stock rises on talk of EDS link Shares in Sprint, the US telecommunications group, rose yesterday amid reports that it had been in discussions with Electronic Data Systems, a subsidiary of General Motors, about an alliance to compete in the multimedia information industry. The companies declined to comment but Wall Street analysts said such a deal could have advantages for both companies and send competitive ripples through the US telecommunications sector. Sprint share closed Dollars  1/2 higher on the day at Dollars 36 5/8 while General Motors E shares - which represent a call on EDS's dividend stream - rose Dollars   1/8 to Dollars 33. Sprint is the third largest long-distance US telecommunications group with large operations in cellular telephony and local telephone services. It is the only large North American communications company which has interests in all three areas, though other groups are tending in this direction as regulatory and commercial pressures allow them. EDS is the world's leading computing services company and operates its own global, digital communications network on behalf of corporate clients. EDS is known to have held talks on possible alliances with many of the world's leading telephone companies - including British Telecom - over the past few years. Analysts said that Sprint, with its well-known brand name and fast-growing cellular service, could give EDS a central role in US multimedia services. Speculation about the future of EDS has risen sharply over the past few days following an agreement over pension plan contributions between GM and a government regulatory agency. The agreement freed EDS from liability for GM pension contributions if EDS left the group, giving GM the freedom to sell all of the unit or a stake in it.</p>

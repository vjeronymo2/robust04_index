			<p>BFN     [Text] Fiber optics, digital telephone exchanges, antennas  for satellite communications ... the first world of  telecommunications is not far off. Actually, it is located in  Campinas, Sao Paulo, where the Telebras [Brazilian  Telecommunications Inc.] Research and Development Center (CPqD)  has been operating for 18 years. In partnership with  universities and industries, the CPqD does applied research,  which helps the Telebras System save $2 billion per year.    The CPqD's 1994 budget amounts to $113.3 million -- the  highest one since its establishment. Is so much investment  worthwhile? CPqD Managing Director Leoncio Rezende Neto answers  affirmatively. "Our cost-benefit ratio is 2,000 percent, much  higher than any other activity," he said.    Besides promoting the technological enhancement of the  companies operating in the Telebras System, i.e.  government-owned telephone companies, the CPqD develops products  and transfers them to industry. Royalties [preceding word in  English] from these transfers have already greatly exceeded $11  million. "We study everything, but we do not produce everything  since we also try to establish the appropriate conditions to  absorb foreign technology. There is no xenophobia," he said.</p>

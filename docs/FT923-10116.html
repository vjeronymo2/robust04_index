			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Sharp rise in income for World Bank THE WORLD Bank yesterday reported a 37 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 1.65bn for the year to June 30, despite charging member countries a lower borrowing rate. The bank said its variable lending rate last year fell by 13 basis points to 7.60 per cent, thanks to a more favourable worldwide interest rate environment and the bank's own strong financial performance. The bank also instituted a lending rate waiver policy, which effectively cut the spread between what it pays on borrowings and what it charges on loans, from 50 basis points to 25 basis points, for member countries with good repayment records. A similar, larger waiver has been approved for this year, which will reduce the cost of loans from 50 basis points to just 15 basis points for those countries which meet their payments within 30 days of schedule, said the bank. Bank profits rose last year because more members met their repayment obligations on schedule (partly encouraged by linking eligibility for the waiver to repayments) and because three countries - Nicaragua, Panama and Sierra Leone - cleared their arrears from previous years. The payment of arrears contributed Dollars 220m to the bank's income. George Graham adds from Washington: World Bank officials also said they planned to launch a global bond, denominated in D-Marks, this year as part of the bank's Dollars 13.5bn borrowing programme. Mr Kenneth Lay, financial operations director, said he hoped to bring a D-Mark bond to the market about the middle of the bank's financial year, which began this month.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- A long-range plan of  integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is  to be worked out by the Councils of Defence Ministers and of  Foreign Ministers of the CIS by September 9, said Vladimir  Shumeyko, chairman of Russia's Federation Council. The document  being drafted on Boris Yeltsin's initiative is to determine how  the Commonwealth develops in the areas of economy, policy and  interstate relations, Shumeyko told reporters on Tuesday.    The head of the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS  believes that the striving for closer economic cooperation was  manifested at a meeting of heads of state of CIS countries in  Moscow. He believes that the economic integration will lead to  political integration and that the concept of the development of  the CIS is important in this connection. Nazarbayev's proposal  for the creation of a Eurasian union prompts this, Shumeyko said.    Shumeyko believes that changes in the CIS regulations will  follow. Specifically, it should be stipulated that members of  the CIS should not be in a state of war with each other. He  said that Armenia and Azerbaijan are meant, above all.    Regarding the signing of the Russian-Belarussian  [Belarusian]  agreement on unifying the monetary systems, Shumeyko surmised  that there will be no objections from the Federation Council to  the ratification of the document. "It is necessary to visualise  the ways of rapprochement of member-countries of the  Commonwealth without infringing their sovereignty and freedoms,"  believes the speaker of the upper house of the Russian  parliament. He said that the growing economic closeness of  Russia and Belarus should only be encouraged as this has been  the purpose of the entire previous economic policy.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Vodafone expands into Europe - Investment of Pounds 21.75m will give telephone group 25% of NordicTel VODAFONE GROUP, the UK mobile telephone group formerly part of Racal Electronics, is investing up to Pounds 21.75m over the next two years for a 25 per cent stake in NordicTel Holdings, one of three Swedish groups licensed to operate GSM digital cellular networks for pan-European mobile communications. The move is a further step in Vodafone's ambitions to expand its presence in western Europe. It was able to obtain such a large stake in the Swedish company after an unnamed investor in the original consortium decided to back out. Vodafone is initially paying Pounds 350,000 for an 18.9 per cent stake in NordicTel and a further Pounds 150,000 which gives it an option to take another 6.1 per cent stake on or before January 1 1995. The other shareholders in the holding company are a Trelleborg subsidiary, Volvo and Spectra Physics, each with a 25 per cent stake. The UK group will inject Pounds 8.75m into the consortium's shareholders' funds this year and Pounds 12.5m in 1993. The capital injections by the other shareholders will be on a pro rata basis. Vodafone will relinquish its current 10 per cent holding in AB NordicTel, the operating company. As a result, NordicTel Holdings will have 100 per cent ownership of the operating company, with Vodafone eventually controlling 25 per cent through its stake in the holding company. The arrangement will also give Vodafone a 5 per cent stake in a Danish GSM digital cellular network which is 20 per cent owned by NordicTel Holdings. NordicTel, along with Televerket, the Swedish national carrier and Comvik, an analog network, have licences in Sweden to operate the GSM digital cellular network, which will be a pan-European network. There are more than 600,000 cellular phone users in Sweden but the current system can only be used throughout Scandinavia and is not pan-European. Vodafone thus expects NordicTel to win over a substantial number of existing users when it starts to offer its service in September. Vodafone, which has a 56 per cent share of the UK mobile telephone market, also has a 4 per cent stake in the second public sector licence in France, 80 per cent of an operator in Malta and 30 per cent of an operator in Hong Kong. It is keen to expand particularly in Italy, which is likely to issue a second licence soon, and Germany, which has said it might issue a third licence. See Lex</p>

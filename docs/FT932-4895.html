			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways Life grows no easier for British Airways, despite moves towards a settlement with Virgin. That would remove any lingering fears that the company might be shaken by further embarrassing revelations resulting from litigation in the US. But BA has now also flown into some fractious disputes with its own employees. One disagreement with its cabin staff over pay levels appeared settled last week. But an outstanding quarrel with its pilots could result in further disruption. Any more strikes would be punitively expensive. Not only would they have an immediate financial impact but they could also sap BA's reputation for quality and service. Trading figures for May already showed a small, but worrying, drop in higher yielding premium traffic. Fears of lightning strikes seemingly encouraged business passengers to switch to alternative flights. Such concerns are unsettling for shareholders considering whether to take up BA's Pounds 442m rights issue. Whatever the short term fall-out, though, shareholders may prefer BA to hang tough. City estimates suggest the airline could lose Pounds 50m at Gatwick this year. The elimination of such losses would greatly help BA's profitability. This cause will have been damaged if the fine print reveals that last week's settlement has hampered its chances of creating a low cost base for European short-haul flights.</p>

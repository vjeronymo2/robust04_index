			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister German Correa by </F> unidentified reporter in Santiago; date not given]    [Text] [ESTRATEGIA] As a militant Socialist Party [PS]  member, what significance do you give your appointment as  interior minister from the personal and political point of view?    [Correa] It is a great responsibility, a great challenge. I  hope to do a good job because this position exerts major  influence on the progress of the government. As a PS militant, I  can say that President Eduardo Frei's gesture to appoint me to  this post when I was PS president is a very clear sign of his  strong inclination for consensus and the consolidation of this  coalition [Coalition of Parties for Democracy, CPPD] that has  been so beneficial to the country. Therefore, my appointment to  this position also has a very important political and symbolic  value.    [ESTRATEGIA] Does your appointment signify official  recognition of the socialist world?    [Correa] I believe so. This brings an end to a very  traumatic  phase not only of disagreements and conflicts that culminated  violently in the 1973 military coup but to all that happened  during the 17 years of the military regime. It shows our  determination for not only analyzing, even to a heartbreaking  point, our past but also our contributions to this process. It  is also evidence of our ability to govern responsibly and  seriously by giving guarantees to all Chileans without any  distinctions. My appointment has finally vindicated our  capability to have a serious government in this country.    [ESTRATEGIA] Would it have been the same if a Christian  Democratic Party [PDC] member was appointed interior minister,  for example?    [Correa] From the point of view of the interior minister's  functions, it is inconsequential who is exercising these duties  because we must abide by what is established in the  Constitution, which is the institutional order that establishes  the duties of this post within the framework of the government  and society. This is inconsequential from this point of view.  I will be exercising this post to the best of my abilities and  strictly adhering to the Constitution and the established  institutional order.    [ESTRATEGIA] From the CPPD point of view, what is the  significance of the appointment of a Socialist to this cabinet  post?    [Correa] The CPPD has worked well. It has clearly shown its  coherence in how it governed the country during the Aylwin  administration. This coherence also will be clearly evident  during the Frei administration because there is major consensus  regarding what we want to achieve in the country.    [ESTRATEGIA] During the previous administration's first  stage, when you were a cabinet member, Senator Ricardo Nunez  (PS) charged that the government was isolating itself. Did you  agree with this assessment?    [Correa] At the time not only I but also several  administration members agreed with this PS criticism. There is  an inclination to isolate yourself, to enclose yourself in  government offices and internal government mechanisms that are  very demanding. This is why we made some self-criticism at the  time. We held several meetings in the Prieto room in this  regard. As a result, we were able to overcome this isolation  and achieve more fluent ties with people outside the government  and have greater contact with people.    [ESTRATEGIA] How will you keep this from happening, because  President Frei has stressed the idea of governing in the field?    [Correa] We are aware of this constant danger, but in this  case we have anticipated events. Moreover, we have a president  whose style is to work in the field, and very soon he will be  putting this into practice. But of course one has to follow the  boss because he is the leader.  <H5>  Realistic Agenda </H5>   [ESTRATEGIA] As chief of the political cabinet, given that  the Socialists wanted to stress the political-institutional  calendar, up to what point do you agree with the preestablished  agenda?    [Correa] President Frei has been very clear about this. That  apparent controversy among some CPPD member parties was solved  when we all agreed to prioritize economic and social subjects.  In this field we have the Aylwin administration's experience  that clearly shows that the right firmly opposes certain kinds  of reforms. What we must do is feel the water before jumping  into the pool of reforms; we must first work and seek a point in  common with the opposition, establish a dialogue, and discuss  things.    Some other reforms, like to again allow the president of the  Republic to appoint Armed Forces commanders, are very  controversial. There is no agreement about this, and we will  have to work more slowly and with more patience on it, seeking a  consensus. The issue here is rhythm and strategy in order to  make progress toward objectives that are not shared by all.    [ESTRATEGIA] Minister, don't you think that by postponing  such subjects we are running the risk that something similar to  what happened with the Senate president election might happen  again?    [Correa] No. The decision is not to postpone the issue but  to  begin working on it now, in a manner so as to obtain results.  Because what could we do now? Send the same draft bills that  were rejected by the right and put them on Congress' agenda,  perhaps with some changes, and then go to the fight? We will not  gain anything from such a position. The most important thing is  to establish a dialogue with the opposition, see what country we  want from the political and institutional point of view, without  seeking advantages, within normal democratic dynamics between  government and opposition.    [ESTRATEGIA] From your point of view, what reform do you  consider the most urgent one?    [Correa] There is a package of four very important reforms  connected to the National Security Council's composition, the  Constitutional Court, and the president's ability to appoint the  forces of order and Armed Forces commanders.  <H5>  Public Security </H5>   [ESTRATEGIA] What is the meaning of the interministerial  committees that will be created, as announced by the government,  and specifically what will be the differences from the former  administration's work?    [Correa] The former government had experience with  interministerial committees. They are institutions that allow  mutual dialogue and knowledge among the ministries, and they  also allow the coordination of projects and the collective  adoption of decisions so as to establish priorities in public  investments in different fields; besides, they allow better  administration.    We will continue with that positive experience and make some  changes to it to guarantee greater efficiency and continue  making progress. An important concrete change is the division of  the social-economic committee into a social committee and an  economic committee. The interministerial social committee will  concentrate mainly on poverty problems. It also has a very  important characteristic because it is directly presided over by  the president of the Republic. This shows the importance the  government assigns to a frontal confrontation of the country's  poverty problem.    [ESTRATEGIA] In addition to poverty, citizens also are  greatly concerned about an issue handled directly by your  ministry: public security. What measures will be adopted to  improve public security?    [Correa] We will start by studying the important measures we  inherited from the previous administration on an important work  they achieved: the proposed social safety plan...    [ESTRATEGIA] Excuse me, sir, but when did the past  administration achieve this?    [Correa] Quite a lot of progress was achieved but there is  obviously much more to be done. Much progress has been achieved  by increasing police personnel and equipment but a lot remains  to be done in this field. We must continue the training  programs for police cadres, and achieve greater community  involvement in public security activities not merely by  establishing private guard groups but by adopting a different  attitude toward citizens' participation in social safety.    There are many undetected social attitudes that promote  crime  such as the lack of preventive measures, and inconsiderate  common behavior encouraging criminal activities that increase  the job of the police, thus making it very difficult for them to  perform well. There is a major task regarding the activities to  be carried out by police and by society in general if we are to  achieve a safer and more peaceful society.    [ESTRATEGIA] As for the terrorist issue, what is the  government's assessment in this regard?    [Correa] The government's assessment is positive. A lot of  progress was made in this regard during the previous  administration. There was coordinated work among police  institutions and the government itself. This resulted in the  dismantling of violent groups, which today are in precarious  shape. Nevertheless, no one can declare victory because all  these groups need to be active is a small armed group of daring  individuals and the element of surprise to cause a tragic  incident.    At any rate, these groups have experienced a major  diminishment of their capability to undertake action.  Nevertheless, we must always be alert and continue  consolidating democracy. Ultimately, what matters is to prevent  these groups from spreading in our society. This will be  achieved through growth and development, the creation of jobs  for the young, giving more opportunities to people, and the  defeat of poverty.    [ESTRATEGIA] Some sectors believe that the granting of  pardons is synonymous with impunity. Can the granting of  pardons harm the fight against terrorism?    [Correa] I don't think so. We must not overlook the fact  that the CPPD as a whole -- not only the Aylwin administration  and now the Frei administration -- at the proper time clearly  established the differences between a political prisoner and  terrorist violence. The ruling party coalition unanimously  agreed by consensus that as 11 September 1990 -- when, as is the  case of President Aylwin's election, a Chilean Government  elected by the will of the people in a democratic election was  installed -- democracy was fully restored in Chile with all its  shortcomings. Therefore, these actions cannot continue to be  portrayed as political crimes as such but as outright terrorist  actions. In view of this, President Aylwin implemented these  pardons.    It must be noted that during the authoritarian regime these  people were treated with an absolute lack of respect for their  basic rights. Many of these prisoners were incarcerated for  prolonged periods without due process, virtually condemning them  before the issuance of a valid court sentence. There are  dramatic cases in which, after spending years in prison, those  involved were acquitted because there was insufficient evidence  to punish them for their behavior, that is, no crime was ever  committed. In many instances, the accused served a kind of  anticipated sentence.    Now many people will issue their opinion on this matter. As  President Aylwin has always maintained, this is a matter of  conscience in the end. In one way or the other, a very tragic  chapter in the history of Chile is closing with this issue.  Nevertheless, part of this chapter is still not closed because  the trials on serious human rights violations during the  military regime, which have been confirmed by all Chileans,  still are pending. I believe that instead of harboring  resentments from such a harsh and traumatic period for our  country, all this should be part of a past we must try to  overcome so we can restore the proper guidelines of peaceful  coexistence and mutual respect.    [ESTRATEGIA] Minister, do you think the prisoners President  Aylwin pardoned recently were political prisoners?    [Correa] That is the way the coalition as a group defined  them. Their actions were politically motivated. They were wrong  in my opinion, as I made clear in my capacity as a political  leader. At the time of their crime I was president of the  Popular Democratic Movement, which was defined by the military  regime as the group making the harshest opposition to their  continuation in government. In that capacity, I was also a  strong critic of the attack against General Augusto Pinochet.    I was a member of Clodomyro Almeyda's Socialist Party and  that was not our line of action. We promoted mass mobilizations  and incorporating millions of Chileans in the democratic  struggle. This struggle finally and happily materialized in the  plebiscite. We participated in the plebiscite actively. We did  not support any direct action like the attempt to assassinate  Gen. Pinochet.    [ESTRATEGIA] Do you think the president's decision to pardon  political prisoners was correct?    [Correa] I share his decision. We must remember that his  pardon only changes their imprisonment to exile. We all know  what it means not to be able to live in the fatherland. It means  not to share in the cultural and human essence of Chilean  society. The many thousands of exiles during the military regime  know very well what it means to live outside of the country  without the possibility of returning for many years.    [ESTRATEGIA] Do you agree with the pardon as a presidential  prerogative?    [Correa] Yes. The pardon must exist as a prerogative. There  are always special cases. The prerogative must be used in  exceptional cases. It must be so as a matter of principle. I  have no doubt that presidents will use that prerogative after  carefully analyzing values, principles, and all the elements  that influenced the behavior of the person considered for a  pardon.    [ESTRATEGIA] Among President Aylwin's latest decisions,  there  was a pardon granted to an opposition party follower charged  with involvement in economic crimes. What is your opinion about  this pardon?    [Correa] Former President Aylwin must have considered the  entire group of elements defining the situation. I am not aware  of the details of the case, but President Aylwin must have  considered them carefully. He probably found among those  elements enough cause to grant the pardon in conscience.    [ESTRATEGIA] Will that practice continue during this  government?    [Correa] The pardon is a juridical institution, a  prerogative  of the president of the Republic. Each case must have  exceptional characteristics for a president to make use of that  prerogative. I trust it will always be so.    [ESTRATEGIA] One of the issues that worries the country is  corruption. Various cases of irregularities involving public  servants were reported during the past government. What will  this administration do to prevent those problems from  reoccurring?    [Correa] We must be precise in the use of terms and how we  characterize situations. I do not think there was corruption in  President Aylwin's government. There were irregularities, which  is something different from corruption as such. Some of the  cases involving alleged corruption are being investigated.    No one can close his eyes to the possibility of corruption,  no doubt about it. There are risks. There are relations between  businessmen and politicians that invite corruption. There are  situations inside a public office that facilitate corruption.  But we should not forget that for corruption to exist two  individuals must participate. In general terms, the blame  affects more the person who has been corrupted, the person who  accepted the bribe. Those who gave the bribe, and who often  initiate the corrupt act, usually are not taken into account.    This is a more complex issue. Eduardo Frei's government will  do everything necessary in the areas of supervision, prevention,  auditing, and controls. We are working on the design of specific  measures. We have been in power for a very short time.    [ESTRATEGIA] Will you also promote legislation on the  matter?    [Correa] We will do that as well. We will reinforce the  comptroller and other organizations' existing supervision  capacity.    Regarding Codelco's [Copper Corporation] case, we think  Cochilco [expansion unknown], which was responsible for auditing  Codelco, performed rather weak work. We do not think they did  their job very well. We must see that existing mechanisms work  properly in public administration. The government will have to  create responsibilities or control mechanisms wherever  supervision is weak. But above all we must transmit a message to  society, because there are multiple forms of corruption and  citizens indulge in them every day. The fight against corruption  is not the sole responsibility of the government though. We will  fight it as best as we can, but citizens also must look at their  own behavior and ethical norms.    [ESTRATEGIA] The political class has a more elegant corrupt  practice. It is called influence peddling. People from your own  party have denounced it. What do you think of it?    [Correa] In effect, we have influence peddling. When you are  in very important positions you perceive it, but you can fight  it. When I was transportation minister, I had the opportunity to  handle multi-million dollar projects. We made important  decisions, such as the one involving subway Line Five, which is  a $300 million project. We had to organize bids involving the  purchase of equipment for $100 million to $150 million. I  oversaw the bidding on Santiago's street lights, which was worth  $16 million, and many other large projects involving millions in  investments.    You can create technical commissions, involve people from  many areas to prevent government people alone from making the  decision. You can create bid evaluation teams to analyze  economic proposals and all stages of the process to grant a  contract to a company. There are ways to ensure clarity, to be  reassured, and reassure the population. All mechanisms created  to prevent conspiracies to commit corruption must be implemented.    When you do things that way you can guarantee that the risk  of corruption will be reduced to a minimum. It might even be  eliminated.    [ESTRATEGIA] But are you aware that not everyone acted in  that manner during the previous administration?    [Correa] I am perfectly aware of it, and it is very  regrettable. We must reinforce the perception of what a public  official should be and the immense responsibility that the  management of public funds signifies. Public officials are  there to safeguard these funds and to make them yield the best  profits for the country's well-being.    At the proper time I pointed out that I thought it was  immoral to allow the National Railroad Company to continue  losing 21 billion pesos per year, that is, to lose from $60  million to $80 million, just to keep it under state management.  I must remind you that I am responsible for promoting a bill  that resulted in the privatization of railroad freight services,  a very lucrative railroad department. Based on very strict  upholding of the meaning of the use of public funds -- which  belong to all Chileans -- and of strict adherence to good  management policies for public resources, we can achieve  progress in the fight against corruption. Moreover, we must  always be very alert, implement measures, and change  responsibilities within the public administration when there is  suspicion that strange things may be occurring.    [ESTRATEGIA] The Frei administration has inherited the  Codelco problem. There is a very serious charge before the  Chamber of Deputies on an alleged marketing network reportedly  involving past and current administration officials. How is the  government going to handle such a complex case?    [Correa] We have undoubtedly inherited a very complex case,  but President Frei has been very explicit in stating that  everything must be investigated to the very last detail so that  all responsibilities are clarified, that once these  responsibilities are established the proper legal proceedings  will be undertaken to the bitter end if criminal actions are  proven, of course.    The basic procedure is to investigate everything, not  allowing anything to be hidden and, of course, not covering up  anything. It is much more detrimental for a government to  strive to diminish the damage that these kind of situations  might cause, to try to minimize or cover up the impact, than to  disclose the full truth. It is much healthier for an  administration to do this because public credibility is  essential for the strengthening of democracy.    [ESTRATEGIA] Finally, do you agree with the assessment made  by Aylwin at the end of his term that there will an increase in  social demands and an unfavorable international economic  scenario?    [Correa] We are aware that we will be facing situations that  might not be as favorable as those of the previous  administration. But I do not believe the situation will be as  dramatic as to say that this administration will be facing  serious difficulties. It is possible that we might face more  social demands, but it is also true that much has been done and  that much more will be done by this administration in this  regard, starting with the emphasis President Frei is putting  into the fight against corruption. This is a difficult issue  because it entails huge resources. It entails a nationwide  effort but we believe the proper conditions are there to achieve  this goal. Even the opposition has expressed its willingness to  cooperate on this issue.    If we are able to achieve this goal, if we are able to  maintain an important growth level, which perhaps may not be as  high as expected because of prevailing international conditions,  by generating new job sources, these situations can be  confronted. Moreover, we also will be able to overcome  complicated situations by granting workers, and people in  general, greater freedom to exercise their rights, and we must  perfect the legislation that limits these rights to do this.</p>

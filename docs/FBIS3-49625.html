			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Visegrad group prime ministers held bilateral  meetings in Hrzan Palace in Prague. Ilona Dienstbierova covered  their talks.    [Dienstbierova] [passage omitted] I will recall briefly the  bilateral talks between Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and  Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. The Slovak prime minister  commented on the initial conditions of the countries that are to  join the Partnership for Peace plan.    [Begin Meciar recording] We are equal in a political and  legal sense, but not in reality. We are not equal in terms of  the geopolitical situation and economic development. As far as  the state and the level of building the Armed Forces is  concerned, we are not on the same level either. That is why the  Partnership for Peace, as a contractual principle and as a  blueprint for doing things, is creating an opportunity and is  initiating a certain process. The development of this process  could take place (?on an individual basis). At the same time,  the course of this process cannot be determined at present.  This means that its outcome might be quite different,  irrespective of the fact that things may appear to be a  certainty today.    Thus, the Partnership for Peace plan has opened up a process  which, we think, is providing an opportunity for us. Even  though not all of us are on the same level as we stand here on  the starting line, there is no way we can forecast as yet what  the results will be. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Domestic growth behind solid results from Unisys Unisys, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported solid fourth-quarter results, boosted by growth in the US. However, revenues declined in Europe and Japan. The company said growth in orders from US commercial customers was at the highest level for five years. Orders also increased in the Asian and Latin American markets but declined 'substantially' in Europe. In the fourth quarter Unisys reported net income of Dollars 117.7m, or 46 cents per share. In the same period a year ago net income was Dollars 139.2m, or 58 cents per share, including special items of Dollars 38m, or 15 cents per share, from accounting changes. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to 10.9 per cent from 10.1 per cent a year earlier. Revenue of Dollars 2.1bn in the fourth quarter was higher than expected, but below last year's Dollars 2.26bn, the company said. For the year, net income was Dollars 565.4m, or Dollars 2.31 cents, including Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents, from special one-time items. In the previous year, Unisys recorded net income of Dollars 361.2m, or Dollars 1.40 per share, which included a special item of Dollars 65m, or 36 cents. Excluding the special items, earnings per share for the year were Dollars 1.48, against Dollars 1.04 in 1992. Revenue declined to Dollars 7.74bn for 1993 from Dollars 8.42bn in 1992. Higher revenues in US commercial business were more than offset by declines in Europe and Japan, the company said. 'We clearly achieved one of the best financial performances in our industry and are very pleased with our year-end results,' said Mr James Unruh, Unisys chairman and chief executive. 'We had a very strong fourth quarter with good order growth and an improved operating margin. For the year, net income was up 22 per cent excluding gains from special one-time items. 'Operating income as a percent of revenue for the year was 9.5 per cent, compared with 8.6 per cent a year earlier. Cash flow from operations again exceeded Dollars 1bn and we reduced net debt by more than Dollars 500m. 'Financially, our 1994 goal is to achieve further improvement in profitability and to continue to strengthen the company's capital structure,' Mr Unruh said.</p>

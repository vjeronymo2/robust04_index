			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Cuban American group leader faces execution CUBA'S council of state, headed by President Fidel Castro, has confirmed the death sentence for terrorism and sabotage on the leader of a group of Cuban Americans arrested on the island's north coast three weeks ago. However, the council commuted the death penalty against another group member to 30 years' jail. Earlier a third man, also originally sentenced to death, had his sentence cut to 30 years' imprisonment by the supreme court. The men, residents of Florida who the Cubans say were captured with arms and explosives, have no other avenues of appeal. Television broadcasts in Cuba showed the three men confessing that they planned to sabotage public installations 'to give the impression that the counter-revolution had began'. The Cubans also broadcast the names of Cuban-Americans they said were behind the financing and training of the group. The council of state said it had provided this information to the US authorities, and charged the US with 'spectacular incompetence' in dealing with the matter. 'There has not been a single arrest or a sign that any will be made,' the statement said. The US administration has denied Cuban charges that Washington approved of terrorist attacks on the island. The State Department and several human rights organisations, appealed for clemency.</p>

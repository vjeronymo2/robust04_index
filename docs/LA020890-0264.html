			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CLUE TO THE ARTIST'S FUTURE;  </P> <P> ART: A FRANKENTHALER RETROSPECTIVE OPENS SUNDAY AT LACMA.  </P> <P> Artist Helen Frankenthaler's mystique seems to be partly based on staying out  of the limelight. Among art world insiders, she is almost as well known for  living a privileged, quiet life on Manhattan's Upper East Side as for her  lyrical abstract canvases. But since last June, when Frankenthaler's  retrospective exhibition opened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, she  has been in the public eye almost constantly.  </P> <P> The traveling exhibition, which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art  on Sunday, set off an avalanche of profiles and reviews in newspapers and  magazines. The 61-year-old artist has also turned up in less predictable  forums. As a member of the National Endowment for the Arts advisory council,  she responded last July to the controversy over Robert Mapplethorpe's and  Andres Serrano's work by advocating "quality control." In a New York Times  commentary, Frankenthaler took the unpopular position of worrying that the  council might have begun to "spawn an art monster" while "endorsing  experimentation."  </P> <P> More recently, photographs of a youthful Frankenthaler and accounts of her  associations with New York School artists cropped up in a controversial new  biography on Jackson Pollock by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith. And the  February issue of Art &amp; Antiques magazine features Frankenthaler cheerfully  posing in a Rolex ad.  </P> <P> Has la grande dame, arguably America's most famous living female artist, let  down her guard? Probably not. In Los Angeles for the opening of her show at  LACMA, Frankenthaler was very much the well-bred, immaculately groomed woman  who is unfailingly polite while measuring what she says to the press. She  formed sentences slowly, answered questions concisely and almost never picked  up an invitation to expand on any particular point.  </P> <P> Painful as this public process may be, Frankenthaler seems to suffer none of  the tyranny that is often attributed to artists' retrospectives. "I don't think  a retrospective is a finality, it's a summing up, an opportunity to see where  you have been and where you will go from there," she said.  </P> <P> "I noticed both with my first retrospective, at the Whitney Museum of American  Art in 1969, and the current one that I made many discoveries. They had to do  with the continuity of my painting but they also gave a clue to things that  could be developed further."  </P> <P> This second retrospective opened a full 20 years after the first, and  Frankenthaler is already looking forward to the third. "I hope there will be a  next one," she said.  </P> <P> The youngest daughter of Alfred Frankenthaler, a New York State Supreme Court  judge, Frankenthaler attended the Dalton school in New York, where she studied  with Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, and Bennington College in Vermont. As a  young painter in New York, she was championed by the influential critic Clement  Greenberg, with whom she was romantically involved. Later married to painter  Robert Motherwell, she forged a distinctive identity and has never wavered from  her course.  </P> <P> Frankenthaler's "soak-stain" abstractions of the early '50s are considered a  link between Abstract Expressionism and the color-field movement of the '60s.  Picking up on Pollock's energetically dripped paintings, she began to pour  pigment on her canvases and let it soak into the fabric, creating soft-edged  bursts of pastel color.  </P> <P> Frankenthaler's retrospective at the County Museum of Art includes about 40  works done between 1952 and 1988. The show begins with her most famous early  painting, "Mountains and Sea" (a pale 1952 work that looked like a paint rag to  some observers but impressed critic Greenberg and artists Kenneth Noland and  Morris Louis as a breakthrough), and ends with the ominously dark "Casanova" of  1988.  </P> <P> In an era when art changes almost as often as clothing styles, Frankenthaler  seems unconcerned about being up-to-date. Securely rooted in Abstract  Expressionism, the style that established American art on an international  stage, she values a historical view of art. "Young artists should have an idea  of the importance of Abstract Expressionism, just as I should have a sense of  my heritage. I think the importance of Abstract Expressionism has to be a major  consideration in where art went from there," she said.  </P> <P> As for where she thinks art actually has gone, Frankenthaler is diplomatically  silent, saying only that much current work is "fashion." She also prefers not  to expound on the artists and works that influenced her. "Paintings speak for  themselves, the good ones," she said, then ticked off a list: Pollock,  Motherwell, Noland, Louis, David Smith, Anthony Caro, Adolph Gottlieb, "early  Willem de Kooning" and "certain paintings" by Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman.  </P> <P> Greenberg, who supported these artists' work, is a great critic, Frankenthaler  thinks. "Everything he has written is extremely valuable, and it is written in  such a way that will hold up well into the future. You can't say that about  very many writers," she said.  </P> <P> Naifeh's and Smith's biography of Pollock takes a dissenting view of Greenberg.  "I haven't read the book thoroughly, but I think it is unfortunately dedicated  to entertainment rather than factual history. I always slightly cringe at the  idea that Van Gogh, Gauguin and now Pollock are material for mega-movies. They  should be represented by their best work," she said.  </P> <P> The Frankenthaler retrospective will be at LACMA through April 22, then travel  to the Detroit Institute of Art, June 11 through Sept. 2.  </P> <P> The Detroit appearance doubtless will call for another round of interviews, but  Frankenthaler has her mind on other projects now. She recently signed three new  prints produced at Tyler Graphics in Mount Kisco, N.Y., an April show of her  recent works of paper is scheduled at Manhattan's Andre Emmerich Gallery and  she is working on a catalogue raisonne of her graphics that she hopes to  complete in 1991.  </P></p>

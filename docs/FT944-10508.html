			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Food for thought - Neil Buckley explains why it took so long for Marks and Spencer to crack the international retailing market When women in Madrid and Lisbon want a bra, they head for Marks and Spencer. The UK-based clothing and food retailer is building a Spanish and Portuguese retailing empire on selling lingerie. The reason, say M&amp;S managers, is that local retailers are decades behind in the way they sell these intimate garments. Many offer only three sizes of bra - small, medium or large. Products are displayed in glass cases; buying one requires an assistant reaching up and taking a box from a shelf behind the counter. Marks and Spencer, by contrast, sells a wide range of bras, displayed on open fixtures, in 17 sizes. 'We really do lead the world in bras and knickers,' says David Dewhurst, commercial manager of Marks and Spencer's Portuguese franchise. Being a successful international retailer, however, means more than providing 17 bra sizes, as Marks and Spencer has discovered. The history of its expansion overseas has not always been happy. In 22 years of trading in Canada it has rarely done better than break even, with local inhabitants never really taking to its stores. D'Allaird's, the Canadian chain M&amp;S acquired in the 1970s, has, performed a little better. More recently, M&amp;S underestimated the work it would have to do to bring Brooks Brothers, the upmarket US clothing chain acquired in 1987, up to group standards. Elsewhere, however, across Europe and in east Asia, Marks and Spencer is at last becoming a successful cross-border operator. As well as 322 Brooks Brothers, D'Allaird's and Kings Super Markets stores in North America and Japan, and its 40 M&amp;S stores in Canada, it has 32 company-owned stores in six countries outside the UK, from the Republic of Ireland to Hong Kong. It also has 76 franchise stores in 18 countries from Austria to Indonesia. In its most recent full-year results, 13 per cent of Marks and Spencer's turnover and 7 per cent of operating profits came from outside the UK. It used to be a rule of retailing that stores groups that succeeded overseas were those that 'sold their country', whose image and products were closely associated with a particular nation. That no longer holds true. Retailers such as Toys R Us of the US and the Swedish furniture retailer Ikea dominate every market they enter not because they are American or Swedish, but because they sell a bigger range of better products than their competitors, at better prices. The UK's Body Shop has expanded into 45 countries by selling innovative 'natural' products. Britishness scarcely comes into it. What these retailers have in common is a 'unique selling point', setting them apart from competitors. Marks and Spencer's USP, however, is complex; customers outside the UK seem drawn to its stores for many different reasons. Part of the reason is still its Britishness. Overseas store managers admit that classic 'British' products, such as Harris tweed jackets or flannel shirts, always sell well. But, says Juan Jinojosa, a director of Cortefiel, the Spanish retailer which owns 20 per cent of Marks and Spencer's Spanish business: 'Early in the life of Marks and Spencer in a new country, its British appeal is important. But the day quickly comes when the appeal is more the strength of the product and the service.' An important reason for customers choosing M&amp;S is that it offers a variety of other products not available locally, at least in such depth, or for such a good price. Lingerie is in this category - in Madrid it accounts for almost a quarter of turnover, compared with 13 to 15 per cent in UK stores. Sometimes the products are more unusual, especially in food. In Marks and Spencer's new Paris store, which opened in September on the Rue de Rivoli, some of the best-selling products are ready meals, especially Indian meals - not widely available in France. But perhaps the most important ingredient of Marks and Spencer's overseas stores is that they are able to meet local tastes and offer products similar to those in local stores - but at superior quality and prices. Both internal and external factors have made M&amp;S better able to do this now than it was when it first expanded overseas in the 1970s. One external factor is that international tastes have started to converge, due to growth in foreign travel and cross-border television and media. Alan Lambert, Marks and Spencer's divisional director for continental Europe, says the 'European consumer' is now a reality. 'I personally wouldn't narrow it down to Europe,' he adds. 'There is already an international consumer.' Individual tastes do persist in different countries, but internal changes have helped Marks and Spencer address these. The group has developed the flexibility to construct a product offer made up of 'core' bestsellers surrounded by products tailored to local markets. This does not work everywhere - Canada being the obvious example - and M&amp;S still makes mistakes, but it has learned to rectify these more quickly. Dewhurst says research a few years ago in Portugal found shoppers loved Marks and Spencer's lingerie, but thought its clothing 'ugly'. By swapping the contemporary bodies and leggings it had been trying to sell for more 'classical' blouses and skirts, it was able to meet local tastes. With all tills in company-owned stores linked to a giant computer centre in west London, and franchise operations increasingly being linked to the same system, the group can quickly pick up trends, spotting which products are not selling, and make adjustments accordingly. Moreover, all products are sourced through its central buying organisation and supplier network, which, says Alan Hodges, Madrid store manager, means M&amp;S can be 'unbeatable value'. That is in spite of M&amp;S's prices in continental Europe being about 20 per cent higher than in the UK, owing to higher distribution costs. Prices, however, are coming down as M&amp;S adopts its 'outstanding value' campaign across Europe, involving lowering prices on popular products to boost volumes. There are perhaps two important lessons to be learned from Marks and Spencer's experiences. One is the importance of flexibility. Transplanting a store format and its product range from one country to another, as M&amp;S tried to do in the 1970s, is not enough, even in the age of today's international consumer. The complexities of local tastes must be catered for. But successful cross-border retailing does not necessarily entail reinventing the wheel, coming up with a highly innovative store format or concept. In the words of Alan Lambert: 'Quality, service and value will sell anywhere.'</p>

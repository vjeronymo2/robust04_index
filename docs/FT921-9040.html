			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Technology: A smear campaign - Lipstick is becoming more of a science and less of an art Leading cosmetics companies are now battling for the mouths and minds of some of the world's most discerning consumers - wearers of lipstick. Gone are the days when wax, oil and a splash of colour was the order of the day. Now those with the pennies as well as the pout are being offered 'performance' lipsticks - which colour, moisturise, heal and caress. In Europe alone the wholesale market for lipstick is worth more than Ecu150m (Pounds 107m), and a successful lipstick can increase a company's sales in the colour sector (lipstick and nail varnish) by more than 50 per cent in the year of the launch, says Patricia Fuchs, director of Geneva-based European Forecasts. Since Lancome, a leading French manufacturer, introduced its Rouge Absolu in the UK in September 1990, for example, the lipstick has outsold, in unit terms, any other product Lancome has introduced into the UK market. For the up-market cosmetics companies the test has been how to differentiate themselves from the cheaper brands, which have 'cannibalised' the market, according to Fuchs, because of the large range of colours and finishes that the more popular suppliers offer. The easiest route for the likes of Elizabeth Arden, Lancome and Helena Rubinstein has been to incorporate a moisturising element in their products. Traditionally lipstick has had one of two drawbacks: if the colour endured then the formula was harsh on the skin; if the lipstick was gentle on the lips the colour faded rapidly. So the test for the lipstick makers has been to produce a stick which combines the best of both worlds. 'Customers want to have a treatment lipstick. They want a colour guarantee and protection,' says a spokesperson for Helena Rubinstein, now part of the French L'Oreal group, about its Rouge Forever lipstick. To do this the largest cosmetic companies have turned to their pharmaceutical and even their food divisions to enliven their traditional potions. Edith Clar, director of scientific communications at Lancome, in Paris, says there is now a two-way flow of ideas between research laboratories in the L'Oreal group (which owns Lancome). The organisation includes shampoo and perfume companies as well as the more traditional cosmetic makers. This move has been facilitated by the acquisition of the big brand name cosmetics companies by multinational consumer products organisations. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch company, famous for Persil soap powder and Oxo stock cubes, has acquired Elizabeth Arden, Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Chesebrough-Ponds and Faberge. At Elizabeth Arden, the skills of 18 multinational chemists were taxed to produce Lip Spa, a lipstick already available in the US and to be launched in the UK in early March. The more conventional lipstick could be formulated by a single chemist. Lip Spa incorporates water - a task which is inherently difficult because the oils and waxes in lipstick are incompatible with water. The technology for emulsification came from the Unilever food division where it has been well-tested in the production of margarines such as Flora, Stork, Delight and Krona. Also included in the potion are liposomes, which are being investigated by pharmaceutical companies as a way of transporting drugs into the body. In cosmetics they wrap themselves around the active substances to make it easier for those constituents to penetrate the skin. Lancome's Rouge Absolu, on the other hand, uses a technique called active gel network, which took three years of specific research to develop, says Clar. The stick incorporates a gel-like network of ultra-fine links. As pressure is applied when the lipstick is put on, the colour and the active ingredients - vitamin E, ultra-violet filters, musk rose oil, et al - adhere to the lips. As the pressure is removed the gel-like network reforms, trapping the pigments and oils on the surface of the lips. Helena Rubinstein uses a similar approach with its Rouge Forever. The pigment is encased in polymeric micro-particles which double up as a moisturiser. As the lipstick is applied the micro-particles release the colour on to the lips. Fuchs does not believe that the recession will reduce the demand for up-market lipsticks, which generally sell in the Pounds 10 to Pounds 15 price range. 'In an economic recession if women can't take themselves on a skiing holiday at least they can buy themselves a luxury product,' she believes. 'A lipstick is really an entry product to a consumer that is aspiring to an up-market brand.' However, the traditional up-market European and US cosmetics companies are coming under increasing pressure in their home markets from Japanese manufacturers, such as Shiseido and Kao. Shiseido has been selling lipstick in its Le Marquillage range for the past three years which combines colour and moisturising properties, developed by its skincare division. The colour elements are immersed in a waterproof and oil-proof coating, says the company, so the colour remains on the lips and does not change, however acidic or alkaline the skin. A second component is an oil which binds water from the atmosphere to it, so moisturising the lips. Shiseido's low profile in Europe - unlike its European and US counterparts it does not have multi-million pound advertising campaigns  - serves to emphasise its up-market image. Its products are only available in 10 outlets in the UK, including Harrods in London. Helena Rubinstein is now following a similar strategy in trying to consolidate its sophisticated image. Where once its products were sold through 270 stores in the UK, that figure has been reduced to 23. The big cosmetics companies are also under increasing pressure as product strategies change. 'The rhythm of launches is getting faster and faster, as we've already seen in the fragrance market,' says Fuchs. 'You can be successful for 18 months but then a rival product comes along.'  --------------------------------------------- WHOLESALE VALUE OF EUROPEAN LIPSTICK MARKET  --------------------------------------------- 1990 total Pounds 107 m  --------------------------------------------- France             Pounds 33.0m Germany            Pounds 20.0m Italy              Pounds 20.0m UK                 Pounds 12.0m Spain              Pounds  8.0m Switzerland        Pounds  5.4m Netherlands        Pounds  3.0m Austria            Pounds  3.0m Belgium            Pounds  2.4m  --------------------------------------------- Source: European Forecasts  ---------------------------------------------</p>

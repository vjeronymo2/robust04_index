			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Building blocks to saving energy The University of East Anglia is building a lecture theatre and office block, which is designed to consume a fifth of the energy used by a conventional building. The 3,000 sq metre building is expected to have the lowest energy consumption of any comparable building in the UK, when it opens next January, according to Fulcrum Engineering which designed it with John Miller &amp; Partners, architects. It is expected to use fewer than 50kW hours per square metre per year. The building, which relies on a high standard of insulation, is designed to require no heating in winter, except for unusually cold periods. It will be cooled by using the exposed mass of the structure to absorb heat during the day, while at night the floors will be cooled by circulating air through the floor slabs.

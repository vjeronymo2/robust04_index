			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- The government may draw up  a set of measures to further liberalize the Japanese market by  February 26, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  indicated Thursday [17 February].    The top government spokesman made the suggestion at a  regular  news conference after a meeting among Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and subcabinet-level officials who represented Japan at  trade negotiations with the United States.    "A cabinet-level session will be convened on the matter next  week," said one government source.    Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to focus on improving foreign  access to the market in a meeting with cabinet members,  government sources said.    They said the scheme, including deregulations and boosting  imports, is designed to break the impasse in the bilateral  framework trade talks.    The talks to whittle down Japan's lopsided trade surplus  with  the United States broke down last week, prompting Washington on  Tuesday to announce plans to impose sanctions for a slow U.S.  penetration into Japan's cellular phone market.    Takemura said the prime minister and government officials  confirmed in the meeting that the government will voluntarily  draw up measures to help slash Japan's vast trade surplus, which  totaled 130 billion dollars last year, of which about 60 billion  dollars was with the U.S.    The steps include deregulation and promotion of imports and  investments in Japan, freeing competition for foreign goods and  services in Japanese markets and improving government  procurement.    Asked if the steps will be compiled before the February 26  meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of  Seven major economic powers in Germany, Takemura replied, "it  should not be too late."    Hosokawa has noted the need for Japan to "swiftly" come up  with voluntary measures since he and U.S. President Bill Clinton  failed in their summit last Friday to narrow differences on  cutting the trade surplus and boosting the sale of foreign goods  in Japan.    Takemura added that a cabinet-ministerial meeting on Japan's  trade gap with the U.S. should be held as quickly as possible.    He also renewed his call on the U.S. to refrain from  imposing  retaliatory measures.    Clinton said Wednesday he expects to have policy  recommendations drawn up in the next few days to address the  bilateral disputes.    The options under consideration reportedly include  resurrection of a U.S. trade law that allows punitive measures  against countries that refuse to change what Washington deems  are unfair trade practices.    U.S. press reports said a White House decision to revive the  "Super 301" trade measure through executive order is imminent,  possibly by Thursday.</p>

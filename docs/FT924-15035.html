			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / French economic slowdown FRANCE'S economic slowdown was yesterday confirmed by a rise in gross domestic product in the second quarter of only 0.1 per cent, compared to 1 per cent in the first three months, writes David Buchan from Paris. The only bright spot in the April-June picture was provided by the trade balance, which improved because of a drop in imports. The depressing state of the domestic economy was underlined by a 0.2 per cent drop in consumption which had risen by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, even though salaries and social security payments grew.</p>

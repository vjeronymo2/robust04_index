			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDS CRISIS CLOSES DOORS OF HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Beleaguered Marina Hills Hospital in Ladera Heights closed its doors Friday and  transferred its 25 patients to other hospitals ending months of financial  troubles, employee complaints and patient loads that had dipped to only one  patient at times.  </P> <P> Hospital Administrator Marvin Herschberg said the final blow to the troubled  hospital was the failure of the state Medi-Cal system to pay its current bills  to nursing homes and hospitals.  </P> <P> However, the hospital had been strapped financially for some time, and had been  operating under bankruptcy protection. Hospital management at one point had  pleaded with employees -- who were owed back pay -- to keep working so the  facility could receive patient referrals from the county.  </P> <P> Herschberg said the Medi-Cal crunch put the final squeeze on the hospital  </P> <P> State officials said Wednesday that Medi-Cal had run out of money and that  there would be a shortfall of funds to meet payments to convalescent homes and  hospitals until July when the next fiscal year begins.  </P> <P> "Basically, we had about $1 million owing us from the state for Medi-Cal  services," Herschberg said. "We found we couldn't collect on them from the  state until July. We couldn't borrow any more money and we didn't want to  endanger any patients so we made a decision this morning (Friday) to just close  down."  </P> <P> The 103-bed hospital was employing about 100 people when it closed, the  administrator said. It was not immediately clear what would happen to the  employees.  </P> <P> Herschberg said: "The closing is particularly tragic because we felt we could  have broken even in June. The county Department of Health Services was sending  us obstetrics cases and we were performing surgery."  </P> <P> The hospital primarily serves obstetrics cases, most of them funded by Medi-Cal  or Medicare. During previous troubles in January and February when the facility  was having problems meeting its payrolls, it was noted that the county  Department of Health Services expected more than 46,000 babies to be delivered  at county hospitals this year, severely overtaxing a system designed to deliver  35,000 babies safely.  </P></p>

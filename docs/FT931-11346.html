			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Management: Inequality rules in Japan The late 1980s surge in Tokyo stock prices and corporate profits was also a time of opportunity for Japanese women. Mariko Mitsui was leader of the largest opposition party, and strong career-minded women were fashionable advertising props. There was even debate about the introduction of a new fast-track for women in big companies. Female fortunes, however, have taken a tumble with the economic downturn - a change best illustrated by the fate of Mitsui, now an ex-member of the Social Democratic Party. A couple of years ago she represented a new era, but is now a symbol of the enduring discrimination against women. Although as a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, Mitsui set up the city's sexual harassment complaints office and stopped the metropolitan government from financially supporting beauty contests, she was criticised by male party members for her feminist views, and has even been a target for sexual harassment by a fellow council member. 'I thought the Social Democratic Party would have a liberal atmosphere, but it was just another male hierarchy,' said Mitsui after resigning last month. Most Japanese companies claim that women employees, on the same career track as men, receive equal opportunities. But one reason to doubt their commitment is recent evidence that they are becoming less willing to hire female graduates. Another is the small impact of the 'sogoshoku' - a career track launched by image-conscious companies in 1986 which was supposed to give women the same promotion chances as men. In practice, however, in addition to the rigid corporate hierarchy, female employees find that they are bound by the unspoken cultural roles required of Japanese women. A study of office practices in 1,700 companies by Recruit Research indicated that 87.6 per cent had female employees serving tea to colleagues, 70.5 per cent made female employees wipe the office desks, while only 33.4 per cent allowed women into policy-making meetings and discussions. 'Of course the basic ideal is for men and women to be equal, but social roles are different, and this affects daily office work as well,' says a manager at Seibu Department, a leading retailer famous for its women managers. If a client comes and the secretary is unavailable, a women rather than a man is required to make and serve tea. Recruit also found that only 23.3 per cent of companies interviewed offered management opportunities for women. Corporate managers blame female employees' failure to justify the costs of training. The low figure indicates the barrier may have more to do with unchanging attitudes towards professional women. Mitsui says of Japanese men: 'They're just not brought up to think that women can be partners or rivals.'</p>

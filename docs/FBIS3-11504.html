Although the heads of Latin American diplomacy were  enthusiastic about U.S. President Bill Clinton's proposal, some  of them expounded the "inadvisability" of holding the summit in  Miami, where anti-Castro groups have a lot of clout.    The diplomats who assisted at the Brasilia meeting, which  ended today, told EFE that the issue was discussed at the  meeting, but did not disclose what delegations were opposed to  Miami being the venue for the summit meeting.    The reservations stem from the fear that anti-Castro groups  will harass some heads of state on account of the independent  stance adopted by their countries and the Rio Group concerning  the U.S. policy vis-a-vis Cuba.    The reservations seemingly reached the ears of U.S. Vice  President Albert Gore, who made a seven-hour visit to Brasilia  -- which extended from the evening of 21 March to the early  hours of 22 March -- to invite Brazilian President Itamar Franco  to the Miami summit.    After the Rio Group meeting, Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso  Amorim said Gore guaranteed him that matters alien to the summit  -- alluding to anti-Castro Cubans -- will not interfere in its  organization and agenda.    Amorim noted that it is "too early" to say whether Cuba's  political and economic situation will be included on the  December summit's agenda.    He further stated that both the summit's date and venue  depend on the decision of the U.S. Government, which convened  the meeting.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli commented  that, in his view, Miami was not a "risky" place to bring  together all the heads of state in the Americas.    Several Rio Group foreign ministers praised the flexibility  of the issues proposed by Clinton, who has asked governments to  offer suggestions to complete the agenda.    The subjects put forward by Clinton to his Western  Hemisphere  counterparts include the strengthening of democracy, human  rights, trade, poverty, the environment, and the streamlining of  public administration.    Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner told  EFE that his country is interested in highlighting trade  liberalization, economic investments, and cooperation at the  summit. Burelli, for his part, noted that questions like  education, poverty, and access to technology had to be part of  the agenda.    Despite the fact that they differ widely on the types of  pressure that should be exerted on Cuba so it will adopt a  pluralistic system to replace the single-party system, Rio Group  countries have condemned the trade embargo on Cuba imposed by  the United States more than 30 years ago.    Brazil and Colombia recently have become the target of  criticism and threats by anti-Castro groups due to their stances  on the situation in Havana.</p>

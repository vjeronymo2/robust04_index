			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Welsh falls 36% on Acer losses The controversy over the diversification policies of utilities resurfaced yesterday as Welsh Water announced disappointing interim results due to losses and charges in its largest non-regulated business. Pre-tax profits fell 36 per cent to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 77.3m) for the six months to September 30, after exceptional charges of Pounds 28.5m. Turnover was 0.73 per cent lower at Pounds 259.9m. Excluding discontinued businesses, sales rose by 1.8 per cent. The exceptional charges included Pounds 11.5m to cover rationalising the Acer motorway design business. The balance arose from a previously announced rationalisation in the core utility business. Mr Iain Evans, chairman, said a significant number of UK motorway orders had been cancelled by the Department of Transport, leaving Acer with losses of Pounds 2.8m. Management had decided to cut 13 per cent of the 3,000-strong workforce, with most of the jobs going from the UK division. Welsh paid Pounds 50m for Acer, including Pounds 27m in debt, 21 months ago. It wrote off Pounds 40m against goodwill soon after the purchase. The company yesterday faced renewed criticism over its diversification record, which includes unhappy forays into electricity and hotels under previous management. 'We are hearing the same story time and time again,' said one analyst. Mr Evans denied that these were bad results. On the positive side, Welsh had cut underlying operating costs by about 1.5 per cent. Further benefit was expected from rationalising the utility, where more than 400 jobs would be cut. Welsh had also achieved savings of roughly Pounds 4m on its capital spending programme. Mr Evans said the non-regulated businesses, with the exception of Acer, had improved 'dramatically'. Profits excluding Acer had risen from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 3.4m. The dividend was increased by 10 per cent to 9.3p (8.45p) from earnings down 37 per cent at 31.1p (49.2p) or 49.4p (49.2p) before exceptionals. COMMENT It appears that Welsh has written off more than it paid for its Acer subsidiary, and the division is still making losses. Not surprisingly the shares underperformed yesterday, falling 4 per cent against the sector's 2 per cent decline. Forecasts were pulled back from about Pounds 163m to Pounds 155m, before the Pounds 28.5m charge. On the plus side, Welsh Water has one of the strongest balance sheets and highest dividend covers among its peers. At some stage, this should feed through to shareholders. For the moment, however, the shares look about right.</p>

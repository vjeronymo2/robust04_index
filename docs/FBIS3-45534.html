			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 11 (CNS)--China's coal industry  last year saw its output of raw coal reaching 1.14 billion  tonnes, resulting in loss-making of RMB 2 billion less than the  year before and with 120,000 staff made redundant. [paragraph as  received]    Minister of Coal Industry, Mr Wang Senhao, said at a  national  working conference on coal production held here today that the  output of raw coal in the country last year increased by 25.5  million tonnes over the year before. State-owned enterprises  turned out 470 million tonnes of coal, a drop of 12.5 million  tonnes, resulting in a sales volume of 412 million tonnes, a  drop of 19.49 million tonnes. The output of local state-owned  enterprises was 198 million tonnes, down 4.3 million tonnes.    The volume of coal transportation made up 40 percent of the  country's total volume of railway shipments and problems faced  in shipping coal was one of the major factors accounting for the  drop in coal production. Owing to the rising of prices,  collectively-run coal mines and township ones saw their  production last year accounting for 472 million tonnes, close to  that produced by state- owned ones.    Last year, the coal industry made progress in the drop in  loss- making and redundancy action with its loss being reduced  by RMB 2 billion or 30 percent less than the previous year and  120,000 staff made redundant while another 130,000 transferred  to other jobs.    According to the minister, the industry has in recent years  made achievements in its industrial adjustment, paying much  attention to the development of its diversified interests. The  industry has, besides coal production, business covering power  generation, chemical industry, construction materials and  commerce and trade. Its output earned from its diversified  interests reached RMB 18 billion and its profits tax from this  sector RMB 900 million, increase of 20 percent and 22 percent  over the year before.</p>

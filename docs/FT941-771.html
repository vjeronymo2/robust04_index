			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Car groups open door to foreign purchases Japan's biggest car companies committed themselves yesterday to increasing output overseas, lifting local content of vehicles made abroad and importing more foreign components for domestic manufacture. Three groups now have unveiled schemes and two more are expected to do so soon. The programmes already announced should raise imports by up to Dollars 4bn a year by 1997. They are designed to help reduce US-Japan trade tension. The voluntary measures follow sustained pressure from Washington on Japan to reduce its record trade surplus. The Japanese government has insisted it was unable to influence private sector decisions. Toyota, Japan's biggest vehicle group, said it planned to double overseas output by the end of 1996 from 890,000 vehicles in 1993. This would include doubling capacity at its US plant to 400,000 units, and lifting UK capacity from 37,000 in 1993 to 100,000 units this year. The company said it expected to increase the value of overseas parts and materials used by the group worldwide from Dollars 6.3bn in 1992 to Dollars 9.7bn by 1997. It also expected to raise the level of US parts from Dollars 4.43bn in the 1992 financial year to Dollars 6.45bn in 1996. Mitsubishi said it would reduce the number of cars made in Japan for export from 600,000 in 1993 to 550,000 in 1997. Local content of its Illinois plant would increase from about 70 per cent currently to more than 80 per cent in 1996. Last week Nissan announced it would increase purchases of US parts from Dollars 3.7bn in the year to March 1995 to Dollars 4.3bn in the year to March 1998. Similar undertakings are expected from Honda and Mazda by the end of the week. Japan will lift voluntary curbs on car exports to the US as of March 31, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said early today. It said: 'The lifting of restrictions reflects recent steady declines in the number of car exports to the US and conclusion of the Uruguay Round which decided to lift grey restrictions within four years.'</p>

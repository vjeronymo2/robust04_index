			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry State Secretary Janos </F> Martonyi by Gabor Szego; place and date not given: "European  Union: At the Same Time, But Not Together"]    [Text] On the basis of the Hungarian Government's decision  and parliament's approval, Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky will  present the Hungarian Republic's official application for  membership of the European Union [EU] to Theodhoros Pangalos,  current chairman of the EU Council, in Athens on 1 April.    As was announced by Janos Martonyi in Warsaw on 22 March,  the  request will be submitted in coordination with Poland.  NEPSZABADSAG interviewed Martonyi on the background of this  decision, among other things.    [Szego] In the past the Hungarian wish has been expressed  many times, namely that Brussels should not treat the East  Central European states requesting EU membership as a bloc or a  group; rather, their readiness for membership and the  fulfillment of the requirements should be assessed. Considering  this, it is rather unexpected that we are making this step  together with Warsaw.    [Martonyi] I do not think that any major change has taken  place or that the announcement in Warsaw was unexpected. From  the very beginning, we indicated that Hungary would consult with  the Visegrad countries on the issue of handing in the membership  request. We had already had consultations with Warsaw in  connection with other talks, and this also included  consultations between the relevant ministers. As a result of  all these, the decision was made that we would submit our  membership request essentially at the same time.    [Szego] So not at the same time after all?    [Martonyi] Due to technical reasons, it will not happen  exactly at the same time. Instead of the originally planned 31  March, 1 April seems to be a definite date, and the Polish  Government's statement of intent will come a few days after this  at the latest. It has not yet been decided when Foreign  Minister Olechowski will find a suitable time for travelling to  Athens. Minor issues like Easter Friday falling on 1 April might  also influence this, therefore, it is quite possible that this  event will only take place on the following week.    [Szego] Is the Warsaw government also past the phase of  parliamentary approval?    [Martonyi] The situation is different in Poland, they do not  need a legislative decision, only a simpler parliamentary  procedure has to be completed. This is planned for 25 March,  therefore, by the end of the month they will also have finished  the preparations. The essence of this procedure is that, in the  name of the government, the foreign minister informs Parliament  of the decision on presenting the membership request, then the  parliamentary group leaders have five minutes each to comment on  this issue. However, there is no voting, the chairman of  parliament sums up the speeches, and then the session is closed.    [Szego] Do we need to worry that, due to the heated debate  that has developed in the European Union in connection with the  membership of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]  countries, this is not the best time for new applicants to  appear? For example, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes simply  said the other day that there is a "complete crisis" in the  Union.    [Martonyi] The current "mini crisis" has nothing to do with  the presentation of the Hungarian request for membership, it is  wise to separate these two issues. In addition to this, by the  time the actual negotiations on membership begin -- at the end  of 1996 or in 1997 at the earliest -- the European Union will  have gone through many crisis periods. Therefore, this is an  important step in the often mentioned long process of gaining  membership that began in 1990: After handing in the request, we  will be official candidates in a diplomatic, legal, and  political sense.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [PRENSA LATINA headline: "Congressman Torricelli Continues </F> Meddling Tour"]    [Text] Managua, 3 Jun (PL) -- U.S. Congressman Robert  Torricelli today reiterated to the Nicaraguan Government a  threat about retaining aid promised by Washington if the  decision to return confiscated property to U.S. citizens is  delayed.    Torricelli arrived in Managua yesterday in the company of  Republican Party Representative Cass Ballenger "to review  compliance with U.S. laws on the return of confiscated property  to North Americans anywhere in the world."    After inspiring repudiation during his recent stay in  Mexico,  where he was criticized because of his alleged desire to meddle  in local politics, Torricelli now wants to "pressure the Violeta  [Chamorro] Barrios government," according to a Nicaraguan media  expression.    According to this Democratic congressman, who promotes the  amendment that has hardened the economic blockade the United  States has maintained against Cuba for more than three decades,  the report to be prepared on his meetings will be evaluated by  the U.S. Congress in Washington to decide whether or not  financial assistance to Nicaragua should be frozen in 1995.    The Chamorro government is in favor of either returning  confiscated property or indemnifying those people who were U.S.  citizens at the moment of the confiscation and in dealing with  the cases of people who acquired U.S. citizenship after the  confiscations, the way cases involving Nicaraguan citizens are  treated.    Washington's ambassador to Managua, John Maisto, has  reported  that the Helms-Gonzalez Amendment does not envisage exclusions  among U.S. citizens based on nationalization dates. This point  would considerably expand the number of people seeking  compensation, because, while the Nicaraguan Government  acknowledges that there are more than 20 unresolved confiscation  cases involving U.S. citizens, the new confiscation lists  involve hundreds.</p>

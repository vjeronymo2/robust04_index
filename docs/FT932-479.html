			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Action to cut surplus 'would stoke up inflation' ANY ATTEMPT to meet demands from Washington for a rapid reduction in Japan's current account surplus would be unsustainable, as it would stoke up inflation in Japan, a senior Bank of Japan official warned yesterday. The official warned that a large part of the current account surplus was structural and so would not be rapidly reduced by higher growth in Japan to suck in imports. An attempt to cut this structural surplus by using macro-economic policies would simply fuel inflation, the BoJ official explained. His comments imply that the Bank of Japan would probably tighten monetary by raising interest rates if it thought public spending was being relaxed too far to meet US demands for higher growth. His comments came after Mr Lawrence Summers, the US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, called in a speech to Japanese business leaders on Friday for Japan to cut the surplus to about 1.5 per cent of gross national product (GNP) over the next three years. The surplus is expected to reach about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 102bn) this year, 3.5 per cent of gross national product. The Bank of Japan official said: 'If we stimulate the economy to cut the surplus to 1.5 per cent of GNP in the short run that would have a very adverse impact on prices. So we have to be very careful.' He added: 'A rapid reduction in the surplus would be in no one's interests.' The official said a large part of the surplus was structural, in that it reflected the high level of saving for retirement pensions, as Japanese society is ageing rapidly. The remainder was cyclical, a reflection of the slowdown in Japan's economy and its demand for imports. Mr Summers argued that the goal of cutting the current account surplus to 1.5 per cent of GNP was acceptable because that was the average level of Japan's surplus over the past 20 years. The BoJ official said that over the past decade the average level of the surplus had been higher because of higher savings for retirement. As a result of this the structural component of the surplus had risen, he said.</p>

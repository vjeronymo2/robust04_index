			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Picture of wealth AS AN artist, I have accumulated a large number of paintings, with a value of several thousand pounds. If I were to sell most of these via a public exhibition or to a dealer, would the transaction be considered 'trading,' and hence taxable, or merely as a sale of chattels? A public exhibition would probably be regarded as an adventure in the nature of trade. The question would then arise as to when (and at what value) the paintings were appropriated to the trading activity. The amount at stake probably justifies the expense of professional guidance through the tax/VAT/NIC maze - from a local accountant for example - particularly as, presumably, you do not plan to stop painting after the sale. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / People: UBS gets Carter When Chris Carter took the call from the headhunters looking for a new head of global equity strategy for UBS, he says he thought long and hard before even agreeing to an interview. That was not just because the research division at the Swiss bank's London investment arm had been in a state of some upheaval, but also because the jump from what he describes as the 'relatively secure' world of fund management, where he has spent his career, to that of stockbroking research, is a big one. 'Fund managers are always critical of broker research material and if anything the strategists get even more stick than the company analysts. So I decided to take up the challenge of designing a product with which fund managers could not find fault.' Carter, 34, comes from Cigna International Investment Advisors, the international arm of the fund management operation of the US insurance giant. There he had been head of international equities for a group with Dollars 6bn under management. Before 1991 he had spent nine years with Bank of America Investment Management and then World Invest, the management buy-out of the BoA operation. He replaces Guy Rigden who is currently writing a business plan for UBS's push into the modish field of emerging markets preparatory to heading up the equity emerging markets division.</p>

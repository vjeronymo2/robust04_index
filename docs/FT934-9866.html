			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Labour steps up attack on fuel VAT LABOUR yesterday stepped up its attack on the government's plans to impose value added tax on domestic fuel next year by starting a campaign against the measure in 22 marginal Tory constituencies. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the taxation of domestic fuel was an unpopular measure which would cause deep concern to Tory MPs who had been elected by slim majorities. She said these Conservatives were under pressure to save either their seats or their chancellor. 'I challenge the chancellor to accept that his majority in the House of Commons on this issue is disappearing.' Ms Harman said the campaign would take the form of 'constituency action'. Her party was unwilling to debate the question of adequate compensation for pensioners and poorer social groups on this issue - it was against the whole principle of the tax. VAT will be imposed on domestic fuel from April, and the chancellor will announce in his November 30 Budget whether it will be at the rate of 8 per cent or 17.5 per cent. Negotiations are still going on in Whitehall over the size of the compensation package for pensioners. Apart from the 22 constituencies where the campaign would be mounted, Ms Harman said there were a further 60 where Tory MPs had a majority of less than 5,000.</p>

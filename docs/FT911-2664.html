			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 16m jetty development in Thailand KIER INTERNATIONAL, the overseas contracting arm of Beazer, has won a Pounds 16m contract to design and build a jetty at Sri Racha in the Bight of Bangkok, for the Sri Racha Harbour Company. Work is being carried out in joint venture with Beazer Asia group companies in Hong Kong. A fast-track approach will be applied to achieve a construction period of 12 months. The whole project is due for completion in August 1992. Designed in-house by Beazer, the jetty will be a steel trestle type decked with precast concrete. It will be supported by steel piles measuring up to one metre in diameter. Around 30,000 cu metres of concrete and 10,000 tonnes of steel will be used during construction. The structure, 3km in length, will begin to the south of an existing jetty and cross over it, finishing on its north side. At the crossover, the new jetty will be 10 metres above sea level. Designed to accommodate up to 45,000 dwt vessels, the jetty will enable the importation of scrap metal for processing at a plant in Sri Racha.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Ibstock back in profit at Pounds 4.4m - Recovery in key markets allowed price increases to be passed on The slow recovery in the UK building market helped Ibstock, Britain's third biggest brick maker, move back into the black for the first six months of the year, reporting pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.36m against losses of Pounds 17.1m. There were also improvements in the US building material business, with brick demand also picking up, and in the international pulp market. Mr Ian Maclellan, managing director, said the recovery in Ibstock's key markets had enabled it to pass on price increases successfully. 'We expect further modest price increases in bricks in the region of 5 to 6 per cent next year, although they have some way to go to recover pre-recession levels,' he added. Mr Cohn Hope, chairman, struck a note of caution. He said: 'We anticipate the steady improvement in demand to continue into 1995, although the essential increases in price that are required to achieve improved margins may be slower to materialise.' Turnover declined 32 per cent to Pounds 96.9m (Pounds 141.8m), although 1993's interim figure was inflated by contributions from discontinued businesses of Pounds 48.5m. On continuing operations, turnover advanced 4 per cent from Pounds 93.3m. Operating profits from the UK brick business more than tripled from Pounds 1.14m to Pounds 3.9m on turnover 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 30m). The US operations had profits of Pounds 826,000 against losses of Pounds 509,000, having returned to the black at the year-end. However, tough trading conditions in the Portuguese building market turned profits of Pounds 424,000 into losses of Pounds 287,000. Turnover slid 19 per cent to Pounds 7.11m (Pounds 8.83m). Higher pulp prices helped the forestry products business move into the black, operating profits of Pounds 1.07m being reported against losses of Pounds 2.9m. Prices increased from Dollars 400 to Dollars 600 a tonne in the last year. Earnings per share were 1.13p (losses of 4.93p). The dividend is maintained at 0.5p. Net debt fell from Pounds 35.6m at the year-end to Pounds 29.4m, mainly due to the sale of Ibstock's 20 per cent stake in a Portuguese pulp company, raising Pounds 7.95m. COMMENT The higher pulp prices and encouraging brick margins which enabled Ibstock to move back into the black reflect its current position in the recovery cycle. Full-year profits of around Pounds 12m would put the stock on a hefty premium to the market, although this falls as the recovery comes through into 1995's earnings. Profits of around Pounds 21.5m then would give earnings of 5.6p, a p/e of 14, a 10 per cent premium to the market and a slight premium to the sector. A justified rating in its present position, although whether the improvement in margins continues will depend largely on whether recovery in the housing market is sustained.</p>

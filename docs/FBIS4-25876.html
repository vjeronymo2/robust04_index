			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jianxin (7559 1696 2450)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of the  State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, met a  visiting Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions delegation at the  Hong Kong and Macao Center in Beijing this evening. Li Zetian  and Zheng Yaotang are the chief and deputy chief of the  delegation.    Lu Ping welcomed the visitors and expressed the hope that  the  federation would unify a broad range of compatriots who love  their country and Hong Kong, and would continue making  contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition.    On the new Hong Kong airport, he said: The Airport Committee  will continue discussing the fiscal plan proposed by the Hong  Kong Government. We hope this issue will be solved at an early  date. After solving the fiscal arrangements, we certainly will  continue paying attention to the new Hong Kong airport's cost  effectiveness and construction speed in accordance with the  principles of "low cost and high return" prescribed in the  Memorandum of Understanding on the New Airport. This is of  great concern to the Hong Kong people. To exercise effective  supervision, we should set up a monitoring mechanism. We hope  most of the new airport projects will be completed before 1997.    The visitors broached the retirement security issue, which  is  of great concern to the Hong Kong people. Lu Ping said: The  social and security affairs panel and the economic affairs panel  under the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory  Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  recently held discussions on this issue. It is the committee  members' unanimous view that the Hong Kong Government should  implement a full-scale retirement security system. The form  which such a system will take is subject to further discussion  and examination. This is because the issue affects the security  of Hong Kong employees' livelihoods. We hope the Hong Kong  Government will draw up a retirement security plan as quickly as  possible and implement it at an early date.    During the meeting, the visitors said: The federation is  deeply concerned about the direction in which Hong Kong's  economy is developing, as well as about the issue of labor  import. In reply, Lu Ping said: "Some people in Hong Kong say  that Hong Kong's industries should keep developing. I agree  with this point because industry directly generates value.  Without a strong industrial base, the long-term development of  stock markets and tertiary industries will be affected". On the  issue of labor import, he stressed that the mainland would not  export a large number of workers to Hong Kong as to affect Hong  Kong workers' employment and lives. Lu Ping said: These issues  do affect Hong Kong's smooth transition. I hope to consult with  the British Hong Kong Government in due course.    During the meeting, Lu Ping also answered other questions of  concern to the visitors.    Wang Fengchao, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, was present during the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "TA SR, il": "Giving Finishing Touches to the </F> Balladur Plan"]    [Excerpts] Paris -- A two-day conference on the Stability  Pact opened in the UNESCO Palace in Paris yesterday. It is  attended by ministers of foreign affairs from 42 European  countries, the United States, and Canada. The Slovak Republic  is represented by Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan.  [passage omitted]    In his address, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Kukan  noted the political readiness of the Slovak Republic to  contribute to the implementation of the Stability Pact by  specific steps and by its foreign policy in general. The  completion of the transformation of the countries of Central and  Eastern Europe is a longer-term process, which can only take  place in a peaceful democratic international political  environment. The Slovak Republic finds this environment in the  European political, economic, and security structures. He  stressed that we consider the Stability Pact to be an important  contribution to European cooperation that supports a further  improvement in international relations, particularly by  intensifying and harmonizing cooperation among neighbors. We  are confident that the Stability Pact project, which we regard  as one of the means of drawing closer toward European Union  membership, will contribute to strengthening European security  and stability.</p>

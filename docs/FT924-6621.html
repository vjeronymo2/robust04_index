			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Management: Different routes through the minefield of change  -Christopher Lorenz assesses new research aimed at helping companies to revitalise themselves Unlike journalists, most academics are slow to commit their thoughts to paper. Even business school professors can take six months to write a short treatise. So congratulations are due to two sprightly scholars for taking only four weeks to come up with a very practical paper on one of the hottest issues of the moment: how sclerotic companies (even ones still thriving on past success) can set about transforming themselves into lean, agile and creative predators capable of seizing on every future shift in their competitive environment, and turning it to their advantage. From General Motors to IBM, British Airways to thousands of small companies, the tricky topic of how to handle this type of radical change preoccupies almost every company these days. As regular readers of this column may recall, the far from academic question of how to vary one's leadership and management style between different types of corporate 'change' and 'transformation' processes transfixed the many top managers, academics and consultants who attended a large international conference in London last month (this page, Oct 23). They were particularly at odds over how to distinguish between the actions needed to create the sort of change which alters a company's portfolio, strategies, or operational effectiveness, and those needed completely to 'reinvent' corporate character and behaviour, as at IBM. Two of the puzzled academics at the conference were Dr Barbara Blumenthal, of Temple University, Pennsylvania (she also works for Gemini Consulting) and Professor Philippe Haspeslagh of Insead, one of Europe's top business schools. Their reaction to the post-conference confusion was to get together and thrash out a working paper which knocks some welcome order into the subject*. In many respects it contains more sense than some previous books on it. In essence, the duo's message is as follows. As distinct from the simple word 'change', a corporate 'transformation' is very considerable in both scope and depth. A litmus test is whether the behaviour of most people in the organisation is affected significantly. There are three basic types of transformation process, each of which may include radical changes in culture. In other words, cultural change is not a separate category, as most academics and consultants would maintain. Nor, as companies are usually advised, must a transformation process necessarily focus directly on issues of competitive strategy if it is to succeed. The three most common types of transformation process, say Blumenthal and Haspeslagh, are: Radical operational improvement. Typically, this involves thorough redesign of business processes, supported by changes to structure, skills and behaviour. Strategic transformation. Some strategic changes, such as mergers, do not always imply transformation. Fundamental changes in strategy spark ones in the components of the organisation: its structure, processes, people and culture. Such transformation can be attempted in several ways. One is the traditional top-down approach, which can work in some cases. An increasingly popular approach, dubbed 'strategic framing', involves top management defining the company's strategic intent, as at Motorola, but then encouraging a great deal of experimentation and championing of actual strategies by middle managers. Some experts advocate a more minimalist view of the top team's ability to set even just strategic direction, and call for middle management to take the lead in a 'middle-up-down' approach. They claim that the current chaos at Digital Equipment is of this kind, and was stimulated deliberately. Genetic re-engineering. This is out in a category of its own, compared with the other two. It involves efforts by top executives to instil a management approach which is able constantly to renew the organisation, by anticipating and coping with change whenever big market changes occur. This involves creating a host of new structures, processes and behaviours, including culture change. The term 'genetic re-engineering' is jargon and, as a metaphor drawn from science, is not strictly accurate. But it certainly conveys the fundamental nature of the type of transformation involved. It also helps separate 'genetic' changes, such as those at US General Electric since 1981, from less broad and deep changes. Again conflicting with much conventional wisdom, Blumenthal and Haspeslagh say there is no one 'correct' combination of these three processes, nor sequence in which they should be attempted. The duo ends with two wise maxims. First, that transformations of any kind are more easily started than completed - especially if middle management cannot be converted solidly to the new approach. And second, that the need to transform never ends. Even highly adaptive, 'self-renewing' companies, such as 3M and Hewlett-Packard, need periodic and carefully-engineered transformation. So how about your organisation? * Corporate Transformation: Amalgams and Distinctions. Insead fax no (France) 33-1-60724242.</p>

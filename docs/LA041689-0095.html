			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Students plastered Beijing campus bulletin boards with posters mourning the  death of former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang and calling for more democracy  in China. Hu, 73, died after suffering two heart attacks within a week. The  posters described Hu, bundled into political obscurity after pushing the  country too far and too fast into reforms, as a heroic "fighter for democracy"  and indirectly attacked the Beijing leadership. Hu allowed a cultural thaw and  openly questioned Marxism before being forced to resign in early 1987.  Conservatives had accused him of failing to stop the spread of "bourgeois  liberal" ideas blamed for the student unrest of late 1986 which erupted at  Beijing University and other colleges.  </P></p>

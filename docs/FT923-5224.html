			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Foreign Affairs: A chance to vent spleen - French voters may vote 'No' on referendum day, but the morning after would be bleak 'Dix ans, ca suffit. Onze ans, c'est trop.' (Ten years is quite enough. Eleven is too much.) That was what the students chanted in Paris, in April 1969. They had failed to get rid of President Charles de Gaulle the previous year, on the 10th anniversary of his return to power. But in 1969 he foolishly held a referendum on a proposed reform (regionalisation) which did not seem to most people a burning necessity. That gave a wonderful opportunity for everyone who was fed up with him to vote against, without having to agree that they were for anybody or anything in particular. Three years later his successor, Georges Pompidou, held another referendum, on the enlargement of the European Community to admit Britain, Ireland and Denmark. This move achieved its objective of causing a split in the opposition between the pro-European Socialists, already led by Francois Mitterrand, and the anti-European Communists, already led by Georges Marchais. When Mr Mitterrand decided to hold a referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20, he clearly had the Pompidou precedent in mind rather than the de Gaulle one. Mitterrand too has succeeded in embarrassing and dividing an opposition which contains both fervent Europeans and fervent nationalists, with some of its leaders balanced between the two. He perhaps forgot that he, like de Gaulle in 1969 - and indeed like Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1990 - has been in power for 11 years. At least, unlike President de Gaulle, Mitterrand has not presented the issue as a personal vote of confidence in himself, or threatened to resign if it goes against him. He knows well that this would be seen by many as a reason to vote against it. 'Our only hope of getting it through is for him to warn that in the event of a 'No' vote he will stay,' a senior civil servant said, half jokingly, in June. But it now looks as though that may not be good enough. Last week I heard a French banker, a keen supporter of the president, wonder aloud whether Mitterrand might not yet save the situation by announcing, just before the poll, that he would resign in the event of a 'Yes' vote, his mission of securing Europe's future and France's place in it being at last accomplished. That was at the annual Aspen Institute seminar on 'the US and the world economy', which this year was held in France. The European participants  - drawn mainly from the banking and business elite but including senior politicians from France and Italy - were unanimous in hoping that Maastricht would go through, and by and large convinced their American interlocutors that they should hope that too. Parallels were drawn between European and North American integration even though (as one American speaker pointed out), the proposed North American Free Trade Association is a very different animal from the EC, Maastricht or no Maastricht. Speakers from both sides of the Atlantic reassured each other, and sought to reassure Japanese and other parties present, that no 'fortress Europe' or 'fortress America' was in prospect, and that regional arrangements, if properly managed, were a step towards the global liberalisation of markets. Perhaps the most telling argument in favour of Maastricht, at least at the Aspen seminar, was that a French 'No' vote would make an early breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations much less likely. One influential Japanese speaker did observe dryly that both the EC (by excluding agriculture from its 'Europe agreements' with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland) and Nafta (by raising the local content requirement for imported cars and abolishing the 'maquiladora' free trade zone) appeared to be violating the Gatt rules. But even he went on to argue that the future lay in a worldwide 'federation' of regional groups, though he was unclear about the nature of the group to which Japan itself would belong. At the same time, the European speakers were acutely aware of speaking for an elite which, irrespective of party labels, had largely forfeited the confidence of the man and woman in the street. The French were in a mood, as one of them remarked, to say not so much 'Non' as 'merde' to the entire political class. The precise reasons for this mood are hard for the British observer to grasp. One is inevitably struck by the prosperous and well-organised appearance of France as compared with Britain. But obviously high unemployment in France has a lot to do with it, especially now that the static condition of the economy offers little hope of early improvement. The danger of a referendum is that it enables all those who dislike a particular government, or a particular proposal, to gang together and defeat it without having to agree on an alternative. Some of the French politicians campaigning for a 'No' vote - notably Mr Marchais and Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader - are no more likeable than the establishment leaders calling for a 'Yes'; But that does not seem to matter in a referendum, where victory would not automatically give them power. Equally, there is much to dislike about the treaty itself. In June, I too gave way to an impulse of Schadenfreude and expressed the hope that Ireland would vote down Maastricht, suggesting that this would clear the decks for a better-designed European union. Happily the Irish ignored that advice. Events since have confirmed their wisdom. Turmoil in the currency markets has shown how difficult it is for Europe to maintain a fixed exchange rate regime with separate currencies and divergent fiscal policies. Worsening carnage in Bosnia-Hercegovina and the continued isolation of Macedonia have shown how ineffective is European foreign policy so long as every detail of it has to be negotiated between 12 national governments on the basis of unanimity. Damage limitation exercises after the Danish 'No' vote have distracted the EC from the more serious agenda: the Uruguay Round, the accession of European Free Trade Association members, aid to eastern Europe, and the follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit. Maastricht will not rectify these deficiencies overnight. The convergence necessary for monetary union will take until the end of the decade to achieve. The foreign policy machinery defined in the treaty will be only a slight improvement on the present one, and will in any case need to be recast in 1996 in the light of enlarged EC membership. But a 'No' vote from France, the country that has been in the vanguard from the very beginnings of European construction, would be a body blow to the entire enterprise. Nationalist demons would be unleashed throughout Europe, and much that has already been achieved would begin to unravel. In a world of nation-states, we might all be forced to choose between accepting German hegemony and forming an anti-German coalition: a choice which, for 40 years, French leaders have striven skilfully to avoid.</p>

TANJUG has learned from military sources in  Knin that Croatia acquired the tanks from weapons arsenals of  the army of the former East Germany.    Military circles in Knin interpret the import of the tanks  as  the reward to Croatia for its acceptance to form the  Croatian-Muslim confederation.</p>

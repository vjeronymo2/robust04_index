			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: New generation eyes seat of power - John Akers' search for a successor WANTED: Executive with broad experience, proven track record and strong leadership qualities. Must be under 50 years of age and willing to sit on the sidelines for at least two years before taking on one of the most demanding jobs in corporate America. THIS is a pivotal year for top executives at International Business Machines. Those who fail to live up to the expectations of its chairman, Mr John Akers, will find their careers slowing abruptly. Those with ambitions to become chairman will have to produce the financial results to justify their claims. The sudden departure of two of the company's highest ranking executives, both of whom had at one time been regarded as potential candidates for the top job in the computer manufacturer, has generated intense speculation about Mr Akers' successor. Mr Michael Armstrong, a senior vice-president and heir-apparent, announced recently that he was leaving to become chairman and chief executive of Hughes Aircraft. A few days later, Mr George Conrades, a former general manager of IBM USA, said he was leaving. Mr Conrades is seen as the most obvious victim of Mr Akers' tough new policy with his senior executives. He was demoted to a staff post last year when IBM's domestic performance failed to meet expectations. Under normal circumstances Mr Akers would be expected to give up the chairmanship in late 1994 when he turns 60. IBM has only occasionally waived its strict retirement policy - in 1988 the then joint vice-chairman, Mr Caspar Cassani, was asked to stay a further year. This year, Mr Jack Kuehler, the company's popular president, agreed to stay on beyond his planned retirement in September. These are far from normal times for IBM, however. The company has just weathered the worst year in its history, with sales slipping over 6 per cent to Dollars 64.79bn and a net loss, after charges, of Dollars 2.83bn. Mr Akers' chairmanship is under pressure. The six years since he took over have been marked by declining competitiveness and drastic measures to make up lost ground. The latest, put in train last year, aims to transform the company into a holding company with dozens of operational units that work independently, yet retain access to IBM research laboratories and other resources. There is no guarantee the plan will succeed in time to allow Mr Akers to make a graceful exit. Transforming IBM's ingrained hierarchical culture will be a slow and difficult process, many observers believe. For Mr Akers - and his top lieutenants  - renumeration is tied to results. As a result, Mr Akers' pay could be cut 40 per cent, to less than Dollars 1.6m, this year. Indeed, Mr Akers may be the only IBM executive who is not engaging in private speculation about the management race. He is said to be in no mood to discuss his retirement plans. He would like to complete the ambitious restructuring process. This is unlikely to be completed by the end of 1994 and he might wish to remain for another year or two. That could explain Mr Armstrong's move. Insiders insist he wanted to be a chief executive, but at 53, his age counted against him at IBM. IBM would want its new chairman to have 10 years in the role, according to Mr Sam Albert, a former IBM executive with close ties to the company. That criterion would rule out company veterans such as Mr Terry Lautenbach (53), Mr David McKinney (57) and Mr Steven Schwartz (57). Whether the main board, if asked, would allow Mr Akers to stay on is another matter. Traditionally, IBM chairmen, with the board's blessing, choose their successors. Now some suggest that for the first time IBM may look outside for a new chief executive. Most observers, however, expect Mr Akers to hand over to one of a group of second-tier executives, in their mid to late 40s, who are being counted on to improve the performance of key sectors in the toughest economic climate IBM has ever experienced. They include Mr Bob LaBant, 46, vice-president and general manager of IBM USA, Mr James Cannavino, 47, general manager of personal systems, Mr Ned Lautenbach, 48, president of IBM Asia Pacific (and Terry Lautenbach's brother), and Mr Bernard Puckett, 47, general manager of applications solutions. Long shots include Mrs Ellen Hancock, 48, general manager of networking systems and Mr Renato Riverso, chairman of IBM World Trade for Europe, Middle East and Africa. The smart money, however, seems to be on Mr LaBant and Mr Cannavino. Both have charm, energy and a willingness to talk to outsiders with an openness that would have seemed foreign to the company 10 years ago. Mr LaBant made his name as the manager of IBM's successful mid-range computer business. Its Rochester, Minnesota, manufacturing site last year won the coveted Malcolm Baldrige award for quality. An amusing speaker, he presents his arguments with a clarity which must have scored high marks in his progress through the company. Mr Cannavino, the enigmatic head of IBM's personal computer business, has a key role in two of IBM's most important alliances - an agreement with Groupe Bull focused on IBM's workstation technology, and a partnership with Apple designed to develop new microprocessors and software for personal computers. Mr Cannavino - someone who has addressed industry conferences wearing a T-shirt disguised as a tuxedo - hardly fits the traditional IBM mould, but he is very much the man of the moment. As a colleague of his remarked, the strait-laced executives of the past are no longer heroes at IBM. Ned Lautenbach has been in charge of Asia-Pacific operations for a year. However, he is not thought to score as highly on charisma and leadership as his brother Terry, who is on the company's five-man management committee. Mr Puckett is a dark horse. Little known outside IBM, his name always comes up when the succession is discussed. He is general manager of IBM's applications solutions line of business, responsible for putting together hardware and software to solve customers' problems. He previously ran the mainframe division. Much will now depend on how each contender performs over the next 12 months. Running the world's largest computer company in such trying times has proved a bed of nails for Mr Akers. As he ponders on his successor, he might well ask himself who would really want the job.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Discussions in Switzerland between PLO chief Yasir  'Arafat and Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the occupying  Zionist regime, on differences regarding autonomy for Gaza and  Jericho ended yesterday afternoon, but the problems have not  been solved.    Differences continue to exist over the Jericho region,  control of the Gaza-Jericho autonomous region's borders with  Egypt and Jordan, and the security situation in the Zionist  occupied settlements in Gaza and Jericho.    It is said that Yasir 'Arafat, representing the Palestinian  side, lacks effective levers or pressure on the Zionist bully,  and that he accepted some mediocre solutions in the Davos talks  and passed on suggestions through Shim'on Peres, foreign  minister of the Zionist regime, to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  of the occupying regime so that he could announce the final view  regarding them.    At the end of yesterday's discussion 'Arafat tried again to  create the illusion that differences between the Palestinian and  Israeli sides are being solved, and hoped that a new agreement  will soon be signed between Rabin and himself in the presence of  Mubarak. However, Shim'on Peres declined to express hope over  the Davos talks.    Some political analysts believe the failure to determine a  date for signing the new agreement indicates the vagueness and  lack of clarity rather than a definite outcome of talks between  'Arafat and Peres -- in particular because it has been decided  that they should continue the discussions in Cairo.    Meanwhile it seems that 'Arafat hopes, through concessions  to  the Zionist side, to take over the internal affairs of Gaza and  Jericho soon. Thus 'Arafat's hopefulness is more a result of  concessions to Israel but it is not clear whether the occupying  regime will be satisfied with the new concessions, particularly  because from the point of view of the Zionist regime the issue  of controlling the borders of Gaza and Jericho with Egypt and  Jordan is related to the security of the Zionist regime and this  is not an issue over which Israel would easily come to an  arrangement or hand over completely to the Palestinians.    From the point of view of the Zionist regime, the security  of  the occupiers is supreme to any form of credibility and it must  be maintained at any cost, even with the violation of the  security and national sovereignty of others. However, it is  possible to predict that talks between 'Arafat and Tel Aviv will  continue endlessly over differences and obstacles to the  Gaza-Jericho plan.    'Arafat has burned all his bridges behind him and Israel  feels that the present buoyant situation is in its interests  because, without giving any rights to the Palestinians, it is  receiving concessions from the Arabs and the West. This  situation was predicted earlier because the autonomy agreement  was designed to have sufficient ambiguity and contradictions as  to allow excuses for delays to its implementation.    However, the problem is not limited to the Davos talks. The  main crisis lies in the occupied lands. Israel has intensified  its suppression and the Palestinians have intensified the  conflict with the Zionist occupiers. The presence of 'Arafat's  Fatah forces alongside the Islamists in confrontation with the  Zionist regime is significant. This is an indication that  'Arafat has lost the game not only to Israel. A more important  card is the people of the occupied lands and the younger radical  Fatah forces whom 'Arafat has lost to the Islamists and the  Islamic intefada.    In the past few days, while discussions were under way  between 'Arafat and Israel, radical Fatah youths carried out at  least two anti-Israeli operations which indicate that  differences between Fatah and 'Arafat are increasing.</p>

The ANC refused to present its package of proposals to the  alliance before the leaders of the group committed themselves to  being flexible. The ANC asked the alliance to obtain such a  commitment from their leaders and report back no later than  Monday. If the report back was positive, the talks would resume  on Monday.    The Freedom Alliance has indicated that it prefers an agenda  to a proposal or package, and that it wants to discuss issues  point by point. In terms of the government package, the  alliance must accept the rulings of the provincial power as  outlined in the constitution if it wants the government to  accept the double ballot paper. The alliance must furthermore  agree to the retention of the present provisions governing the  entrenchment of provincial constitutions. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fanos Konstandinidhis] </F>   [Excerpts] Reliable information by I MAKHI notes that  President Glavkos Kliridhis plans to ask U.S. President Bill  Clinton to appoint a personal envoy on the Cyprus issue who will  act as an observer. The U.S. observer will have the same  mission as the observer from the European Union. However, an  effort will be made to give the U.S. observer more important  duties and to have him submit reports directly to President  Clinton. In this way, the U.S. President will get more involved  in the Cyprus issue because he will have direct knowledge of  developments.    As it has become known, Washington has been sounded out  regarding the appointment of a U.S. observer and the reaction  was not negative.    U.S. officials and people from President Clinton's circle  are  studying the request from Nicosia for the appointment of an  observer as a substitute for the special coordinator who is  under the State Department.    Nicosia estimates that the institution of the "special  coordinator" on the Cyprus issue has not been productive so far,  and the various "coordinators" at times did not do anything  worthwhile, as they usually resorted to small talk and useless  and deceiving statements.    In the meantime, important officials of the Greek community  in the United States are trying to arrange for a meeting between  President Clinton and President Kliridhis, perhaps in June in  Washington.    Political and diplomatic circles stress that a possible new  meeting between Clinton and Kliridhis, especially following the  collapse of the proximity talks, will give the opportunity for  personal intervention by the U.S. President in the Cyprus issue.  Irrespective of whether a Clinton-Kliridhis meeting takes place,  information notes that the Cyprus Government plans to ask for a  more active involvement by Washington in the Cyprus issue. One  of the basic issues that the Clinton Administration will be  asked to support is Cyprus' demilitarization.    According to government information, the five permanent  members of the UN Security Council view Kliridhis' proposal for  demilitarization positively, and the government is determined to  move toward this direction. Furthermore, it is not ruled out  that a special appeal to the Security Council will be made so  that the body will take an official position on the issue.    According to the estimate of diplomatic circles, following  the collapse of the talks on the confidence-building measures  there will be no action on the Cyprus issue until the Security  Council decides on the next move and after UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali submits his report with the relevant  suggestions. The report is expected to be submitted in three  weeks and will be based on the report of Joe Clark's [UN  secretary general's special representative on Cyprus] report to  the secretary general after his fruitless deliberations with the  Turkish side.    The estimates are that the Turks--Ankara and [Turkish  Cypriot  Leader Rauf] Denktas--have recently intensified their  intransigent stance. [passage omitted]    In the meantime, both Britain and Germany have openly  criticized the Turkish stance on the Cyprus issue and have let  it be known that the new impasse could lead to the process for  Cyprus' accession in the European Union to be accelerated.    In Nicosia there is information that the German presidency  of  the European Union [which will take over from Greece on 1 July  1994] has given assurances that it will promote Cyprus'  application for membership in the European Union.</p>

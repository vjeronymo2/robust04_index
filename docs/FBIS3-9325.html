It has been the first visit at this level since  Slovenia became independent.    The sides reviewed bilateral relations and expressed a  desire  to build a legal basis for contacts, Daskalov said. In  Ljubljana he met with his counterpart Lojze Peterle and was  received by President Milan Kucan, Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek  and Parliament Chairman Herman Rigelnik. The foreign ministers  signed an agreement on cooperation in culture, education and  science.    Daskalov said that a trade agreement and probably an  investment promotion agreement would be signed in Sofia in  April. Agreements on double taxation relief and transport  cooperation are also expected to be signed in the near future.    The two countries hold similar views on the crisis in the  former Yugoslavia and the efforts of Bulgaria and Slovenia to  become integrated into Europe, according to Daskalov. He said  the two countries would open talks on establishing a free trade  zone, perhaps during the visit here by Slovenia's Minister for  Foreign Economic Relations Davorin Kracun on April 20, according  to the Bulgarian foreign minister.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Fashion: A breeze from Africa clears the grunge - British designers are rediscovering the colonial look AN UNEXPECTED thing happened to the British design fraternity this spring. While all around were losing their heads to the dubious delights of the grungy 1970s revival, causing many observers to wonder how anyone selling designer fashion was going to make a living this year, the British headed unanimously for a different form of nostalgia - Africa. Finally, British designers seem to have learnt that fashion must be not only exciting but saleable. For here are elegant, interesting summer clothes that will see you through from office to holiday. For designers such as Mulberry and Margaret Howell, the British mood of colonial nostalgia is a hardy perennial. Their time has come again with the return to pale silk and linen, neutral suedes and long, swishy skirts. Others, more susceptible to fashion's whims, have made a strong statement of the same style. So too have the chain stores and, interestingly, commercial European houses such as Georges Rech, Sportmax and Louis Feraud. The original master of this look, Ralph Lauren, who even named a perfume Safari, carries it off to perfection. The colonial revival comes from a recognition that nostalgia is in the air, but that women mature enough to afford designer clothes favour the elegant 1930s and 1940s. In the politically correct 1990s, the quiet colours, natural fabrics and textures of safari dressing have an asceticism that seems contemporary. It is also natural fashion territory for British women. As Paul Costelloe points out: 'That soft, beautiful image of the Englishwoman abroad, in a pale dress sheltered by her parasol or gently sunkissed on a grand safari, has a natural resonance with my sort of customer. Perhaps it is my age, but I don't look on the 1970s with affection. I was working in America and I remember too many size 24 Southern belles in hotpants and waistcoats. I don't think women want that again.' Roland Klein, whose long safari dresses in heavy, textured linen have swingy and full or svelte slim skirts, believes his customer is 'not on the hippy trail. She is forward-looking and likes the modern practicality of the safari look.' But this modernity has retro overtones that make it distinctly different from the last time around. As softness is the key to this summer's fashion, so colonial safari style has adapted too. It is a long way from the crisp, cotton khaki shorts and T-shirts associated with the real thing. Margaret Howell, the designer, says it is her standard summer look, 'but I always adapt to current fashion and this time it is softer, longer, more antique-looking.' Designer Arabella Pollen describes the mood as eloquently as do the chiffon ties on her floppy safari suits: 'It's Africa as seen by 1930s Hollywood - a glamorous woman arriving in the bush, beautifully but over-formally dressed.' In fact, recent film titles are perfect scene setters: Out of Africa, White Mischief, The Lover and Indochine have the same basic fashion message, albeit from different periods and areas. It is the unchanging tropical version of past elegance - simple, hot-weather shapes plus an unstructured jacket for the cool of the evening or the hill country. The difference is in the softness and in new ways of layering the shapes. A safari jacket may have gently rounded details, a long skirt has fluttery pleats or an A-line cut to give movement, trousers are wide, pyjama-style in the softest silk, and the crisp shirt is replaced by a slip of ruffled chiffon. The mixes to try are a soft suede waistcoat over a long linen dress, a sleeveless frock worn like a pinafore over a tiny sweater, the low-necked feminine blouse under a tailored safari suit, and the softest silk scarves and throws with everything. Going on fashion safari always makes sound commercial sense but its latest reinvention follows a very fresh track.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Soldier's kidnap halts Israeli talks with PLO Israel suspended peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday and sealed off the Gaza Strip following the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier by Islamic militants who threatened to kill him. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, telephoned Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, and held him responsible for the safe return of the soldier, Corporal Nachshon Waxman, who was kidnapped by the fundamentalist Hamas group. The head of the Israeli delegation to the peace talks in Cairo, where negotiations are under way over Palestinian elections, was recalled. In Jerusalem Mr Rabin held talks wiith security officials and an emergency cabinet session was called for today. The incident, which comes amid reports that Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin are to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, marks one of the most serious political crises since Palestinian autonomy was established in May after Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. It follows warnings by Mr Rabin to Mr Arafat to crack down on Islamic fundamentalists, who oppose peace with the Jewish state. Mr Arafat has refrained from confronting the fundamentalists, fearing that any attempt to disarm them or arrest their leaders would result in a civil war. Hamas said it would kill the soldier unless Israel released a number of Moslem militant leaders being held prisoner by Friday. Mr Rabin's office warned that 'any harm to the soldier kidnapped by the Hamas or delay in the return of the soldier is likely to have a very detrimental effect on the future relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and the continuation of the peace process'. 'This is the true test for the Palestinian Authority,' Mr Rabin told Mr Arafat. It was the second time that Israel has sealed off the Gaza Strip, barring Palestinian workers from getting to their jobs in Israel, since autonomy began. The move puts additional pressure on Mr Arafat as the 50,000 workers are the main breadwinners for the impoverished coastal strip. In Gaza, Mr Arafat condemned the kidnapping and accused Hamas of provocation. He spoke to the parents of the kidnapped soldier and promised to do his best to win the release of their son, said his spokesman, Mr Nabil Abuirdeineh. Israel radio reported that Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state who is brokering peace between Israel and Syria, telephoned both Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat over the developments.

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT ACCUSES MAN OF CREDIT CARD SCAM;  </P> <P> CRIME: PROSECUTORS SAY HE TARGETED LATINOS AND COLLECTED NEARLY $100,000 IN  'SERVICE FEES' NATIONWIDE.  </P> <P> A North Hollywood man was arrested on suspicion of mail fraud for swindling  credit card applicants out of nearly $100,000, the U.S. attorney's office said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Charles Oberman, 50, who also uses the name Helmut Brunjes, faces nine felony  counts of mail fraud, said Carole Levitzky, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's  office.  </P> <P> If convicted, Oberman could receive a maximum sentence of five years in prison  and a fine of $250,000 on each of the counts, she said. Prosecutors said  Oberman ran advertisements for his Goldcard Services Inc. in Latino newspapers  across the country for five months in 1988.  </P> <P> The ads promised that "he could get his clients credit cards regardless of no  credit or bad credit," Levitzky said.  </P> <P> Applicants received a letter from Oberman stating that they had "received  preliminary approval for a VISA or a Mastercard when he had no authority from  VISA or Mastercard to solicit cards," Levitzky said.  </P> <P> She said the applicants were then asked to pay a "service fee" amounting to  $60.  </P> <P> More than 1,600 people nationwide paid the fee, but received no cards, Levitzky  said.  </P> <P> Oberman was arrested Wednesday and held in lieu of $50,000 bail.  </P> <P> He was expected to be arraigned today.  </P></p>

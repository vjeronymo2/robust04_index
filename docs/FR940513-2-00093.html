Also include any contracts with organizations for the provision of technical assistance. Do not include payments to individuals on this line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Justification:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attach a list of contractors indicating the name of the organization, the purpose of the contract, and the estimated dollar amount. If the name of the contractor, scope of work, and estimated costs are not available or have not been negotiated, indicate when this information will be available. Whenever the applicant/grantee intends to delegate a substantial part (one-third, or more) of the project work to another agency, the applicant/grantee must provide a completed copy of Section B, Budget Categories for each contractor, along with supporting information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line 6g_Construction:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Leave blank since new construction is not allowable and federal funds are rarely used for either renovation or repair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line 6h_Other:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enter the total of all other costs. Such costs, where applicable, may include, but are not limited to: insurance, medical and dental costs; noncontractual fees and travel paid directly to individual consultants; local transportation (all travel which does not require per diem is considered local travel); space and equipment rentals; printing and publication; computer use; training costs, including tuition and stipends, training service costs including wage payments to individuals and supportive service payments; and staff development costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line 6i_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Total Direct Charges: Show the totals of Lines 6a through 6h.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line 6j_Indirect Charges:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enter the total amount of indirect charges (costs), if any. If no indirect costs are requested, enter ``none.'' Indirect charges may be requested if: (1) the applicant has a current indirect cost rate agreement approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another federal agency; or (2) the applicant is a State or local government agency. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Applicants other than state and local governments are requested to enclose a copy of this agreement. Local and state governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be also charged as direct costs to the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of training grants to other than state or local governments (as defined in 45 CFR Part 74), federal reimbursement of indirect costs will be limited to the lesser of the negotiated (or actual) indirect cost rate or 8 percent of the amount allowed for total project (federal and non-federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, stipends, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations. As part of the justification, applications subject to this limitation should specify that the federal reimbursement will be limited to 8%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For training grant applications, the entry for line 6j should be the total indirect costs being charged to the project. The federal share of indirect costs is calculated as shown above. The applicant's share is calculated as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Calculate total project indirect costs (a*) by applying the applicant's approved indirect cost rate to the total project (federal and non-federal) direct costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Calculate the federal share of indirect costs (b*) at 8 percent of the amount allowed for total project (federal and non-federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items, alterations and renovations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c) Subtract b* from a*. The remainder is what the applicant can claim as part of its matching cost contribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line 6k_Total:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enter the total amounts of Lines 6i and 6j.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Line 7_Program Income:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Estimate the amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project.

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NON-ALCOHOLIC BEER IS NOT COMPLETELY ALCOHOL-FREE  </P> <P> Your article about non-alcoholic beer ("Miller Brewing Rolls Out a New  Non-Alcoholic Beer," Oct. 31) erred in not informing your readers that  "non-alcoholic" beer is not no-alcohol beer! So-called non-alcoholic beer still  may contain up to 0.5% ethyl alcohol under federal law.  </P> <P> It's high time for the fine print on near-beer labels to be enlarged so that  the consumer can be better informed as to the true alcohol content by volume of  each beer container.  </P> <P> No license is required to sell these products, and no identification need be  demanded of minors. Recovering alcoholics, pregnant women, minors and those  with special medical or health reasons who shouldn't drink alcohol had better  beware.  </P> <P> RAY CHAVIRA  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL  </P> <P> The writer is a member of the steering committee of the L.A. County Alcohol  Policy Coalition.  </P></p>

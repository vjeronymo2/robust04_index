			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Elisabeth Nordgren: </F> "Discontent Spreading In Latvia"]  <H5>  [11 Mar p 3] </H5>   [Text] It is almost time to leave. Zina stands out in the  bitter cold inspecting the vanload of furniture. Since 1985 Mrs.  Antonina Kuznetsova and her husband, an officer, have lived on  the Adazi Russian military base near Riga. She has worked here  as a typist at a military office, but now she and her family  must leave. Mrs. Kuznetsova looks sorrowful. She does not know  what awaits her in Rostov, where her family is moving.    Mrs. Kuznetsov's family is one of almost 3,000 officers'  families that must eventually leave Latvia. But, for now,  negotiations over the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia  have broken down.    At present, however, individual families are moving. People  still seem to be living in most apartment buildings on the Adazi  base. Curtains hang in the windows, rugs and mattresses hang on  frames for dusting, out in yards where children play in the  snow. A gray striped cat slinks out into the cold and a  half-completed apartment building stands empty up on the hill.  <H5>  Empty Barracks Area </H5>   The barracks area itself is also empty, except for the  battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Anatoliy Kvartsov, and  just under 100 officers and soldiers (of a force of 2,500 men)  who still live in the housing area. But the barracks have been  emptied of their soldiers. The cots stand in neat rows. Even the  bed of the "unknown soldier" up on a platform has been made.    As recently as December 1992 the base was teeming with life,  the tramping of boots, and the sound of target practice. Then  people started moving away.    Adazi base, 18 kilometers north or Riga, was used as a  training site for sergeants who, after a half year of training,  went on to various posts in the Baltics.    Lt. Col. Kvartsov believes that eventually he, too, will  leave, but he does not yet know when. He received his military  training at a military academy in the northern Caucasus. He will  soon be homeless when he moves to Russia and his wife, who  worked as a bookkeeper on the base, will be unemployed.    The commander does not know what will happen to all the  housing in the area.    "Everything here is owned by the Russian Army, but the local  authorities will probably take over the buildings."    There are still a total of 10,000 active-duty soldiers in  Latvia (of 120,000 during the Soviet period). If we add to this  number an additional 200,000 (the figures vary depending on the  source; the Army's press officer indicates 60,000) pensioned  officers, disabled veterans of the Great Patriotic War, and  those who spent time in concentration camps, we are talking  about a significant military potential.    Here they have the same problems as in Estonia. The various  categories of pensioner's housing rights are in jeopardy,  pensions paid from the Russian Defense Ministry's fund are  nonexistent, social rights are limited (free health care has  been abolished) and Russia is demanding that Latvia pay  considerable sums to support the Russian military. Moreover, war  veterans are paid their pensions in accordance with Latvian law,  and the amount is not great--only 21 lati (approximately 210  markkas). And since the rent alone amounts to 20 lati, there is  not much left over for food. The idea is for Latvia to  contribute a housing subsidy of 50 percent. In addition, the  press officer said that Russia could not pay war veterans of  foreign powers. This is in conflict with the Latvian position,  so the stage is set for conflict in this area. It is not  surprising that a large portion of retired military personnel  voted for Zhirinovskiy.  <H5>  Beggars in Riga </H5>   Over half the Russian population of Latvia, which is half  the  population of the country (2.7 million inhabitants) also voted  for Zhirinovskiy. Moreover, since the law on citizenship, in  which conditions are far stricter than in Estonia, has not yet  been approved, a large portion of the Latvian population is, in  a sense, outside society. One-fourth of the Russian population  has become Latvian citizens, however, as they have been living  in the country since the 1940's.    However, the lack of citizenship for the majority has led to  increasing frustration, which can even be seen on the streets of  Riga. Despite elegant new boutiques, despite stylish  restaurants, the mood is dismal and gloomy. Armed civil guards  are seen here and there. The banks are guarded. There are  beggars and homeless people outside the railway station in Riga,  where angry old Russian women stand and sell cigarettes. These  old women, former factory workers and now poor pensioners, are  angry at both the Kremlin and the leaders in Riga.    "I worked and slaved for 40 years in a factory and this is  the thanks I get," said Olga.    "I get a pension of 25 lati and my rent is 18 lati. What am  I  supposed to live on? There are nothing but bandits in the  government. They should be thrown out like the Russian pigs. The  leaders live well, but no one thinks about us ordinary people.  My daughter, who is a student, is unemployed, so I am just  forced to stand here and sell things. The profits are nothing to  write home about, about one lati (10 markkas) a day. Then the  police show up and take our cigarettes."    Another old woman said she supported her son by selling  cigarettes. Her pension is also small. And it is difficult to  sell the cigarettes. She believes that Moscow is solely  responsible for her predicament. It is a shame that the Soviet  Union broke up, according to the old woman, who previously made  a living in fishing.    Eight-year-old Jani sits by the stairs leading down to the  subway. He is shaking with cold. He holds a piece of paper that  says in Russian that his mother is his sole provider. She is  unemployed and has four children. The family has nothing to eat.  <H5>  "Help Us" </H5>   Zhirinovskiy supporters in Riga complain about worsening  conditions in schools, a shortage of Russian books and Russian  libraries, and an unwillingness on the part of Latvian  authorities to provide courses in Latvian for those who want to  apply for citizenship. They point out that the economic  situation is strained for everyone in Latvia, but that it is  extremely difficult for unemployed Russians to find work. They  also point out that the lack of citizenship for the Russian  populace and for other minorities makes it difficult to  demonstrate that their human rights are being violated in this  country. Many Russians would be willing to leave the country if  only they had somewhere to go.    They also point out that half the industry in Latvia has  been  shut down. Factories with Russian workers are generally closed.  Zhirinovskiy supporters are also highly critical of Yeltsin, who  has ignored the exiled Russians in Latvia. The level of  education among Russians in Latvia is falling, since higher  education is offered only in Latvian. These Zhirinovskiy  supporters also believe that the Baltic nations will join the  CIS countries, even if they support an independent Latvia.    It is a fact that the standard of living has dropped, that  unemployment has risen, and that dissatisfaction has spread. And  the Latvians are becoming more and more concerned over a fifth  column and a Russian attack of some kind, while the country's  leadership is feverishly working for more economy and other  contacts with the West.  <H5>  Concern Over Greater Russian Influence in the Baltics </H5>   Guntis Ulmanis, the Latvian president, indicates that the  demobilization of Russian troops has become a serious problem.    "Since Russia does not seem to be willing to withdraw its  troops from the Baltic, the Russian leaders clearly intend to  maintain their influence here. Since it is also impossible to  predict what will happen in Russian politics, the situation is  troubling."    The Russians who were involved in the coup attempt and were  recently released in Moscow have the potential to develop a  strong leadership, according to Ulmanis. The question is what  they will decide to do.    Nevertheless, Ulmanis looks to the future of Latvia with  confidence.    "Life has become better and quieter here. There is plenty of  food and other necessities. Privatization is under way and  industry is being activated. And we are continually developing  our security structure."    At the same time, Ulmanis is hoping for more moral support  from Finland which, because of its experience with a complicated  past, can understand Latvia's vulnerable situation. More  business ties are also desired.    Ulmanis does not see unemployment as a serious problem in  Latvia. It is relatively low at present, he said. However, he  wants to shut down the large factories previously run by Moscow.  The citizenship law should be enacted later this spring, which  should ease the situation for the Russian-speaking population.  <H5>  [14 Mar p 4] </H5>   [Text] In Lithuania, 4 March is St. Kasimir's Day. St.  Kasimir is the patron saint of Catholic Lithuania. In Vilnius,  his day is celebrated with song and dance, a warming glass of  punch in the snow slush, and brisk sales at the markets on the  narrow streets of the old town. The most popular Kasimir item is  made of dried grass with various types of flowers dipped in  coloring and tied into a long, narrow, and brightly colored  bouquet.    The people look happy and open and the mood is relaxed. The  cozy cafes are filled with parents and numerous small children  who happily drink their juice. And people gather in the many old  churches to hear organ music and choirs.  <H5>  More Contact With the West </H5>   On the surface, at least, things seem to be going well in  Lithuania, although the standard of living has dropped here as  it has in the other Baltic states. This, by the way, is a trend  in most of the postcommunist nations.    But there are few unemployed, only one percent, even though  some large plants do not operate every day, according to Justaf  Paletskis, President Brazauskas' foreign policy advisor. And, of  course, this leads to social and psychological problem for those  who are affected by unemployment. Nor is the crime rate as high  as it is in the other two Baltic states, Paletskis points out.    Thus, under the leadership of former communist leader and  current President Algirdas Brazauskas, Lithuania is stabilizing  both economically and politically, it is establishing good  relations with neighboring Poland, Russia, and Belorussia and,  most important, it is increasing cooperation with the other  Baltic nations and with the Nordic countries. A NATO membership  is also on its wish list.    The last Russian troops left Lithuania in August 1993. Since  the democratic law on citizenship was approved, all minorities  were able to seek citizenship immediately, which 85 percent of  them did. As a result, minority conflicts in Lithuania (just  over 9 percent Russians, 10 percent Poles, and various other  minority groups out of a population of 3.7 million) are minimal  compared with Estonia and Latvia.    The majority of the Russian-speaking population are loyal  Lithuanian citizens, Paletskis pointed out.  <H5>  New Rich Doing Well </H5>   One person who is happy with her life in Lithuania is  31-year-old Daiva who is trained as a hairdresser. She was out  on the town, shopping with her four-year-old son Martin. She is  one of the country's new rich. She lives in her parents' private  home and has a small vegetable garden. To be sure, she is  unemployed at present, but she can afford to be a homemaker and  take care of her child because her husband earns well. He  purchases goods in Sweden and sells them at home in Lithuania.    "Everything is fine. There are plenty of goods in the shops.  Our standard of living has gone up despite everything, although  rent is high and goods are expensive," Daiva said.    Industrious Daiva also does some extra work at times. Her  husband buys meat and other small items and Daiva sells them at  the market place.    There are no conflicts between Russians and Lithuanians  according to Daiva, who has several Russian friends.  <H5>  Subversive Activities </H5>   Despite everything, Zhirinovskiy supporters and other  Russian  groups are not particularly happy with their lives in Lithuania.  But these dissidents, about 3,000 people, form a tiny minority.    Among them is Valentin Mesheryakov, a member of the Russian  Communist Party. He has lived in Lithuania since 1953, is  married to a Lithuanian woman, speaks the country's language,  supported Lithuanian independence, but has not received  Lithuanian citizenship. Why?    "I would have received citizenship if I had signed a paper  that demands loyalty to the Lithuanian state. Since I have  always considered myself a democratic person, I thought this  requirement was undemocratic. There is a strange political game  going on. The other day I was summoned by the public prosecutor  and accused of subversive activity. That was because I am  chairman of Rossiya.    This organization of Russian citizens exists in all the  Baltic states, along with other associations that safeguard the  interests of the Slavic people. It is these organizations, with  their ties to Moscow, that are building a fifth column in  Lithuania.    Mesheryakov continued:    "My home and the homes of my friends have been ransacked,  too. We try to obey the laws of Lithuania, but we do not let  Lithuanians into our territory. It is the job of Russia's  prosecutor to handle may case, not that of the Lithuanian  prosecutor. I demand freedom for Rossiya to operate here in  Lithuania. According to Lithuanian law, only Lithuanian citizens  have the right to establish organizations. But I will cite  paragraph 23, according to which foreigners have the same rights  as Lithuanian citizens."    "Our organization is apolitical, although I personally am a  communist. But anyone from fascists to communists can join  Rossiya. Russia is my country, and it is there I am asking for  help."    Several of Mesheryakov's communist friends are in jail,  accused of weapons possession and active opposition to Sajudis,  the Lithuanian popular front that paved the way for Lithuanian  independence.    Translator Tatyana Bogoshilskaya, born in Vilnius, was also  interrogated after the coup leaders in Moscow were released,  since she is in charge of a Russian cultural organization that  is also considered to be disloyal toward Lithuania.  <H5>  Where Is Brotherhood? </H5>   At a meeting in the Teachers' Building, where members of  some  20 Russian organizations in Vilnius met, an elderly woman broke  into tears. She had been without work for a long time and did  not have Lithuanian citizenship. Her husband had left her and  gone to Ukraine.    "We are hungry. What kind of freedom is this? Where is the  brotherhood and equality? The rich ones leave and we have to  stay here. Whey doesn't Russia find my husband? Here most  Russians are unemployed and accused of being "red-brown." The  criminal government in Moscow owes us a lot."    A younger woman who had worked for the Soviet Army has no  citizenship at all and not even a valid passport. Now it seems  she will have to wait 10 years to become a Lithuanian citizen.  Another woman, who worked for the KGB in Vilnius, also  complained because she had not received Lithuanian citizenship,  but she is prepared to leave for Moscow at any time.    Nina Ivanova also cried bitterly. Her son, Valeriy Ivanov  has  been in prison in Vilnius for the past two years. He stands  accused of helping start the blood bath in Vilnius in January  1991 in which 14 innocent people were killed. Every day she  visits her son in prison, where he awaits his trial. She is also  concerned for her grandson who was left on his own in Moscow  where his mother died.    "My son is innocent. He will be acquitted. It was Antonas  Terliatskas of Free Lithuania who started the violence here in  Vilnius. Who will take care of my grandson? I have worked here  for 45 years. Now I am old. Who will bury me when my time comes?  I am all alone.  <H5>  A Victim of the Empire Has His Chance To Help </H5>   Jack of all trades Vytautas Cinauskas, geologist, historian,  poet, was among the Baltic people who were oppressed by Soviet  power. He was deported for 15 years.    Even as a young man in 1941 he was sent with his mother and  his 11-year-old brother to a prison camp far away in deepest  Siberia on the River Lena, the coldest part of Russia, and he  was not allowed to return until 1956. Toward the end, he was  ordered to work on a geological research project.    His mother died of hunger almost immediately in the prison  camp. The years passed and Cinauskas mannaged to flee, but was  soon caught again in 1948. After his release, it took more years  before Cinauskas was rehabilitated and allowed to begin studying  and get a job.    In the prison camp, Cinauskas met Finns and Karelians from  the Russian side. He was also sent down into the mines, where he  had to work for eight years.    "Only a sense of humor could get you through prison camp and  forced labor. It was also difficult to live here in Vilnius  after I returned home. People did not want to accept me. I could  not find work, since I had no official place of domicile."    Now Cinauskas has full-time employment as the head of a  foundation for deportees who want to return home. There are  still thousands of Lithuanians who were deported by the former  Soviet empire during the forties. They and their children need  help to return to their homeland.    The foundation was established in 1992 and it has received  donations from exiled Lithuanians as far away as Brazil. The  telephone rings in one of Cinauskas' offices at the headquarters  of the Cultural Foundation in downtown Vilnius. One wall is  covered with pictures of partisans and other deportees. A map  shows the areas to which Lithuanians were forcibly moved.    Cinauskas is also gathering material for a book on genocide  in Lithuania, including the deportation of Lithuanians and life  in the prison camps.    As early as 1940, during the Sovietization of Lithuania,  21,000 Lithuanians who were undesirable to the regime were  deported to Siberia. The next wave of deportations came after  the war, when several hundred thousand Balts were forcibly moved.</p>

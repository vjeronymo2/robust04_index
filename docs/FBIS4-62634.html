			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Osipov] </F>   [Text] Abijan May 18 TASS -- The Russian ship Zolotitsa has  been detained in the capital of Liberia for "an illegal call at  the port of Monrovia and unauthorized delivery of 81 foreigners  to the country", the Liberian Ministry of Justice said in a  statement released on Tuesday. The statement says that eleven  employees of the immigration service in the port have been  charged with "neglecting their duties".    The ship arrived in the port two weeks ago, and 81 persons  suspected of being mercenaries disembarked, the statement says.  They landed and disappeared before the immigration service  employees had time to understand what was happening. It was not  immediately known from what country they arrived and what was  Zolotitsa's last port of call before Monrovia.    Asked by ITAR-TASS to comment on the incident, a Liberian  Embassy official in Cote d'Ivoire replied that "he does not have  any details of the case".    The other day the leader of one of the military-political  groupings of Liberia's United Liberation Movement for Democracy  Roosevelt Johnson accused the leader of another faction of the  same grouping, Alhaji Kromah and his supporters from the  Mandingo tribe of using the services of foreign mercenaries in  fighting the ethnic group of Kran.    Kromah rejected the allegations as "groundless, slanderous  and aimed at provoking unrest".</p>

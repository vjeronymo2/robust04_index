			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEIL BUSH'S FORMER PARTNER PETITIONS FOR BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Former Denver developer Bill Walters, who defaulted on about $100 million in  loans from Silverado Savings &amp; Loan, has filed a personal bankruptcy  petition in federal court in Santa Ana listing debts of $279 million.  </P> <P> The filing comes several months after Walters, a former business partner of  Neil Bush -- President Bush's son who sat on the Silverado board, created a  firestorm of controversy in Washington when it was revealed that he was living  in a $1.9-million Newport Beach home a month after telling Congress that he was  broke.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy petition, filed Nov. 1, lists more than 200 creditors. The  largest is New York banking giant Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which is  owed $111 million. He even lists his ex-wife Mary Lou McGuire, whom he owes  $5.3 million.  </P> <P> In Southern California, Walters owes $5.2 million to Far West Savings &amp;  Loan in Newport Beach, according to the petition. Irvine businessman Burt M.  Heimlich is listed as having a $1.95-million claim.  </P> <P> Walters could not be reached for comment. His San Diego bankruptcy attorney  Nathan E. Jones did not return several phone calls.  </P> <P> Walters was once one of Denver's highest-flying real estate developers, helping  to reconfigure the city's skyline while amassing a personal fortune that in the  mid-1980s totaled at least $200 million. He moved to Orange County this year  after his empire collapsed in connection with the depression in Denver's real  estate markets.  </P> <P> Silverado had bankrolled the Bill L. Walters Cos. and federal regulators claim  that his firm's default on $96 million in loans helped cause the thrift's 1988  collapse, which is expected to cost taxpayers $1 billion.  </P> <P> Neil Bush became the subject of a federal inquiry and the lightning rod for  taxpayer anger over the savings and loan crisis in part because he approved  loans to Walters while sitting on Silverado's board of directors.  </P> <P> Congress has investigated charges that Bush may have violated  conflict-of-interest laws because he was a partner with Walters in an oil  exploration firm. Bush is also a defendant in a $200-million lawsuit filed  against some former Silverado officials by federal regulators.  </P> <P> Walters actions drew national attention in July when it was disclosed that he  was living in a Newport Beach mansion and dividing his leisure time between a  $1-million desert retreat near Palm Springs and a $250,000 mobile home on  Laguna Beach. Just the month before he told a House subcommittee he had "a  negative net worth."  </P> <P> Each of those homes is listed either in the name of his second wife Jacqueline  or in a trust of which she is the beneficiary. The Newport Beach home is for  sale.  </P> <P> Under Chapter 7, a federal bankruptcy judge will appoint an independent trustee  to liquidate Walters assets and distribute them to debtors according to rules  set forth in bankruptcy law.  </P> <P> The law allows a debtor to hold on to $45,000 in home equity and up to $1,200  invested in a car. Jewelry, heirlooms and works of art exceeding a total of  $2,500 must be sold.  </P> <P> The court-appointed trustee may also probe whether Walters has hidden assets or  improperly transferred them to relatives or friends, said James I. Stang, a Los  Angeles bankruptcy attorney and a former Chapter 7 trustee. This could include  three homes and two Mercedes-Benzes that are held in the name of his wife,  Jacqueline Walters.  </P> <P> "There are certain statutory lawsuits that the trustee can bring that examine  transactions that occur within four years of the bankruptcy," Stang said. "What  the trustee would want to examine would be the sources of the money for those  purchases. The fact things were acquired in her name or a trust benefiting her  is not necessarily the end of the story."  </P> <P> The former Jacqueline Brown, an insurance saleswoman before she married Walters  in 1986, is listed in the bankruptcy filing as a creditor for "unpaid family  expenses under prenuptial agreement" though the amount claimed is zero.  </P> <P> The Walters were married on Nov. 15, 1986, and the Walters Trust I -- which is  in her name and is the entity that purchased the Newport Beach home -- was  formed a day later. He transferred his $1-million Indian Wells condominium to  her on Nov. 17 of the same year, according to records in the Riverside County  Recorder's office.  </P> <P> Nearly all of the Walters' creditors contacted on Friday refused to comment.  </P></p>

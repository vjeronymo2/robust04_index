			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Merivale settles dispute over building collapse MERIVALE MOORE, a property company, has won several million pounds as a settlement of its four-year dispute over the collapse of a building in Battersea. The company took legal action against Royal Insurance, Commercial Union, Bovis, Fairclough and Grove Consultants, a subsidiary of Wimpey. The size of the final settlement will depend on the resolution of a related dispute with another insurance company. The dispute concerned a 45,000 sq ft building at Ransomes Dock, near Albert Bridge in Battersea, that was being converted into flats and offices. In January 1989, a wall collapsed after the building's sub-structure was weakened by nearby construction work. Mr Granville Dean, chairman, said that the settlement would have a healthy impact on the company's net assets. At the last year end, on June 30 1992, it had net assets of Pounds 10m and borrowings of Pounds 40m. Two thirds of Merivale Moore's business is concerned with commercial property, particularly an office campus in Cambridge. It also owns flats in London's St Johns Wood.</p>

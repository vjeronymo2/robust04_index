			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CONEJO VALLEY;  </P> <P> GARDEN IS A REFUGE FOR PLANTS, PEOPLE  </P> <P> Nestled between condominiums and a shopping mall, the Conejo Valley Botanic  Garden, with its chaparral-covered hills and winding nature trail, is an urban  refuge for both woodpeckers and people.  </P> <P> Attracting an average of 60 plant enthusiasts, joggers and bird-watchers each  weekend, the garden remains one of Thousand Oaks' best kept secrets.  </P> <P> Organizers say the absence of a defined boundary makes the garden appear to be  just an extension of its neighbor, Conejo Community Park.  </P> <P> Volunteer gardeners hope to clear up the confusion by installing a fence around  the northwest portion of the garden later this summer.  </P> <P> Funding for the fence, about $3,000, will come from a recent $10,000 grant from  Exxon.  </P> <P> "With a fence, people will be corraled into the garden," said Barbara Song,  treasurer of the nonprofit Gregor Mendel Botanic Foundation Inc., which manages  the 35-acre grounds.  </P> <P> "We also need more signs because people get off in the wrong direction. We're  hoping this will do it."  </P> <P> The fence should also help reduce vandalism and create a protected area where  gardeners can grow more sensitive plants.  </P> <P> Until now, the foundation has hesitated to exchange seeds with other gardens  out of fear that the plants would never get a proper chance to sprout.  </P> <P> Children who use the garden as a shortcut to and from school knock over  sprinklers and plants, Song said. The gate on the fence will be locked at  night.  </P> <P> Organizers say they plan to expand the collection, which includes olive trees,  holly oak trees and Aleppo pine trees.  </P> <P> The expansion will focus on drought-resistant plants so that the garden's  twice-weekly watering schedule will not have to be increased.  </P> <P> When the Conejo Valley Recreation and Park District was given the land in 1973  by the Klingbiel Corp., it was little more than a hill covered with dry brush.  </P> <P> The Gregor Mendel Botanic Foundation was formed to manage the grounds under a  $1-a-year park district lease, said Jim Gilmore, development planner.  </P> <P> With water provided by the park district, the foundation spends about $1,000  annually on repairs, relying mainly on contributions and volunteers to expand  and maintain the garden, Song said.  </P> <P> The garden contains 200 species of plants and trees, including a small orchard  and a section for succulents. The Conejo buckwheat, which is Thousand Oaks'  official flower and is on the endangered list, has also found a home at the  garden. STEPHANIE STASSEL  </P></p>

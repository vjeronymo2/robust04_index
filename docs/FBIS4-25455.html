			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Xinjiang News" program] </F>   [Excerpt] On the afternoon of 6 June, the Xinjiang Military  District held a ceremonial meeting at the Bayi [1 August] Club  to sum up the Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable communications  project and to commend those involved in the project. Those  attending the meeting included Fu Bingyao, deputy commander of  the Lanzhou Military Region and commander of the Xinjiang  Military District; Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of  the Lanzhou Military Region and political commissar of the  Xinjiang Military District; Wang Yousan, vice chairman of the  Xinjiang Autonomous Region; and officers and men taking part in  the construction of the project.    At the meeting, Zhou Yongshun, deputy political commissar of  the Xinjiang Military District, read the military district's  circular to commend and record announcements of merit for nine  units and 10 individuals. Heads of the military district and  leaders of Xinjiang presented awards to the units and  individuals who rendered meritorious service and presented silk  banners and keepsakes to units taking part in the construction  of the project. Fang Denghua, deputy commander of the Xinjiang  Military District and commander in chief of the optical cable  communications project, summed up the project. He said: The  Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable communications project is a key  state project of the Eighth Five-Year Plan and a part of the  continental communications bridge connecting Asia and Europe.  Completion of the project has great significance for China's  reform and opening up, for invigorating the economy of northwest  China, for accelerating Xinjiang's development, and for  preserving Xinjiang's social stability. The Xinjiang Military  District dispatched nearly 10,000 officers and men and more than  600 vehicles and other equipment to dig trenches for laying the  880-km long optical cables. The troops taking part in the  construction work, in keeping the overall situation in mind,  earnestly practiced the five kinds of revolutionary spirit  advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 64-character  enterprising spirit advocated by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They  worked diligently under extremely difficult conditions, which  enabled them to complete the project 45 days ahead of schedule  and thus accomplish a miracle in the construction of the  country's communication projects.

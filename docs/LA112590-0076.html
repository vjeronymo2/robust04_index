			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLA BREVE  </P> <P> NANES: Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4. London Philharmonic, conducted by Thomas  Sanderling. Delfon CDR 4050(compact disc). Apparently Richard Nanes would like  nothing better than to be known as an American Gustav Mahler.  </P> <P> The angst-ridden Symphony No. 3 -- a threnody to the victims of the Holocaust  -- rails and broods and shakes its fist as it exploits the resources of a large  orchestra. The Symphony No. 4 is designated as a battle between "good and evil"  no less, and it piles on the rage and redemption even more thickly and at  greater length. At no time, though, does one hear even a ghost of a striking  musical idea, something which acres of sumptuously recorded sound and fury  can't quite hide. RICHARD S. GINELL  </P></p>

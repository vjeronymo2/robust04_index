			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Turkey attacks major powers Turkey yesterday attacked the major powers and the international community as a whole for their failure to use military force to counter 'the Serbian aggression' in Bosnia, writes Robert Mauthner in New York. Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister, told a news conference during a meeting of the UN General Assembly that his government was becoming 'increasingly discouraged' by the ineffectiveness of UN and EC efforts to stop the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems. In a reference to the extreme reluctance of the US and other members of the Security Council to contemplate the use of military force in Bosnia, Mr Cetin said this was a serious mistake.</p>

He added: 'The latter alternative, although attractive, is in the long run neither economically rational nor politically credible.' Lord Desai said Labour had to think about taxation that would hit consumption by the better-off. He favoured higher band income tax and ending of the ceiling on national insurance contributions, proposed in Labour's 1992 election manifesto. 'Failing that, I would remove zero rating for VAT on all items.' Benefit entitlements could be doubled to compensate the poor, he added.

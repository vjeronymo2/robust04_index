			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: Statoil suffers from lower oil prices STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, saw profits fall to NKr2.2bn (Dollars 352.56m) from NKr3.5bn due to lower oil prices, weak refinery margins and depressed prices. It warned that profits for the year would be lower than last year unless prices for the group's main products improved significantly, or the dollar strengthened against the krone. Last year, the group reported a net profit of NKr4.2bn, compared with NKr4.3bn in 1990. Third-quarter net profit was halved to NKr535m from NKr1.1bn last year, despite a rise in operating revenue to NKr20.7bn from NKr19.7bn. Third-quarter pre-tax profit fell to NKr2.5bn from NKr3.6bn. Statoil was forced to charge accounts with a NKr1.2bn loss compared with a NKr476m financial charge last year. The charge resulted partly from a NKr489m loss incurred by swapping free shares in Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, for A-shares. Statoil holds a 9.4 per cent stake in Saga. Operating revenue rose to NKr61bn from NKr57.8bn as operating costs increased to NKr46.5bn from NKr42.5bn. Mr Morten Woldsdal, a Statoil executive, warned the company may be forced to intensify efforts to reduce costs if market conditions do not improve. He said Statoil was considering delaying investments and divesting some of its North Sea assets, but gave no further details. Operating profit fell by NKr1.1bn to NKr10bn in the nine-month period. Statoil said weak markets had been party offset by higher oil and gas production and increased revenue from pipeline transport. Production rose to 115m barrels from 105m last year, but oil prices fell in the period to an average Dollars 19.36 a barrel from Dollars 19.82 last year. Group pre-tax profit fell to NKr8.9bn from NKr10.7bn last year. For Statoil's individual business operations, exploration and production suffered a decline in operating profit to NKr6.6bn from NKr7.3bn last year, mainly because of weaker oil prices. The natural gas division, a bright spot, saw operating profit in the period rise to NKr3bn from NKr2.6bn last year due to an increase in volumes of transported gas. Refining and marketing saw operating profit nearly halved to NKr563m from NKr1bn last year, due to lower refinery margins and weaker rates in the marine transport business. Statoil operates more than 30 oil tankers. Petrochemicals and plastics plunged into an operating loss of NKr265m from a profit of NKr144m last year. 'The weak result so far this year reflects the deep recession affecting the petrochemicals industry and particularly the plastics sector,' Statoil said.</p>

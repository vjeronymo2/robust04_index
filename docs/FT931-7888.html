			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers turn attention to global offerings THE CONCEPT of global bond offerings is catching the attention of a growing range of borrowers. Last week, the Kingdom of Sweden, the World Bank and the Canadian Province of Quebec all launched large global bonds. The process of offering bonds simultaneously in the US, Europe and the Far East allows borrowers to raise larger sums and to place paper at the best possible price. Not surprisingly, borrowers are eyeing the mechanism closely, but it does have some limitations. The concept was pioneered by the World Bank, which launched a Dollars 1.5bn issue in September 1989. Last week's Y200bn global bond issue was its tenth, and it plans to launch the first D-Mark global offering later this year. Mr Kenneth Lay, director of financial operations, says that one of the main motives was to achieve a single world price for its bonds. This has resulted in what the World Bank regards as a more accurate valuation of its bonds, thereby increasing investor confidence in the pricing of the paper. Prior to the start of its global programme, there was often a yield differential of 10 to 20 basis points between World Bank Eurobonds and bonds placed in the US market. In practice, all triple-A credits are not the same: European investors were willing to pay a higher premium for World Bank paper than US investors. Under the global programme, the knowledge that there would be a strong bid for the paper in Europe helped increase US investors' confidence. But there are other differences between US and European investors. European investors are heavily influenced by their views on the currency outlook, buying dollar bonds aggressively when the dollar looks set to rise. Japanese investors take a similar approach, but the timing is different, since there are occasions when, for example, the dollar is weak against the yen but firm against European currencies. US investors on the other hand are blind to such considerations. So far, there have been global offerings in dollars, Canadian dollars, and yen. Global bonds denominated in D-Marks and French francs are expected this year. That experiment may be less successful. Although both currencies are increasingly widely traded internationally, US fund managers are still far more averse to currency risk than their European counterparts. US bankers are sceptical about how well the structure would function, given that most US fund managers still want to buy only dollar bonds. So far only two corporate borrowers, Matsushita Electric Industrial of Japan and Ford Motor Credit of the US, have issued global bonds, and the scope for more global corporate bonds appears limited. Few companies need to borrow sums of Dollars 1bn or more in one go. Further, differences in credit perception between corporates from different countries are more difficult to overcome. For example, Ford's recent global offering was mostly placed in the US, where Ford paper trades far tighter than in Europe. The greater familiarity of investors with domestic companies is likely to mean that the advantages of global bond offerings for companies are more limited: when a single-A rated UK company launches a long-dated sterling bond, it is likely to be placed with a small base of domestic investors, even if it were to be packaged as a global offering. The global bond market is less a single market, than the linking of a number of different markets, to the benefit of both investors and borrowers. Global bonds combine the features of US bonds and Eurobonds. The borrower has to register its intended offering with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and get its prospectus approved by the SEC, as for a US domestic bond. But global bonds have the same fee structure as for Eurobonds, which is cheaper than the US market. Efficient distribution and settlement between markets in different parts of the world have considerably reduced price spreads because the bonds can flow to areas of greatest demand. Secondary trading in global bonds is facilitated by the formal bridge between the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the US and the European clearing houses, Euroclear and Cedel. The Bank of Tokyo operates a book entry register for yen global bonds, and depositary and custodial links are established between Euroclear, Cedel and DTC to enable the transfer of those bonds against payment. 'The bonds can therefore be settled freely in each market,' says Mr Charles Berman, director in the capital markets group at Salomon Brothers in London.</p>

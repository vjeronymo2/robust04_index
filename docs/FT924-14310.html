			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Pirelli Tyre sheds 40% on plan to double equity BY the close of a turbulent week, most bourses had managed to recoup most of the losses suffered on Monday, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was surprised by Pirelli Tyre Holding's decision to double its share capital. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.7 at 107.8, a fall of 2 per cent on the week. Pirelli closed down Fl 8.40 or nearly 40 per cent at Fl 12.70, following news of its one-for-one rights issue, priced at Fl 10 per share and underwritten by its parent, Pirelli SpA. The company said that the capital was needed to fund its new restructuring programme, to help increase profitability and improve efficiency. Last month the group forecast further losses for 1992. Rumours that KNP, the paper producer, might hold a press conference on Monday at which it would announce a scaling back in 1992 forecasts saw the shares down Fl 2.70 or 6.3 per cent at Fl 39.80. Fokker, 90 cents lower at Fl 17.10, was again upset by reports, which it later denied, that Dasa was not going ahead with plans to take a majority stake. The rumours have been compounded by news earlier this week that Dasa is cutting staff, one analyst said. MILAN continued to advance, but dealers were divided about whether the market was still in a technical rebound or whether the long-awaited recovery had started. The Comit index rose 15.09 to 397.57, up 8.8 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's relatively heavy L195.6bn. Fiat gained 5.8 per cent or L224 to L4,074 while Stet recouped another L85 to L1,285 and Italcementi added L295 or 4.1 per cent to L32,500. But Pirelli fell L8 to L1,072 on news of its Dutch tyre unit's big capital increase. PARIS lost early gains as Wall Street opened lower. The CAC-40 index fell 16.52 to 1,657.34, down 1.5 per cent on the week, in moderate turnover of FFr1.9bn. A denial from Havas that it had any interest in buying shares in Hachette sent the latter's shares down by FFr22.70 or 14.3 per cent to FFr136 as speculators sold out. Havas lost FFr8.80 to FFr369.20. MADRID saw profit-taking ahead of the weekend. The general index rose 0.39 to 193.10, up 3.6 per cent on the week. Analysts said that September inflation data due on Tuesday may interrupt this week's rally. STOCKHOLM continued to be supported by lower domestic interest rates, as the central bank cut its key lending rate to 16.5 per cent from 18 per cent. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 14.9 to 668.0, but was 1.9 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of SKr354m after SKr387m. BRUSSELS closed mostly higher in spite of 5 per cent fall in Petrofina. The Bel-20 index rose 5.6 to 1,094.87, steady on the week. Petrofina tumbled BFr410 to BFr7,950, its lowest level this year, on news that Norway might order the closing of a North Sea oil field oil and gas processing tank in which Petrofina has a 30 per cent stake. ZURICH featured chemicals again after Roche's forecast of a 'considerable improvement' in 1992 group earnings on Thursday. The SMI index rose 8.1 to 1,878.4, a 0.5 per cent gain on the week. Roche certificates firmed SFr70 to SFr3,620 while its bearers added SFr110 to SFr5,500. COPENHAGEN's bank shares recovered as the result of rising bond prices, writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank rose DKr9 to DKr229 and Unidanmark A by DKr2 to DKr105. The all share index eased 0.25 to 255.10, down 4.3 per cent on the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Oct 9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     11.30am  12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     4 pm     close 989.22   990.64   989.73   991.22   991.05   985.90   986.91   987.08  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Day's High  991.83     Day's Low  985.01  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Oct 8    Oct 7    Oct 6    Oct 5    Oct 2           986.33   971.05   954.29   937.42   993.56  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

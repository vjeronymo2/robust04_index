			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 17 (CNS)--Chairman of the Financial  and Economic Committee of the NPC Mr Liu Suinian, delivering a  report reviewing the plan for last year's national economy and  social development and this year's draft plan at the meeting of  the Presidium of the 8th NPC today, said that the central bank  must be responsible for giving priority to stabilizing the value  of the renminbi and it would not be allowed to stimulate further  economic increases by merely issuing more money.    The committee put forward seven suggestions in light of the  recent report on planning work by Minister of the State Planning  Commission Mr Chen Jinghua. One of the main suggestions dealt  with attempts to control the size of credit and the supply of  money.    Mr Liu said that China had increased its credit at a high  speed in the past two years and had increased the issuing of  money into circulation. If the government did not make up its  mind to reduce the supply of money, a number of serious problems  would be created unfavourable to stable economic development.    The committee suggested that the banks should greatly  improve  their fund management and speed up capital flow, strictly  restricting and striving to reduce the size of credit.    It also suggested greatly strengthening macro-control,  restricting investment in fixed assets and overgrowth in demand  of consumer goods, developing the rural economy in an overall  way, particularly in the production of grain, cotton, vegetable  oils, meat, sugar and vegetables, strictly controlling prices  for everyday needs, services and agricultural production means  and cracking down firmly on criminal acts and misdemeanours  involving speculation and the raising of prices.    With regard to boosting economic results, Mr Liu said that  China's economic results on the whole remained low with 30  percent of state-owned enterprises running at a loss. Social  capital circulated slowly and the debt problem among enterprises  was becoming increasingly serious. China, therefore, had to  deepen reform and boost economic results while enterprises with  serious losses must be declared bankrupt.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / IG Chemie joins pay push IG CHEMIE, the German chemicals industry union, will make a pay claim of 'around' 4.2 per cent at negotiations for 1994 starting next month, according to Mr Hermann Rappe, union president. Mr Rappe, who represents 819,000 workers across German industry, said in a radio interview the union would resist calls for a pay freeze. His informal 'estimate' of a claim yet to be agreed by the union's board highlights the low morale among workers' representatives as they prepare for the new year's pay round. The chemicals industry employers have made no proposals, although they have been at pains to illustrate their lack of ability to pay. Their association recently said 30,000 jobs would go this year and more would follow in 1994. Pay had risen 15.5 per cent in the past three years while productivity had gone up only 6 per cent. Mr Rappe claimed 4.2 per cent would match the expected rate of inflation in western Germany next year, although all official and unofficial forecasters predict a rate of 3.5 per cent. His proposal followed Tuesday's recommendation from IG Metall, representing engineers and metal workers, for a rise of 'up to 6 per cent', which was immediately rejected by employers as 'poison'. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Kirchner, chief executive of Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, described the union's claim as 'incomprehensible, unrealistic and illusory'. He warned that Gesamtmetall and IG Metall, the two giants of the German wage bargaining process, were in danger of becoming extinct if they failed to find realistic solutions to the high-cost problems of the industry. 'If we follow the old pattern of negotiations, there will be a loss of confidence in the wage bargainers,' he said. 'We don't want to be one of the dinosaurs. I do not think IG Metall wants to be one either. 'What we need this year is a significant cost reduction. This combination of a six per cent wage demand, and a call for a moratorium on job cuts is simply impossible to understand.'</p>

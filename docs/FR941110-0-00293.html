			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solanum incompletum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was known from central and northeastern Lanai and from scattered locations on Maui (HHP 1992k1, 1992k2, 1992k4, 1992k10 to 1992k13; Symon 1990). According to David Symon (1990), the known distribution of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solanum incompletum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> also extends to the islands of Kauai and Molokai. On the island of Hawaii,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solanum incompletum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was known historically from the Kohala Mountains, Kona, Puu Waawaa, Puu Ikaaka Crater, and Omaokoili (HHP 1992k3, 1992k5, 1992k7 to 1992k9). The single remaining known population is from the island of Hawaii; it has not been seen for more than 40 years. This population is on State land at Puu Huluhulu and consists of perhaps two individuals at an approximate elevation of 2,040 m (6,700 ft) (HHP 1992k6). Associated species include naio,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acacia koa  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (koa), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sophora chrysophylla  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (mamane) in dry mesic forest, diverse mesic forest, and subalpine forest at elevations from 300 to 2,040 m (1,000 to 6,700 ft) (HHP 1992k1, 1992k6; Symon 1990; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). The primary threats to the last remaining individuals of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solanum incompletum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are stochastic extinction and reduced reproductive vigor due to the extremely small number of existing plants, and competition with the alien plant,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Senecio mikanioides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (German ivy).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (NCN) was first described by H. Wolff in 1921. In the past, this Hawaiian species had been confused with the European plants,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Apium echinatum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Caucalis daucoides  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Constance and Affolter 1990, Wolff 1921).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a member of the parsley family (Apiaceae), is a slender annual herb with few branches that grows to a height of 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in). Its leaves, dissected into narrow, lance-shaped divisions, are oblong to somewhat oval in outline and grow on stalks about 2.5 cm (1 in) long. Flowers are arranged in a loose, compound umbrella-shaped inflorescence arising from the stem, opposite the leaves. Each cluster consists of two to six flowers, with each flower on a stalk between 2 and 6 mm (0.08 and 0.2 in) long. The calyx is lacking in this species, but one to five bracts grow below the clusters of flowers. The fruits are oval and laterally compressed and constricted at the line where the two halves of the fruit meet. The fruits are 4 mm (0.2 in) long and 3 mm (0.1 in) wide, covered with curved bristles, and contain seeds that are marked with longitudinal grooves beneath oil tubes that are characteristic of the parsley family.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is the only member of the genus native to Hawaii. It is distinguished from other native members of the family by being a non-succulent annual with an umbrella-shaped inflorescence (Constance and Affolter 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was known from Waimea on Kauai, Koko Head on Oahu, Paomai and Kahinahina on Lanai, and Kipuka Kahali' on Hawaii (HHP 1992L3 to 1992L5, 1992L8, 1992L9; H. Huntzinger,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1993). Currently, six populations are known on Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, and West Maui; one additional population may exist on Hawaii. On Oahu, on State land at Diamond Head (land leased to the Department of Defense at the Diamond Head Reservation), 10 plants were observed in 1992 during the dry season. In 1988, when the site was first visited, thousands of plants were seen over an area less than 50 sq m (several hundred sq ft) (Wayne Takeuchi, DOFAW, pers. comm., 1992). The population fluctuations probably reflect seasonal changes in precipitation. On Molokai, about 600 plants were reported from Kamalo on private land within an area of less than 400 sq m (0.1 ac) (HHP 1992L6). On Lanai, 2 populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. hawaiiensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are known on private land: 1 at Kapoho with 100 individuals and 1 west of Puu Manu with 50 to 100 individuals covering an area of about 0.1 ha (0.25 ac) (HHP 1992L7; R. Hobdy, pers. comm., 1992). On West Maui, 3 populations are known on State land: 1 in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, with 60 to 100 individuals within an area of about 0.4 ha (1 ac); 1 further east in the Lihau section of the West Maui NAR, with several hundred plants scattered over a distance of 0.7 km (0.4 mi); and 1 above Lahainaluna School, with several hundred individuals spread over an area of about 0.4 ha (1 ac) (HHP 1992L1, 1992L2; HPCC 1991n). On the island of Hawaii, a collection of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Spermolepis hawaiiensis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> was made at an unspecified location in 1943; it is not known whether this population still exists (HHP 1992L9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

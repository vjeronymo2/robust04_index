			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (12): US businesses are leading the way - Virtual Private Networks EVEN in the age of the global corporation, human behaviour is slow to change: many people have a mental block about phoning their colleagues, just because they have to use an international dialling code. According to Robert Taylor, consulting manager in international communications at pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham, such reluctance to make international calls creates a geographic barrier. This can limit the progress of a company - 'if a company manufactures a product in one part of the world, and someone in another part of the world wants to use the same techniques, why not share that knowledge?' he says. Mr Taylor believes that a new-style phone service, known as a virtual private network or VPN, could go a long way to solving the problem. A virtual private network offers businesses a way to link the switchboards on different office sites, without having the expense of installing and running their own private network. In its most basic form, a VPN means that staff can use short code internal phone numbers to any of the sites which are connected. Those sites could even be in a different country. More sophisticated VPNs also permit the system to call back when an engaged number becomes free, or to display the number of the person calling. Such facilities won't be new to British or US companies which have had private telephone networks for several years. But in countries such as France and Germany, VPNs will be the first opportunity for many companies to obtain an advanced telephone capability. Barclays Bank was the first organisation to sign up for British Telecom's VPN service. John Grimmett, chief executive of Barclays Network Services, wants to use the VPN to expand the private network facilities to many of the bank's smaller branches where a private line is not viable. Mr Grimmett was also attracted by the flexibility of the VPN, which be dynamically re-configured to handle business changes within the bank. For example, the bank might operate a payment service out of six branches in the London area, but wants to concentrate the processing in just one of them. Customers, on the other hand, should not have to be told to re-dial if they call their branch with query. Using the VPN, calls can be transferred internally, and it appears to the customers that everything takes place in their branch. Another VPN convert is French chemical company, Rhone Poulenc. It took the decision on the basis of cost: for competitive reasons, most telephone companies are pricing their VPN services at a discount to both private and public network facilities. 'In France, the company did a full-cost analysis, looking at private networks compared with VPN, and was initially surprised at the savings,' said Peter Hewitt, telecom manager for the company's UK operations. The Rhone Poulenc vpn stretches across four countries and is one of the first to set up international links. It currently comprises BT's Featurenet in the UK, France Telecom's Colissee service, MCI's V-Net in the US, and KDD's Virnet in Japan. So far, 26 sites in France, 80 in the US, three in the UK, and four in Japan have been hooked up. Links between the VPNs in each country have been set up by the phone companies. This means that Rhone Poulenc obtains the same facilities on international calls as on national calls. Thus, French employees only have to dial a seven-digit number to reach colleagues in the UK. And if they fly to the US office, and want to call the same people, they dial the same seven digits. It's too early, however, to say how popular the facility will be: the UK sites have only been connected since December last year. However, monitoring of calling patterns in France has shown that employees are gradually getting into the habit of calling via the VPN, although the total number of calls has not increased. Mr Hewitt also believes that he will make significant savings on the annual telephone bill in the UK. He said that BT's VPN tariffs offer a 25 per discount on international calls, and almost half of the company's UK phone calls are to its own locations abroad. Although some phone companies do publish VPN tariffs, most international VPN contracts are individually negotiated. Susan Ablett, an analyst with specialist research company Analysys of Cambridge, believes that corporate customers are now in a position where they can use their financial muscle to obtain good deals on VPNs - 'we say to them to use their negotiating power. They are in a powerful position now to bring down prices, which they weren't two years' ago,' she says. However, Mr Taylor believes that the European phone companies could do more to make their VPN services attractive. SmithKline Beecham is an active user of VPN services in the US, and he is looking at possibilities for the Cable and Wireless-Sprint joint venture known as global virtual private network (GVPN). In his view, the US phone companies provide better support for customers. For example, their staff work full-time on the customer's premises. They also provide bigger discounts for high-volume corporate customers. He would like to see similar customer support and incentives offered on this side of the Atlantic. But the US market for VPNs is much more mature than in Europe, and was worth an estimated Dollars 2.5bn in 1992. It grew up rapidly in the late 1980s, when the three phone companies, MCI, Sprint and AT&amp;T waged a price-cutting war. Today, the market research company Yankee Group estimates that US customers can get discounts of up to 38 per cent can be obtained on five-year contracts. Further deals are offered to customers interested in calling card or free phone facilities - for example, sales reps are given a calling card and PIN number, so that they can call the office from anywhere, and the call travels via the VPN.</p>

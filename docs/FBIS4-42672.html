			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The World Today" column by Ali Sirmen: "An Important </F> Proposal"]    [Excerpts] The visit to Israel by a Turkish parliamentary  delegation, headed by Erdal Inonu, can contribute significantly  to developing relations between Israel and Turkey. In addition  to delegation members being who they are -- Erdal Inonu and  other members such as Mr. Ismet Sezgin -- the fact that meetings  will be held with Yitzhak Rabin warrants looking forward to  important results from this visit.    Undoubtedly the positive developments in Turkish-Israeli  relations are favorable to both countries.    The most important factor that effects relations developing  like this is that Israel is no longer the greatest element of  instability and obstacle to peace in the region. [passage  omitted]    Unfortunately, Israel no longer being a risk factor was not  sufficient to create a favorable and auspicious atmosphere in  the region, not where the future or Turkey's relations with  regional countries is concerned. Because, this time new threat  centers and points of conflict have emerged, and others will be  added in the future.    Countries under radical Arab administrations are posing a  big  threat for Turkey in the region. These countries try to export  their ideologies at each opportunity and spend great funds  toward this end. Inevitably Iran, though not an Arab country,  is included in this category.    On the other hand, we cannot ignore our southern neighbor  Syria's perpetual initiatives directed at creating instability  in our country. [passage omitted]    For this reason, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's  proposal [as published] envisaging Turkish-Israeli-Egyptian  cooperation and forming a common front against terrorism gains a  more important dimension.    It has to be pointed out immediately that Rabin's proposal  has to be carefully discussed, closely scrutinized, and  meticulously implemented. The reason being that fundamentalist  and ethnic terrorism is threatening the regimes of all these  three countries.    For years now, it has been Arab countries, wanting to export  their structure and expecting support from ethnic terrorism,  which have been a source of danger and terrorism for Turkey and  not Israel, which was once considered a threat.    In this situation, it is meaningless to bury our head in  sand  and be foolishly deceived by the intentional propaganda of the  supporters of religious laws. It is not Zionist ideology that  threatens Turkey but rather Arab ideology.    The situation being as it is, the reasons for considering  Rabin's proposal seriously are obvious.</p>

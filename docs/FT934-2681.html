			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Zimbabwe likely to win extra aid Donors attending a Zimbabwe aid meeting in Paris today are expected to respond sympathetically to the government's call for extra funds in 1994 to support its economic reform programme. Zimbabwe will ask donors at the meeting, to be chaired by the World Bank, for an extra Dollars 226m (Pounds 151.6m) to close its 1994 funding gap. This implies some Dollars 808m in new pledges, assuming that project aid is disbursed over five years and balance of payments assistance over 18 months. The programme, blown off-course by the drought in 1992, has progressed rapidly since April, when steps were taken to liberalise investment and exchange controls covering individuals. This season's rains have started well and GDP growth of at least 4 per cent is possible in 1995, though it will take until 1995 to return to 1991 output and export levels. Inflation, which peaked at almost 50 per cent in August, 1992 has halved to 24 per cent on a year-on-year basis and will average 28 per cent for 1993, against 42 per cent last year. Output has started to grow again, after a 7.7 per cent fall in real GDP in 1992, but there will be only marginal expansion this year. Donors are expected to question the World Bank's forecasting record, which as recently as June predicted 7 per cent growth, but now estimates a mere 1 per cent. The bank's forecast, in a paper prepared for the Paris meeting, of export growth (in US dollar terms) of more than 10 per cent annually for the next three years may be treated cautiously. Not only is this faster than growth rates forecast for world trade (5.8 per cent a year), but it is in sharp contrast to Zimbabwe's performance over the past five years, when exports have fallen almost 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Watchdog issues 150 hints on judging efficiency of councils MORE THAN 150 indicators for comparing the performance of local authorities were announced yesterday by the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog. The indicators, a key part of the Citizen's Charter, are intended to enable people to judge the relative efficiency and effectiveness of their local services. They cover the 40-odd services provided by local councils - everything from the quality of refuse collection and street cleaning to school meals; the speed at which police respond to emergencies; and the accessibility of public buildings to wheelchairs. The commission is inviting comments on the proposed indicators before the end of next month. It will issue a final version in December, and councils will be obliged to provide the information from the 1993-94 financial year. Mr David Cooksey, Audit Commission chairman, said: 'We want to produce a balanced set of indicators which will answer citizens' questions about what is going on at their local authorities but without being simplified to the point of nonsense.' The aim, he added, was to balance cost and quality. Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service, welcomed the indicators. 'The introduction of performance indicators into local government is at the heart of the Citizen's Charter commitment to giving the ordinary citizen more information about the operation of local government services,' he said. However, many of the indicators are straight comparisons of the quantity and/or regularity of provision, which could lead to demands for increases in both - and thus in local government spending. Ms Margaret Hodge, vice-chair of the Labour-run Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said the indicators were inadequate.

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Council tax liability I AM landlord of a dwelling let under an Assured Shorthold Tenancy, the first six months of which expires on February 9 1993. I intend to lextend the tenancy on an indefinite monthly basis. The tenant currently pays her Poll Tax. What action should I take to ensure she pays the new Council Tax from April onwards? Although a residential leaseholder is responsible for paying Council Tax, it might be argued that a lease or tenancy agreement such as the one you describe varies the incidence of that obligation (thus placing the ultimate burden of the Council Tax on you). To avoid such risk, do not use the present form of lease after February 9 1993, but require a new form to be used which obliges the landlord to pay the headlease ground rent (and any other outgoings attributable to your status as lessee under the head lease) but omits reference to rates and taxes in the landlord's covenants. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

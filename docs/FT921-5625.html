			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Saudi ruler faces up to change: A look at an historic development for the kingdom WHILE the physical infrastructures of the oil-rich monarchies of the Gulf have been transformed in the past three decades, their political institutions have been notably resistant to change, and nowhere more so than Saudi Arabia. The announcement on Sunday by King Fahd of several decrees, including the formation of a Consultative Council, therefore marks what is for the kingdom an historic development, even if for the western world it may appear to be little more than a cosmetic change. There is nothing new in the idea of a consultative council. King Fahd first mooted the proposal ten years ago on his accession to the throne. However its introduction has been spurred by the pressures on the kingdom caused by the Gulf war. The war accelerated trends already visible in the Saudi economy and in its political life. It is these that King Fahd is now seeking to answer. Saudi Arabia is still a wealthy country but much less so than it was. Gross domestic product last year was only two-thirds of the level in 1981. It has run a budget deficit for each of the past ten years, and in 1991 borrowed abroad for the first time. Although oil income increased sharply in 1991, as output topped 8m barrels a day to compensate for the drop in supplies from Kuwait, revenues are still well below the level of the early 1980s. With foreign currency reserves available to the government standing at less than Dollars 10bn, there is little room for economic manoeuvring. In other words, Saudi Arabia has acquired many of the characteristics of other world economies and will require more sophisticated management. However, there remains one substantial difference. The ruling family in Saudi Arabia feels obliged to provide virtually all public services free of charge. Modest attempts at finding alternative sources of revenue have failed to win public support and the government has recoiled from the risk of unpopularity. Some local economists argue that the nettle will have to be grasped before too long, especially if the defence establishment's appetite for more sophisticated weaponry is not curbed. A consultative council with the power to suggest new laws would obviously be a convenient vehicle through which potentially divisive measures could be introduced. The council also has the potential to answer wider political demands. Saudi Arabia's fast-growing population is being far better educated, and is frustrated by the incompetence, waste and sometimes corruption at official level. At the same time, the interests of the religious right, the natural political enemy of the liberals, have been broadened. Both challenged the ruling family in after the Kuwait invasion. The most obvious symbol of the liberal challenge came from 45 women who drove cars through the centre of Riyadh in defiance of the law. Taking advantage of such a large western presence in the kingdom, including hundreds of journalists, they hoped to shame the government in allowing greater freedoms. Not only did they fail in their attempt but they also stirred up the religious right who were furious at this attempt to undermine their own perceived authority on social issues. One of the main anxieties of the religious establishment has been that the consultative council would be the structure used by the liberals to gain political advantage. Faithful to his extremely cautious nature, King Fahd has delayed for at least six months the naming of the 60 members of the council, thus rendering impossible any attempt at assessing its political complexion. However it can be assumed that it will be an exercise in political balance. This same principle is also extended to the ruling families. In a further decree announced on Sunday King Fahd has to an extent formalised the method of nominating future monarchs The process will remain very much within the family, but it does appear to answer the criticisms of some members who feared they were being ignored. Political evolution in Saudi Arabia is under way but the pace of likely development can best be measured against the enormity of events required to get it started. Editorial comment, Page 22</p>

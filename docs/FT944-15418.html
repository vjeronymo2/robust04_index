			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Indonesia looking for Dollars 50bn Indonesia will need more than Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.3bn) in infrastructure investment over the next five years, President Suharto said at the opening of the world infrastructure forum Asia, which the Indonesian government is hosting this week. 'We hope most of this investment is borne by the private sectors, both domestic and foreign,' he said. According to a government report Indonesia needs the private sector to invest at least Dollars 18bn in infrastructure projects over the next five years. That investment will be channelled mainly into toll roads, container ports, airports, power plants, housing and water supplies. In June, the government unveiled a deregulation package for foreign investment which opened up most of these sectors to foreign capital.</p>

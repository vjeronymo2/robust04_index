			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Step Down Long Road"] </F>   [Text] Barring further obstacles Yitzhaq Rabin's  government may create at the eleventh hour to block the  agreement launching Palestinian self-rule, Cairo will today  witness the signing ceremony and the agreement will go into  effect immediately.    If we are skeptical about the signing, it is because as the  date approaches, Israel has been trying to blackmail the  Palestinian side into making further concessions. Israel may  even seek to renege on certain points it agreed to with the  Palestinians in the tough negotiations they have conducted over  the past weeks.    In any case, assuming things proceed as planned, today  should  be marked as a milestone in the history of the Palestinian  people, who have paid a heavy price to unblock the road to their  legitimate national rights and win their freedom and  independence.    Granted, this agreement falls short of the Palestinian  people's aspirations and inalienable rights. Notwithstanding  its inadequacies, the agreement could in the long run prove a  major step down a long road to freeing the land and getting rid  of occupation and rebuilding the Palestinian entity.    Hopefully, no last-minute obstacles raised by Israel will  block the signing ceremony. It is also hoped the agreement will  constitute a fresh stimulus for the Palestinian people's  struggle. The brother Palestinians owe it to themselves to make  the most of this significant accomplishment and go on to score  further successes so that, eventually, they attain their  freedom, advancement, and independence.</p>

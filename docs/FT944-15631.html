			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Lisbon looks for revenue rise Portugal's centre-right government yesterday presented to parliament a moderately restrictive budget for 1995 that allows room for a high level of European Union-financed investment in the approach to a general election next October. Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the budget deficit would be cut to 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product from an estimated 6.3 per cent this year. This would be achieved through increased revenue rather than by spending cuts, consolidating a downward trend after a large overrun in 1993. Overall revenue next year was forecast to grow by 7 per cent compared with 1994, to Es3,649.2bn (Pounds 14.7bn). The central value added tax rate would be raised from 16 to 17 per cent, but Mr Catroga said direct tax would not rise as a percentage of GDP. Public spending would rise 5.2 per cent, above forecast 1995 inflation of 3.5-4.5 per cent, to Es4,380.8bn.</p>

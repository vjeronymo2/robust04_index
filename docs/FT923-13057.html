			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Fondiaria chairman voted on to supervisory board of AMB AACHENER und Munchener Beteiligungs yesterday followed up the ending of hostilities with Assurances Generales de France (AGF) by tightening links with another foreign minority shareholder, Fondiaria of Italy. Shareholders at yesterday's annual meeting voted Mr Camillo de Benedetti, the chairman of the Italian insurance concern, on to AMB's supervisory board together with Mr Michel Albert, the head of AGF, with which the German company last week reached an accord after a battle over full voting rights. As expected, Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl is stepping down as AMB's chief executive after failing to keep the French company at bay. Yesterday's decisions show that AMB is now on much warmer terms with both AGF, which owns just over 25 per cent of its shares, and Fondiaria, which has 20 per cent. Recently, it had been speculated that Fondiara might sell its AMB holding. The French and German companies said last week they had reached agreement over the voting rights attached to AGF's stake. Previously, AMB had refused to recognise full voting rights on the holding, as it was able to do under German company law. Now AGF will be able to exercise these rights; in turn, it has dropped legal action against AMB on the issue and agreed to back the board at future annual meetings. Mr Helmut Gies, chairman of AMB's supervisory board, said Mr Baumgartl's contract had been dissolved by mutual consent. The settlement of this dispute also paves the way for Credit Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, to take a majority stake in BfG , the bank in which AMB bought control five years ago and which has since proved a financial drain. AMB will keep its co-operation agreements with Fondiaria and Royal Insurance of the UK. Mr Baumgartl will be replaced by Mr Wolfgang Kaske, 61, head of the group's subsidiary, AMB Volksfursorge in Hamburg. Mr Kaske, the brother of Mr Karlheinz Kaske, who steps down soon as chief executive of the Siemens concern, was previously on the AMB management board. Shareholders were also told yesterday by Mr Wilfried Boysen, the finance director, that AMB's results would at least match those of 1991, when net profits totalled DM74m (Dollars 46m).</p>

For purposes of this section, a list or [opinion]  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> written representation  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> shall be deemed to be current if it is based upon the status of the account as of a date not more than 18 months prior to the date of the transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Beneficial Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term beneficial interest means not only ownership interests, but every type of direct financial interest of any persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (4) hereof in such account [, including, without limitation, management fees based on the performance of the account]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, however, that no restricted person shall be deemed to have a beneficial interest in an account receiving a hot issue as a result of ownership of an interest in an investment partnership or corporation, or similar type account (``investment entity''), if the following conditions are met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The investment entity establishes a separate brokerage account, with a separate identification number, for its new-issue purchases. At the end of each fiscal year, the general partner, or similarly situated party, will certify in writing to its independent certified public accountants that: (a) all hot issues purchased by the investment entity were placed in this new-issue account; and (b) that the participants in the new-issue account are not restricted persons under this Interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Prior to the execution of the initial hot issue transaction, the investment entity's accountant or attorney will provide a written representation that complies with paragraph B of the section of this Interpretation entitled ``Investment Partnerships and Corporations.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. As part of its audit procedure for the investment entity, the indendent certified public accountant will confirm in writing to the investment entity that all allocations for the new-issue account were made in accordance with the provisions of the applicable investment entity agreement that restricts participation in hot issue purchases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The investment entity will maintain in its files copies of the certifications, representations, and confirmations referred to in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(3) above for at least three years following the last purchase of a hot issue for the new-issue account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The investment entity will accept investment funds from other investment entities only if such other accounts provide the same documentation and assurances described in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(4) above that restricted persons will not participate in the purchase of hot issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The certifications and documents required in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(3) above shall be provided to the member holding such account at such time as these certifications and documents are filed with the investment entity and its independent certified public accountant and, the member shall make such documentation available to the NASD upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Venture Capital Investors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> This Interpretation shall not prohibit the sale of hot issues in an initial public offering to a person restricted under the Interpretation or to an account in which such restricted person has a beneficial interest (a ``Venture Capital Investor'') if the following conditions are met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Venture Capital Investor has held an ownership interest in the company issuing the hot issue securities for a period of one year prior to the effective of the public offering; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The acquisition of the hot issue securities in the public offering does not increase the percentage equity ownership of the Venture Capital Investor in the company above that held three months prior to the filing of the registration statement in connection with the offering;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Venture Capital Investor received no special terms in connection with the purchase; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The securities purchased shall be restricted from sale or transfer for a period of three months following the conclusion of the offering. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Violations by Recipient <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In those cases where a member or person associated with a member has been the recipient of securities of a public offering to the extent that such violated the Interpretation, the member or person associated with a member shall be deemed to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation as well as the member who sold the securities since their responsibility in relation to the public distribution is equally as great at that of the member selling them. In those cases where a member or a person associated with a member has caused, directly or indirectly, the distribution of securities to a person falling within the restrictive provisions of this Interpretation the member or person associated with a member shall also be deemed to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation. Receipt by a member or a person associated with a member of securities of a hot issue which is being distributed by an issuer itself without the assistance of an underwriter and/or selling group is also intended to be subject to the provisions of this Interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Violations by Registered Representative Executing Transaction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The obligation which members have to make a bona fide public distribution at the public offering price of securities of a hot issue is also an obligation of every person associated with a member who causes a transaction to be executed. Therefore, where sale are made by such persons in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Interpretation, such persons associated with a member will be considered equally culpable with the member for the violations found taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the particular case under consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Disclosure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The fact that a disclosure is made in the prospectus or offering circular that a sale of securities would be made in a manner inconsistent with this Interpretation does not take the matter out of its scope. In sum, therefore, disclosure does not affect the proscriptions of this Interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> Explanation of terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The following explanation of terms is provided for the assistance of members.

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Scandinavian markets confound the forecasters - The state of the Nordic economies has not been reflected in share prices this year THE PERFORMANCE of the Nordic region so far this year illustrates how stock markets can prove to be unreliable indicators of a country's economic health, and that short-term market forecasts are prone to error. Back in January, stock exchange watchers believed that Oslo and Copenhagen were set to do well early in 1991, while Stockholm and Helsinki would take longer to recover from their setbacks last year. The opposite has proved to be the case. This year, according to the FT-Actuaries World Indices, Stockholm has enjoyed one of the most impressive rallies anywhere, with its 23 per cent rise in local currency terms beaten only by Madrid in Europe, while Helsinki has been not far behind with 20 per cent growth. By contrast, Oslo languishes at the bottom of the FT-A index for Europe with only a 5 per cent increase so far this year, while Copenhagen, at 14.5 per cent, is below the European average of 16.4 per cent. Swedish analysts have been hard pressed to explain what has spurred Stockholm on, after it suffered the biggest fall in share values in its history in 1990. In the first quarter of this year, the bourse was the world's best performer in local currency terms and the second best after Hong Kong in US dollars. It was not just the persistently gloomy macroeconomic indicators this year that made the upsurge hard to decipher, but also the steady stream of pessimistic annual results from most of Sweden's listed blue-chip companies, particularly Volvo, Saab-Scania, Electrolux and SKF. Combined profits of Sweden's 500 largest companies, adjusted for inflation, fell 20 per cent last year. Some of the shine has been taken off Stockholm in the past fortnight but, as the business magazine Affarsvarlden argued last week, 'the stock market does not seem to know which way to turn, so it goes both ways'. The magazine could find no obvious explanation for the first quarter boom, coming up with the view: 'Possibly, investors wanted to simply forget 1991 and start banking on a strong recovery in 1992.' There has been a growing interest among foreign investors in Swedish shares this year, in particular for Astra, the pharmaceutical company, and the engineering groups Atlas Copco and Asea. Today foreigners own around SKr40bn (Dollars 6.5bn) worth of Swedish shares, 6 per cent of the total market capitalisation. This positive attitude reflects confidence outside Sweden that the country is heading in a sensible economic direction. The government's decision to seek membership of the European Community, a tight financial policy that shows no signs of relaxation in spite of a general election in September, and a fall in interest rates appear to have convinced international opinion that Sweden has a strong future. Helsinki, like Stockholm, had a terrible year in 1990. It was the world's second worst performer after Tokyo, with a 34.8 per cent fall in the Unitas index. But in February it began to recover at a dramatic rate. In the view of Kleinwort Benson Securities, 'bored by bad news and full of cash, investors on the Helsinki bourse decided to stop worrying about 1991 and to love 1992, or even 1993'. The uncertainties over the Finnish economy, which is in its worst recession since the mid-1970s, coupled with last week's arrival of a new Centre-Conservative coalition government, must put a question mark over Helsinki's ability to improve further. Investors seem to have been reassured, however, that the currency is not about to be devalued, contrary to earlier fears. The stock market recovery has been led by international investors, while their domestic counterparts have been cautious about following suit. This week's announcement by the Swedish companies, Volvo and Aga, that they are cancelling their Helsinki listings because of the high fees - said to be the highest in the world - is bound to cause concern. The fees were increased at the start of 1991 to compensate for low trading volumes. While analysts remain sceptical about the extent of the recoveries in Stockholm and Helsinki, they remain convinced that there will be improvements on the other Nordic stock markets. Copenhagen has not done as well as might have been expected. The Danish economy is in better shape than the other Nordic countries, with the lowest inflation rate in Europe and improving trade and current account surpluses. However, this has not impressed the bourse. The bond market has been much more favourable, producing an average real yield of 6 per cent. With a cut in corporate tax rates to 38 per cent this year and average wage costs only rising by 3.5 per cent, it is hard to understand why the equity market has been so lacklustre. 'Copenhagen is a very defensive market,' explains Ms Birgitte Kjolhede at Kleinwort Benson Securities. 'There is a lack of interest in most medium-sized companies at the moment.' Oslo is also disappointing. The Norwegian economy has been improving, with a strong currency, low inflation helped by a modest wage round, and a solid current account. But once again this has not done much to cheer up the stock market, where trading volume has been sluggish. Shipping shares staged a comeback, with a 15.5 per cent improvement in January and February, but there is still a long way to go to recover the levels of early 1990. The banks have also been strong, in spite of their financial troubles, thanks to the government's new risk capital fund and the liberalising of the capital requirement rules. But the recently announced corporate tax reforms have unsettled the market, while Norsk Hydro, accounting for 30 per cent of the bourse, saw a fall in profits for the first quarter of 1991, which has also caused some concern. It is possible that the early prognoses for 1991 will be more accurate for the rest of the year. There is still time for Stockholm and Helsinki to sink again, and for Oslo and Copenhagen to advance, although it is doubtful whether the explanations offered at that time will be any more convincing.</p>

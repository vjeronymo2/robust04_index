			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Europeans, Japan seek larger IADB shareholding JAPAN and European governments have begun efforts to enlarge their shareholding in the Inter-American Development Bank. Japan's contribution to the bank's operations justified a bigger shareholding, according to a Japanese Finance Ministry official. Japan has also been seeking to have Japanese personnel play a bigger role in the bank. Some European officials, including one from Germany, have also been seeking a larger shareholding. Member governments from outside the Americas currently hold only 7.2 per cent of the capital, and some would like to see this doubled. As informal discussions start about a new capital increase for the bank, German officials said they favoured an increase. However, a smaller increase than the Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23.2bn) proposed by some Latin governments would be sufficient for the bank to maintain its real lending levels, they said. The bank was dealt a blow ahead of its annual meeting by the refusal of the US Congress last Thursday to fund new foreign aid programmes. But Mr Enrique Iglesias, the IADB president, said he remained hopeful that such finance would eventually be forthcoming. Included in the bill was the initial US contribution for the Dollars 1.5bn Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), and relief on debt owed by several Latin American states to the US government. Both formed part of President George Bush's Enterprise for the Americas initiative. The IADB would administer the fund, for which Dollars 1.2bn had been committed. Japan has agreed to match the US proposed contribution of Dollars 500m, but is believed unlikely to provide support in the absence of US funding. Mr Iglesias said his optimism was based on the continued support of the US administration for the initiative.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> I'm an urban education specialist and have published extensively in the field.  I also train urban school teachers. Acuna's article is yet another example of a  single-issue educator perpetuating his vested interest. I agree that schools  fail Latinos in any tongue. Schools generally fail most students.  </P> <P> Forget the fact that more blacks drop out of school than Latinos; forget the  fact that bilingual students drop out at the same or higher rates than most  students; forget the fact that bilingual education reinforces segregation in  public schools; or forget the fact that numerous reports show that bilingual  education just doesn't work for many. Coping with our dismal public school  system cannot be easily translated into one self-serving issue, bilingual  education.  </P> <P> Lack of motivation to complete one's education is not exclusively an issue for  bilingual education, as some would have us believe. Lack of motivation,  pervasive in all urban public education, is not the restrictive property of the  bilingual education lobby who wishes to sell the fashionable one-issue  standards. The failure of public schooling to meet the needs of the many is far  more complex than offering simplistic solutions for complex problems.  </P> <P> ALFRED LIGHTFOOT  </P> <P> Professor of Education  </P> <P> Loyola Marymount University  </P></p>

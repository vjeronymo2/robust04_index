			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Parkway shares went to Clegg relatives SIX RELATIVES of Mr John Clegg, the former chief executive of Wace Group, and three people believed to be connected with them, bought 2.6m shares in Parkway Group in the months before Wace bid for Parkway, the share register obtained by the Financial Times reveals. The share price of Parkway, which was Wace's main rival in the printing services industry, had ranged from 26p in May 1990 to a low of 14p at the end of July. It doubled on August 1 when Wace bid 28p cash per share. Mr Clegg resigned suddenly as Wace's chief executive three weeks ago following allegations that the company had links with the IRA. Both Mr Clegg and the company denied the allegations, and investigations by several security forces found no evidence. During those investigations last year, the insider dealing unit of the London Stock Exchange looked into share dealing in Parkway but found no evidence of misconduct. In recent weeks Wace's own internal inquiry has uncovered 'potentially unlawful dealings' in Parkway shares. This is understood to refer to 'significant' new evidence which has been passed to the Department of Trade and Industry. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Wace's stockbroker, was aware only of the purchase of 75,000 shares when it was handling the acquisition but that discovery aroused 'consternation', according to one observer of the takeover. However, BZW completed the transaction after written assurances from Mr Clegg that he was unaware of the investments in the names of James, Christopher and David Clegg. Although they were his cousins, he said he had not contacted them for years. Wace and BZW were unaware then that Mrs Jayne Riley, whom Mr Clegg has described as the cousin whose financial backing allowed him to buy into Wace in 1983, had acquired 400,000 Parkway shares registered on July 12. She subsequently has proved to be his half-sister. Of those, 200,000 were registered in the care of the Anglo- Irish Bank of Dublin. Mr Clegg, who was a director of AIB, resigned three weeks ago when he left the Wace board. Other shares owned by Mrs Riley were registered at an address in London NW2 shared by a Miss McHale, the owner of 800,000 shares at the time of the bid. That has led to inquiries about a second address in London NW4 used to register the purchase of more than half a million shares in the name of Mrs McHale and 600,000 shares in the name of a Mrs Johnston. Because BZW used the Parkway share register of July 26 1990 it was unaware too of the purchase of a further 47,000 shares in Clegg names - James, Vivienne and Christopher - registered on August 13. The register, which takes between two and five weeks to incorporate dealings, listed the three at the same address in Sheffield, Mr John Clegg's home town. The later list also shows a holding of 250,000 shares in the name of Mr Keith Riley, Mrs Riley's husband, registered on August 28.</p>

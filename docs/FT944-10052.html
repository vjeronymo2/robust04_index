			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods launches last ditch defence to BFI bid Attwoods, the UK waste services company, yesterday put itself on the block in a last ditch attempt to fend off the hostile Pounds 364m cash bid from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US. In a style of bid defence more familiar in the US than the UK, Attwoods pledged to sell its British and mainland European operations if shareholders rejected the BFI bid. It would then seek a buyer or potential merger partner for the US assets. The disposals were expected to be completed by the middle of 1995. Attwoods said yesterday these actions would realise more value for shareholders than the 109p a share on offer from BFI. Investors would receive a cash payment when the UK and European businesses were sold, which could range from 24p to 46p a share. This was based on estimates of net disposal proceeds of between Pounds 69m and Pounds 129m, after paying Pounds 81m in debt and preference shares. They would then have the option of cash or shares in the new vehicle to be created through the sale or merger of the US businesses. Attwoods said it was in discussions with several potential unidentified purchasers. Speculation centred on Waste Management International, the UK quoted arm of WMX of the US, as a possible buyer in the UK. In the US, Attwoods is expected to explore merger opportunities with middle-ranking waste companies, such as Sanifill and United Waste. Although Attwoods was confident that appropriate sale proceeds would be achieved, it said it could not make a formal estimate while the bid continued. Attwoods also said it would not make the disposals if it could not 'achieve proper value for shareholders'. BFI attacked this caveat as the 'clearest indication' that shareholders should accept the bid. 'When the bid pressure goes away, they will not do it,' said an adviser. BFI is expected to indicate by the middle of next week whether or not it will revise its offer. Last night the company was adamant that 109p was a 'full and fair price'. Investors are less convinced, however. They are thought to be pressing for concessions in the structure of the bid - such as an equity sweetener - in the price, or in the amount BFI has promised to return to investors with the sale of Attwoods' German operations. 'We do not think this current bid is acceptable,' said one shareholder. Attwoods shares closed 1p up at 115p. See Lex and Weekend Money</p>

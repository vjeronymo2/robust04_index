			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Konstantin Borodin: "Vitaliy Masol -- New-Old Premier of </F> Ukraine"]    [Text] Vitaliy Masol has been elected the premier of  Ukraine. 199 MP's voted for his candidature. 24 were against.  Such result was a surprise for 78 MP's who abstained (27  members of Rukh faction, 27 MP's from the group "Reforms", 26  members of faction "Statehood").    One day before the voting, those MP's were quite optimistic  since the faction "Unity" (26 MP's) and faction "Center" were  against elections of the premier. Les Tanyuk, MP representing  Rukh, predicted that only 140 MP's, representing communists,  socialists and agrarians, would vote for Masol. Leader of the  democratic party V. Yavorivskyy stated that at least half of the  faction "Center" would be against the candidature of Mr. Masol.  Quite unexpectedly, there was a split among the left-wingers --  parliamentarians from Donetsk region tended to back the  candidature of Lazarenko.    However, Speaker Moroz proposed to postpone the election  till  next day. It is hard to say what kind of changes occurred  within one night but, be that as it may, the left-wingers formed  common opinion and pursued quite a few MP's from factions  "Unity" and "Center" to vote for Masol. Thus, V. Masol, former  head of the state planning committee and the premier of Ukraine  in 1987-1990 again was elected to this high post.    Almost 4 years ago, the students went on hunger strike and  made him resign on the 17th day of that strike. In October of  1990, this man was a symbol of a rotten communist system.  However, the authorities did not fulfill other demands of  students. Rumors have it that in the last 4 years Mr. Masol  headed a company having a lot of offices abroad. His son is  manager of "Rostok" company producing kitchen equipment. The  company is profitable and popular among consumers.    Ex-Premier Y. Zvyagilskyy said that he had voted for Masol  because the latter is good specialist and businessman who would  stick to the policy of economic stabilization. Speaker Moroz  told our correspondent that the Cabinet would undergo  considerable changes. Says Mr. Moroz: "Nobody should complain  that Mr. Masol is procommunist. First and foremost, he is a  professional". According to leader of communists V.Symonenko,  Masol meets the interests of not only the party of communists  but the people of Ukraine as a whole.    One communist parliamentarian told that there had been  heated  debates among communists concerning Masol's candidature. He  says that the fact that communists backed him was the compromise  with centrists. Many communists did not like his address to the  parliament in which he underscored his adherence to market  reforms. Says famous economist V. Pylypchuk, member of faction  "Reforms": Having heard his program, I understood that Mr. Masol  had changed much. His program is 90 percent similar to mine.  The main thing is that he should keep his promises".    Mr. Pylypchuk stressed the difference between economic  programs of Masol and Speaker Moroz. The latter, however,  stated prior to elections that the parliament and government  would act in unison if Masol was elected the premier of Ukraine.  According to Mr. Pylypchuk, it is good that left-wingers  supported Masol since now they have no arguments in accusing the  democrats of opposition. His opinion is shared by his  colleagues from Rukh and "Reforms" factions. None of them is  going to work in the Cabinet.    O. Yemets, the minister for the matters of nationalities in  Zvyagilskyy's Cabinet, resigned on the next day after Masol was  elected the premier. He believes that the government will be  procommunist one and rejects any idea of formation of coalition  cabinet. It seems that new premier likes such state of affairs.  In particular, he states that his Cabinet would consist of  professionals having no political sentiments. It was President  Kravchuk who nominated Masol to the premier's post. This was  done after parliamentary commissions considered the list of  candidates including Y.Zvyagilskyy, leader of liberals I.  Merkulov, former Vice Premier V.Symonenko, representative of  Dnipropetrovsk nomenklatura V.Lazarenko, plant director V.  Melnyk and V. Masol.    O. Zayets, secretary of Rukh faction, thinks that Masol's  candidature was the best of them all but believes that the  Premier had to be elected from "new people". Thus the victory  of left-wingers at parliamentary elections was supported by  appointing of the most odious person (for their opponents) to  the premier's post. It seems improbable that the coalition  government will be formed since democrats reject any idea to  work in the cabinet. Still, Mr. Masol may cooperate with  Pynzenyk and Lanovyy to partially implement their programs. It  is worth underscoring that the victory of left-wingers can  neutralize separatist sentiments in southern and eastern regions  of Ukraine.</p>

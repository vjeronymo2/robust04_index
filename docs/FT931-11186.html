			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / New devices ruffle TV plan THE European strategy for developing wide-screen cinema-quality television risks being overtaken by different technologies and may have to be revised, according to EC commissioner Mr Martin Bangemann. The EC's industry commissioner, who now has responsibility for telecommunications, said the objective of European high-definition television (HDTV) would not be abandoned, and the Commission would not renounce its five-year Ecu500m (Pounds 406m) 'action plan' to develop HDTV. 'We can't reinvent the world every day,' he said. The original objectives of the action plan have been thrown into doubt in recent months by British opposition to the strategy. The UK believes the cost of the plan is not justified and that the full HDTV standard backed by the Commission - known as HD-Mac - could soon be overtaken by digital norms, which can be used for terrestrial as well as satellite broadcasts. Mr Bangemann said: 'At this stage we don't see any signs of the UK showing more flexibility.' In those circumstances, the Commission might have to revise its strategy, taking into account that digital technology could become a feasible alternative to HD-Mac within three to four years. He suggested a revised action plan might concentrate funds on the development of wide-screen television equipment, 'flat' television sets with liquid crystal displays, and the production and conversion of programmes which could be broadcast in the wide format. There seems to be a growing realisation even among supporters of the HD-Mac strategy that further delay will undermine the Commission's original objectives. This week, Philips, the Dutch equipment manufacturer, said it would not move to production of HD-Mac television sets unless funding became available for programmes in the same standard. Mr Bangemann stressed that he had not yet discussed his ideas with industry and member states. If he attempts to change the strategy too radically he will face fierce opposition from the Netherlands and France. They are solidly behind their manufacturers, Philips and Thomson, both of which have invested heavily in HD-Mac technology.</p>

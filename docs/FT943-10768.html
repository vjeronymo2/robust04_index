			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: National Westminster There are two ways of looking at National Westminster's 14 per cent dividend increase. One is that it is an attempt to offset last year's relative stinginess, which was badly received by the market. The other that it is a genuine signal of confidence in improving profits. Both have a ring of plausibility. Although the bank's trading surplus fell 9 per cent during the first half, provisions are lower than the market expected and there are some outstanding bright spots, notably in the Lombard finance division and in the US where loan demand is growing and margins are widening. Whether this is sufficient evidence that the bank has really turned the corner is another matter. Although there is room for provisions to fall further, there must be questions over the pace. The 42 per cent drop in the first half - which happily helped finance the dividend rise and leaves tier one capital at exactly 6 per cent - is much larger than the fall in loans on which interest is not being accrued. As for the weak trading surplus, it is too easy simply to blame this on weak UK loan demand which is affecting all banks. Yesterday's figures leave room for doubt about NatWest's grip on costs. This is not only true of UK retail banking where trading profits fell by 5 per cent and the bank itself admits that further cost cutting is needed. Despite a commendable increase in dealing profits, the trading surplus at NatWest Markets actually fell by 22 per cent in the first half. Presumably NatWest is happy to let costs rise as the business grows. But it urgently needs to show that its investment can earn a decent return.</p>

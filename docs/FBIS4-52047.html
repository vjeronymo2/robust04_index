			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- About 90 percent of food  service firms surveyed serve foreign rice to customers,  according to a private survey published Friday [6 May].    The survey, compiled by the Japan Food Service Association,  showed that 167, or 91.3 percent, of the 183 firms polled said  they use foreign rice.    Of the 167 companies, about 50 percent said foreign rice  accounts for more than half of the rice they serve.    Around 80 percent of them also said they do something to  improve the taste, like adding additives.    The poll, conducted in mid-April, also found that U.S.-grown  rice is the most frequently used, followed by grains from  Thailand, China, and Australia.    Asked about how foreign rice is received by customers, 41.4  percent reported little reactions, while 37.2 percent noted  mostly favorable reactions. Another 5.5 percent replied foreign  rice is only poorly received.</p>

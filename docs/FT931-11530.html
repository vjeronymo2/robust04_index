			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Bankers' secrets CUSTOMERS OF Britain's high street banks have the right to restrict how widely details of their accounts are circulated within their bank. Barclays Bank has devised a way around this for new customers by requiring those who buy products such as its credit cards to allow any of the bank's subsidiaries to use information about them on its database. This tactic, and other efforts by banks to get customers to give permission for the use of financial data, is intended to help banks sell more financial products to their existing customers. Barclays has a strong motive to raise its income from products such as personal loans and credit cards because it may next month declare a pre-tax loss for last year. The banks are thus trying to minimise the effect of a provision in their code of practice for personal customers which says that customers must give their consent for banks to publish details of their accounts to third parties - even when those third parties are subsidiaries of the bank. In effect, Barclays is forcing new customers to give such consent. The office of the data protection registrar, who is responsible for ensuring that companies adhere to the Data Protection Act, is naturally concerned about this. It thinks that Barclays and other banks which might follow are evading their own code of practice. It also believes they may be breaching the act by not obtaining and handling data fairly. British banks are currently facing a wave of criticism over everything from their small business lending policies to charges for overdrafts. In reply, they rightly point out that they are businesses not public utilities, and they must make a profit. This means raising charges, since much of their lending in the late 1980s turned out to be loss-making. This argument does not apply to the methods being used to obtain permission from customers to use data. The banks only agreed their code of practice last March. But its provision on confidentiality would be weakened if all banks emulated Barclays. This is hardly the signal to send to those who call for statutory regulation. The banks are themselves concerned about data security, and have started an industry-wide review after the shock of seeing details of Mr Norman Lamont's credit card bill in The Sun newspaper last December. Their worry is that employees may take information from their databases, and disclose it to outsiders. The banks say they recognise the need to improve data security, but their customers' faith in these efforts is hardly enhanced by their response so far to the data protection office's anxieties. It is in the banks' own interest to ensure that the right of confidentiality afforded under the banking code of practice is honoured in the spirit and the letter.</p>

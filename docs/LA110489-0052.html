			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SENATE OKS SPECIAL MT. RUSHMORE COINS  </P> <P> The Senate voted on Friday to issue gold and silver coins to mark the 50th  anniversary in 1991 of the presidential memorial at Mt. Rushmore in South  Dakota's Black Hills.  </P> <P> The legislation, which now goes to the House, calls for the minting of 500,000  gold coins bearing a face value of $5 and 2.5 million silver $1 coins. Both  would be sold at a premium, with half of the profits being used to reduce the  federal budget deficit and half to go to improve, enlarge and renovate the  monument and its facilities and grounds.  </P> <P> An additional 2.5 million half-dollar Mt. Rushmore coins would be struck as  legal tender.  </P></p>

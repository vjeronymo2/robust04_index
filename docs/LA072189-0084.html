			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> TELEPHONE FIRMS RING UP MIXED PROFITS IN QUARTER  </P> <P> Fueled by continued strong growth in its long-distance telephone business,  AT&amp;T's profits rose 17.7% in the second quarter, the company reported  Thursday.  </P> <P> Earnings results were mixed, however, among the trio of so-called Baby Bell  local phone companies that also reported financial results. San Francisco-based  Pacific Telesis, parent of Pacific Bell, said its profits rose a scant 1.2%  mainly because of vigorous growth in its cellular phone business. Meanwhile,  Southwestern Bell in St. Louis said its earnings rose 22.8% while profits  dropped 13.6% at Nynex in White Plains, N.Y.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T  </P> <P> For American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which had written off old equipment and  taken a $1.67-billion loss last year, the news was all good. "By and large they  were excellent results," said Charles Nichols, an analyst with Bear, Stearns  &amp; Co. "They're making progress on the revenue side at the same time they're  improving (profit) margins."  </P> <P> For the quarter ended June 30, net income was $699 million despite a  $96-million charge due to depreciation changes and the declining value of old  telecommunications gear. Revenue increased 5.2% to $9.26 billion, with  long-distance revenue growing 7%.  </P> <P> Chairman Robert E. Allen attributed the showing to AT&amp;T's having made  "definite progress toward our objective of achieving business growth in tandem  with expense control."  </P> <P> Allen credited, among other things, the company's expanded sales force. Last  year, 2,000 staff employees were shifted to sales, and another 3,000 workers  will still be redeployed.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said product sales increased 4%, largely due to improved sales of  telecommunications abroad, including a first-ever, $154-million contract to  provide optical communications gear to Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp;  Telephone.  </P> <P> "It's a good fundamental quarter," said Gregory Sawers of Sanford C. Bernstein  &amp; Co. "I read it that they're stabilizing market share. They're still  growing less than the industry level, but they're improving."  </P> <P> AT&amp;T's biggest rivals in the long-distance business -- MCI Communications  and U S Sprint -- earlier this week reported that their results improved  sharply.  </P> <P> Pacific Telesis  </P> <P> For Pacific Telesis, net quarterly income rose 1.2% to $325 million on revenue  of $2.41 billion, up 1.7%. Chief Executive Sam Ginn attributed Pacific Telesis'  modest gain to "the improving performance of our cellular business," where  sales increased by 51.3% to $111.5 million and profits more than tripled to  $13.5 million.  </P> <P> Results were flat, however, in the company's local phone business in California  and Nevada.  </P> <P> In the stock market Thursday, AT&amp;T shares closed at $57.25, up 25 cents;  Pacific Telesis finished at $43, off 87.5 cents; Southwestern Bell dropped  $1.125 to $53.625, and Nynex fell $1.375 to $78.25.  </P></p>

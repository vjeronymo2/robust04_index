			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yegor Gaydar, director of the Institute for </F> Economic Problems of the Transition Period, as reported by  Yelena Vishnevskaya: "Will a Crash Delay the President's Sweep?"]    [Text] Being discussed in business circles are the  possible consequences of the measures pouring out of the package  of presidential edicts and governmental decrees. There are still  a few documents pending. But what will be the effect of the  already signed edicts? There have been quite a few skeptical and  even deprecatory comments among opinions about the already  promulgated edicts. But here is the opinion of the director of  the Institute for Economic Problems of the Transition Period,  Yegor Gaydar.    On the whole, they can only be welcomed. The decisions  contained in them were discussed for a long time within the  government and were the subject of fierce debate and opposition.  Among the most serious decisions involving direct action, for  which there are no legal obstacles in the way of their  implementation, is the document on the liberalization of foreign  economic activities and the abolition of quota-setting and  licensing. This is a quite revolutionary decision. In my  opinion, it had already become immanent at the end of 1993 and  could have been implemented as of the beginning of this year.    Last fall, with enormous difficulty, we implemented the  decision to reduce substantially the volumes of quota-restricted  and licensed commodities. To be honest, I will not believe in  this decision until I see it implemented in practice: I know  only too well what serious groups of interests the abolition of  quota-setting and licensing touches and what substantial  opportunities for the mobilization of illegal revenues are  associated in our country, just as in any country carrying out  such a large-scale program, with these changed standard acts.    A substantial factor which prompted at this time the  adoption  of so radical a decision is the extreme impudence of many  exporting sectors in the use of the breaks and privileges on  export tariffs, which was displayed at the beginning of 1994.  This matter has traditionally been the subject of  haggling--export tariffs or centralized deliveries of fuel and  energy resources? Over the course of all of 1993 there was  constant discussion about what portion of the exportable gas or  oil should go for the federal budget's needs.    The general plan was something like this: Around half of the  exportable resources would be used for the budget's needs and  then the other half would be exempt from the export tariffs. In  1994 a paradoxical situation arose when the producers were  exempted from the export tariffs and they considered it  absolutely unnecessary to deliver products for budget  requirements. As a result, the budget's revenues from foreign  economic activities, toward an increase in which, to a large  extent, the draft of the 1994 budget had been oriented,  decreased sharply in the first half of the year. Then the urgent  need arose to simplify all foreign economic activities and to  abolish not only quotas and licenses, but also the export tariff  breaks. If the decision is actually carried out, this will lead  to an increase in export receipts.    The main obstacle in the way of the abolition of the quotas,  let us say in the area of oil marketing, has traditionally been  associated with actual transportation limitations on the volume  of our exporting--the capacities of the pipelines and the major  exporting ports. Actually, we are currently exporting  approximately as much oil as our transportation can carry out of  the country. I am convinced that this situation will continue in  the near future--it is not a matter of quotas, rather of  transportation. Although, of course, the abolition of the quotas  and licenses, in principle, expands the opportunities for  transportation enterprises to make the most of their own  monopoly position.    But, all the same, there are advantages to having this kind  of economic regulation in comparison with the administrative  type. If, over the course of a certain amount of time, you have  transportation capacities which act as actual limitations,  sooner or later you will build a new oil-tanker seaport. But if  you have administrative quotas and licenses, then the result  will exclusively be an additional number of Mercedes. From this  point of view, I think that this kind of decision will be  beneficial to the long-term dynamics of Russia's foreign trade  and the development of its fuel sector. If, of course, we  actually manage to put it into practice.    There are also other decisions which are correct and long  immanent, for example, consolidation of the highway fund into  the budget. I would call the sharp tightening up of tax control  one of the other especially significant ones. It is a very  useful and outstanding decision! But it has one shortcoming:  Unfortunately, it does not have any legal force. Until the  appropriate law is adopted by the Duma and then by the Federal  Assembly, not a single court will implement it. Unfortunately, I  know this quite well from experience.    The same thing may be said about the decision to grant large  breaks to joint production ventures, which contribute more than  $10 million. This decision is contradictory and ambiguous in its  consequences. But it cannot be implemented on the basis of  presidential edicts within the framework of the existing  constitution. This is more a declaration of intentions, which  may have practical consequences in the event that it is backed  up by appropriate legislation. Otherwise, this decision  contradicts a whole set of laws.    As for the changes in the tax legislation, these are  sensible  proposals for reducing somewhat the rates for the profits tax,  the value-added tax, and the deductions for social insurance  while increasing the property taxes.    But, the personal income taxes as a second source, it seems  to me, have been selected unsuccessfully. I absolutely do not  believe in the feasibility and advisability of the upper rate  for the income tax. I am convinced that, under the conditions of  our lack of tradition of tax discipline, this decision will more  likely lead to a decrease, rather than an increase, in actual  tax receipts. I would more likely name as an obvious target an  increase in the rates of the land tax as a perfectly natural  direction for making up "falling" revenues.    The document on reforming state enterprises has been in  preparation for a long time. It makes it possible to take one  more step to eliminate the completely irregular situation when  the directors of the state enterprises, within the framework of  the concept introduced by us back at the end of the eighties of  full economic management, received rights I usually compare with  the rights of regimental commanders--to declare war, to conclude  peace, and to sell off their regimental property with such  obvious serious consequences for the national economy. Now it is  possible to strengthen control over the state enterprises' work  and to create incentives for their more or less normal behavior.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Japan trade surplus 'may be peaking' Japan's current account surplus, the source of friction in relations with the US, could be peaking, according to the Ministry of Finance. The surplus fell 16.1 per cent during March in both dollar terms compared with the same month last year. In addition, both the current account and trade surpluses declined in yen terms during the 1993 financial year, the first drop in three years, according to figures published by the ministry yesterday. 'Judging from various indices, Japan's current account surplus appears to be peaking out now,' ministry officials said. The country's current-account surplus in yen terms was expected to continue to decline. 'The downward trend is obvious in yen terms, and seems to hold true even in dollar terms, if figures are compared on a quarterly basis, as opposed to a monthly basis, which is more susceptible to fluctuation.' But the officials warned that the politically-charged dollar figure was dependent on exchange rates and the price of oil which has been rising in recent weeks. The forecasts and figures will provide some relief in the struggle between Tokyo and Washington over Japan's surplus. This climbed to another record during the 1993 financial year to March, when it increased from Dollars 125.9bn (Pounds 59bn) in 1992 to Dollars 130bn. Tokyo has come under sustained pressure from Washington to boost its domestic economy and deregulate to generate increased imports. Exports last year rose 6.1 per cent to Dollars 355bn, outstripping imports, which dropped 6.9 per cent to Dollars 213bn. In yen terms, the current account surplus fell from a record Y15,600bn to Y14,000bn, with exports down 8.2 per cent at Y38,300bn and imports down 7.6 per cent at Y22,900bn. During March, the year-on-year surplus fell 16.1 per cent to Dollars 15.7bn, with exports up 5.3 per cent at Dollars 35.6bn and imports up 10.3 per cent at Dollars 20.4bn. The ministry also released details of Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus during the first 20 days of April, which widened to Dollars 4.75bn from a revised Dollars 4.61bn surplus in the same period a year earlier. The continuing weakness of the US currency played an important role in the rise, with the dollar at Y104.7 over the period, against Y115.9 12 months previously. Imports increased by 11.8 per cent to Dollars 15.26bn, while exports rose by 9.6 per cent to Dollars 20bn.</p>

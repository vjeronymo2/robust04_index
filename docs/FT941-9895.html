			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading A poor gilts sector in both the UK and the US undermined early strength in Footsie futures that followed the good overnight Wall Street performance, writes Joel Kibazo. Wednesday's New York market advance, coupled with favourable results from a clutch of leading UK stocks, helped the March contract on the FT-SE 100 to a firm start at 3,447. But doubts about that early strength set in within half-an-hour of the opening, leading to sporadic selling. March drifted for the next few hours, pulling the underlying cash market lower, with the fall by UK gilts accelerating the decline. With the weakness in European markets and US bonds leading to a further retreat in the afternoon, March finished at 3,399, a 7-point discount to cash. Volume at the official close totalled 16,741 contracts. Turnover in the traded options rose to 57,352 lots, against Wednesday's 52,745. However, volume in the FT-SE 100 option showed a slight decline at 18,000 contracts. Hanson was the busiest stock option with a total of 6,868 lots traded. Dealers said implied volatility was particularly high, indicating that a sharp decline was in store. Dealings in the OMLX futures on the FT-SE Mid 250 were negligible and a mere 250 contracts were dealt.</p>

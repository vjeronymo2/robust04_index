			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead THE MUSIC industry is in the news with the announcement that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate the price of compact discs. On Tuesday, Thorn EMI, one of the biggest music companies in the world, is due to announce its full-year results and any comments on CD prices by Sir Colin Southgate, the chairman, will be regarded with interest. Under the old accounting system, pre-tax profits of Pounds 330m are expected compared with Pounds 255.1m in the previous year. This does not take account, however, of exceptional items relating to Thames Television, which the group recently sold to Pearson. With results reported under FRS3, this and exceptional items related to smaller disposals will be included. Supermarket stocks have been in the doldrums recently as investors have focused on recovery plays and Argyll Group, the UK's third largest food retailing group, is no exception. The stock has been trading around its lows for the year. Nevertheless Argyll, which runs the Safeway and Presto / Lo-Cost chains, is expected to report a rise of as much as 15 per cent in full (53-week) year pre-tax profits to between Pounds 415m and Pounds 420m when it announces its results on Tuesday - continuing a remarkable six-year period of growth. On Wednesday, Courtaulds is expected to report pre-tax profits for the year to March of about Pounds 190m, down from Pounds 201m a year earlier. Of interest will be the impact of sterling's devaluation on its exports. But a cheaper pound will also mean higher debt. Carlton Communications reports on Monday, forecasts are of a modest increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 53m from Pounds 49m. The improvement will be in spite of an operating loss of about Pounds 5m by Carlton Television, the new London weekday ITV franchise. The loss will reflect start up costs and weak advertising revenues.</p>

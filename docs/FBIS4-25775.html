			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 14 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) notified the United States  today that it was withdrawing from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    The DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam faxed his country's  notice of leaving the IAEA to U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, a senior U.S. official said.    Under the IAEA statute, states may withdraw from the IAEA by  actually notifying the United States Government, because the  U.S. Government is the depository state for instruments of IAEA  membership.    The senior U.S. official said Kim told Christopher that  would  leave international inspectors with nothing to do in the DPRK.    The official commented that the U.S. administration would  have to do something about it and take an accelerated approach  to sanctions against the DPRK.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELIZABETH HARWOOD, 52; NOTED BRITISH SOPRANO  </P> <P> Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known operatic sopranos in the 1960s  and 1970s, has died after a battle with cancer, her family said. She was 52.  </P> <P> The singer, who specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and the music of  Mozart, died Friday at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London.  </P> <P> She sang with nearly all the top British operatic companies and appeared  regularly in leading roles at the prestigious annual music festival in  Salzburg, Austria, in the early 1970s.  </P> <P> She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in "Die Zauberflote" at  Glyndebourne in southern England.  </P> <P> She had been heard by Herbert von Karajan, who approached her for his own  Salzburg Festival.  </P> <P> In 1963, she scored her first major success, as the Countess Adele in Rossini's  "Count Ory." In 1960, she won Britain's prized Kathleen Ferrier memorial award  for singing, and in 1965 was joint winner of the Verdi Competition at Busseto  in Italy.  </P> <P> That same year she toured Australia with Dame Joan Sutherland's International  Opera Co.  </P> <P> She first appeared at Salzburg in 1970, when she sang the role of Constanze in  Mozart's 1782 opera "The Abduction From the Seraglio" and that of Fiordiligi in  "Cosi Fan Tutte."  </P> <P> Returning to Salzburg in 1972, she sang the countess in a new production of  Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro," again conducted by Von Karajan. He continued  to invite her to Salzburg for several more years.  </P> <P> She repeated Constanze at Milan's La Scala in 1972.  </P> <P> Von Karajan also chose her to record the title role in Franz Lehar's "Merry  Widow" and Musetta in Giacomo Puccini's "La Boheme."  </P> <P> In the late 1970s her health began to deteriorate. Her last public performance  was in November, 1989, at the Bath Festival in western England.  </P> <P> She married publisher-businessman Julian Royle in 1966 and their home was known  as a gathering place for both amateur and professional music makers. The couple  had one son.  </P></p>

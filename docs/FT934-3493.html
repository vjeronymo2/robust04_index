			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistani scientists in search for weather-proof cotton varieties Pakistan's cotton scientists are exploring ways to develop new crop varieties that will be tolerant of changing weather conditions, after this year's heavy crop damage. The government estimates that up to 15 per cent of the expected 12m bales has been lost because of the recent attack of the leaf curl virus. But some scientists suspect that higher temperatures, especially during night time, may have exacerbated the drop in production. Mr Waheed Sultan Khan, director of the government's cotton research institute in Faisalabad, said yesterday: 'Cotton is a very sensitive crop. We have seen this year that night temperature was 3'C higher as compared to previous years. The night temperature has a great impact on cotton production'. Such environmental changes required that new crop varieties be developed, Mr Khan said. Concern over environmental degradation causing crop damage is the latest addition to a lengthening list of worries for the cotton industry. Some officials and experts still fear that the fall-out from the Gulf War is continuing to affect the atmosphere. However, few efforts have been made to establish a scientific link. Some experts also believe that higher temperatures have been caused by large scale deforestation in recent years. Meanwhile, many cotton farmers among the worst affected in villages outside Faisalabad, were yesterday busy sowing other crops to recover some of their losses from cotton. Some have already ploughed their cotton fields without harvesting any crop, because the lint it contained would have earned them less money than they would have had to lay out in picking costs. 'I will never sow cotton again,' said Chaudhary Bashir Ahmed, who farms land about 32km from the city. He has recently ploughed in what remained of his 21-acre crop following the virus attack.</p>

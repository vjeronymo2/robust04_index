			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Pondering a deal with 'astronomical' potential: Telegraph directors meet today to discuss Southam Mr Conrad Black's business career has often taken surprising twists. But, for some of those in London who follow his publicly quoted UK newspaper group, The Telegraph, the sentiments aroused by his latest shift of tack go well beyond surprise. Last November, Mr Black's Canadian company Hollinger bought a 22.5 per cent stake in Southam, a Canadian newspaper group, at a price of CDollars 18.10 per share, at the time a 15 per cent premium to the market price. Hollinger has since offered The Telegraph half this stake, at the same price, at a cost to the UK group of Pounds 72.3m. The purchase was approved by The Telegraph's independent directors, ready for a vote by shareholders. The majority of the shares in The Telegraph, some 68 per cent, are owned by Mr Black's interests; but only outside shareholders will vote on the deal. The shareholder vote was set for March 30. Then came the twist. Last week, Power Corporation, the holding company of Mr Paul Desmarais, the Canadian financier, agreed to buy new shares from Southam at CDollars 14 each. That purchase will give Power an 18.7 per cent stake in Southam, and dilute the Hollinger holding down to the same level. Power and Hollinger also came to a shareholder agreement which would give the two considerable influence over Southam. To Mr Black, Southam is 'a classic corporate recovery', as he put it in a letter in Monday's FT. It owns 17 newspapers, published in almost every main Canadian city. It lost CDollars 153.2m in 1991 and CDollars 262.9m last year, and has been struggling with borrowings which reached CDollars 665m in 1991. But debt is being reduced. Power's investment in Southam is worth CDollars 180m and Southam is planning a CDollars 75m rights issue later this year, which should leave the business virtually debt free. Mr Black argues the business can be turned around. 'The upside could be astronomical,' he enthuses. Canadian analysts generally support Mr Black's assessment of Southam. 'They have a wonderful franchise and they should be able to make money,' says Ms Sue Scully, of Richardson Greenshields. It is not quite a clear-cut issue, though. If Power and Hollinger work together, they will have considerable influence over Southam. But if they fall out the story could be different. Some in Toronto suspect Southam did the deal with Power in order to reduce the influence of the Hollinger/Telegraph axis. Although Mr Black says in his FT letter that Hollinger and Power are 'long-standing corporate friends and on occasion allies' Mr Black and Mr Desmarais have in the past also been rivals, notably in the fight over Argus Corporation when Mr Black beat Mr Desmarais in a takeover battle. Still, a number of Telegraph shareholders and analysts in London focus not so much on the merits of the deal as on the way it has been handled. On March 13 The Telegraph's independent directors sent a circular to shareholders recommending a vote in favour of the share purchase, and a meeting between directors of The Telegraph and analysts was held on Wednesday March 17. It was on Tuesday or Wednesday, say those close to the deal, that directors learnt of the proposed Power purchase and that Hollinger was negotiating an agreement with Power. The Hollinger/Power agreement was finalised last Thursday and Telegraph shareholders heard about it the next day. The special meeting was postponed until The Telegraph's independent directors could review the changed circumstances, and meetings between the company and some shareholders were postponed. The independent directors meet today to discuss their recommendation. The Telegraph is still being offered the shares at Dollars 18.10. It has the option to sell the Southam shares back to Hollinger at CDollars 18.10 for about a year, giving it what Mr Black calls an 'almost risk-free opportunity'. The 17 independent directors endorsed the deal 10 days ago. One says: 'We looked at it before the arrival of Power Corporation on the scene and we liked the idea then. The injection of new money into Southam might make it a better deal.' Some Telegraph shareholders complain, however, that Power is getting a better deal still. Says one: 'It does not make sense to pay CDollars 18.10 for shares when others are buying at CDollars 14. It does not make sense for us to support the transaction unless they can explain why it's a good deal.' An independent director says: 'Mr Black said 'come in at my price or not at all'. I don't think it's negotiable. If it's a good deal it (the price) will come out in the wash.' Power's arrival offers another advantage, says Mr Black. The agreement with Power, 'largely vacates the so-called 'poison pill' arrangements which could have curtailed Hollinger's and The Telegraph's ability to be a constructive influence at Southam'. In the original circular, the Southam poison pill was described but the potential restrictions on Hollinger's and The Telegraph's influence were not emphasised. The circular said the holding proposed 'should enable The Telegraph to influence the recovery of Southam'. At the time Mr Joe Cooke, The Telegraph's managing director, said The Telegraph would have 'quite a lot of influence' over Southam. One institution which is a shareholder says it is unhappy with the Southam deal. 'The attraction to us in the shares was The Telegraph itself, not the rest,' said the fund manager. 'We did not buy shares in The Telegraph because we thought Mr Black was a good punter in media shares.' Another shareholder argues: 'Anyone who bought shares in The Telegraph knows that he (Mr Black) is a substantial shareholder and has an acquisitive track record. It's a case of the minority shareholders reviewing every deal put to them.' If The Telegraph's minority shareholders do not like the deal they can reject it - at the risk, Mr Black warned this week, of short-changing themselves. They will have to choose between the benefits of Mr Black's entrepreneurial style, and the occasional surprises to which it is likely to give rise.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / People: More feet under Stylo's table Stylo, the Bradford-based footwear retailer and manufacturer, yesterday promoted Michael Frankel, 50, and Stephen Lewis, 42, to the main board, restoring the complement to 10 following the departure of Mike Smith and the retirement of Patrick Hammond-Turner in the summer. Smith, who was finance director, went to Athena, the Pentos subsidiary, as md. This consolidated the position of Stylo's group md Michael Ziff, 41, who was redesignated as chief executive in yesterday's changes. 'The change of title is to help people outside avoid confusion with our divisional managing directors,' Ziff said, when asked about the adjustment in nomenclature. Frankel will continue in one such divisional role, as md of Stylo Barrett shoes. Lewis, a scientist with a PhD, will have overall responsibility for information technology and distribution. Stylo is hardly a household name for a company owning 500 retail outlets, but Barratts, the name over most of their front windows, is. It was this universal high street presence that led to Conrad Ritblat's British Land trying to lever its way into the company during the 1980s property boom. The concerted efforts of employee and Ziff family shareholders beat off the challenge, led by the redoubtable Arnold Ziff, now 67, the chairman  - and Michael's father. Ziff the elder also chairs the Leeds-based Town Centre Securities and is one of Yorkshire's business establishment. Will he now be taking a back seat? 'He is very much involved and, as usual, telephoned me from London at 8 am this morning for Tuesday's sales figures,' Michael Ziff said yesterday. Thanks to the computer technology new director Lewis is in charge of, they were immediately available.</p>

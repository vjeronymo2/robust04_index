			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on 'Arafat's speech at the Johannesburg  mosque, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says that Yasir 'Arafat  is the first Palestinian leader who is prepared to make peace  with Israel, and that we have to differentiate between his  remarks and his deeds. The foreign minister made these remarks  in an conversation with our Washington correspondent Arye Golan  at the outset of his U.S. visit.    [Begin recording] [Golan] Mr. Foreign Minister, what is  your comment on the latest disclosure of the tape in which  'Arafat says in Johannesburg that the agreement is temporary,  that it is like the agreement between Muhammad and the Quiraish  tribe?    [Peres] First of all, I am not certain that 'Arafat and  Muhammad resemble one another. They have a different  explanation, you know. I am not their attorney. I asked  'Arafat about this, and he explained that the Quiraish tribe was  the one that violated the agreement, in retaliation to which  Muhammad violated the agreement with Quiraish. That was his  explanation. I have no doubt, however, that he was drawn into a  harmful speech.    [Golan] Is he still a partner for peace negotiations, after  all we have heard about his remarks in Johannesburg, including  the latest disclosure?    [Peres] Look, negotiations are waged by nations, not persons  -- by the Palestinians and us. He heads the Palestinians for  better and for worse.    [Golan] Do you still believe him?    [Peres] I believe in peace.    [Golan] Are you saying that what he told you in Oslo is  sufficient, that he does not have to sign any new commitments?    [Peres] No, I am not a notary who writes affidavits. It is  not my job.    [Golan] What is going to happen now? What will happen to  the government if this man continues making such pronouncements?    [Peres] Again, I do not want to be anyone's advocate, but we  should differentiate between people's pronouncements and their  deeds. In this century, he was the first Palestinian leader who  decided to engage in negotiations on the basis of compromise.  This is the other side of the story. What good was it that the  mufti, who headed the Palestinians for 43 years, kept saying no,  no, no? What good was it that for 20-odd years the same 'Arafat  kept saying no and dealt in terrorism?    [Golan] Now he is saying yes and no alternately.    [Peres] No, he is doing yes and saying no. I do not want to  generalize, but we should remember his deeds, not just his  declarations.    [Golan] Don't you feel he is pulling wool over our eyes, as  they say?    [Peres] First of all, no one can pull wool over our eyes,  because we are not fools. We have the strength to defend  ourselves. We are not sapping our strength or impairing our  security one iota. We are making peace because we are strong,  not because we are weak. This is not peace made by weaklings,  this is not peace made by a pathetic nation. I feel we are a  strong, well-organized country which enjoys enormous  international support, a country which has grown. Militarily,  we have most of what we need. Therefore, the elements of  anxiety, fear, or weakness are not at stake here.    [Golan] Are you for pursuing the peace process with him, for  granting them self-rule according to the plan?    [Peres] I repeat: Not with him, with the Palestinian  people. And if a Palestinian authority is established, we will  have a much broader body to deal with. Today, however, he is  the spokesman and the leader of the Palestinians, and we must  remember this for better and for worse.    The transition period is difficult. They have a police, they  do not have a police; they have money, they do not have money.  But the transition period, too, should be viewed in the right  light. It is the transition period.    [Golan] Thank you very much, Mr. Foreign Minister. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / International Company News: Celcius ownership structure to be broadened CELCIUS, the Swedish state-owned defence group, moved a step nearer privatisation yesterday when the government announced plans to broaden the company's ownership structure and consider a stock market quotation within four months. The government says the state will remain a significant shareholder in the group, but it is likely that its holding will be reduced to about 20 per cent if enough industrial and institutional investors are willing to buy the shares. Estimates of the market capitalisation range widely, with most falling between SKr2bn and SKr3bn (Dollars 276m to Dollars 415m). The aim is to draw in industrial and institutional owners, rather than retail investors. If carried through, this would make Celcius the second large Swedish privatisation since the government announced in 1991 that it was planning to sell off 35 state-owned groups. Last year, the government sold off the big state steel group, SSAB, and three smaller companies. However, a stumbling block could be the attitude of the opposition Social Democrats, who say they oppose a stock market listing for Celcius at this stage. The party gained a say in the privatisation process as part of a crisis package agreed with the government last September. Mr Olof Lund, Celcius chairman and chief executive, said the group had decided in September 1991 that it wanted to broaden its ownership structure. Since then, it has been carrying out internal restructuring, which has included the sale of its installation company Calor and the disposal of some real estate operations. Mr Per Westerberg, industry minister, said: 'A market quotation for Celcius gives the company the possibility to take an active part in the restructuring of the Swedish and European defence industry.' Even though Celcius is a defence company, there are no restrictions on foreign ownership. Celcius made a profit of SKr345m on sales of SKr7.7bn in the first eight months of 1992.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Community aid coffers run low: Warning from Brussels as EC under pressure to give more THE European Community, which will face pressure on Friday to commit substantial new aid money to Bosnia, has all but run out of resources from its humanitarian aid budget. 'We've emptied all the drawers; we're dry; we have no money left,' said Mr Manuel Marin, commissioner in charge of development and humanitarian aid. The European Commission will this week approve an extra Ecu57.3m (Dollars 74.5m), on top of the Dollars 872m the Community and its 12 member states have provided for the former Yugoslavia between September 1991 and the end of this June. But the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is calling Friday's meeting of aid donors, is looking for Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn more for the Yugoslav crisis, on top of the Dollars 1.3bn already spent. The UNHCR is banking on the commitment made by last week's Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo, which agreed in its political declaration that 'the flow of humanitarian aid to Bosnia must be increased'. As the donor of two thirds of funding so far, the EC will be expected to provide the larger portion of new money, for what the US and Japan regard as primarily a European problem, according to Mr Marin. 'The Community budget is in no condition to meet these demands,' he added, unless the Twelve agree to raise the budget ceiling, a politicaly difficult decision at a time when all member states are under pressure to narrow widening budget deficits. Since the Yugoslav crisis began two years ago, the EC humanitarian aid budget has increased ten-fold, to around Ecu800m a year. But this money is required for emergencies in some 30 countries, among them Somalia, Ethiopia, Angola, northern Iraq, southern Sudan, Cambodia, the former Soviet republics and central America. A reserve emergency fund of some Ecu300m set up at the end of last year is now virtually exhausted, and limited funds transferred from other areas like the Phare programme for eastern Europe, or unspent commitments from the Lome Convention programme for Europe's former colonies, have been used. Mr Marin is essentially saying the Twelve will have to put their money where, at least, the four EC members of the G7 put their mouths last week.  ------------------------------------- HUMANITARIAN AID TO FORMER YUGOSLAVIA  -------------------------------------            Dollars m     %  ------------------------------------- EC             872      68 US             164      13 Japan           32       2 Others         217      17 Total         1285     100  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Regulator in row over gas spending SIR JAMES McKinnon, the director general of gas supply, yesterday asked British Gas to justify what he termed 'apparently arbitrary cuts' in capital spending, triggering a fresh row between himself and the company, David Lascelles writes. Evidence of an investment cut was presented to Sir James at a meeting with the Society of British Gas Industries. The society's members are the main suppliers to British Gas. They claimed that British Gas had made an arbitrary cut of 10 per cent in all its investment plans four to five months ago. They said the effect of this was now coming to light and together with the British Gas policy of running down stocks, some suppliers had seen orders fall by a third. Sir James said that British Gas had agreed two years ago to a set of price controls which left room for a fair rate of return and adequate investment. He added: 'Claims by British Gas that it can no longer afford essential investment are nonsense.' Mr Norman Blacker, British Gas's managing director of gas business, said: 'We are disappointed that once again the regulator has gone public with views on the company without first discussing the issue with us.' Some of the drop in capital spending was because of the sluggishness of the housing market, but safety was not being sacrificed. The company needed a fair rate of return to balance the interests of its customers, shareholders and suppliers.</p>

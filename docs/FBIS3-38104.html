EU Commission President Jacques Delors stated in  Brussels on Friday [28 January] that the work of his authority  will focus on a concept for a "greater Europe."    These considerations also played a role at the  Austrian-French forum that was held in the Vienna Town Hall on  Friday at the invitation of Foreign Minister Mock and the City  of Vienna. There Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European  affairs, summarized the stage plan in the direction of  pan-Europe: First the EU has to be increased to 16 members, so  that Austria also belongs to it. Then four steps must follow:  First, implementation of the Maastricht resolutions on foreign  and security policy; second, subsidiarity; third,  democratization; fourth, gradual integration of Central and East  Europe. "We need a policy for the East," Lamassoure said.    He wants to start the EU's policy for the East with an  "engagement day," that is, a basic offer to the East European  states that permits them to become members of the Community.  This policy must be extended to Russia. In the transition  period there will be a security problem, with which Austria will  cope best by acceding to the Western European Union (WEU),  toward which the East European states are also pushing their  way. Everything else would be paradoxical, he said. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (1): The engine overheats - World demand for cars is dropping just as large-scale investment in new production facilities is racing ahead in many countries. These twin factors are creating a business climate of particular harshness WORLD car makers are facing weakening demand in western Europe and Japan, while the US car market is pulling only hesitantly out of recession. The big three US car makers are reducing the record losses of 1991, but the struggle back into profit is painfully slow. For the first time the Japanese motor industry is also under pressure as its seemingly inexorable expansion comes up against the limits of retrenchment in its domestic market and jarring trade frictions abroad. In Europe falling sales, looming overcapacity and turmoil in the financial markets paint an ominous background as the car industry is poised to enter the era of the single market from the beginning of 1993, with the gradual dismantling of restrictions on Japanese vehicle imports. In Japan several of the smaller auto makers including Isuzu, Daihatsu and Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru) are in loss, while Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, is expecting its first loss this year since 1946 and is omitting its interim dividend. The net profits of Toyota, the leader of the Japanese industry, fell by 45 per cent in the financial year to the end of June. The Japanese motor industry 'may now be at a structural crossroads,' Mr Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan, warned earlier this month. 'The global motor industry is facing a business climate of unprecedented severity.' New car demand in Japan in 1992 is falling for a second year in succession, the first time for many years that there has been such a prolonged period of decline. The fall of 4.6 per cent in 1991 and a forecast decline of 6 per cent this year follow a period of extraordinary growth in the late 1980s, when the Japanese new car market climbed from 3.28m in 1987 to 5.1m in 1990. With no more access to cheap capital and with sharply rising labour costs, the Japanese car makers are having to cut costs, actions which could bring much-needed relief - at least in the short-term - to their hard-pressed rivals in the US and in Europe. The seemingly inexorable flood of new products from Japan may slow, as for the first time Japanese car makers move to extend model life cycles  - in many cases from four to five or six years - and act to reduce the proliferation of model variants. Japan, the world's biggest automobile producer, emerged for the first time last year with the highest gross hourly wage rates in the world auto industry according to a study by the German motor industry federation. In North America, where the big three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - are seeking to climb back from last year's record losses, the going remains tough. Ford, the second largest US producer, warned earlier this month that slow sales in the US and in Europe are expected to push it back into loss during the third quarter. General Motors, the wounded leader of the world motor industry, still faces an onerous task to restructure its chronically loss-making North American operations. As GM tries desperately to shrink its North American operations it has announced the closure of 21 plants - six vehicle assembly plants, four engine and transmission plants and 11 components plants - and a 74,000 reduction in its workforce by the mid-1990s. GM has already turned the screw drastically on its outside components suppliers in its attempts to cuts costs, but with one of the highest levels of in-house component manufacturing in the world auto industry, the battle remains to be fought inside the corporation. In the struggle to lose its status as the high-cost producer in North America GM could still be heading ominously for a climactic show-down with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW said earlier this year that it intended 'to enforce vigorously' its labour contract with GM, which virtually guarantees continued pay to laid-off workers. The unfolding drama at GM will influence the development of the worldwide auto industry, which it still bestrides accounting for around 15 per cent of world vehicle output. The severity of the problems that have confronted the US auto industry have intensified protectionist pressures and the big three US car makers are showing unusual unity as they enlist Washington in their battle against the encroachment of the Japanese car makers. The US initiative has brought fresh promises from the Japanese motor industry to buy more US components both for use in Japan and in the Japanese car plants in North America, but the concessions will scarcely dent the chronic US automotive trade deficit with Japan. Within North America the US administration has tried to use customs regulations on local content to force Japanese vehicle makers to use more locally-produced components while a barrage of protective trade legislation has been proposed in Congress. The automotive sections of the North America Free Trade Agreement signed earlier this year between the US, Canada and Mexico also appear to be designed to raise the competitive hurdles confronting the Japanese car makers in the US. Japanese producers accounted for 25 per cent of total US car production last year, increasing their share from 22 per cent a year earlier. The Japanese transplants' total car and light truck production capacity in North America is planned to reach around 2.7m vehicles a year by 1993/94. The development of the Japanese production base in North America is now almost complete, however, and the central focus of the battle in the global auto industry has shifted to Europe. In a period of less than 12 months from the summer of 1992 an array of Japanese manufacturing plants and new models are entering production in the UK, Hungary, and Spain. The Japanese car makers' main springboard into Europe is the UK, described by Mr Jacques Calvet, the staunchly protectionist chief executive of Peugeot, the French car maker, as 'a Japanese aircraft carrier just off the coast of Europe'. The indigenous European producers are also busy building new capacity - car makers led by Volkswagen, Fiat and GM are bringing into production in Europe plants with a capacity for around 1.5m vehicles a year between mid-1992 and the end of 1994. The next wave of plants is about to hit the market, however, as the European appetite for buying new cars is succumbing to economic recession. Leading western car makers have intensified warnings in recent weeks that west European new car sales would fall in 1993 for the second successive year. The challenges facing car makers in Europe have been heightened by the massive upheaval in the currency markets. The uncertain economic outlook is a depressing background to the dawning of the era of the single market in Europe, which marks a watershed for the car industry. From the start of 1993 the existing bilateral restrictions on direct Japanese vehicle exports to France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK are supposed to be replaced by a controversial system of monitoring by Brussels and Tokyo, in the first move to a completely liberalised EC car market by the end of 1999. The rules for monitoring Japanese vehicle exports to the EC appeared to be shaky even in a period of growth, but severe frictions could now develop between Europe and Japan, if the system must be administered in a period of falling sales.</p>

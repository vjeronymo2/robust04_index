			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON CONCERNED ABOUT EFFECTS OF THE 'BIG ONE';  </P> <P> DEFENSE: OFFICIALS, WORRIED ABOUT THE CONCENTRATION OF WEAPONS-MAKING PLANTS IN  </P> <P> Even as the Bay Area begins to recover from Tuesday's earthquake, some Pentagon  officials are trembling at the prospect of a still-deadlier temblor in the  heart of the nation's defense industry.  </P> <P> Damage to most of the area's 900 defense contractors was relatively light, and  weapons giants such as Lockheed Corp. and Ford Aerospace reported that  employees are back at work and defense programs are back on schedule.  </P> <P> But those responsible for ensuring the health of the nation's  weapons-production capability point to the concentration of defense plants in  earthquake-prone California and warn that quakes are not only human tragedies  but a national security problem too.  </P> <P> "If an 8.3 (magnitude) earthquake strikes California, it will not only be a  California but a national disaster," Richard E. Donnelly, assistant secretary  of defense for acquisition and logistics, told an industry group studying the  problem in 1986. "It is conceivable the President would declare a national  emergency and place U.S. forces on alert."  </P> <P> Experts warn that California's more than 5,000 defense contractors --  representing more than 50% of the nation's missile and space business and about  75% of the domestic microchip industry -- must take further precautions to  prepare for the "big one" that scientists believe is likely to strike in the  next 30 years.  </P> <P> A March, 1989, white paper prepared by the American Defense Preparedness Assn.,  a Washington-based industry group, concluded that "only 5% of the companies in  earthquake-prone California are estimated to be adequately prepared to cope  with earthquakes that could potentially wipe out their computer facilities and  operational capabilities."  </P> <P> "We industrial-base fanatics are never satisfied," Donnelly said in an  interview. "But in the past decade, there's been a substantial improvement. . .  . We think the system is working."  </P> <P> Donnelly said the Pentagon, working with contractors through the Business and  Industry Council on Earthquake Preparedness, has helped encourage and guide  defense firms to take voluntary measures to protect their ability to produce in  the wake of an earthquake.  </P> <P> But some, including the members of the ADPA, believe that the Defense  Department should move more aggressively to protect the nation's weapon-making  capacity, requiring earthquake preparations as a condition for doing business  with the Pentagon and looking outside the vulnerable quake zone for alternative  manufacturers for certain systems.  </P> <P> Donnelly said such measures go beyond the Pentagon's existing power over  contractors. He said the Pentagon's most effective earthquake initiative has  been a system of monitoring the locations and activities of defense  contractors.  </P> <P> Last Tuesday evening, Donnelly's office used a new database called DINET --  short for defense industrial network -- to identify those companies and defense  programs that might be affected by disasters. The database had been used in  Pentagon "command post exercises" but was used for the first time in a real  disaster when Hurricane Hugo struck the South Carolina coast.  </P> <P> On Tuesday night, DINET gave defense officials the names of 900 Bay Area firms  likely to be affected by the quake, as well as the defense programs that might  first be delayed if production lines shut down. Donnelly said the Pentagon had  not received reports of substantial disruptions in equipment deliveries as a  result of the quake.  </P> <P> But in Southern California, where the concentration of defense contractors is  greater than in the Bay Area, the delays could be severe -- and costly -- in  event of a major temblor, the ADPA group warned.  </P> <P> A 1986 Defense Department survey of 32 major contractors in the Los Angeles  quake zone indicated that an earthquake measuring more than 8 on the Richter  scale would cause delays in the delivery of equipment ranging from two months  to more than two years.  </P> <P> Companies that rely heavily on robotics and automated production have the most  urgent need to make earthquake preparations, warned the ADPA white paper, which  was prepared under the direction of Northrop Corp. disaster planner Nelson Cyr.  </P> <P> For instance, at FMC Corp.'s San Jose and Santa Clara production plants, where  armored troop carriers and fighting vehicles are produced, engineers worked  quickly to check and recalibrate automated equipment by Thursday.  </P> <P> But contractors who specialize in delicate, hand-assembled equipment have  challenges of their own. At Ford Aerospace's satellite assembly facility in  Palo Alto, satellites withstood the quake atop a 40-foot thick block of  concrete set on pilings that are sunk deep into the bedrock, according to Ford  spokesman Susan Pearce.  </P></p>

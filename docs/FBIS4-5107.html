			<p>BFN     [Text] An ROK shipping company is promoting the opening of  a triangular sea route connecting Pusan port and North Korea's  Chongjin port through Mogi port located on the southwest coast  of Japan.    According to the Korea Maritime and Port Administration,  Changyong Maritime Company, an inshore shipping company engaged  in shipping between the ROK and Japan, represented by Kim  Chong-su, recently applied to the National Unification Board  [NUB] for permission to contact North Korean residents to open a  regular sea route between Japan and North Korea for transporting  agricultural and sea products.    Accordingly, the NUB consulted with the Korea Maritime and  Port Administration, the office mainly concerned, to determine  if it is acceptable for an ROK shipping company to open a sea  route between Japan and North Korea. The Korea Maritime and  Port Administration has informed the NUB that it is necessary  for a domestic company to open a sea route between Japan and  North Korea because this would help domestic shipping companies  secure shipment territory in the East Sea economic area in the  future.</p>

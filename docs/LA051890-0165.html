			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SNL' WITH CLAY WINDS UP FOURTH IN NATIONAL RATINGS  </P> <P> It looks as if wholesome can still beat outrageous, even on "Saturday Night  Live."  </P> <P> NBC said Thursday that despite the impressive overnight ratings for the  controversial appearance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay last weekend, the final  national figures showed that the program was only the fourth highest rated  edition of this season. The first? The one hosted by Fred Savage of ABC's "The  Wonder Years."  </P> <P> The Clay installment had garnered "Saturday Night Live's" best ratings of the  season in the 23 large cities that deliver overnight figures, but the numbers  did not hold up in the smaller markets.  </P></p>

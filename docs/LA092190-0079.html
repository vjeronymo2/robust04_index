			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARENTS TO BE REUNITED WITH KIDNAPED BABY  BOY  </P> <P> A Hollywood couple were to be reunited Thursday with their kidnaped 1-year-old  son, who was recovered in Florida after he was allegedly spirited away last  month by his baby-sitter, police said.  </P> <P> Marta and Miguel Perez, both 24, were flown to Miami to pick up their son,  Raul, after police discovered the infant living with the baby-sitter and her  boyfriend in a Miami apartment, said Hollywood Division detective Mike Fino.  </P> <P> The baby-sitter, Rosa Posada, 34, was arrested and booked into Dade County Jail  on suspicion of kidnaping. Posada is expected to be returned to Los Angeles to  face charges after an extradition hearing Friday, said Fino. Her boyfriend was  not charged.  </P> <P> Fino said Posada took Raul from his Hollywood home the evening of Aug. 23  because, although she had been hired to baby-sit the infant and his brother  only two days before, "she had developed an attraction with the child and  wanted to raise him."  </P></p>

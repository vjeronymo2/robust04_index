			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: "Just Struggle"] </F>   [Text] According to a radio report from Seoul, students  staged strong anti-U.S. demonstrations in Kwangju and Taegu on  the morning of 17 February. Approximately 300 university  students in Kwangju district staged anti-U.S. demonstrations in  front of the American Center in Yangnim-tong, So-ku, Kwangju  City. The students denounced the United States for recently  strengthening pressure on the North regarding the nuclear issue  and for creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. The  university students strongly urged the United States to stop  pressuring the North on the nuclear inspection issue and to  discontinue the Team Spirit joint military exercise.    It is said that the furious students threw approximately 100  paint bombs and stones at the American Center and staged strong  demonstrations.    In addition, approximately 50 university students rushed to  the American Center in Taegu City and staged a surprise  anti-U.S. demonstration. According to the radio report, the  students threw dozens of paint bombs at the American Center,  while chanting the slogan: "We oppose the United States  aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula."    The South Korean youth and students stage very justifiable  struggles to prevent the war danger developing on the Korean  peninsula, to establish durable peace, and to realize the  independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    As everyone knows, even though half a century has passed  since our country was divided, our country has not been  reunified. The danger of war -- not durable peace -- has been  further increased on the Korean peninsula. This is because the  United States has occupied South Korea and has run wild to bring  about a new war.    If the United States did not bring approximately 1,000  nuclear weapons of all kinds into South Korea, the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula would not arise. If the United States  did not deploy tens of thousands of aggression forces in South  Korea and did not run wild to bring about a new war, the  situation of our country would not be tense.    Worse still, the United States has been putting pressure on  us to accept nuclear inspections and has openly revealed the  inner intention to conduct the Team Spirit joint military  exercise -- a test nuclear war and a preliminary war to invade  the North.    Now the U.S. warmongers say that if the Team Spirit joint  military exercise cannot be conducted, they plan to conduct  another joint military exercise targeted at our Republic. They  are babbling that if the joint military exercise cannot be  conducted in South Korea, they will conduct it even in Hawaii.    In actuality, the U.S. Forces based in Okinawa will begin a  military move regarded as the conduction of the Team Spirit-94  joint military exercise.    Facts show that the Team Spirit war exercise will become a  reality. In spite of the strong opposition by our people and  the people of the world, if the Team Spirit war exercise is  conducted, the tension in our country will be extremely  aggravated and the dark cloud of nuclear war will hover over our  people.    Furthermore, at a time when tension has been extremely  aggravated due to nuclear inspection moves by the United States  and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] against us,  conducting the Team Spirit war exercise is very dangerous, like  playing a war gamble on an arsenal depot. If such a very  dangerous thing is overlooked, the irrevocable nuclear holocaust  will be imposed upon our nation.    Thus, in face of the fascist suppression, South Korean  youth,  students, and people are staging strong struggles calling for  the United States to discontinue the Team Spirit war exercise.    Our nation cannot fall a victim to nuclear holocaust.  Whether they are in the North, South, or overseas, the people  who think about the future of the country and the nation should  rise up to the just struggle to prevent and frustrate the U.S.  nuclear war moves through the unity of all nations.    The United States should give up the moves to conduct the  Team Spirit war exercise move as claimed by the South Korean  people, it should get out of South Korea immediately by  withdrawing its forces, nuclear weapons, and all aggression  forces from South Korea.    If the United States persistently conducts the Team Spirit  war exercise in spite of our people's strong opposition, it  should be entirely held responsible for the consequence arising  therefrom.</p>

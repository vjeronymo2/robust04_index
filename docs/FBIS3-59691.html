			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI),  in cooperation with Nagoya University, synthesized and separated  a new isotope, praseodymium-127 (Pr: a rare-earth element whose  atomic number is 59). The researchers ascertained the half-life  and at the same time confirmed that gamma rays are emitted by  the isotope. This is the latest of the results obtained at the  ion irradiation research facility (TIARA) that was established  in 1991 at JAERI's Takasaki Laboratory. Because the Pr-127  isotope has 14 fewer neutrons than the naturally occurring  stable Pr-141 isotope and is very unstable, its existence was  difficult to confirm and its half-life was unknown until now.    The researchers formed Pr-127 in a reaction with argon-36  (Ar-36) and molybdenum-94 (Mo-94), then, after separating the  isotope with an on-line isotope separator (ISOL), confirmed its  existence by measuring gamma-ray and other radiation.    The researchers used a strong Ar-36 beam, which was  generated  with the TIARA's AVF cyclotron, in a synthesizing nuclear  reaction with Mo-94 to form Pr-127. Next, they isolated only  three types of Pr-127 from the isotopes produced, and then  measured the Pr isotopes, which became extinct within seconds.  The results of the analyses showed that the half-life of Pr-127  is 7.7 +/- 0.6 seconds.    Isotopes are the components of space from which the  structure  of matter originates, and studying the properties of isotopes is  useful in understanding the process by which the elements are  formed. Because of that there is vigorous research on isotopes  in the advanced countries, and, in the 80 years since the  discovery of isotopes, one thousand and several hundred isotopes  have been confirmed. In 1989 JAERI discovered a new isotope of  lanthanum (La-121). After that JAERI used the newly set up AVF  cyclotron in research on Pr isotopes. Now JAERI plans to search  for Pr-125, which has even fewer neutrons than Pr-127 and is  expected to have an even shorter half-life.</p>

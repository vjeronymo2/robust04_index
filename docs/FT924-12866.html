			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Thames TV to lose film rights THAMES Television will be told today that it cannot hold on to the weekday rights to broadcast several hundred films in the London area when it ceases to be an ITV company at the end of this year. Thames has asked its successor, Carlton Television, for Pounds 20m for the rights or threatens to sell them on to Channel 5 Holdings, a company in which it is the leading shareholder. Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, has written to Thames saying that its intention to sell the film rights to Channel 5 amounts to a refusal to sell to Carlton. Under a 1987 agreement, Mr Quinn says, an ITV company that loses its licence must offer to sell its rights to the franchise winner. If no agreement can be reached between the two, the right to broadcast the feature films reverts to the ITVA. It is clear that the ITVA is taking control of the rights immediately. It will, however, grant Thames a sub-licence to use the films until its franchise runs out at the end of the year. The ITVA says it plans to sub-licence the rights to Carlton from December 31. The ITVA will appoint an independent panel of experts to assess the value of the rights. Thames is likely to go to court to establish who should control the rights. The films are important to Thames if the planned Channel 5 goes ahead. Films will be one of the specialities of the advertising-supported channel, which could begin broadcasting in London in late 1994.</p>

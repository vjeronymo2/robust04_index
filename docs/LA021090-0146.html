			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI WELCOMES GAY-LESBIAN FESTIVAL BUT HOUSING STILL FOR MARRIEDS ONLY  </P> <P> With students in the background protesting what they call discrimination  against homosexuals, organizers for the Gay and Lesbian Festival said Friday  that UC Irvine officials have agreed to allow the controversial fair to be held  on campus this year.  </P> <P> Students continued to camp out for a third day in a shantytown of cardboard  boxes and sheets of plastic to protest a university policy that bars unmarried  and gay and lesbian couples from university housing for families. Fifty yards  away, festival organizers announced plans to hold the fair and parade at UCI on  Aug. 11-12.  </P> <P> Some of the student protesters charged that the university was being  inconsistent.  </P> <P> "Gay and lesbian couples cannot get (university) housing, but we can have a  parade here," said Michelle Richards, a sophomore English major who slept  overnight on the rumpled blankets outside the administration building to  support the protesters. "There seems to be an inherent contradiction."  </P> <P> University spokeswoman Linda Granell said Orange County Cultural Pride, the  group of volunteers that staged the gay festival last year in Santa Ana, was  invited to hold the event at UCI by the campus Gay and Lesbian Student Union.  </P> <P> "The timing makes it so these two issues are viewed together, but they're  really completely separate," Granell said. "One is a legal issue and the other  is a student activity."  </P> <P> Granell said the Gay and Lesbian Festival is welcome at UCI. But she said  university family housing, which is moderately priced, is available only to  legally married couples. Unmarried gay and lesbian couples cannot live at the  860-unit Verano Place apartments on campus, she said.  </P> <P> The first Gay and Lesbian Festival encountered virulent opposition last  September when it was held at Centennial Regional Park in Santa Ana. A tense  shouting match between fundamentalist Christians, and gays and lesbians erupted  into a fist-swinging fracas that ended with six people arrested, from both  sides.  </P> <P> Fundamentalist Christians subsequently launched a recall effort against six of  the seven City Council members for allowing the park to be used. Petition  organizers have until mid-March to get a recall ballot, said City Councilman  John Acosta, who publicly opposed the festival and thus is the only council  member not targeted by the recall effort.  </P> <P> The fair will not be held in Santa Ana because a new city law bans large public  events that charge entrance fees, said festival spokeswoman Janet Avery.  </P> <P> Organizers said they believe the second festival will not generate as much  controversy, in part because of the new location.  </P> <P> "It will take us a few more annual events before we're allowed to go and do our  thing" without bringing out counterdemonstrators, predicted Connie Long,  president of Orange County Cultural Pride.  </P> <P> Leaders of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, which mobilized the  Christian demonstration last year, would not say whether they would demonstrate  at this year's event, according to Steve Sheldon, the son of the group's  founder, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon.  </P> <P> Security at the festival will be tightened this year, Avery said. She declined  to be specific, but said police drawn from many of the nine UC campuses will  cover the event.  </P></p>

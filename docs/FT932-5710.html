			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Spotlight falls on Canadian dollar sector THREE new issues totalling CDollars 1.65bn refocused attention on the Canadian dollar market, after a quiet period. The Province of British Columbia's debut global offering of CDollars 1.25bn of bonds stole the limelight from two smaller issues. Dealers reported strong demand for British Columbia's 10-year bonds, priced to yield 45 basis points more than the comparable Canadian government bond. 'British Columbia is a rare borrower, even in the Canadian domestic market,' said one dealer. While some other Canadian provinces have already flooded the domestic market with paper, demand for British Columbia held up well across all three time zones. The Provinces of Ontario and Quebec have already issued bonds using the global bond structure, which allows bonds to be sold and traded in the Far East, Europe and North America, and Ontario is said to be in discussions with underwriters over a further global offering denominated in Canadian dollars. A CDollars 200m 10-year offering for Kansai International Airport was also well received. The borrower has already tapped the market on a handful of occasions, but this could mark its last visit to the capital markets for some time, as the first stage of the construction of the airport is close to completion, according to lead manager IBJ International. The yield spread of 42 basis points over 10-year Canadian government bonds was considered an attractive pricing for Japanese government-guaranteed debt by both Japanese and European investors. Dealers reported somewhat slower demand for a Dollars 200m five-year issue for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, arranged by IBJ. In the Dutch market, the World Bank launched a Fl 750m issue of 10-year bonds via ABN Amro Bank, priced to yield 8.4 basis points over the 10-year Dutch government bond, which dealers said offered reasonable value compared with other secondary market issues. In the sterling bond market, Cheltenham and Gloucester, the UK building society, launched its first publicly traded fixed-rate debt, a Pounds 150m five-year issue via J. P. Morgan. The deal was priced to yield 70 basis points over the five-year UK gilt, but the spread widened slightly due to the rally in the UK gilts market. Elsewhere, Portugal is said to be preparing to launch a DM1.5bn to DM2bn bond issue, possibly this week, depending on market conditions. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank are said to be the leading candidates to arrange the issue. Portugal's foreign debt rating was upgraded last week from A plus to AA minus by Standard &amp; Poor's. The improved rating should allow the Portuguese government to achieve slightly finer terms for a new bond offering. The OMLX Exchange and OM Stockholm, the London- and Stockholm-based derivatives exchanges, are planning to launch three new series to add to the 17 Swedish stock futures and options presently traded. The stocks are Sandvik, Stora, and Nordstrom &amp; Thulin. The UK's Office of Fair Trading said that none of the rules of the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) was likely to prevent competition in the market for futures and options in the UK to any significant extent, Reuter reports from London. Nymex has applied to operate in the UK using Access, its electronic order matching and trade execution system.</p>

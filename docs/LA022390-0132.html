			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' PAIRINGS;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW, LA QUINTA HIT THE ROAD  </P> <P> Eight Orange County girls' teams remain in the Southern Section basketball  playoffs.  </P> <P> All of the semifinal games will be played Saturday night at neutral sites, so  there are no home-court advantages.  </P> <P> However, winners of Thursday's coin flips were designated as the "home team."  Being designated the home team gives schools the advantage of playing at a  gymnasium near their school.  </P> <P> Only two county teams -- Ocean View and La Quinta -- lost coin tosses.  </P> <P> Here are the pairings for each division involving county teams. All of the  games, except in the 2-AA division, begin at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> 5-A Division -- Fourth-seeded Ocean View (26-2) makes its first appearance in  the semifinals. The Seahawks, who have set a school record for victories in a  season, travel to Ventura High for their game against top-seeded Buena (25-0).  </P> <P> 4-AA Division -- Unseeded Loara (16-10) is the designated home team against  unseeded Ventura (18-9) at Savanna High.  </P> <P> 4-A Division -- Third-seeded La Quinta (25-3), led by Amy Jalewalia, last  season's state scoring leader, takes on second-seeded Palm Desert (25-2) at  College of the Desert near Palm Springs. The Aztecs make their first appearance  in the semifinals.  </P> <P> 3-AA Division -- Unseeded Estancia (14-12) is the home team against  second-seeded Palos Verdes (26-4) at University High.  </P> <P> Brea-Olinda, which beat Foothill Thursday night, plays fourth-seeded Alemany  (20-6). The home team will be determined by a coin flip today.  </P> <P> 3-A Division -- Making its first appearance in the semifinals, top-seeded  Rancho Alamitos (20-3) plays host to San Dimas (16-6) at Bolsa Grande High.  </P> <P> Unseeded Costa Mesa (15-11), led by standout freshman Olivia DiCamilli, plays  host to second-seeded South Hills (19-5) at Estancia High.  </P> <P> 2-AA Division -- Fourth-seeded Santa Margarita (20-6) is the home team against  unseeded Beaumont (18-6).

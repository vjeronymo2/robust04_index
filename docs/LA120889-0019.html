			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU KEEPS IT CLOSE BUT LOSES TO LIONS, 152-137  </P> <P> U.S. International, which lately has become college basketball's answer to Ed  McMahon, earned a little of its own limelight against Loyola Marymount Thursday  night.  </P> <P> USIU Coach Gary Zarecky fancies his Gulls as a team that can run with the likes  of LMU and Oklahoma. But in two games against the Lions last season and a game  earlier this season with the Sooners, USIU proved to be just so much fodder.  </P> <P> Thursday night, USIU played LMU tough in the first half and led, 94-92, with  13:13 remaining. But the Lions scored the next 18 points on their way to a  152-137 victory before approximately 800 at Golden Hall.  </P> <P> The loss was the fifth in a row for USIU (2-5). Loyola Marymount (4-1) won its  fourth in a row.  </P> <P> This one had nothing such as the team records set in last year's two meetings,  which LMU won, 162-144 and 181-150, or the 97 points Oklahoma scored in the  first half against the Gulls two weeks ago.  </P> <P> But the Gulls' Kevin Bradshaw set a USIU record with 54 points, breaking the  mark of 47 set by teammate Demetrius Laffitte against Point Loma Nazarene last  season. Bradshaw also led the team in rebounding with 13. Laffitte scored 25  points and had 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> Neither could offset the dominating play of Hank Gathers, who had 37 points and  27 rebounds. Four other Loyola players scored in double figures as the teams  combined for 289 points, the fourth highest in NCAA Division I history. Three  of those four games were between USIU and LMU.  </P> <P> "The talent kicked in," Zarecky said. "Our kids played a good game for  three-quarters of the way. They really over-achieved. I thought we did a good  job breaking their press. We're getting our confidence back."  </P> <P> The Gulls showed that they weren't intimidated by the Lions. USIU trailed,  34-24, with 12:34 remaining in the first half, but the Gulls rallied to pull  within 75-72 at halftime.  </P> <P> But in the second half, the bench depth between the Gulls and the Lions became  evident as LMU went on its 18-0 run.  </P> <P> "I said before the season we have the best bench since I've been here and  they've proven it," Gathers said. "A lot of people laugh at this USIU, but  they're a remarkable team. I respect a team that can come out and run that  way."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUNDAY SILENCE, EASY GOER TO MEET IN $1-MILLION INVITATIONAL AUG. 4  </P> <P> Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, last year's top two U.S. thoroughbreds, will  renew the hottest rivalry in horse racing at a $1-million invitational race  Aug. 4.  </P> <P> Arlington International Racecourse said Tuesday that it will host the 1  1/4-mile race on dirt that will reunite the two horses who thrilled the fans in  four exciting races last year which ended 3-1 in favor of Sunday Silence.  </P> <P> Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and, in their last  meeting, the Breeders' Cup Classic in November. Easy Goer denied the black colt  the honor of the Triple Crown by capturing the Belmont Stakes by eight lengths.  </P> <P> The invitational is to be held at the track in Chicago's northern suburbs less  than a month before the Arlington Million, a race on grass that features an  international field. Sunday Silence trainer Charlie Whittingham has nominated  his horse for that 1 1/4-mile event as well.  </P></p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Pension industry faces big sales loss in next tax year THE Department of Social Security has insisted that sellers of personal pensions inform their clients about changes to tax rules which will make them less attractive to hold. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, yesterday was the first to issue guidelines requiring companies to contact clients for whom it may no longer be worthwhile to maintain current personal pension arrangements when new tax rules come into effect on April 6. If the individuals follow this advice, it could mean the loss of billions of pounds of premium income for the industry. The other self-regulatory bodies, Fimbra, Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, are also to issue guidelines in the next few weeks. The guidelines say enforcement officials from the SROs (self regulatory organisations) will be checking company records in the coming year to make sure best advice is given. 'The government and regulators are keen to ensure that anyone considering their pension provision receives the best possible advice,' the Department of Social Security said. There are roughly 5m holders of personal pensions in Britain. The product has been the life insurance industry's single biggest source of new business in the past year. Rebates of national insurance contributions (NICs) have made them particularly attractive to young people although as individuals age, the tax advantages disappear. Industry officials estimate that one-half to two-thirds of all personal pension holders are so-called 'rebate only'. That means that the only contribution paid into their personal pensions are the rebate from their NICs. The new tax rules cut the rebate of NIC available to those who contract out of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) via a personal pension. This means that the age at which men should contract back into Serps could fall to 40 from 45 at present and women should contract back in at 35 instead of 40. Currently, 750,000 personal pension holders are over 40. John Willman writes: The ruling could produce short-term benefits for the government's deficit. When people opt back into Serps, the exchequer saves the national insurance rebates paid into personal pensions for those who opt out. In the longer term, however, the cost of paying Serps pensions would grow. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that if everyone eventually opted back into Serps, the cost would be double the Pounds 15bn a year forecast for 2030.</p>

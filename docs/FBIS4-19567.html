			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Yennaris] </F>   [Text] The question that concerns the government is how the  information about National Guard work at Larnaca Airport was  leaked so that the United States and Britain became interested  in it. Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC] broke its  exclusive report of the incident yesterday and the government  officially confirmed it today. Government spokesman Ioannis  Kasoulidhis confirmed that police had interrogated British  military officers about an incident in which a U.S. national,  who was using a car with diplomatic license plates, became  involved.    Asked about the excuse of the arrested, Kasoulidhis said:    [Begin Kasoulidhis recording] Their version was that it is  their hobby to watch the planes land and take off. [end  recording]    Kasoulidhis added that the arrested were not in a prohibited  area and at first glance it does not seem that they have  committed a crime. The issue is being investigated further.    A U.S. source revealed to CyBC that the U.S. national is  Major Scott David Dorney, the assistant military attache. The  same source said he was at the airport to meet a colleague. The  source mentioned that other Americans, including U.S. Embassy  personnel, were also at the airport to welcome U.S. Ambassador  Richard Boucher, who was returning from abroad.    An official spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia told  CyBC that no American has been arrested, detained, officially  interrogated, or been in a prohibited area at Larnaca Airport.  Answering our question on the purpose of the major's presence at  the airport, the spokesman said he was there for personal  reasons. Of course he did not reveal them.    A British bases spokesman confirmed that a British officer  was interrogated by police and was later released. The  spokesman added: The British officer cooperated with police, but  we do not understand what the issue is.    Asked about the incident this morning, President Glavkos  Kliridhis said:    [Begin recording] [Kliridhis] I do not believe we can say  that this is an espionage case, because it is well-known that we  are bringing in arms.    [Unidentified correspondent] What did they want, then?    [Kliridhis] I do not know. We will find this out when we  investigate the case. [end recording]</p>

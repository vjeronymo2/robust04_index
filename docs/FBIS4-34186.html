			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, President Luis Alberto Lacalle asked the  publishers in our country to bear in mind that the idea of  liberty is also "imbued with a lofty idea of responsibility."    Upon signing the Chapultepec Declaration on freedom of the  press, Lacalle discussed this issue with the top officials of  the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) yesterday. The  president pointed out: "Even though there is a constitutional  provision establishing liberty and all of us are ready to  preserve it, liberty is increasingly matched by the  responsibility of publishers, editors, directors, and owners."    The chief executive noted: "If we bear in mind that the  judicial branch may not always act quickly, it is necessary for  liberty to be increasingly matched by the responsibility of  owners, directors, and media promoters."    Lacalle pointed out: "By signing this declaration we confirm  our commitment to making men entirely free and responsible for  their actions."    Present at the ceremony were IAPA President Raul  Kraiselburd,  IAPA Vice President Robert C. Hardie, and local media  executives, including EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO director Ricardo  Peirano. Argentine President Carlos Menem signed the  declaration on 6 June, and Paraguayan President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy will sign it on 8 June.</p>

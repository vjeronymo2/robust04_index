			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Taiwan falls 4% as margin loans are rationed Roundup Markets moved in sharply divergent directions, with Tokyo on holiday and Bombay still strikebound. TAIWAN plunged 4 per cent on heavy profit-taking triggered by news that Fuh-Hwa Securities Finance was introducing a rationing system for margin loans. The weighted index ended 216.79 down at 5,257.96, after an intraday low of 5,248. Turnover remained heavy at TDollars 78.87bn but fell from Wednesday's TDollars 103.92bn. Fuh-Hwa is the market's biggest provider of margin loans. Profit-taking from the market's 32 per cent gains since November 27 was relentless in spite of some bargain hunting at mid-morning. China Steel, the most active issue of the day, retreated TDollars 1.60 to TDollars 25. Among the most recent targets of foreign buying, the banking stock ICBC finished only 50 cents lower at TDollars 67.50. BANGKOK rose 1.3 per cent in active trade, propelled by the strong gains of TelecomAsia and the debut of satellite dish seller Samart Corporation. The SET index added 19.77 at 1,543.52 in turnover of a robust Bt25.43bn. TelecomAsia, the largest capitalisation issue in the market, hit its 10 per cent upward limit, surging Bt11 to Bt127, and was the most active stock in volume and turnover terms. Samart soared to Bt452, or more than five times its initial public offer price of Bt80. The stock was the second most active. The combined turnover of TA and Samart represented 21.8 per cent of the market total. HONG KONG saw selective buying which took the Hang Seng index 173.24, or 1.6 per cent, higher to a record 10,881.20, although profit-taking had pared a day's best of 10,957.59. Properties led the gains, with Sun Hung Kai Properties peaking at a record HKDollars 66 before finishing HKDollars 3.50 ahead at HKDollars 65 and Henderson Land up HKDollars 2.25 at HKDollars 44. San Miguel Brewery, a locally listed subsidiary of San Miguel, of the Philippines, surged HKDollars 1.425 to HKDollars 5.80, buoyed by a late wave of local demand after market rumours that the brewery might move its operations to China. NEW ZEALAND's rally continued, supported by lower interest rates. Most shares gained ground on good volume, the NZSE-40 capital index climbing 16.94 to 2,088.72. Strong foreign demand took Telecom 3 cents higher to NZDollars 3.98 and Carter Holt Harvey up a cent to NZDollars 3.51 in turnover of 5.6m shares. MANILA closed at a record high for the fourth straight day as money continued to flood into the market. The composite index moved up 99.63 to 2,997.46, taking this week's cumulative rise to 12.6 per cent. JAKARTA advanced in moderate late trading which left the official index 7.27 higher at a record 557.34. KUALA LUMPUR extended its ggod run, led by institutional buying of blue chips, with the composite index ending 30.86 up at a new 1993 peak of 1,152.24. SINGAPORE was in bullish mood, the Straits Times Industrial index rising 24.66 to a high of 2,298.61 in heavy volume of 515.9m shares. SEOUL was dragged lower amid profit-taking in high-priced blue chips and the composite index fell 10.23 to 858.37. KARACHI encountered more profit-taking, pushing the KSE index 28.88 lower to 2,033.08.</p>

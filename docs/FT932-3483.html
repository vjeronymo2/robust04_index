			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Business ethics and China FOREIGN investment is pouring into China. As the reports on page 2 indicate, China's growth offers such promise that businesses have to consider the opportunities. The risks include huge unknowns. How will the country be governed after the octogenarian leadership disappears? To what extent will economic reform bring political change, and will this cause instability? For how long is China's economy doomed to a lurching boom-bust cycle? There is, however, a further question. Is it morally defensible for businesses to seek profit in a country still firmly controlled by a Communist party which ruthlessly and shamelessly stamps upon its people? This is the government which showed in Tiananmen Square four years ago that it was prepared to stop at nothing to hold onto power. Millions of people languish in its labour camps, the products of their labour often sold abroad. The issue should not be brushed aside as a concern of politicians, but not of business. Human rights are a matter for each individual. The decisions of each company's directors matter. The strongest argument for participation in China's boom is that the contact now occurring daily between ordinary Chinese and thousands of foreign business people is a potent agent encouraging stable economic and political development from the inside. Western business practices and ethics are being communicated inside China as a practical matter, not as part of a sermon. The growth of private enterprise and individual expression is being fostered as values encouraged by state control wither. This is the 'peaceful evolution' the Communist hardliners fear. Such changes occur only gradually and can be frustrated. But consider the risks, both for a billion Chinese and for the world, of chaotic governmental collapse similar to that in the former Soviet bloc. The world cannot expect western-style democracy suddenly to emerge in China. It is more realistic to expect slow progress towards greater pluralism in government - and it is in the interests of the rest of the world that change occurs in a reasonably calm atmosphere. The opening of China's economy is bringing broader political and social changes. The monolith is breaking down. Yet it is an over-simplification to suggest that the party's new dogma - the socialist market economy - is simply capitalism by another name. Businesses negotiating joint ventures are usually dealing directly with official bodies, and bureaucrats still control the supply of many essential inputs. The success of a venture depends on having good connections within the system. The moral question is, therefore, not easy to answer. Putting sound business principles into practice is the best foundation for assessing investment in China. Experience shows that the successful investments are those which the foreigner thoroughly investigates and carefully oversees. First-hand scrutiny of a venture is not only to be recommended on business grounds, but it should also be used to satisfy the investor that it does not bring involvement in unacceptable practices such as prison labour. Companies, such as Levi Strauss, which have chosen to reject involvement in China because of the country's human rights record, are entitled to respect. Such decisions are, however, part of a carefully positioned corporate image and as such do not necessarily apply to others. Foreign business presence in China is part of the west's overall policy of engaging in dialogue at every level, seeking to foster stable economic development while at the same time pressing China to conform to international standards of behaviour. Companies which do take the plunge deserve the support of their governments.</p>

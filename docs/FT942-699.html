			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Citizenship in Latvia Sir, The article 'Held up on the western Line' (June 23) clearly points out many of Latvia's concerns regarding the critical demographic situation in Latvia. However, it incorrectly gives the impression that 'almost one half of the population' is presently excluded from Latvian citizenship. In fact, 70 per cent of the residents of Latvia - of many ethnic origins - are presently citizens. An area of prime contention concerns the fate of a group of about 410,000 persons, of whom an estimated 160,000 are retired Soviet military and KGB personnel and their families. This latter group, by the internationally accepted Geneva Convention on Occupied Territory, should not be 'forced upon' Latvia as potential citizens. The second important aspect concerns the present demographic situation in Latvia (52 per cent ethnic Latvians) and the potential effects of rapid naturalisation of persons who may not be assimilated into the Latvian culture prior to the impending parliamentary elections of October 1995 and October 1998. While the recommendations of the Council of Europe and Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe have been seriously considered by the government of Latvia, and many were incorporated into the law, the critical demographic situation in Latvia precludes a rapid naturalisation process. One may ask, would any European country allow such a demographic shift in its citizenry to occur in such a short period of time?

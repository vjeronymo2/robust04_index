			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN CALLING SELF 'MESSENGER OF LORD' RAPES 3 WOMEN  </P> <P> A man identifying himself as "St. Peter, messenger of the Lord," has raped  three women in Long Beach in the last two weeks after cutting off most of their  hair and carving upside-down crosses on their backs, police said Monday.  </P> <P> The women, all in their early 20s, accepted rides from the man, said Long Beach  Police Sgt. C.S. Roberson. After raping them, the man dumped them out of the  car naked, leaving them in industrial sections of Long Beach.  </P> <P> "(The rapist) says he is there to redeem the women in the face of God,"  Roberson said. "That's why he cuts off their hair, to give them a cleansing  before they meet the Lord. He says the hair is a token for the devil or for  Satan."  </P> <P> All of the assaults have occurred between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., Roberson said. All  of the victims are described as slender women in their early 20s with long  hair.  </P> <P> The first assault took place Sept. 16, when a woman was picked up near the  intersection of Long Beach Boulevard and 6th Street, Roberson said.  </P> <P> A second woman was raped on Sept. 21 after being given a ride near the corner  of Pacific Coast Highway and Linden Avenue. The third woman was raped Friday  after accepting a ride near the intersection of Ximeno Avenue and Pacific Coast  Highway, police said.  </P> <P> The victims told police that after being picked up by the man, he began to rant  about God and religion, while threatening them with an eight-inch knife. They  were taken to remote sites near the harbor, where they were raped, Roberson  said.  </P> <P> The suspect is described by police as a white man with blonde hair, 28 to 35  years old, and between 5 feet, 9 inches, and 5 feet, 11 inches tall. Police  said he is driving a beige Volvo with a sunroof and tinted windows.  </P> <P> Police are also attempting to determine if there are any links between the  rapes and the shooting death of a woman in her early 30s whose nude body was  found Sunday morning on the Carson Street underpass of the Long Beach Freeway.  </P> <P> The woman, not yet identified by police, was apparently shot at another  location and her body dumped on the freeway, police said. A motorist discovered  the body at 7 a.m. Sunday and notified police.  </P></p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Looking to the future With UK equities sliding uncomfortably lower it is only natural that the market should be looking to apportion blame. On most conventional valuations, equities look like a firm buy. Yesterday's 1 per cent fall had more to do with the gloom emanating from Japan than any single domestic factor, but the market is looking closer to home for a scapegoat. The growing volume of futures trading relative to the size of the cash market seems to fit the bill. Volume in the cash market is not unseasonally low. At Pounds 13bn, July turnover of FT-SE stocks was actually slightly above July last year. Yet the centre of gravity is certainly shifting towards the floor of Liffe. The FT-SE future traded more stock than the underlying shares last month. So far this year the cash market and futures are running neck and neck. Both show volume of around Pounds 90bn. Similar concerns in Japan have prompted measures to make index futures trading more expensive. However, trading of equity futures and options is twice the size of the cash market in the US, suggesting there is nothing sinister about the growth of futures trading in itself. Indeed bearish sentiment in the cash market may have driven business towards futures as institutions search for liquidity and market makers hedge long positions. The independent traders operating from the FT-SE future pit may seem candidates for the lynch-mob. The future seems to be leading the cash market lower but the pit operators' efforts would be swamped if only institutional investors were prepared to back their valuations with hard cash.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: PM's first 'talkabout'with party faithful SAWTRY VILLAGE hall near Huntingdon was the venue for the first of the prime minister's shirt-sleeved, one-man shows, or 'talkabouts' across the country that will be a new element in the Tories' election campaign. The day after officially launching the Tories' election effort with a speech to a party rally in Torquay, Mr Major informally launched the campaign with a 45-minute question and answer session. Selected members of the local Conservative Association and some of their friends were invited to meet the man who has represented them for 13 years and who received a majority of 27,000 in 1987. Conscious that public speaking is not the prime minister's greatest strength, party officials sounded faintly defensive about the new tactic, emphasising that such meetings would be in addition to the set-piece occasions and not instead of them. They had expected questions to be difficult, as they had been in two dry runs, in Bristol last summer and at York in January. Such expectations were dashed by the automatic standing ovation and the respectful atmosphere, in part engendered by a rousing introduction from Mr Jeffrey Archer. The prime minister, sitting on a bar stool and choosing his own questioners from the 300-strong audience, looked at ease and relaxed, even if one or two phrases such as 'savings ratio' and talk of buying 'that new consumer durable' seemed to owe more to Westminster than to the common touch. The questions, mainly on the economy, education and health, gave Mr Major plenty of choice and opportunity to develop his themes of greater choice and opportunity in the Britain he wanted to see in the 1990s. Tory party officials have billed this and the other five or so such occasions which are planned as 'not press conferences but people conferences.' But although it was the people asking the questions, the television and lights and cameras reinforced the point made by Sir Geoffrey Pattie, the party deputy chairman, who acted as Mr Archer's warm-up man, that the meeting with Mr Major would reach 15m to 20m television viewers.</p>

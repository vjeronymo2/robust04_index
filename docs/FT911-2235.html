			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: Japanese to lift stake in Brazilian steel mill AN obstacle hindering Brazil's first significant privatisation - that of Usiminas, its largest steel mill - was removed yesterday with the signing of an accord substantially raising the equity of the company's Japanese shareholders. After months of negotiations it was agreed that Nippon Usiminas, a Nippon Steel-led consortium of 54 Japanese companies as well as the Japanese government, would have its stake in Usiminas increased from 4.6 per cent to 13 per cent. The agreement resolves years of complaints by the Japanese over the systematic reduction of their equity which, as a result of government accounting practices, was reduced from 25 per cent. Usiminas was established in 1958 as a joint Brazilian-Japanese venture to provide steel for the motor and naval industries. The Japanese put up 52 per cent of the capital and retained 40 per cent of the equity, the maximum a foreign company could hold. Nippon Steel provided the latest equipment and technical assistance making the mill the most efficient in Brazil. But government price controls on steel to subsidise other industries, and more recently to keep down inflation, prevented it becoming the profitable venture envisaged. So, as Brazil increased investment in Usiminas, the Japanese cut their participation to hold only 25 per cent of the equity. The real blow came in 1976 when all state steel companies were brought under the control of Siderbras which, through redirecting tax reimbursements, drastically reduced the equity participation of Nippon Usiminas from 25 per cent to 4.6 per cent. The story of Usiminas is seen as highlighting the problems Japanese investors have had in Brazil. 'This is Japan's saddest experience in Brazil,' said Mr Toshiro Kobayashi, president of the Council of the Bank of Tokyo and also head of the committee to promote Brazilian-Japanese relations. 'Not only was Japanese equity slashed, but because of government intervention in the steel sector Japanese investors have never received a dividend.' Consequently when Usiminas was placed top of the Collor government's targets for privatisation the Japanese threatened to block it unless their equity was increased. Yesterday's accord to raise their share to 13 per cent means the privatisation is expected to proceed in July. There is unlikely to be any Japanese interest. Mr Hiroyuki Nakagawa, president of Nippon Steel in Brazil, said, 'With price controls active I can't see any Japanese buyers. We have enjoyed nothing from our investment in Usiminas.' Last year Usiminas made a real loss despite a declared profit.</p>

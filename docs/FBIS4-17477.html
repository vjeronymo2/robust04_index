			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 21 Apr -- A session of the Crimean Supreme  Council will be held at the beginning of May, which will examine  the issue of Crimea's secession from Ukraine. This was revealed  by representatives of pro-Ukrainian organizations who arrived in  Kiev in connection with such an extraordinary development of  events. Representatives of Crimea's branches of URP [Ukrainian  Republican Party], SOU [Union of Ukrainian Officers], SUS [Union  of Ukrainian Students], Union of Ukrainian Women, the "Prosvita"  Society, societies of political prisoners and the repressed, the  Ukrainian Civil Congress of Crimea, Majlis of the Crimean Tatar  People, and organizations of the Crimean-Tatar National Movement  decided for the subsequent and probably the last time to  demonstrate their position to the president and Ukraine's  Supreme Council: "Crimea should be part of Ukraine."    Mykola Porovskyy said, as people's deputy and leader of the  Crimean branch of URP, that members of the delegation will  picket the Supreme Council during the work of Ukraine's Supreme  Council of the old convocation (from 22 April) "in order to show  the Supreme Council what the voting on Crimea's autonomy has led  to and what the consequences of the Ukrainian parliament's  policy toward Crimea are." A warning hunger strike will be held  during the picket. An appeal adopted by Crimea's pro-Ukrainian  organizations and parties demands that Crimea's autonomy and the  presidential institution be abrogated; direct presidential rule  be introduced on its territory; the full return of Crimean  Tatars and other deported peoples to their historic fatherland  be facilitated; the rights of national autonomy be granted to  them; the laws of Crimea be brought into line with Ukrainian  legislation and that its implementation be guaranteed on the  territory of the autonomy; Yuriy Meshkov and his supporters stop  aggravating inter-ethnic hostility and anti-Ukrainian hysteria;  Russian troops be withdrawn from the territory of Crimea; the  problems of the Black Sea Fleet be resolved fairly; decisions of  the Sevastopol town council concerning the Ukrainian Armed  Forces be cancelled; and that presidential and local council  elections be postponed being as they are too early.    In the event of Ukraine's Supreme Council rejecting these  demands, the appeal's authors retain the right to turn to  international human rights organizations in the West and to  resort to acts of civil disobedience.</p>

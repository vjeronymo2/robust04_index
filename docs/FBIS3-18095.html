			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kustaa Hulkko report: "Top Names To Participate in EU Data </F> Network Group"]    [Text] The EU [European Union] is beginning negotiations on  a free trade agreement with the Baltic states. At their meeting  in Brussels, the EU foreign ministers selected a number of top  names in European electronics to join a working group assigned  to develop a European data network strategy. The 19-member  working group, headed by EU Inustrial Affairs Commissioner  Martin Bangemann, will be reinforced with five top executives in  European key positions: Jan Timmer from Philips, Heinrich von  Pierer from Siemens, Carlo de Benedetti from Olivetti, Pierre  Suard from Alcatel, and Peter Bonfield from ICL.    The working group has been commissioned to prepare the  implementation of the EU white paper recommendations for  economic growth in the area of computer-based data networks.    The group includes representatives from all EU countries.  Other members are former Volvo CEO Pehr Gyllenhammar and IBM  Europe's Managing Director Hans-Olaf Henkel.  <H5>  Agreements in Baltic Countries </H5>   The EU Foreign Ministers have decided to authorize the  Commission to negotiate free trade agreements with Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania.    According to sources at the Commission, the final agreements  may vary with respect to differences in the economic development  phases between these countries with, for instance, Estonia  maintaining no customs protection.    The EU aims to follow up the free trade agreement with  association agreements, seen as preliminary stages of membership  for these East European countries. It is intended to include a  declaration to this effect in the preamble to the free trade  agreements.    The Commission's authorization for negotiations with the  Baltic states was still being hampered only last year by  Germany's wish to start discussions concerning a broader  European agreement with these states. Such an agreement would,  however, have required ratification by member states and would  probably also have postponed the implementation of the free  trade agreement to next year.    To solve this problem, it has now been decided that there  will be an interim free trade agreement as an initial step to an  additional association agreement.    The foreign ministers announced that the EU would like to  establish closer relations with Ukraine. They were concerned,  however, about the fact that this country has not yet signed the  nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Commission has been  authorized to negotiate a partnership and cooperation agreement  with Ukraine.    Negotiations on a similar agreement between the EU and  Russia  have already been going on for a long time. The lack of results  is due, among other things, to the EU's refusal to accept  essential reductions in the rights of foreign banks in Russia.  <H5>  Universal Mail </H5>   The foreign ministers confirmed formally earlier resolutions  made by the Council of Ministers in December concerning  so-called universal postal and telecommunications services. The  EU aims to ensure basic postal services in the context of postal  markets being opened to competition.    In the next stage, the Commission will define the concept of  "universal services" and other regulations for postal services.    In the area of telecommunications services, the EU aims to  ensure consumers a guaranteed minimum level of service at a  reasonable price. This means in practice that the telephone  companies would obviously be able to subsidize domestic calls  using revenue from the more profitable long-distance  communications.</p>

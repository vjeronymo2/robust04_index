			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD COUNCIL USES WINDFALL TO AVOID BUDGET SHORTFALL;  </P> <P> FINANCES: A ONE-TIME INFUSION OF $1.6 MILLION AND THE ELIMINATION OF 18 1/2  JOBS HELP THE COUNCIL BALANCE ITS BOOKS. BUT THE CITY MANAGER WARNS THAT THE  TASK WILL BE TOUGHER NEXT YEAR.  </P> <P> Oxnard City Council members on Monday came up with the money to balance a  $60-million budget for the next fiscal year but expressed fear that the  short-term financial solution may only delay future cuts in city personnel and  services.  </P> <P> The council was able to reduce a projected $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91  fiscal year with the help of about $1.6 million in one-time revenue windfalls,  including part of a rebate from the state-run public employees retirement  program.  </P> <P> As recently as a week ago, City Manager David Mora had recommended that the  city eliminate 64 positions to help avoid the projected deficit.  </P> <P> But at its special budget meeting Monday, the council was able to balance the  budget by eliminating 18 1/2 positions and making select cuts to some supplies  and services.  </P> <P> Of those full-time and part-time positions, the council decided to cut seven  from the Police Department, 5 1/2 from the Parks and Recreation Department, two  from the Finance Department and four from the Public Works Department.  </P> <P> The council spared some early targets for cuts, including the Carnegie Art  Museum, two emergency rescue squads in the Fire Department and a six-person  traffic enforcement team in the Police Department.  </P> <P> The council is expected to give final approval of the budget today.  </P> <P> But Mora predicted that the city will continue to face revenue shortfalls  during the next two years and said the council had only delayed inevitable  personnel and service cuts for a year.  </P> <P> "You will, if you don't take reductions this year, find yourself making these  reductions next year," Mora warned the council as the budget hearing began.  </P> <P> Mayor Nao Takasugi agreed after the budget meeting concluded that the council  used onetime revenue windfalls to delay inevitable budget cuts.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us are thrilled with it," he said.  </P> <P> The windfalls include a $1.4-million rebate from the state-run public employees  retirement program that the city received earlier this year. The rebate was the  result of successful investments made with the city's retirement funds.  </P> <P> The council decided Monday to spend $800,000 of the rebate toward reducing the  budget and the remaining $600,000 to avoid layoffs by continuing the salaries  of employees while they are shuffled to other city jobs.  </P> <P> The council also decided to save $337,500 by putting off a five-year,  $3-million project to remove asbestos from several city buildings. The city had  earmarked $457,000 this year to begin the project, but the council decided to  set aside only $120,000 toward removing the asbestos.  </P> <P> The city expects to gain another $200,000 next year in proceeds from  Proposition 111, a gasoline tax measure designed to provide local governments  with money to repair deteriorating streets.  </P> <P> The council also saved an additional $264,000 by funding the Economic  Development Department with money from the Redevelopment Agency, which makes  money through assessment fees, and not from the general budget.  </P> <P> The windfall revenues reduced the projected deficit by $1.6 million. The  council then pared an additional $1.2 million in reductions from a list of  possible cuts recommended by the city manager.  </P> <P> The council's personnel cuts include two landscape workers and a park ranger  from the Parks and Recreation Department; a purchasing officer and an  accounting position from the Finance Department; a records clerk, an account  clerk, a property clerk and a four-person drunk-driving task force from the  Police Department; and three street sweeping personnel and a pavement  management specialist from the Public Works Department.  </P> <P> In the past two weeks, citizens and department heads have lobbied the council  to spare programs that they feel are vital to the city.  </P> <P> The loudest outcry from the community was prompted by Mora's recommendation to  close the Carnegie Art Museum, which costs the city $140,000 a year and employs  one part-time and two full-time workers.  </P> <P> Supporters of the museum, including the Oxnard Cultural and Fine Arts  Commission, warned the council that once the museum is closed it would be  almost impossible to persuade other museums to loan art exhibits to the  Carnegie in the future.  </P> <P> Mora had also recommended eliminating the city's $398,000 annual contribution  to the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau, which employs six full-time staff  members. Instead, the council decided Monday to contribute $200,000 to operate  the bureau for six months while the city studies the possibility of adding  another 2% to the city's 9% bed tax to pay for the bureau's annual costs.  </P> <P> The council has until July 24 to place such a tax measure on the November  ballot, city officials said.  </P></p>

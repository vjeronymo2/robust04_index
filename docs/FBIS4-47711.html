			<p>BFN     [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] has expressed  disappointment at its provincial results. DP leader Zach de  Beer said at the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission]  headquarters at Gallagher's Estate that the results were much  worse than expected. He attributed his party's poor performance  to National Party [NP] propaganda which had called on the  electorate to vote for the NP to prevent domination by the  ANC-communist party alliance. He said the DP was not  considering merging with another party because there were no  other attractive prospects. The DP would continue to play an  important role as watchdog over human rights and democracy.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: The threat of October chill looms - Wall Street It has proved an uneasy truce. A little over a week ago, the resolve was there: the course was set, the direction seemed clear. So why, so soon after, are we back to that old prevaricating uncertainty, the vacillation and the lack of conviction? That question is not only being asked in US foreign policy circles, after President Bill Clinton's apparent compromise with Haiti's military leaders a week ago. The stock market, which also seemed to have achieved a new resolution, has performed a flip-flop of its own over the last 10 days. Was it really less than a fortnight ago that the Dow Jones Industrial Average put on nearly 100 points over three days to rise above 3,950, flirting with its all-time high? By midday yesterday in New York, it was back to 3,835. What went wrong? The loss of nerve (Wall Street's, that is) is the latest in a series of such twists and turns this year. Investors and traders just cannot make up their mind about how serious the threat of renewed inflation in the US economy is  -or how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be in trying to kill it off before it becomes a problem. A belief that the inflationary bogey was retreating helped fuel that earlier, brief rise in share prices. But as last week closed, the Cassandras were in the ascendant again. Foremost among the pessimists were Wayne Angell, the Bear Stearns chief economist and a former Federal Reserve Board governor, and Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman Sachs. Both said they expected another rise in US interest rates after the Federal Open Markets Committee, the key policy-making group which determines interest rate policy, meets on Tuesday. If they are right, that would make the sixth interest rate increase since the Fed started nudging rates up in February. Their views were based on such factors as the last set of producer price inflation numbers, which have been out for a fortnight, and a rise in industrial production and capacity utilisation, which was announced a week ago. Although consumer price inflation seems subdued at present, such forces will eventually feed through into higher prices in stores, the skeptics fear. Angell has also been sounding alarms all year about the rising gold price, a market indicator that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said he watches closely. Higher interest rates hurt stock prices because they reduce companies' profits, adding to the costs of servicing their debt while restraining consumer demand for their products. Also, they increase the attraction of keeping money in the bank or in short-term debt instruments, relative to holding shares. If the Fed committee does decide that rates should rise, it could, paradoxically, give the stock market something of a lift. The first two US interest rate hikes, in February and March, caught traders by surprise and devastated share prices. Since then, though, the stock market has adapted to this new phase of the market: by marking share prices down in anticipation of an interest rate rise, traders leave less room for surprise. The bad news, when it comes, is at least put behind the market. That, at least, was the reaction to the Fed's last two rate hikes, on 17 May (when the Dow jumped 50 points) and 16 August (when it rose 25 points.) Each time, it seemed that the Fed would not have to act again for some months. If rates go up for a sixth time next week, though, how confident will the market be that this time really is the last? Whatever the short-term reaction, it seems likely that the stock market will have trouble rallying much until bond investors regain some of their lost confidence. While stocks have continued to bump along close to their all-time highs, in spite of the volatility, bonds have slid steadily. At 7.8 per cent, up around 13 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point) on the week, the yield on 30-year government bonds is at its highest level since for more than two years (lower prices equate to higher yields.) At yesterday's level, the yield on long-term bonds is 3 percentage points higher than at the peak of the market's peak last October. Over the same period, the dividend yield on shares has remained essentially flat, at less than 3 per cent. As the gap between bond and equity yields widens like this, it becomes ever-harder to justify holding shares: either bond prices will have to rise (bringing the yield down,) or share prices will have to fall (lifting the dividend yield.) Against this background, warnings of a 10 per cent 'correction' (to you and me, that means fall) in share prices continue to echo around Wall Street. And, as one or two commentators are beginning to point out, it is nearly October again - the stock market's favourite month for a collapse.  ------------------------------------- Monday         3936.72  +  03.37 Tuesday        3869.09  -  67.63 Wednesday      3851.60  -  17.49 Thursday       3837.13  -  14.47 Friday         3831.75  -  05.38  -------------------------------------</p>

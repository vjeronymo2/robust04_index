			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Zhen Minwei and correspondent Wang </F> Qingqiu: "An Authoritative Study Shows: The Resumption of GATT  Membership' Will Have a Strong Impact on Shanghai's Industries"]    [Text] The footsteps of "the resumption of GATT membership"  which was once likened to a "wolf" can finally be heard clearly  now. The time of "dancing with the wolf" is no longer far away.  If so, what impact will "the resumption of GATT membership" have  on Shanghai's industries which account for 60 percent of  Shanghai's GNP? The result of an authoritative study, conducted  in Shanghai, of "the resumption of GATT membership" shows: that  "the resumption of GATT membership" will have a strong impact on  Shanghai's industries.    The Group Studying the Impact of "the Resumption of GATT  Membership" on Shanghai's "Industries and the Policy on Dealing  With the Impact," composed of experts from the city's economic  commission, foreign trade and economic relations commission, and  customs administration and 12 industrial bureaus as well as  other institutions, believes: From a long-term perspective, "the  resumption of GATT membership" is beneficial to Shanghai's  industries. However, its impact and disruptive effects will be  very strong, and the intensity involved should arouse great  attention from all sectors.    According to an analysis of 286 major products produced by  the 12 industrial bureaus, because of the effects of tariff  reductions and the abolishing of import licenses, there will be  disruptive effects and impacts on 72 percent of those products.  The most severe disruptive effects will be on such products as  the Sontana passenger car and computers and their peripheral  equipments. There will be beneficial effects on the development  of 80 products, mainly giving them price advantages.    Also, according to an analysis of 1,074 state-owned  enterprises which are supervised by the 12 industrial bureaus  (corporations) and covered by the local budget, there will  basically be no impact on 46.83 percent of the enterprises, and  there will be impacts of different intensity on 29.42 percent of  the enterprises; there will be very severe impacts on 9.86  percent of the enterprises, some of which will even close down  as a result. Those enterprises are mainly concentrated in such  industrial bureaus as the Light Industry, Textile, Medical  Supply, No 2 Light Industry, and Instrument Bureaus.    According to an investigation of 48 industries, "the  resumption of GATT membership" will have beneficial effects on  23 percent of the industries including the diesel engine,  light-industry machinery, metal-cutting machine tool, threaded  steel, refractory materials, electric lighting equipment, small  household electric appliance, and household hardware industries.  There will be large adverse impacts on such industries as the  automobile, radio and television, communication equipment,  engineering machinery, bearing, stainless steel, refrigerating  and air-conditioning equipment, wire, chemical fertilizer,  electronic parts, automation instrument, clock and watch,  household chemicals, paper-making, refrigerator, copper product,  and aluminum product industries.    Based on comprehensive and in-depth investigations, the  authoritative study group reached its conclusion on the overall  impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on the industries:  From an overall perspective, "the resumption of GATT membership"  will be beneficial to Shanghai's industries. This mainly refers  to the prospects that after "the resumption of GATT membership"  a number of Shanghai's industries which are competitive can  increase their exports; that there can also emerge a more  extensive resource-allocation environment with regard to the  provision of energy and raw materials which have all along been  in short supply; and that it will also be possible to make  stepped-up efforts to develop high- and new-technology and high  value-added industries in the next few years by exploiting the  provisions for protecting infant industries and the  most-favored-nation treatment. Even more important, "the  resumption of GATT membership" will stimulate Shanghai's  industries to accelerate their becoming capable of meeting  international standards with regard to product prices, operating  mechanisms, technological standards, and industrial structure,  thereby speeding up the movement of Shanghai's industries toward  modernization.    It is unavoidable that the high- and new-technology  industries and priority-development industries will encounter  severe challenges. Shanghai's high- and new-technology  industries and priority-development industries started late, and  are not yet in a situation characterized by economies of scale;  some of them may die young.    That long-range impacts and disruptive effects are more  severe than near-term ones will become a fact. In the near term,  Shanghai's labor-intensive products will retain some competitive  advantages on the domestic and external markets; the patents on  most imitation-based goods have already expired, and therefore  such goods can continue to be produced; some high- and  new-technology products will receive protection for a time, but  once time is up there will be growing disruptive effects on  those industries and their products.    There will be a double disruptive impact on the basic parts,  accessary, and raw materials industries. This is, on the one  hand, because of the disruptive effects on them produced by the  impact of "the resumption of GATT membership" on the main parts  industries, and, on the other hand, because of the disruptive  effects on them produced by the importation of parts,  accessaries, and raw materials after "the resumption of GATT  membership."    Nevertheless, the intensity of the disruptive effects  produced by "the resumption of GATT membership" will in the end  change with the development of the market economy. This is the  final conclusion presented by the report on that authoritative  study, carried out in Shanghai, of "the resumption of GATT  membership."</p>

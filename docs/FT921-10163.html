			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Fujimori seeks UK help on terrorism and trafficking PERU'S President Alberto Fujimori yesterday called on Britain to assist his country with its economic reconstruction and in the fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. 'The support of the United Kingdom is very important to us - perhaps they could participate even in a symbolic way at the moment to show solidarity for our situation,' Mr Fujimori said in an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Fujimori, on his first visit to London, met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, for talks at which he described Peru's economic reconstruction and stabilisation programme. He suggested Britain might give training to assist the fight against terrorism. Britain did not take part in the support group of nations, led by the US and Japan, which eased Peru's re-entry into the world financial system after the election of Mr Fujimori in 1990. Peru's economic programme won IMF approval in September last year. Mr Fujimori, who is also using his visit to highlight the environmental damage caused by the drugs trade, vigorously defended his anti-drug and anti-terrorism campaigns. 'When I took over the government the anti-drug policy was very repressive and militaristic,' he said. 'In our new strategy we do not have to fight against the farmworkers. We have to distinguish between the farmworker who is growing the coca leaf and those who process and commercialise cocaine. 'We have to gain the confidence of the farmworkers, who are actually exploited by the drug traffickers. We have to campaign to help them change,' he said. Peru produces at least 60 per cent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. Mr Fujimori admitted that corruption continued to be a problem. 'Without corruption you could not explain how drugs continued to arrive in the US. But the level of corruption has been reduced.' He also claimed progress against the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas and the MRTA (the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement), which have waged a long and bloody struggle against the Peruvian state. 'I am completely sure that I will leave Peru completely pacified,' he said, switching briefly into English 'to make matters absolutely clear.' Suspected Shining Path guerrillas rampaged through Comas, a shantytown north of Lima early yesterday, killing four people and wounding three others whom they had accused of trafficking in drugs, witnesses said, Reuter reports from Lima. The deaths brought to 39 the number of people killed in political violence around the country since Monday. More than 24,000 people have died in political violence since the Shining Path took up arms in 1980.</p>

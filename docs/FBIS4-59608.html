			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  renewed his call to Yemeni leaders to stop the fighting and  resort to dialogue, stressing that war solves nothing.    In a statement to be published in the 16 May issue of the  newspaper MAYU, President Mubarak said: Stop the fighting. War  terminates unity; it does not preserve it. The Yemeni people  are paying the price with their own blood and their vital  installations, which are being destroyed. War will solve no  problem anywhere, even if one side triumphs over another. The  basis is always dialogue.    He added: We have always advised them not to resort to  military force. We said unity must be achieved with the consent  of the people.    Regarding the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, President Mubarak  said:  The Palestinian people are happy with this agreement. We are  also happy to see that our Palestinian brothers have begun to  restore their land and return to it in accordance with this  agreement, which was the result of long and exhausting talks.    Referring to the crisis that occurred during the signing  ceremony for the agreement in Cairo on 4 May, Mubarak said:  What happened on the day of the signing of the agreement in  Cairo--the dispute over the maps, their not being signed, and  then our return to the stage after bridging the gaps--is the  most eloquent proof of the efforts we all exerted and the  strenuous talks that ended with the signing of the agreement.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Board changes at Eurocopy BOARD CHANGES were announced yesterday at Eurocopy, the photocopier distributor which was recently the target of an Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the selling practices of some subsidiaries. The company, which was allowed to retain its consumer credit licences after a four-month OFT inquiry, said yesterday that Mr John Bedford, the company secretary, Mr Robin Gilmore, group treasurer, and Mr Hugh Wilson, managing director of Purdie and Kirkpatrick, Eurocopy's Scottish subsidiary, would be leaving the company with immediate effect. Purdie and Kirkpatrick, acquired in 1989, had been singled out by Sir Gordon Borrie, director general of the OFT, for special criticism in the inquiry. However, he acknowledged that Eurocopy had taken steps to reform selling practices at the subsidiary before the inquiry began.</p>

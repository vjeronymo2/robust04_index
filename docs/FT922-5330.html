			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Germany delays final decision on European Fighter Aircraft project SUPPORTERS of the Pounds 21bn European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project within the German government have won a one-month delay in the final decision on whether to pull out of the deal. Postponement of a key parliamentary meeting this week will give Mr John Major, the British prime minister, a chance to persuade Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the German leader, not to abandon Britain, Italy and Spain in the joint production of the aircraft. The two meet for an informal summit in Bonn on Friday. It will also give the German aerospace industry, led by the Daimler-Benz subsidiary Deutsche Aerospace, a last chance to lobby for the deal. Mr Volker Ruhe, the new German defence minister, is known to be highly sceptical about going ahead with such a sophisticated fly-by-wire fighter when his budget is under severe pressure. He has called for drastic price cuts if the aircraft is to be financed within the DM12bn (Pounds 4bn) set aside in his long-term budget. The chances of ensuring German participation still look exceedingly slim. Most politicians in Bonn doubt the project can win majority support in the German parliament because of the present climate of budget stringency to finance unification. A final meeting takes place today of the six-member working group of defence experts drawn from the German coalition government, which includes the Christian Democrats (CDU), the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Free Democrats (FDP). It will produce a report comparing all possible alternatives to EFA, such as the US F-16 and F-18 fighters, the Swedish Gripen, and the Russian MiG-29, but making no rigid recommendation. The key meeting of CDU and CSU parliamentarians, scheduled for tomorrow, at which Mr Ruhe was due to make his own recommendation, has been postponed until June 16. The deadline for a final decision is now July 1, when the 1993 draft budget has to be presented to the German cabinet. The delay was agreed last week at a meeting of leaders of the CDU and CSU chaired by Mr Kohl, and involving Mr Ruhe, Mr Theo Waigel, the CSU leader and finance minister, and Mr Mac Streibl, the Bavarian prime minister. The Bavarian-based CSU is a strong champion of the EFA, which would be built largely by the southern German aerospace industry. According to reports of the meeting, Mr Ruhe was attacked sharply by the CSU leaders for letting it be known that he wants to abandon the project. They argued that such a decision would undermine Germany's international credibility, and deal a devastating blow to the country's aerospace industry. Mr Kohl agreed to put off this week's meeting, giving himself a chance to discuss the project with Mr Major, and by telephone with Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister. The EFA project - whose principal contractors are British Aerospace, Alenia of Italy, Spain's CASA, and Deutsche Aerospace - is supposed to move from its present development phase to the pre-production phase next year. The issue has been brought to a head early in Germany by the need to include DM100m in next year's budget for the pre-production phase.</p>

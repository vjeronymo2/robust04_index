			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> GEORGIA SATELLITES HAVE YET TO REACH POTENTIAL  </P> <P> Despite the unaffected good-rockin' they may represent, the sad truth is that  most actual bar bands are numbingly commonplace.  </P> <P> Certainly some groups elevate party music to a high art, but the Georgia  Satellites at first didn't seem to be one of them.  </P> <P> When this band hit in 1986, it seemed unworthy of the attention brought by its  left-field hit "Keep Your Hands to Yourself."  </P> <P> The Satellites' Saturday Coach House show, however, had moments that suggested  the quartet may yet attain the sublime.  </P> <P> While the songwriting, singing and playing that went into the 24-song show  didn't offer much in the way of individuality or virtuosity, some points go to  Rick Richards for his snarling slide guitar work, which helped pump plenty of  spirit into several of the songs.  </P> <P> The Beatles' "Don't Pass Me By" became a hard-rocking hot rod in their hands,  matched by their own "Shake That Thing" and "Saddle Up."  </P> <P> Richards fronted a smoldering ballad version of the current "All Over but the  Cryin' " while co-singer/guitarist Dan Baird led an uproarious, free-flying  "Dan Takes Five."  </P> <P> If more of the band's delivery was as unfettered, the Satellites might vie for  greatness, but those moments were spread thin over a two-hour show.  </P> <P> And it was ultimately fatiguing hearing a group whose cultural matrix begins  and ends with the Faces.

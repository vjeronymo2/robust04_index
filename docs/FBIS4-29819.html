			<p>BFN     [Text] In yet another confidence-building pitch for  foreign investments, the Monetary Board (MB) last Friday  approved the complete lifting of existing restrictions on  repayment and repatriation of foreign investments financed by  transactions using the debt-to-equity scheme.    In a press statement, Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] Governor  Gabriel C. Singson said the move "marks another important step  in foreign exchange liberalization."    Considered the most successful mode of easing the country's  debt burden, the debt-to-equity program has historically  accounted for about 30 percent of the total external debt which  has undergone restructuring. Debt converted under the program  reached $1.87 billion out of the total $6.382 billion recorded  from 1986 to 1993, the Bangko Sentral's 1993 annual report shows.    The debt-to-equity program was launched in 1985 as a  mechanism to reduce the country's external debt and to encourage  the entry of the then elusive foreign investments. Under the  program, investors are allowed to buy Philippine debt papers,  redeem these at a higher price and invest the proceeds in  eligible projects.    The investor gains from the spread between the redemption  price at which he sells the paper to the Bangko Sentral and the  price at which he buys it from the secondary market.    The program also augurs well for the Bangko Sentral as it is  able to retire its debt at deep discounts. The mechanism was  revised in 1990 particularly to retire the then Central Bank's  $900-million outstanding obligations to foreign banks over a  three-year period which ended last year.    The MB decided to defer the program in September 1993 due to  low investors' interest during the eight auctions as a result of  the steadily declining discounts on Philippine debt paper in the  secondary market. The MB, however, resumed the program's  implementation in January this year.    At present, outstanding registered foreign investments under  the program amount to about $398 million.    Prior to the liberalization, investments under the  conversion  program were subject to a restrictive repayment schedule.  "Principal capital originally could not be repatriated except on  a five-year staggered basis commencing not earlier than three or  five years after the original investment was made, depending on  whether it is classified as preferred or less preferred  investment. For a less preferred investment, dividends were  also subject to a four-year freeze period," the Bangko Sentral  said.    Mr. Singson said the move was likewise aimed at easing the  continuing upsurge in dollar inflows which has been buoying up  the peso exchange value since the first quarter of this year.    With the dwindling amount of foreign investments utilizing  the debt-to-equity approach, some bankers doubted whether the  volume of dollars that will be siphoned out from the system via  the scheme will be that significant.    A chief executive officer of one of the resident foreign  banks in the country told BUSINESS WORLD while the move sends a  positive signal to foreign investors, it remains to be seen  whether others at this stage would want to sell out with the  relaxation in the repayment of dividends.    "It usually takes time to find corporate buyers so the  reaction time will be long," he said.</p>

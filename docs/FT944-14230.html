			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting lifts Kao in first half Kao, Japan's leading maker of household products, has reported a rise in profits for the first half of the year, helped by cost-cutting and the success of new products. Demand for a new cosmetics line, gift soaps and a new floor cleaning fluid, helped sales rise by 2.1 per cent to Y322.5bn (Dollars 3.3bn) in the six months to September. Recurring profits, before extraordinary items and tax, rose more steeply, by 12 per cent to Y25.76bn. Sales of laundry and cleansing products, Kao's largest sector, worth nearly 40 per cent of turnover, rose to Y127.6bn from Y123.9bn, while sales of personal care products, 35.5 per cent of the total, rose slightly to Y114.5bn. Results for some skin care products, a market where price cutting is rife, fell by comparison with last year. Overall operating profits rose 8 per cent to Y27bn in the interim period. Operating margins were a record 8.4 per cent of turnover. Kao has been one of the few Japanese companies to keep profits and margins rising through the recession. This is partly a result of cost reductions and the rapidity of new product releases. First-half earnings per share rose 4.1 per cent to Y21.11.</p>

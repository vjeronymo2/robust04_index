			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Labour sees recession as its election winner THE LABOUR leadership yesterday insisted that the recession would win the general election for the party, in spite of weekend opinion polls showing it neck and neck with the Tories. Senior Labour spokesmen refused to appear disappointed by the opinion polls carried out late last week. Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, said the party's current level of support was 'a very good platform from which to work.' The economy has become the central part of Labour's campaign. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, is expected to use reports of Treasury briefing papers arguing that Britain should not pay more to the European Community because of its lower relative prosperity to fuel further attacks on economic mismanagement by the government. Senior Tories expressed relief yesterday, however, that Labour had failed to establish a lead in spite of the gloomy economic statistics. Both Labour and the Conservatives are anxious to ensure that their opponents do not manage to pull away in the opinion polls and begin an unstoppable 'bandwagon' effect. The Harris poll for the Observer, conducted last Wednesday and Thursday, put Labour on 40 per cent and the Tories on 39 per cent. An ICM poll for the Sunday Express, carried out after Thursday's sharp rise in unemployment figures, put Labour on 39 per cent and the Conservatives on 40 per cent. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, yesterday retaliated by saying that lower inflation and mortgage interest rates were boosting real incomes. Mr Norman Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, urged Mr Major to concentrate on Conservative strengths such as the economy, defence and foreign affairs and pledge to cut taxes. He should not worry about pleasing all voters, Mr Tebbit said on BBC television. 'What he wants is that extra 2 or 3 per cent above what he's got now. One has to upset some people.' Meanwhile, Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour foreign affairs spokesman, said private Labour polls showed the party 'has been substantially ahead for months'. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, blamed the Tories' US-style 'negative campaigning' for his party's failure to establish a convincing lead. It was 'the reaction of a Tory party on the verge of defeat'. He said on London Weekend Television: 'We will catch up, overtake and move further forward in the weeks ahead as the true horror of the recession . . . sinks into the public mind.'</p>

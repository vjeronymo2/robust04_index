			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Beverley's reverse takeover by FEC collapses The proposed reverse takeover of Beverley Group by Hong Kong-based Far East Consortium has collapsed, after FEC terminated a provisional agreement to swap a Chinese boiler manufacturing subsidiary for a majority shareholding. Beverley gave no explanation for the move, which follows more than three months of negotiations. The deal would have provided Beverley with its sole source of earnings. FEC is controlled by the family of Mr Deacon Chiu, who built up a conglomerate around a network of cinemas and property developments, but became entangled in a series of legal battles. In 1993, he had 14 charges of false accounting dropped against him, after he was found unfit for trial due to senile dementia. Shareholders still voted for him to retain his post as chairman. In September that year, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange expressed 'major concerns' over a property sale to Far East Hotels, a FEC group company. The deal would have netted a HKDollars 506m (Pounds 41m) profit for Mr Chiu's son Derek in less than a year, but the sale was withdrawn. And last December, Hong Kong's Commercial Crime Bureau raided the FEC group offices, in connection with a government investigation into the 1990 buy-out of Alan Bond's Bond Corporation International Ltd. No charges have been brought. Beverley's purchase of Pegasus, which owns 51 per cent of a Guangzhou (Canton) boiler manufacturer, was to have provided access to a high growth market, and a positive cash flow. Beverley's 1993 accounts were qualified, as its auditors were 'unable to provide confirmation that it will have sufficient facilities to cover future working capital'. Its shares will remain suspended, and the company is looking at alternative means of raising finance.</p>

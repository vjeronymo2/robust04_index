			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has not promulgated regulations providing more specific EPA rules regarding determination of model year. Instead, EPA has historically relied on Advisory Circulars to clarify agency policy on the determination of model year and has used these policies and definitions in the enforcement of Federal programs such as vehicle certification. The first guidance regarding model year was issued on March 27, 1972 (Mobile Source Pollution Control Program (MSPC) Advisory Circular 6). This guidance was revised by MSPC Advisory Circular 6A (September 1, 1972). The most recent iteration of this guidance was issued on December 31, 1987 (EPA Office of Mobile Sources Advisory Circular 6B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. New York and Massachusetts Litigations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While Advisory Circulars have been an adequate mechanism for the purposes of establishing Agency policies and using such policies for enforcement matters, the fact that EPA relies on Advisory Circulars in addition to its regulations has been an issue in litigation challenging the adoption of the California LEV program by New York and Massachusetts. Section 177 states that the term ``model year'' shall be ``as determined by regulations of the Administrator.'' In the New York litigation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NYDEC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 17 F. 3d 521 (2d Cir. 1994), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined that the Advisory Circulars were not entitled to the deference normally provided to Agency decisions under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chevron U.S.A. Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Natural Resources Defense Counsel,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). The Second Circuit found that the circulars were not ``regulations'' required under section 177 and were, in any case, not prepared specifically to implement section 177. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The court also found that application of Advisory Circular 6B to section 177 was ``newly minted'' for the New York litigation, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and thus was entitled to little deference. The court then provided its own opinion regarding the most appropriate interpretation of the term ``model year'' in the section 177 context, and found that ``absent promulgated EPA regulations, `model year' is best read as applying on an industry-wide basis.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> at 535. As discussed below, the Second Circuit based its opinion on the perceived practical problems that would occur if ``model year'' were defined by engine family, rather than industry-wide, given the existence of the NMOG fleet averaging program, as well as questions regarding Congressional intent, industry confusion and enforceability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 75 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency had filed an  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> amicus curiae  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> brief in this case, as well as in the Massachusetts case, that argued that the Agency's decision, as delineated in the Advisory Circulars, was entitled to Chevron deference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As shown in the Massachusetts case, discussed below, this determination was factually incorrect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Massachusetts litigation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> AAMA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Greenbaum,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No. 93&hyph;2276 (1st Cir., Aug. 3, 1994), the First Circuit decided not to follow the lead of the Second Circuit, and instead upheld the EPA's implementation of ``model year,'' as delineated in Advisory Circular 6B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> slip op. at 11&hyph;24. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, the First Circuit noted that an argument could be raised that the EPA Advisory Circular is owed no deference because section 177 specifically requires EPA to define ``model year'' by regulation, not policy statements. The First Circuit found that since plaintiffs had not raised the argument in earlier proceedings, it was precluded from raising the issue in its appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In so doing, the First Circuit noted that the EPA's policy had not been newly minted for these litigations, but had been issued in 1987 and had been applied to section 177 in a letter to Congressman John Dingell (D. Mich.) on March 7, 1991, prior to litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Judicial review of this issue has thus resulted in contrary results from the two courts of Appeals that have ruled on the matter. However, while there was division in the circuit courts as to the final result, both courts commented on the lack of EPA regulations that define model year for the purpose of determining compliance with section 177. Though EPA continues to believe that the existing regulations and Advisory Circulars are entitled to Chevron deference, EPA is proposing new regulations specifying its definition of model year as that term is used in section 177 of the Act in an effort to remove further confusion regarding this issue and to provide national consistency. EPA is also proposing to apply these regulations to ``model year'' as that term is used for regulation of motor vehicles under Part A of Title II of the Act. EPA is not proposing to extend this determination at this time to regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles, which may require somewhat different provisions for ``model year.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Determination of Model Year <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The determination EPA is proposing today for implementation of section 177 shall include the regulatory definition of model year as that term has been defined under section 202 of the Act. It shall also include the more specific determinations regarding model year, including the definition of ``production period,'' delineated in Advisory Circular 6B (Dec. 31, 1987). This Advisory Circular addresses the duration of model year, defines production period and provides information on EPA policy concerning the duration and applicability of certificates of conformity. It notes that a specific model year must include January 1 of the calendar year for which it is designated and may not include a January 1 of any other calendar year, thus limiting the duration of a model year to a calendar year plus 364 days. In addition, Advisory Circular 6B defines ``annual production period'' for any specific model within an engine family of light-duty vehicles or heavy-duty engines as beginning either:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ``(1) When such vehicle or engine is first produced, or (2) on January 2 of the calendar year preceding the year for which the model year is designated, whichever date is later.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The annual production period ends either: (1) when the last such vehicle or engine is produced, or (2) on December 31 of the calendar year for which the model year is named, whichever date is sooner.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes that the definitions of ``duration of model year'' and ``production period for specific models within an engine family'' which are contained in Advisory Circular 6B are the appropriate definitions to be used to determine compliance with section 177 as well as to determine compliance with the programs for which the Advisory Circular has been used in the past. EPA believes these definitions, and the fact that the production period is based on specific models within engine families, provide vehicle manufacturers the maximum flexibility in terms of adjusting the model year designation of their product line to marketing needs and product changes. By permitting the designation of specific engine families, or models within families, as ``pull ahead'' model year families without affecting the remainder of the vehicles in the model year they are presently building, a manufacturer will be able, for example, to launch a new vehicle as a 1995 model year vehicle while the remainder of their models are being produced as 1994 models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

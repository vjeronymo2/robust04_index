			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: SE Banken The gloom surrounding Nordic banking is lifting as quickly as it descended, judging by SE Banken's first-half results. It is a measure of the renewed confidence that Sweden's biggest commercial bank is launching a SKr5.3bn rights issue and has withdrawn its request for state support after just nine months. The 11-fold rise in SE Banken's shares since April now looks to have firmer foundations. The rights issue will significantly bolster SE Banken's balance sheet and move it away from the danger zone: its problem loans threatened to push the bank below international capital adequacy standards. At an operating level, it is showing a marked improvement in earnings. Sweden's lowest interest rates since the 1970s have certainly helped, but SE Banken has also made useful gains in securities and foreign exchange. Costs are now 2.5 per cent lower than a year ago, although the full extent of the rationalisation is masked by the krona's devaluation. Still, it would be dangerous to get swept away. SE Banken's problem loans are horrific and credit losses may amount to as much as SKr11bn this year. And while banks across the world have found it easy to justify wider margins while recession lingers, the trick will be to maintain them when recovery takes hold.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The friendly association of Siberian Cossacks in  Kazakhstan has forwarded a protest to President Nursultan  Nazarbayev due to the "soft genocide" with respect to the  Cossacks living on the territory of this Republic and violation  of Russian-speaking population rights pursued by the Kazakh  leadership.    The document states that the republic denies the fact of  existence of a multi-million Cossack population in Kazakhstan.  The arrest of Boris Suprunuyk, one of the leaders of the  Russian community in North Kazakhstan who repeatedly spoke  against the infringement of the rights of the Russian-speaking  population in Kazakhstan was the major premise of this statement.    The document underlined that the Cossacks are ready to hold  a  dialogue with the authorities regarding the provisions of  registration of the Cossack communities and granting an official  status of a public organization to Cossacks, however, "the  Republic associates the notion Cossacks with separatism."    The statement, in particular, reports that during the  celebration of a Moslem holiday in the Cossack villages of  Pokatilovka and Topolevka in the Taldy-Kurgan region the Kazakh  nationalists destroyed the house of one of the leaders of the  Cossacks threatening to cut all Cossacks. The interior forces  blocked these populated centers and nobody was allowed to the  place of this incident.    In order to learn the details of this incident a delegation  of Cossacks headed for these Cossack villages from Taldy-Kurgan,  but the employees of the State Road Inspectorate detained them  explaining this by the need to verify their documents and then  arrested them for 10 days.    On 5 April another 25-strong group of Cossacks again  endeavored to go to these Cossack villages in order to  investigate the circumstances of this incident. However, they  were met by a reinforced militia post and accompanied to the  city of Sarkand in the Taldy-Kurgan region. On their way to  Sarkand as many as 50 Kazakh nationalists, 20 mounted and 30  foot people made an attempt to seize the bus with the Cossacks.  Some of the attackers had hunter guns. The Cossacks were  detained in the city, several of them were arrested for seven-10  days and accused of the organization of an unauthorized meeting.    The board of the friendly association and the council of the  Atamans of the Siberian Cossacks believe that these actions of  the Taldy-Kurgan region's administration deliberately provoke  further aggravation of inter-ethnic relations between Russian  Cossacks and Kazakhs.    The statement contains a demand to the Kazakh president, as  the guarantor of rights and freedoms of the Republic's citizens,  to adopt urgent measures in order to prevent any demonstrations  of nationalism and lawlessness with respect to Cossacks and to  punish the guilty.</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / International and Government Bonds: Long gilts make up ground as sterling bounces back LONGER-dated UK govern-ment securities surged ahead by nearly 1 1/2 percentage points in highly volatile trading yesterday as sterling bounced back from its recent lows. Having missed out on the recent rally in other European bond markets, gilts made up much of their lost ground. The benchmark 2003/07, which finished before the new year at 113 15/32 , moved to 114 29/32 . Traders attributed much of the turn-round to a determined performance by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in a radio interview. This eased concerns about a possible interest rate rise, helping sterling climb back comfortably above 2.85 against the D-Mark. The surge caught many traders with short positions, and the rush to reverse them accounted for much of the volatility, observers said. In a relatively busy day for the futures market, with nearly 32,000 long gilts contracts traded on Liffe, the March futures contract climbed from 95.20 to 97.00, before easing to 96.27 in reaction to US weakness. GERMAN government bonds firmed slightly despite the announcement of the first full issue of the German unity fund since last September. The wider spread between German interest rates and those of the US and Japan helped fuel retail interest, and accounted for the strength of the market. Bids for the latest unity fund bonds, which are offered at 100.40 with a coupon of 8 per cent to yield 7.94 per cent, are due today. Traders expected strong demand, although some said the take-up was likely to be closer to DM8bn than the DM10bn some had expected. While bunds rose in the cash market, the futures market fell on some profit taking. DESPITE some mixed economic statistics, bond prices in New York were generally lower yesterday. The US labour department reported that initial claims for state unemployment insurance fell 29,000 to 438,000 in the week ended December 21 - in sharp contrast to economists' predictions of a 5,000-claim rise. Within half-an-hour, however, this news was counteracted by publication of the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for December. This showed a marked slump, to 46.5 per cent, the first time it has fallen below 50 per cent - which indicates a decline in manufacturing - since May. The net result was to leave longer-dated issues down by almost a full point at midday, although below their lows for the morning. The benchmark long bond showed a loss of  27/32 at 106 9/32 , yielding 7.460 per cent. THE Ecu bond market made an encouraging start to the year, registering the first new issue of 1992, an Ecu200m Eurobond offering for Canada's Export Development Corporation. The two-year deal carries a coupon of 9 per cent, and is designed to appeal to retail investors, who like short-dated paper, particularly when there is an inverted yield curve. In addition, some central banks and money market funds were said to be buyers of the triple-A rated paper. More short-dated Ecu deals could follow if arbitrage opportunities persist. The EDC deal was swapped into floating-rate dollars. The deal was held in syndicate overnight. Demand in the Ecu sector is concentrated at the short end of the market, where rates are relatively high, and at the very long end.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEFILE  </P> <P> Powers Boothe will play Jessica Lange's extramarital lover in Orion's "Blue  Sky," a drama directed by Tony Richardson, that takes place on a southern Army  base in the 1950s. The Bob Solo production, which also stars Tommy Lee Jones as  Lange's husband, gets under way this month in Alabama and Florida.  </P> <P> Pamela Reed will play Arnold Schwarzenegger's partner in Universal's  'Kindergarten Cop." Ivan Reitman directs this story of a hard-bitten cop who  goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to keep track of a drug kingpin's  wife and child. Filming gets under way in June in Oregon and L.A.  </P> <P> Rob Lowe, F. Murray Abraham and Juergen Prochnow play the men in Helena  Rubenstein's early life and Shelley Winters the Jewish shopkeeper who first  employs her in "Helena," a Cosfilm production shooting in Poland, New Zealand  and Australia starting July 16. The film is based on Paul-Loup Sulitzer's novel  "Hannah," a fictionalized account of her life, which was a best seller in  France. Producer-director Georges-Alain Vuille is still looking for his leading  actress.  </P> <P> James Edward Olmos will star in and Luis Valdez will direct "Bless Me, Ultima,"  a film version of Rudolfo Anaya's famous novel of New Mexico set in 1945, the  era of the A-bomb. Moctesuma Esparza and Robert Katz will produce from a script  written by Valdez and Vincent Gutierrez. Production gets under way in New  Mexico this fall.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Esparza/Katz Prods. has cast Australian pop singing star and actress  Kylie Minogue in "Most Wanted," a '30s gangster tale written by Dick Guttman.  Sam Pillsbury will direct in North Carolina in the fall. Negotiations are under  way for a U.S. distributor on both films.  </P> <P> Rod Steiger and Joanna Pacula join previously announced Timothy Bottoms and Pat  Morita in Gold Leaf International's thriller "The Ice Runner," which films in  Murmansk in the Soviet Union in late June. Jeffrey Sneller produces and James  Fargo directs. Meanwhile, Fargo has bowed out of Eagle Films' "Deadly  Crossing," a thriller about a giant snake in the Amazon, which will shoot in  Florida in September. British director Peter Hunt takes over.  </P> <P> Barry Primus joins the cast of writer-director Irwin Winkler's "Fear No Evil"  (due for a title change), a drama about the Red scare era in Hollywood. Primus  plays the agent for Robert De Niro who portrays a successful director who finds  himself blacklisted. Ben Piazza has also been cast to play movie mogul Darryl  F. Zanuck.  </P> <P> The Oscar-winning "My Left Foot" provides plenty of kick for any project to  which its writer-director, Jim Sheridan, attaches his name. By agreeing to  serve as "story consultant" on "Illegals" -- a film written and to be directed  by Nye Heron, his assistant on "My Left Foot" -- the project raised enough  money in the U.S. and Europe to begin production in mid-July in the Bronx. The  Mike George Production tells of a romance between two illegal immigrants, an  Irish lad and a Dominican woman. KIRK HONEYCUTT  </P></p>

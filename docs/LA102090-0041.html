			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HAHN IN GOOD CONDITION AFTER BEING  HOSPITALIZED  </P> <P> Veteran Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn was hospitalized Friday  complaining of "chest discomfort," an aide said. He was in good condition in  the cardiac care unit at Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood.  </P> <P> Hahn, 70, who suffered a stroke in 1987 that left him partly paralyzed, was  taken by his county driver to the hospital "for precautionary reasons," said  Hahn spokeswoman Lynn Sakamoto.  </P> <P> Hahn missed work Monday and Tuesday complaining of flu-like symptoms, but  briefly attended Thursday morning's board meeting. The supervisor will undergo  tests and remain at the hospital a few days, Sakamoto said.  </P> <P> Sakamoto described Hahn as alert and said that he sent word from his hospital  bed through an aide for her to prepare a news release applauding the board vote  Thursday to impose restrictions on wood roofs, something Hahn has long sought.  </P></p>

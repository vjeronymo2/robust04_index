			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / International Company News: First-half shortfall at Airtours reduced AIRTOURS, the UK's third-largest package holiday company, yesterday reported reduced first-half losses after a sharp rise in sales during winter. Mr David Crossland, chairman, said the summer holiday market as a whole for the year to May had increased 20 per cent, the first growth in two years, and that the winter market had also grown - by 8.3 per cent in the year to end-March - for the first time since the 1988-1989 season. Holiday bookings at Airtours in April and May were higher than in the same period last year, but the first two weeks of June had been weak with volumes maintained but at the expense of lower margins. Airtours' summer bookings were 31 per cent ahead of last year following a 30 per cent increase in the number of holidays on offer. Mr Crossland said Airtours had taken a large slice of the market left when Mr Harry Goodman's International Leisure Group collapsed last year. The company remained as dependent as ever on margins that could be attainable in the late booking market, he said. The results suggested that in spite of the recession, holidays were among the last non-essential costs to be cut. In the six months to the end of March, Airtours increased the number of passengers carried by 77 per cent and its sales by 83 per cent to Pounds 101.55m. UK holiday companies traditionally make losses in the first half as they pre-pay certain of their summer season costs. But, in spite of the jump in sales, Airtours cut its losses to Pounds 5.59m from Pounds 6.21m. This loss included for the first time a seasonal loss on its leased aircraft fleet and Pounds 1.1m in start-up costs on the introduction of three aircraft. The company will pay a 0.55p dividend, up 10 per cent on last year, while the loss per share fell to 4.29p.</p>

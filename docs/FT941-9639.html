			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / MPs confront a Scottish ghost: The start of a probe into the local enterprise bodies beset by controversy Those who preside over training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in England frequently complain that their organisations have too low a profile. That lament is unlikely to be heard from their Scottish equivalents, the local enterprise companies (Lecs). For the past year the 22 Lecs and their parent bodies have rarely been out of the news. In Glasgow today the Commons Scottish committee opens its inquiry into Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Lecs. Critics accuse the Scottish Enterprise network of being unaccountable, secretive, and wasteful. They allege mismanagement and conflicts of interest in the Lecs. Scottish Enterprise however, welcomes the inquiry and claims to have lobbied for it in order to rebut criticisms. It believes the critics are ignoring a success story. The Lecs arose out of a decentralisation of existing bodies, the Scottish Development Agency and the Highlands and Islands Development Board, formed in the 1970s. This meant that while the Lecs took on training functions, they also inherited the economic development roles of the old bodies. Unlike the English Tecs which stand on their own, the Lecs have parent bodies in the enterprise bodies, which disburse money to them and act as a buffer between them and the Scottish Office. They are expected to follow strategy set by their parent bodies. The creation of a network of local economic development bodies, spending more than Pounds 500m a year, has led to an upsurge in economic activity. For example in Edinburgh, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise has pushed through projects such as the new Festival Theatre, while Lanarkshire Enterprise is spearheading regeneration after the closure of the Ravenscraig steel works. But officials at Scottish Enterprise headquarters in Glasgow admit that the performance of the Lecs has been uneven. Trouble first emerged a year ago in Dumfries and Galloway Enterprise after criticisms of its chief executive. Then the Scottish media focused on potential conflicts of interest between the business affairs of the Lecs' unpaid directors - almost all of whom come from the private sector - and decisions taken by the Lec boards. No case of impropriety was discovered, but Scottish Enterprise has laid down that directors' interests must all be publicly disclosed. The only case of the many allegations which Scottish Enterprise has had to investigate where a clear breach of procedure occurred involved a Lec chief executive, who resigned last month over an undeclared conflict of interest. Mr Henry McLeish MP, a Labour Scottish affairs spokesman, says conflicts of interest are 'only a by-product of a system that is fundamentally flawed'. He complains that the status of Lecs as private companies enables them to keep many of their transactions secret and prevents them being publicly accountable - in spite of their public funding. A survey of company directors showed that a majority felt the Lecs were not providing value for money in economic development, and that they were altogether less effective than the defunct Scottish Development Agency. The legacy of the agency bedevils the Scottish Enterprise network. Its creation was partly motivated by the Conservatives' desire to obliterate a Labour creation. Critics of Scottish Enterprise would like the core body to be a more powerful relative to the Lecs. But others, such as the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, would like a strengthening of the Lecs at the expense of the core body. The Commons committee must grapple with conflicts such as these and others which have plagued Scottish Enterprise from the start. Supporters hope the inquiry will finally establish the legitimacy of Scottish Enterprise and lay to rest the ghost of the development agency.</p>

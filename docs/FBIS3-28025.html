The South Korean puppets detained them, not sending them  back  to the North instantly, and tried to make them defect to South  Korea by all sorts of appeasement and deception. They, however,  could not break the revolutionary constancy and will of the  a-match-for-a-hundred soldiers who have grown in the bosom of  comrade supreme commander.    The South Korean puppets were compelled to send them back to  the Northern half of the country by the stubborn protest of the  detained soldiers and repeated demand of our side.    The soldiers were interviewed by reporters in our side's  portion of Panmunjom.    They exposed the attempts of the South Korean puppets to  induce them to defection. Saying that they could be embraced in  the bosom of the socialist homeland as there was comrade supreme  commander for them, they stated they would be loyal subjects and  filial sons safeguarding comrade supreme commander as his rifles  and shells.</p>

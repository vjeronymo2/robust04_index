			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Jobs: Why big companies are short of new ideas - The double set of mufflers that stop senior executives' eardrums from hearing any surprises WHO precisely first coined the phrase, no one the Jobs column has ever met could identify. But whoever it was deserves an honoured place in dictionaries of quotations. For, of all the multitudinous maxims uttered these past 2,500 years on how to survive in an organisational setting, none is more cogent than the phrase in question. It states: Never surprise a vice-president] While transatlantic in idiom - it was apparently coined by somebody in American Telephone and Telegraph - the phrase clearly has universal force. Moreover, the inadvisability of springing surprises applies not only to bosses as high as vice-president or the equivalent, but to many if not most ranked lower down. So in an attempt to convey the wider scope of the message I've reformulated it in more general terms as one of the Laws of Organisational Stupidity, calling it after Professor Iain Mangham of Bath University's management school who introduced me to the original in the 1970s. In the wider version, which goes under the name Mangham's Muffler, it says: When communicating to superiors, new news is bad news. Since first hearing of the rule, I've seen it borne out too often for its workings to be any longer a surprise to me. The explanation seems to be that aspiring bosses have a psychological need not only to possess the power to tell others what to do, but to feel they hold it by natural right. Hence they tend to believe deep down that they are endowed with such superior faculties that they are sure to learn of anything worth knowing before it could ever occur to anyone of lesser status. What has surprised me even after all these years, however, is the strength with which the topmost rankers defend themselves against the possibility of being forced to recognise otherwise. That revelation comes as a result of my discussion two weeks ago of the problem senior executives' secretaries pose for the growing numbers of displaced managers who now have little chance of re-employment unless they can win the ear of someone empowered to hire them. In the hope of helping to put unused skills back to work, I passed on a couple of hints from a consultant in New York on how to bypass the secretarial gatekeepers. One such hint was to dodge round their blocking question - What's it about, please? - by misplacing the word 'not' in your answer. To illustrate: if you're out of work after a time in Germany and aim to persuade some chief who's a total stranger to hire you as a representative there, the reply to the gatekeeper might be: 'We've met before but not for some time. I've been working in Germany, and there's a business opportunity I know he would be interested in.' Then, on getting through to the chief and being asked how you know each other, you say: 'Sorry? I didn't say we did. What I said was we've not met before. But for some time I've been working in Germany . . .' Readers' responses, often vehement as well as extensive, have come from several angles. For example, half a dozen outplacement consultants and four of the executive-selection variety have accused me of advocating the seriously dishonest practice of approaching employers with bogus propositions. That's a bit steep. The article a fortnight ago expressly stated: '. . . it is of course imperative to have done your homework on the target company and executive, and the idea you're proposing, as well as ensuring that every checkable fact you voice is true.' In other words, any proposals made must be genuine. Even so, given the numbers unemployed and the barriers in the way of their recovery, I see no cardinal sin in practising mild deception to get honest proposals a serious hearing. Nor am I alone in doing so. In the circumstances, even the stern philosopher Hobbes would have forgiven it. On reflection, however, I agree that the reproving out-placers are right to say that 'networking' is a more promising as well as less deceitful method. It is defined by one of them as: 'making new contacts via referrals from existing contacts and genuinely asking for advice and NOT for a job. The aim of a network meeting is referral to more contacts. Keeping the network 'alive' over a period of weeks results in a whole series of people you do not now know positively thinking of you when they might hear of a job.' Nevertheless my conversion to networking is not because of its philosophical merits, but strictly on practical grounds. The reason lies in the dozen responses from readers who actually work in the aforesaid gatekeeping capacity. For their letters have persuaded me that such dodges as I passed on just wouldn't wash with the consummate professionals who work as senior secretaries. Hence my belated realisation that the stopping power of senior managers' mufflers is greater than I had previously supposed. They are equipped with not one, but two of them: the classical Mangham sort worn by the chiefs themselves, and an outlying filter represented by their secretaries. As one of same typically remarks: 'I can say with hand on heart that no-one will get through to my boss on the telephone if they will not explain to me exactly why they wish to speak to him - and, only then, provided he tells me he wishes to take the call.' The only hope of penetrating to the chief, several of the gatekeepers say, is essentially akin to networking. In the words of the same correspondent, it is 'waking up to the fact that few top executives will take calls unless they are very thoroughly screened and perceived to be mutually constructive, and en-listing the secretary's help and advice as to how to get their message across or who would be the right person to speak to about their idea/application. At this level, the secretary would certainly be one of the best people to have on your side when chasing those elusive job openings.' To which I can only nod in agreement. But that is not to say the better pay-off of networking augurs well for the economic future. For it is a method that clearly best serves folk good at favourably impressing influential others - which need not be, and often isn't, the same as having something productive to offer a company. Indeed networking was summed up in a maxim long before 'Never surprise a vice-president': to wit, It's not what you know, but who you know.' Still, that being the case, it may help to explain why so many big companies at least, have so few good new ideas. N OW to a couple of City of London jobs being offered by separate headhunters.

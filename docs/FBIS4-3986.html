			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Deng Ying (6772 4481)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the invitation of  the Chinese State Nuclear Safety Bureau, an International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] team on international evaluation of nuclear  safety control today began the evaluation of the effectiveness  of China's nuclear safety supervision and control.    The team consists of experts from the United States, France,  Britain, Spain, and Belgium, as well as IAEA officials. During  their stay in Beijing, the team members will listen to the State  Nuclear Safety Bureau's briefings on nuclear safety supervision  and control system, organizations and functions, the formulation  of nuclear safety law and its evaluation and enforcement, as  well as nuclear contingency plans in China. They will also hold  special talks with the state bureau on the aforesaid topics. In  addition, the team members will visit Shenzhen to hold talks  with Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear Plant and the state bureau's  Guangdong Supervision Station to familiarize themselves with the  Chinese state bureau's nuclear safety supervision and control  over the operating units.    International evaluation of nuclear safety control is a form  of international cooperation activity, through which IAEA  organizes international nuclear safety experts to evaluate the  effectiveness of nuclear safety supervision and control carried  by the nuclear safety agency of a certain member state. The  purpose of the evaluation is to obtain firsthand information  about the member state's nuclear safety supervision and control,  to summarize successful experiences, to make suggestions for  improvement, and to exchange experiences in order to raise all  member states' level in nuclear safety supervision and control.    According to a state bureau official, international  evaluation of nuclear safety control is to be requested by  member states on a voluntary basis and to be organized and  carried out by the IAEA. Since the inauguration of the State  Nuclear Safety Bureau in 1984, China has adopted relatively  comprehensive nuclear safety regulations and supervision system.  The international evaluation, the first to be conducted on  China's nuclear safety supervision and control in 10 years, will  help improve China's nuclear safety work, enhance its influence  on the world, and promote its international cooperation in  nuclear safety.    The IAEA team, which arrived in Beijing 24 April, will  complete the evaluation on 9 May.</p>

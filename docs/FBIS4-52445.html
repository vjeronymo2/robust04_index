			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Railway workers of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea are greeting their holiday  (May 11) with an increase in transportation.    According to data available at the Ministry of Railways, the  daily freight haulage entering this month is 6,000 to 7,000 tons  more than in the same period last month.    The General Bureau of Western Railways is topping the daily  plan of freight turnover by 2,000 to 3,000 tons through well  organized and commanded transportation.    The Kaechon General Bureau of Railways is overfulfilling the  daily transport plan at an average of 107 percent.    The General Bureaus of Eastern and Northern Railways are  carrying more freight than the plan by effectively controlling  the locomotives, wagons and facilities.    Many railway stations including the Sariwon Youth Station,  the Sinanju Youth Station, the Nanam Station and Pungnyon  Station have hit the transport targets for the first half of the  year more than two months earlier than schedule.    Railway builders have effected new innovations in the  construction of railways including the Namdong-Onchon line.</p>

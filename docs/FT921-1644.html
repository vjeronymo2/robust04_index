			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Gatt plan and quantity conflict Sir, In your article 'German proposals may save next round of Gatt' (March 18) your correspondents in Bonn and Washington refer to Chancellor Kohl's initiative aiming at a freeze on US exports of cereal substitutes to the European Community and, in return, quantity restriction on EC agricultural exports. While it is desirable that level of EC agricultural export subsidies should be reduced, quantity restrictions are quite another matter. This will inevitably lead to conflicts between member states - how much French wheat should get subsidy, as against how much British barley. . ? The next step would be the introduction of quantitative controls over grain production, provoking interminable and probably insoluble political and administrative difficulties. This approach might indeed suit Germany, which wants to keep a high-price Common Agricultural Policy corseted by supply controls, but it is the wrong path to 'reform'; price cuts as envisaged in the MacSharry Plan, with degressive income compensation to farmers, are the right way. It would be paradoxical if the outcome of trade liberalisation were to be an even more highly-regulated CAP. Michael Tracy, La Bergerie, 20 rue Emile Francois, 1474 La Hutte (Genappe), Belgium</p>

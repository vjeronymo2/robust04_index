			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday Energy and Mines Minister Daniel Hokama  Tokashiki asserted that the recovery currently being experienced  in the mining sector, and especially the boom in gold  production, are the principal activities reactivating the  Peruvian economy.    Hokama said that 36 percent of the total foreign investments  obtained in the past few years have been earmarked for the  mining sector, despite the fact that only a little over 10  percent of the Peruvian potential is being exploited.    While its mineral reserves place Peru as the seventh largest  mineralogical district in the world, during the last decades no  systematic mineral exploitations have been carried out. It is  believed that there are great deposits yet to be found, and the  country's progress could be based on the adequate development of  the mining field, stated the minister.    Hokama added, however, that the inflow of fresh capital is  not only encouraged by the existing potential, but also by the  implementation of an open economy, by a controlled inflation,  and by the outlook toward obtaining a fiscal balance.    In view of the new legal framework, important international  mining enterprises have expressed their interest in investing in  Peru. Among them are Anglo American, Cyprus-Amay, Cambior, RTZ  [expansion unknown], Placer Dome, Noranda, Lac Minerals,  Americana Barrick, and Asarco.    In referring to the boom in gold production, Hokama stated  that in this field it is estimated that some 500,000 ounces of  gold will be extracted this year from the Yanacocha and Maqui  Maqui mines alone.    The minister explained that the Yanacocha project being  developed by the U.S. enterprises Newmont and BGRG [expansion  unknown], in partnership with the Peruvian enterprise  Buenaventura, will this year yield a production of 250,000  ounces, and that this amount will double as of December, when  the Maqui Maqui project is implemented.    In comparing gold production over the past five years, in  1990 the monthly production amounted to 2,400 ounces while in  1993 the production amounted to 53,000 ounces.    Minister Hokama said that the new mining policy redefines  the  role played by the state in its capacity as administrator of  natural resources: promoting private investment, supervising,  and implementing precise and stable regulations.    In order to give an idea of the great mining potential of  the  country, he said that of the 128 million hectares making up the  country's territory, 60 million correspond to mineral resources.  He also commented that during the past 18 months requests have  been made to exploit mineral deposits over a surface of 5  million hectares.    Aware of the damages that mineral exploitation may cause to  the ecosystem, the mining enterprises have started a series of  actions designed to establish adequate mechanisms for  safeguarding the environment.    This was confirmed by the Gold Committee of the National  Mining and Oil Association, which stated that "there must be an  equilibrium between the development of the mining sector and the  preservation of the environment, sustained by shared  responsibility on the part of the enterprises, the government,  and the scientific community."    The business sector also referred to the great importance  granted to the environment during the first international  symposium on gold held in Peru.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Radio market shift claimed THE COMMERCIAL radio industry yesterday said that for the first time it now accounted for more than 40 per cent of total radio listening. Mr Douglas McArthur, the managing director of the Radio Advertising Bureau, set up to promote commercial radio, said new figures 'demonstrated why advertisers are re-assessing their views of radio as an advertising medium'. The latest official figures produced by Radio Joint Audience Research, for the three months from March to June, show that BBC radio had a share of 57.2 per cent and the commercial stations had 38.9 per cent. Mr McArthur, in addition, included the 2.2 per cent share of listening obtained by Virgin 1215, the new national popular music station which was on air for only seven of the 13 weeks of the research period. The Radio Advertising Bureau said it now had a 'stranglehold' on the BBC, particularly in London where commercial radio was taking a 58 per cent share of the total radio audience. The BBC countered by saying that two-thirds of the adult population listened to a BBC radio station every week, giving an audience of more than 31m. The survey also showed that more than 27m adults listened to network radio each week and that the BBC's Radio 5 had increased its audience by half a million adults since the last full survey. The BBC estimates that 500,000 under-15s also listen to Radio 5. The finding will make it more difficult for the BBC to replace Radio 5 with a 24-hour news service following the row over plans to run the news service on Radio 4's long wave frequency.</p>

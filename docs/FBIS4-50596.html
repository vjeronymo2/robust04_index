			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's  Qinghai Province had exported 35.81 million U.S. dollars-worth  of commodities by May 10, an increase of 39.5 percent compared  with the corresponding period of last year.    The increase rate is also higher than the national growth  rate of 22 percent for exports in the past four months, said  local trade officials.    Meanwhile, imports in the same period were worth 11.92  million U.S. dollars, a decrease of 40,000 U.S. dollars over the  same period of last year.    The officials attributed the growth in exports in the first  four months of this year to the implementation of reform  measures in foreign trade.    They said they believed that the unification of foreign  exchange rates and other foreign trade reform measures have  provided favorable conditions for the development of enterprises  engaged in foreign trade and have brought the enthusiasm of  these enterprises into full play.</p>

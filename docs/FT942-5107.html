			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Tories may win 30% of vote in Euro-poll survey says An opinion poll for the Labour party suggested yesterday the Conservatives may do better than many expect in Thursday's European parliament election, winning up to 30 per cent of the vote and 20 seats. The poll, which is broadly in line with private polling for Conservative central office, suggests that core Tory voters have been reassured by Mr John Major's Euro-sceptic handling of the election campaign. However, divisions emerged over the prime minister's concept of a 'multi-speed' Europe, as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, summoned up the D-Day spirit for the last few days of electioneering. In a rallying call to activists at Conservative central office, Mr Heseltine gave full backing to Mr Major's stress on Britain's pursuit of self-interest in Europe. He said the multi-speed concept reflected the political reality of the decades since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which launched the European Community in 1957, and applied to all EU member states. But Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and the cabinet's most prominent pro-European, said Britain should retain a leading role in the Union. 'I believe that Britain should set the running, can set the running, and we should exercise our full weight in the Union,' he said after talks with EU finance ministers in Luxembourg. Mr John Gummer, the pro-European environment secretary, also said in London that it was 'absolutely clear' that Britain could not move at a slower speed than the rest of the EU. The opinion poll, by NOP, indicated that 43 per cent were likely to vote Labour, 30 per cent Conservative and 21 per cent Liberal Democrat. Labour officials said such a turnout would give the party 50-55 of the 84 British mainland seats. The Conservatives would win about 20, and the Liberal Democrats would win some seats in the south-west, where their support is concentrated. Labour currently holds 45 seats and the Conservatives 32. Labour strategists believe the NOP poll is more accurate than a Gallup survey for the Daily Telegraph, which last week put the Conservatives in third place on 21 per cent of the vote. A Gallup poll in today's Telegraph, puts Labour on 53 per cent, the Tories on 23 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 17.5 per cent. A poll of polls in today's Guardian suggests the Tories will win only six seats, Labour 65, and the Liberal Democrats 12. Tory split reopened, Page 8</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper giant faces 'reform or die' challenge - Chuquicamata is struggling with falling ore grades, high costs and low prices At first, there seems to be little logical explanation for the existence of Calama. A thriving town of more than 100,000 inhabitants, it is hemmed in on all sides by the Atacama desert, the driest place on earth. It is only on careful inspection that one notices, far in the distance, the belching chimney stacks of Chuquicamata, the world's largest copper mine, on which Calama depends. Without Chuquicamata - the 80-year-old, state-run mine that accounts for 6 per cent of global copper production - the town would sink back into the desert sands. Although the mine employs slightly fewer than 10,000 workers, more than half Calama's population is economically dependent on it. It is against this background that falling ore grades and high production costs at the mine, coupled with slumping copper prices, become of great concern. Worrying too is the assessment of Mr Raul Melendez, head of Chuquicamata's finance department, that: 'We have to change the way we operate within five years or we're going to die a natural death'. Part of that change, provoked by growing competition from Chile's private sector mines, involves the break-up of Chuquicamata from next year into seven autonomous business units. The scheme, described as 'highly sensitive' by managers, is under discussion with the mine's powerful unions. The idea is to create an 'internal market' by splitting the operation into separate profit centres that will 'sell' services to one another, according to Mr Gilberto Ortega, a member of Chuquicamata's finance team. The scheme aims to spotlight inefficiency, judge management performance and introduce market incentives. 'The important thing is that each unit should have its own management and make its own profits. Poorly performing units will have to change or disappear,' Mr Ortega says. After a two-year experimental phase, units will be permitted to sell services outside the mine. It is not yet clear how the theory will work out in practice, given that Chuquicamata operates as an organic process. Rather than expose each unit to the profit-or-die laws of the marketplace, it seems likely that the new structure will be used to pinpoint areas where savings can be made. Unions are likely to oppose such reforms, which may be regarded as a potential assault on jobs and pay. Worse still, the planned reorganisation smacks of privatisation by stealth. Managers speak, however, of a 'cultural shift' among Chuquicamata's workers, who they say are increasingly open to change. Evidence of this came earlier this year when workers signed a three-year wage agreement. Unlike 1991, when there was a two-week strike in pursuit of better pay and conditions, workers this year settled for a deal that merely kept pay in line with inflation. There is growing recognition that Chuquicamata must become more efficient if it is to survive, managers say. Such sentiments have been sharpened by the association last month of Codelco, the state-owned copper concern, with a US/Canadian consortium for the development of the huge El Abra mine. As Codelco's first joint venture, the Dollars 1bn project is being trumpeted as a great leap forward. Chile will receive Dollars 404m in return a 51 per cent stake. Without investing so much as a peso, the country will collect 49 per cent of profits. Moreover, El Abra copper will be produced at 40-45 cents a pound, compared with an average of 69 cents over Codelco's four divisions. Chuquicamata, with production costs of about 58 cents a pound, remains Codelco's most cost-effective mine. However, that figure is partly disguised by extremely low-cost metal derived from Mina Sur, the mine's rich oxide deposit. Copper from Chuquicamata's main sulphide mine, a terraced pit measuring 2km by 4km, is increasingly expensive to produce as the mine deepens and ore grades decline. Standing beside the gouged and dynamited hole - at the base of which towering trucks appear the size of ants - it is easy to appreciate the difficulty of keeping costs in check. In addition to the mine reorganisation, managers intend to cut staff. They hope that through early and disability retirement, plus a hiring freeze, the workforce can be reduced by nearly 1,500 to 8,575 by 1995. There is also likely to be a crack down on what managers regard as lost time during shift changeovers. Chuquicamata's non-core infrastructure, which includes housing, schools and sports facilities, is also to be scrutinised. The site hospital alone, which guarantees free medical treatment to staff and their families, costs Dollars 15m a year. 'We're looking into ways of reducing these costs,' says Mr Melendez. Chile's government, which controls Codelco's investment budget, has made it clear that it expects cost-cutting. Mr Eduardo Frei, almost certain to be president after elections in December, recently told an election rally: 'Those copper companies that are incapable of producing at less than 60 cents a pound are going to collapse'. Politicians are also using El Abra as a rod with which to beat Chuquicamata, the management of which is desperate to develop the replacement ore bodies of Radomiro Tomic and Mansa Mina. Currently the law prohibits these deposits, regarded as belonging to Chuquicamata, from being developed in association with foreign partners. But no one doubts the desire of many politicians to scrap that stipulation. 'If Codelco wants to develop new mines on its own it will have to transform itself radically in terms of productivity and efficiency,' said Mr Alejandro Foxley, finance minister. As the government diverts money to social programmes, the budget left over for Codelco is barely sufficient to implement environmental clean-ups and to keep mines ticking over. In the meantime, it is not merely the inhabitants of Calama who are relying on the continued profitability of Chuquicamata, the backbone of the Chilean economy. Although low copper prices have severely dented profits, Chuquicamata still accounts for around 7 per cent of Chile's GDP. Whether the government opts to keep the mine entirely in state hands or to broaden its scope for attracting foreign capital is still up for debate. What is certain, however, is that the next administration will do all it can to prevent its most important asset from suffering a slow and painful death.</p>

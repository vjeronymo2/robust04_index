			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Istanbul shares plummet PRESIDENT Turgut Ozal's death at the weekend sent shares tumbling on the Istanbul stock exchange yesterday and spurred dollar buying on fears of a political crisis, Reuter reports from Istanbul. The index, which hit an all-time high on Friday, sank 767.23 points or 10.45 per cent to 6,574.14. 'This is the biggest slump in the history of the stock exchange,' said broker Mr Bulent Yanaray at Pay investment house. Mr Ozal's death also stimulated dollar buying, forcing the central bank to intervene several times to halt its surge. Brokers expected stock market turmoil to continue, albeit less intensely, until nominations for the presidency are put forward during a 10-day period from next Tuesday. See World Stock Markets</p>

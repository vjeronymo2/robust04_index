[passage omitted on ceremonial proceedings]    Speaking at the ceremony, Col. Maung Kyi, chairman of the  Kayah State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of  the Regional Command Headquarters in Loikaw, said today is a  very auspicious day for the Kayah State as well as the Union of  Myanmar [Burma] because it marks the return to the legal fold of  the Kayah State which had decided to give up the policy of armed  struggle in order to join hands with the government in  development. He recalled that during his trip to Loikaw and  Bawlake, SLORC Secretary-1 Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt had invited the  armed organizations in the jungle to give up the policy of armed  struggle and return to the legal fold to work with the  government in regional development.    He said after realizing the genuine goodwill of the  government, the KNPLF has now returned to the legal fold after  holding many rounds of talks based on mutual friendship,  respect, and trust. He said there is now a ray of hope for  peace emerging in the Kayah State. He said national  reconciliation is an indispensable task for building a peaceful,  modern, and developed Union of Myanmar. [passage omitted]    Continuing, he said although the current situation in the  country is heading toward stability and progress, it should be  noted that the country could come under threat any time due to  internal traitors and foreign neocolonialists. He said people  in the Kayah State must be happy to see the KNPLF returning to  the legal fold with the intention of cooperating with the  Defense Services in unity for the progress of the country. He  said the entire nation and people should take pride in and  welcome the event. He said the people are hoping that the  entire Union would become peaceful and developed if the  remaining armed organizations in the jungle make similar efforts  like the KNPLF with mutual understanding. He said all of us  should take note of the people's aspirations. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, he urged the KNPLF to work hand in hand with  the local people under the leadership of the government in  implementing regional development projects.    Next, U Tun Kyaw, leader of the KNPLF, handed over the list  of members, weapons, and ammunition to Col. Maung Kyi, chairman  of the Kayah State Law and Order Restoration Council and  commander of the Regional Command.    Speaking at the ceremony, KNPLF leader U Tun Kyaw said that  the KPLF gives great importance to the unity and development of  the national people residing in the Kayah State, and stated its  desire to remain in the Union through weal and woe and live in  unity, with mutual respect and assistance among national races.  He said his organization welcomed the SLORC gesture of warmly  receiving the armed organizations returning to the legal fold.    He noted that our country is a beautiful country which is  very rich in natural resources. Developments that should have  taken place, however, did not happen because of the civil war  which had been waged for over 40 years. He said the time would  soon come to develop our country into a just and a genuinely  democratic country with a new outlook and thought. He said the  time has now come to establish a Union with a full family  spirit. He said the KNPLF, in accordance with the wishes of the  people, had responded to the government's invitation by  returning to the legal fold and giving up its policy of armed  struggle. The KNPLF shall work hand in hand with the Defense  Services in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence.  He said the KNPLF shall give priority to the interests of the  people and development and progress of the Kayah State. He  called on the remaining armed organizations to urgently  contribute to the government peace policy, which had been openly  declared to the world, and to work jointly for development and  progress of the nation.</p>

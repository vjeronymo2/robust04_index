			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAUGUS FALLS BEHIND POSTHASTE IN 49-7 ROUT  </P> <P> Dick Flaherty was running behind schedule most of Friday night.  </P> <P> The Saugus High coach brought his football team out to the College of the  Canyons field just six minutes before kickoff. No stretching. No warmups. Not  much of anything.  </P> <P> The Centurions just ran onto the field then took a 49-7 nonleague beating by  Hart.  </P> <P> Afterward, Flaherty appeared just as rushed when asked to comment on the game.  </P> <P> "I don't have time for this," he said when approached by reporters, then  trotted toward the locker room.  </P> <P> The Centurions might, however, find time this week to work a little on their  special teams, because in that aspect of the game Saugus failed miserably.  </P> <P> The Indians converted four crucial special-teams miscues into four touchdowns  and a 28-0 lead.  </P> <P> "The bottom line was that we got the big plays off their mistakes," an  unhurried Hart Coach Mike Herrington said. "I guess that's good. But I was a  little disappointed because we didn't get our offense rolling as far as driving  the ball."  </P> <P> Still, the Indians (2-2) had opportunities to gain 366 yards.  </P> <P> The Saugus collapse began late in the first quarter when Hart's Tucker  Setterberg led a flood of Indians into the Centurion backfield and blocked Jeff  Hickman's punt deep in Saugus territory.  </P> <P> Brad Goeres recovered at the eight-yard line and Ryan Connors scored two plays  later when he beat defensive back Kevin Neidigh to the outside and sprinted in  on a five-yard bootleg.  </P> <P> On the Indians' next drive, which had stalled at their own 21, Saugus (1-3)  committed another blunder.  </P> <P> Brian Allen clobbered Hart punter Doug Distaso. The 15-yard roughing-the-kicker  penalty turned fourth and 14 into an Indian first down at the 36.  </P> <P> This time, it took Hart five plays to make the Centurions pay.  </P> <P> Scott Blanchard capped the 92-yard drive with an 11-yard run.  </P> <P> It only got worse.  </P> <P> Hart's Jon Bodemer returned the second half kickoff 89 yards for a score and a  21-0 advantage.  </P> <P> On their next drive, the Indians used a fake punt to continue a scoring drive.  Punter Distaso passed 19 yards to Damon Mori for the first down. Four plays  later, Connors connected with Brian Bernier for a 19-yard touchdown pass.  </P> <P> Connors passed for 126 yards and a touchdown. He also carried 10 times for 74  yards. Blanchard added nine carries for 89 yards and a pair of 11-yard  touchdown runs.  </P></p>

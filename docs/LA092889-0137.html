			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSOURI ABORTION RULING BRINGS UNFORESEEN RESULTS  </P> <P> The moment she saw the blurred outline of the fetus on the sonogram on Sept.  11, Maralee Dinsdale knew something was horribly wrong.  </P> <P> "There just wasn't a definite round little head," Dinsdale recalled, starting  to cry quietly. She spelled the word that the doctor used:  a-n-e-n-c-e-p-h-a-l-i-c. It meant that the 22-week fetus would be born without  a brain.  </P> <P> Three months ago, she might have had an abortion at either of the two hospitals  where her doctor practices. But when he tried to schedule one for her earlier  this month, both facilities refused, saying they had changed their policies to  conform with a Missouri law that had been upheld in July by the U.S. Supreme  Court.  </P> <P> Dinsdale, confused and desperate, was advised to cross the state line to get  her abortion at a clinic -- one that was not as well equipped as a hospital to  handle the potentially dangerous medical complications that arose.  </P> <P> For all the attention that has been paid the Supreme Court decision in Webster  vs. Reproductive Health Services, neither side of the abortion debate expected  the Missouri law to have much of an immediate impact. The law's relatively  narrow restrictions were seen as merely a first step -- and a very small one,  at that -- toward the gradual chipping away of abortion rights.  </P> <P> The statute bars the state from using its money, facilities or employees for  abortion, except in cases where the woman's life is in danger.  </P> <P> However, as the law is being implemented, it is having some unexpected  consequences.  </P> <P> "It may be more far-reaching than many at first recognized," said Barbara  Hackett, president of Missouri Citizens for Life. "It's really a hopeful  situation, no doubt about it."  </P> <P> "Now the chickens are coming home to roost. There are all these crazy  situations happening in Missouri," said Roger Evans, litigation director for  Planned Parenthood and counsel in the Webster case.  </P> <P> Though Dinsdale's case was extreme, her experiences are only one example of the  effects that the Supreme Court decision is having on availability of abortion  here. It is being felt in several areas, among them:  </P> <P>  -- More hospitals than initially expected have stopped performing abortions,  leaving women with fewer options, and forcing a few, such as Dinsdale, to take  greater risks to get an abortion.  </P> <P>  -- In apparent contradiction with assurances that the Missouri attorney  general made to the U.S. Supreme Court, at least one state college has put its  staff on notice that it may not provide anyone with information on abortion.  Other state officials say they are unsure how far their employees may go in  discussing the topic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blockades Allowed  </P> <P>  -- Two judges have ruled that the law's preamble justifies such tactics as  sit-ins and blockades by anti-abortion groups seeking to shut down abortion  clinics.  </P> <P> Originally, the law was thought to apply mainly to Truman Medical Center, a  private facility located on public land in Kansas City. But several other  hospitals have since announced that they can no longer do abortions.  </P> <P> Mario Mandina, president of the anti-abortion group Missouri Lawyers for Life,  said some hospitals will define the law's prohibition as broadly as possible.  "Some of those people were looking for excuses to get out of (abortion) and  this was a convenient excuse," he said.  </P> <P> The loss of public facilities does not present a major obstacle for the vast  majority of women seeking an abortion in Missouri. Fully 90% have the procedure  in private clinics, which are not covered by the law.  </P> <P> But Dinsdale was well beyond the point in her pregnancy where most clinics will  do the procedure, and she was fast approaching a time where it would be  difficult to get one anywhere.  </P> <P> Dinsdale, a 32-year-old substitute teacher and girls basketball coach, could  have carried her doomed fetus to term. But she and her husband, Kevin, had been  devastated by both a fetal death and a miscarriage in the past three years. She  could not bear thinking what it would be like "to feel it move every day, to  know every day that when it was born, it wouldn't live."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shocked by Options  </P> <P> After some hasty consultation with a colleague, her doctor recommended that she  go to Comprehensive Health for Women, a clinic in Kansas. Had she had more time  and information, Dinsdale might have continued her search for a private  hospital in Missouri that still does abortions. But Dinsdale and her husband  were shocked and confused at the limited options presented to them. Her doctor  did not return a call requesting an interview.  </P> <P> Comprehensive Health officials say they have seen several women forced across  the state line by the Supreme Court decision. However, Dinsdale's case caused  them particular concern.  </P> <P> In an earlier delivery, placenta had adhered to her uterine wall and she had  hemorrhaged. Doctors at Comprehensive Health knew that could happen again, and  were uncomfortable about performing the abortion there.  </P> <P> "With her history of bleeding . . . the abortion should have been done in a  hospital," said clinic director Adele Hughey.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Begins Bleeding Heavily  </P> <P> As they feared, Dinsdale began bleeding heavily as soon as they completed it  and suffered an adverse drug reaction, according to nurse-practitioner Ada  Anderson, who attended the procedure.  </P> <P> Clinic staff quickly summoned an ambulance, and Dinsdale recovered in a  hospital.  </P> <P> "People think that cutting off access to public facilities won't really hurt  women, but it already has," said Lynn M. Paltrow, an attorney with the American  Civil Liberties Union.  </P> <P> Missouri hospitals are not the only institutions in the state distancing  themselves from abortion. The law also prohibits use of public funds,  facilities or employees for "encouraging or counseling" abortion.  </P> <P> In a July 13 memorandum to top officials at Southwest Missouri State  University, Vice President Herbert L. Lunday warned that university employees  are not to discuss the subject "when an individual (client, patient or other)  raises the issue of abortion with an employee of the university" or "if an  individual requests referral to an abortion clinic."  </P> <P> The Supreme Court decision was based in part on assurances from Missouri Atty.  Gen. William L. Webster that the statute "is directed solely at those persons  responsible for expending public funds" and "does not prohibit the use of  public funds to provide information regarding abortions or to inform a woman of  the options she may have to cope with an unwanted pregnancy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Retain Policy  </P> <P> However, university attorney John Black said Southwest Missouri State plans to  stick by its new policy. "Any public employee, I would think at this point in  time, has some reason for concern," he said in an interview.  </P> <P> "There had been great concern on our part early on as to even mentioning the  word (abortion). . . . Anything any one of our staff does is supported with  state funds," said Michael R. Henry, director of legal services for the  Missouri Department of Social Services. "At this point, we have not issued any  instructions to staff."  </P> <P> Anti-abortion groups argue that while the law's limitations may make it more  complicated for some women to obtain an abortion, they do not make it  impossible, or even difficult. "Basically, the Webster decision hasn't stopped  one abortion," said Mandina, the president of Missouri Lawyers for Life.  </P> <P> Far more significant, he said, is the new interpretation that some Missouri  courts are giving the law's assertions that "the life of each human being  begins at conception" and that "unborn children have protectable interests in  life, health and well-being."  </P> <P> The state had argued that this passage was "abortion-neutral," and the Supreme  Court left it up to Missouri courts to decide what that section of the law  means.  </P> <P> It has been cited in a number of unusual cases since July, including one in  which a defendant accused of underage drinking is trying to add nine months to  his age and another in which a pregnant imprisoned woman is claiming her fetus  is illegally incarcerated because it committed no crime.  </P> <P> What has elated abortion foes, however, are separate decisions last month by  two state judges, who cited that language from the law's preamble as their  justification for freeing protesters charged with trespassing on abortion  clinic property.  </P> <P> St. Louis Judge Arthur Miorelli acquitted four protesters, saying: "I'm  satisfied that Missouri law provides for the protection of these children."  </P> <P> In the earlier case, Associate Circuit Judge George R. Gerhard acknowledged  that 11 people had disrupted a clinic, but said their actions were "necessary  as emergency measures" to prevent the "death and maiming of unborn children."  </P> <P> Judges in other parts of the country, including Los Angeles and San Diego, have  rejected such "necessity defenses" by anti-abortion groups.  </P> <P> Neither of the two Missouri cases may be appealed, but the issue is expected to  ultimately reach the state supreme court.  </P> <P> If the necessity defense is upheld, "I don't know how the abortuaries could  stay open here, because there would be so many people who would be sitting in.  . . . They would shut (abortion clinics) down, day in and day out. They would  have to move out of the state," Mandina said.  </P> <P> But St. Louis County prosecutor Tom Wehrle said: "We don't read the law that  way. Our county police will still be there making arrests."  </P></p>

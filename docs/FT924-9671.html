			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Burmese drills grinding to a halt - Disappointed explorers are ready to pull out SEVERAL international oil companies are on the verge of abandoning efforts to find oil and gas in Burma after collectively spending more than USDollars 400m in three years on almost fruitless exploratory drilling. Among those that have already decided to drop their onshore exploration blocks are BHP of Australia and Clyde of the UK. The military government awarded a round of three-year contracts in late 1989. Oil companies have the option of extending the contracts, but most of them - disappointed by poor results and higher than expected costs - are likely to pull out, according to oil company executives and western diplomats. Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, which faces a deepening energy crisis, is pinning its hopes on a project awarded this year to Total of France to exploit known offshore gas reserves in the Gulf of Martaban. The plan is to export most of the gas to Thailand by pipeline, but the Dollars 1bn project will not come on stream until the second half of the decade. Crude oil was extracted from hand-dug wells in Burma as far back as the tenth century, and the country - officially renamed Myanmar - now produces about 15,000 barrels a day of oil and 85m cubic feet a day of gas. The oil companies operating in Burma - including Shell, Amoco, Unocal and Idemitsu - were hopeful that they would find large oil-bearing structures in the country. 'But after three years of exploring, everything seems to be technically more complex - hard to find and hard to develop,' says one oil company executive in the capital Rangoon. In the words of one western diplomat: 'They have spent an awful lot of money not finding oil'. Obstacles included the complexity of Burma's geology, the inadequacy of its transport and communications networks, the seasonal monsoon rains and the embarrassment of working with a military junta notorious for the brutality with which it suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988. In a paper presented at a regional oil and gas conference in Bangkok earlier this year, the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise spoke admiringly of Amoco's logistical achievement in hauling thousands of tonnes of equipment by helicopter and river barge to its concession in remote northern Burma. The military government, acutely aware of the country's energy deficit, has to rely on foreign oil companies because of its own shortage of funds and expertise. Power cuts are common, refineries are operating at 30 per cent of capacity and petrol at the official price is rationed, although supplies are freely available on the black market. Government officials seem philosophical, however, about the departure of some of the oil companies. 'That's the nature of oil exploration,' says Commander Thein Tun, a former naval officer who heads the energy planning department. 'Companies are going out and companies are coming in. 'This year the price of oil is not very encouraging to the explorers and so most of the oil companies in the US have to retrench, and the oil companies in Japan also have problems. We are quite aware that the infrastructure in some areas is not adequate and that they have some logistical problems.' The only bright spot of the last three years was in January this year when Shell struck a barely commercial amount of gas at one of the three exploratory wells on its concession in central Burma; the gas is now being fed into the domestic grid. Commander Thein Tun says the government is negotiating with Shell in the hope that the company will take on four small blocks in a previously explored area next to its existing concession. The US companies Apache Oil and Trend International were awarded two blocks each this year, and Kailis Resources of Australia took a block on the west coast, but several onshore blocks remain open. Offshore, meanwhile, the only activity is in three blocks operated by Texaco and in the area to be exploited by Total. Total's first job will be to appraise the gas discovered by MOGE in 1983. The enterprise estimates that reserves exceed six trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, Burmese officials say, but other studies suggest a figure of between 2.6 trillion and 3.5 trillion cu ft. A quarter of the estimated 400m cu ft a day of gas produced could be used inside Burma, and the rest is likely to be exported to Thailand by pipeline following negotiations involving the Petroleum Authority of Thailand and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. The proposed pipeline would cross an area where rebels opposed to the ruling council are active, but Commander Thein Tun said his government had told the Thais that the Burmese would look after the pipeline on the Burmese side of the frontier. 'Maybe there are only one or two strongholds of the Karens (the rebels) there,' he said; 'and the government is at the moment trying to talk with the ethnic groups.'</p>

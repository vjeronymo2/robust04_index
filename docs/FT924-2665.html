			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Property: Creative collapse - How numbers can mislead In the search for scapegoats for the property slump, accountants are among the prime suspects. Creative accountancy allegedly contributed to the sector's collapse which, to add insult to injury, is now generating substantial fees for accountants' receivership practices. This argument should not be taken too far. It was, after all, the banks  - which base their lending decisions on far more than published accounts - which financed the sector's reckless expansion in the late 1980s. And the misinterpretation of accounts often reflects as badly on their readers as on their creators. Nonetheless, the use of creative - though entirely legal - accounting techniques often confused investors. Moreover, this creative approach helped delude companies about their true exposure to a possible downturn and encouraged them to take greater risks. Property group Rosehaugh was one of the most commonly associated with off-balance-sheet finance - the removal of assets and liabilities from the balance-sheet to reduce the ostensible gearing; Rosehaugh went into administration last week. Another recent example of how numbers can mislead was provided by Trafalgar House, the property-to-shipping conglomerate. Trafalgar House had to restate its 1990-91 pre-tax profits of Pounds 122.4m as a loss of Pounds 38.5m. This followed a ruling by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounting watchdog, that property write-downs should be taken through the profit and loss account rather than reserves. While the sector has largely faced up to the slump in values of the past three years, there is still much concern among investors about non-property companies with heavy property exposures which have not yet reflected the full fall in values in their assets. When County NatWest, the investment house, conducted a survey of these companies last summer, it concluded that many had 'yet to face up to reality'. The recurring themes of the accounting treatment of property are off-balance-sheet finance and changes in the treatment of assets and capitalised interest (whereby interest payments on a development are classified as an asset on the balance-sheet, rather than an expense in the profit and loss account). The significance of capitalised interest came to light with the emergence of the star developers of the 1980s, many of which have since collapsed, such as Broadwell Land, Rockfort, Citygrove and Rush &amp; Tompkins. These companies' apparently robust profits appear less impressive when the capitalised interest is brought back into the profit and loss account, revealing the company's poor ability to service its debt. Rosehaugh provides another illustration of the ambiguity of reported profits. In its accounts for 1989-90, Rosehaugh included Pounds 23.5m of interest 'receivable' from its associates. In fact, much of the interest was not received in cash and was later waived. The problems of interpreting figures that involve capitalised interest pale beside the difficulties created by off-balance-sheet finance. Indeed, capitalisation of interest only becomes a real problem for readers of accounts when its extent is obscured within an off-balance-sheet subsidiary. Rosehaugh's extensive use of off-balance-sheet finance gave it a reputation for obfuscation. 'However hard one pores over yesterday's results, there are few financial things an outsider can say with relative confidence about Rosehaugh,' was the view of the FT's Lex column in 1989 - just months before Rosehaugh shocked the City by announcing a rescue rights issue. But off-balance-sheet finance was very attractive because it allowed relatively small companies to undertake ambitious ventures. In 1990 quoted companies ran up an estimated Pounds 7.1bn in off-balance-sheet debt, according to Drivers Jonas, chartered surveyors. The justification for excluding this debt from a company's gearing figure was that interest is usually rolled up and only paid when the a property is completed and sold. Moreover, the off-balance-sheet debt was assumed to be 'non-recourse', in other words that the parent company took no responsibility for the loan if it turned bad. But both these justifications wore thin with the property slump in the late-1980s. As values tumbled, off-balance-sheet subsidiaries became increasingly unable to repay their debts. And many parent companies found they could not avoid the responsibility of 'non-recourse' loans. Rush &amp; Tompkins is perhaps the best example of a company that disguised problems arising from off-balance-sheet finance. The company's last set of accounts merely listed its bank borrowings as Pounds 25m and mentioned Pounds 89m of 'non-recourse' or limited recourse banking arrangements. When Rush &amp; Tompkins went into receivership in May 1990 it had debts of more than Pounds 300m. The frequent absence of annual valuations or when assets are valued by directors rather than independent valuers is another problem arising from the treatment of property in accounts. This has been a particular concern in the building sector, where hundreds of millions of pounds has been wiped off the value of land over the past three years. Developers 'are just scratching the surface of their problems,' said County NatWest. New accounting standards that will be introduced early next year will tighten up the treatment of property in accounts. But to many investors, this is too little, too late.</p>

The foreign scientists will be elected as CAS academicians  at  the seventh academicians' conference of the CAS in May, he said.    The move is aimed at speeding up academic exchanges with  foreign countries and international co-operation, the spokesman  said.    With the status of Chinese scientists rising, more than 200  CAS scientists hold posts in important world academic bodies, he  added.    Other academic co-operation includes 64 academic agreements  the CAS has signed with scientific academies in other countries,  the spokesman told a current annual work conference of the CAS,  which started Tuesday.    CAS President Zhou Guangzhao also spoke at the conference.  He said that CAS scientists are carrying on substantial  co-operation with their foreign colleagues, which includes a  Sino-U.S. high-energy physics project.    The CAS has acquired a large amount of international funds  for research into deserts, mineral resources, geochemistry and  global changes, he said.    The president called on the CAS academicians to conduct more  "substantive" co-operation with foreign colleagues, through  which transnational labs and research centers could be  established.</p>

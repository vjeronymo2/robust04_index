			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA TRAVEL SAFE AGAIN, OFFICIAL SAYS  </P> <P> A railroad worker who rose to become a high-ranking Chinese tourism official  hopes to patch his country's tattered image in the wake of the violent  crackdown on student protesters in Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> "China needs to understand the world and the world needs to understand China,"  said Xi Zhenhuan, deputy general manager of China Swan International Tours of  Beijing.  </P> <P> Xi, who carries a generous supply of lapel pins of the crossed flags of China  and the United States, said the Chinese are becoming increasingly aware of the  power that their country carries.  </P> <P> "A country of more than 1 billion people has to do something for the world," he  said.  </P> <P> "Travel is a very good way for people to understand one another and develop  social contacts," said Xi, flashing a broad smile. "I have friends all over the  world."  </P> <P> Xi has been working to open China up to foreign tourists for more than a  quarter century, long before the first Americans were allowed behind what was  then called the Bamboo Curtain.  </P> <P> Xi, 57, came to California to appear at half a dozen seminars organized by an  American travel wholesaler, World Travel Consultants Inc. of Glendale. Speaking  through a translator, he assured the audiences of retail travel agents that the  climate in China has calmed and that foreigners are welcome.  </P> <P> Tourists have been able to do pretty much as they please since "the June 4  incident," he said.  </P> <P> Xi is China's highest-level travel industry official to be dispatched to the  United States since students and others demanding democratic reforms were shot  and killed in Beijing and other cities this past summer.  </P> <P> "I don't think that tourists have had any problems since (the crackdown)," Xi  said.  </P></p>

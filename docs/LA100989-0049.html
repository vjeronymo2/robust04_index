			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE ;  </P> <P> DRUG INHIBITS AIDS VIRUS  </P> <P> A drug discovered in a Texas laboratory appears in early tests to inhibit  growth of the AIDS virus and may show promise in preventing healthy people from  contracting the disease, the laboratory said last week.  </P> <P> Bill McAnalley, Carrington's research director, said the studies showed that  the drug seems to boost the body's ability to fight the AIDS virus even in  healthy patients. "The drug turns on the immune system and the effects last  several days from just one dose."  </P> <P> The drug, whose brand name is Carrisyn, was given orally to healthy male  patients. Blood samples were then taken from the patients and put into test  tubes. The AIDS virus was then added to the blood and the growth of the virus  was measured.  </P> <P> The virus spread less quickly than it would have in blood from men who did not  take the drug, McAnalley said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-THRIVING EMPIRE SAVINGS SEEKING FEDERAL HELP TO SURVIVE  </P> <P> Empire of America Federal Savings Bank, the nation's 12th largest savings  institution by assets, grew quickly in the 1980s by gobbling up 13 failing  S&amp;Ls with the support of federal regulators.  </P> <P> Empire, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based concern that was seeking to expand across the  country, bought S&amp;Ls in Texas, Florida, New York, Michigan and California.  The California acquisitions were to serve as a springboard for a major push  into the state by Empire, which set up local headquarters in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> But now it's Empire that needs support -- lots of it. Saddled with major losses  stemming from its acquisitions, the $10.3-billion (assets) thrift recently said  it is insolvent and is looking for federal help to survive.  </P> <P> On Sept. 28, Empire announced that its stockholders' equity -- that is, the  amount of its assets minus its liabilities, or net worth -- had vanished  because of the thrift's ongoing losses.  </P> <P> Despite its problems, Empire noted that customers' deposits, up to $100,000 per  account, remain insured by the U.S. government. Thus far regulators have not  seized Empire as part of the recently enacted federal savings-and-loan bailout  program, which is being overseen by a new agency called the Resolution Trust  Corp.  </P> <P> The federal government might provide Empire with the necessary money to stay in  business; then again, Empire might eventually be seized by the government or  merged with another institution instead.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it is business as usual at Empire's 17 branches in California,  including those in Fountain Valley, Costa Mesa and Irvine, said Jeffrey M.  Reinhardt, division marketing officer for Empire's California unit.  </P> <P> The offices in Fountain Valley and Irvine were picked up when S&amp;L  regulators sold the insolvent Equitable Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine to Empire  in March, 1987. Equitable also had an office in Bellflower, which Empire  operates. The Costa Mesa office was converted to an S&amp;L from a branch of  Empire's Pacific Thrift &amp; Loan subsidiary.  </P> <P> As for Empire's 125 workers in California, there is "no change in their  status," Reinhardt said.  </P> <P> In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Empire lost $209.3 million, after losing  $57.3 million for all of 1988. The red ink wiped out its capital, leaving it  with $53.5 million more in liabilities than assets.  </P> <P> What went wrong? Empire tried to expand its banking empire in a hurry by buying  sickly S&amp;Ls, and in doing so it ran into a growing problem with the  accounting rules governing takeovers. As Empire bought these S&amp;Ls, it found  that the S&amp;Ls' liabilities -- which mostly consist of deposits and so can  be withdrawn at any time -- exceeded the value of the S&amp;Ls' assets by $926  million.  </P> <P> To make its accounts balance, Empire added $926 million of "good will" to its  assets. In accounting, good will is a non-cash asset, yet it must be written  off, or amortized, over a number of years as a charge against the company's  income. So every year, Empire found that good will was draining $95 million to  $110 million from its profit.  </P> <P> At the same time, Empire was unable to generate enough earnings from its  operations to offset the "good-will drag," as Empire calls it. And the  resulting losses steadily eroded Empire's net worth.  </P> <P> Empire's descent into insolvency was not unexpected, however. In July, when the  company reported a second-quarter loss of $54.2 million, it said continuing  losses would eat up its net worth by the end of 1989.  </P> <P> Also, Empire had asked the federal government in February for $900 million to  overcome the problems stemming from its purchase of the troubled thrifts.  Empire said that if the government came through with that support, Empire's  investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, hoped to raise an additional $675  million from private investors.  </P> <P> The cash infusions then would have enabled Empire to meet new, stricter capital  minimums required under the new S&amp;L legislation. In general, capital  reflects the net worth of an S&amp;L, and the tougher capital requirements are  meant to strengthen the thrifts' cushion against future losses.  </P> <P> Empire's initial plea for cash was made to the Federal Savings and Loan  Insurance Corp., but that agency was abolished under the S&amp;L bailout plan.  So on Sept. 20, Empire filed a new application for aid with the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp., which is helping direct the bailout program.  </P> <P> In its latest application, Empire did not list the dollar amount it needs.  Carol G. Corr, an Empire senior vice president, said the exact amount would  depend on when the government decided to help. At that point, all of Empire's  assets would be rechecked for their current market value, and then the amount  would be established, she said.  </P> <P> There is no guarantee, however, that the government will step in.  </P> <P> But Corr said Empire does not regret its move into California.  </P> <P> "I could not say we're sorry we went into California or Texas or Florida," she  said. At the time, the mergers "were then appropriate and made sense," but  since then "a lot of things have happened to change the value of the mergers.  I'm certain there are no regrets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE O.C. ANGLE  </P> <P> Empire has 17 branches in California, including those in Costa Mesa, Fountain  Valley and Irvine. The latter two were acquired in the March, 1987, sale by  federal regulators of the insolvent Equitable Savings &amp; Loan, based in  Irvine. Equitable also had an office in Bellflower, which Empire operates.  </P></p>

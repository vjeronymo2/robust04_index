			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> JOHNNY GRIFFIN GIVES A LESSON IN PURE SOUND  </P> <P> "Jazz Music!" exclaimed tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin with a broad smile at  the conclusion of his scintillating first set at Catalina Bar and Grill in  Hollywood on Tuesday.  </P> <P> It was both a statement of what Griffin and his crew -- Michael Weiss (piano),  Dennis Irwin (bass) and Kenny Washington (drums) -- had just played as it was a  joyous exultation. Griffin is of the school where jazz means one thing: pure,  unadulterated cooking music where pretty notes reign.  </P> <P> Griffin's five-tune set, which began a five-night engagement, opened at a  near-gallop with "Just Friends" and closed with an even-faster "Hot Sake."  Sandwiched in between were Thelonious Monk's, "Coming on the Hudson," the  enchanting Billy Strayhorn ballad "Isfahan"; and the standard, "If I Should  Lose You."  </P> <P> Griffin, a prodigious improviser, produced a comely, robust sound, consistently  employed dynamics and displayed excellent taste. "Isfahan" was Griffin at his  rhapsodic best.  </P> <P> The rhythm team was first-rate. Weiss, a Bud Powell disciple, turned in ace  performances, Washington crackled, and Irwin played a brace of listenable  essays.  </P> <P> Griffin is a magical musician who can take the basics of melody, harmony,  rhythm and form and turn them into something beautiful and wondrous.ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

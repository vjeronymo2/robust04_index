			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jochen Piest: "`Superplague' for the Enemy"] </F>   [Text] According to the London SUNDAY TIMES, Moscow has  developed a fatal biological weapon and is continuing work on  it. The denial by the Russian defense ministry sounded like the  old stuff from the times of the Cold War: "It is all a  never-ending campaign by the West, with the obvious aim of  diverting attention from its own biological armament programs."    The report says that there is no remedy for the Russian  "Super Plague": Spread with bombs and missiles, the newly-bred  bacteria causes a terrible death, with blood spitting,  poisoning, and decomposition of the lungs. Within a few days,  entire areas can be "cleansed" of enemies, while cities,  factories, and transport routes fall into the victors' hands  intact. Russian laboratories can breed 200 kilograms of the  deadly bacteria in a week -- enough to kill half a million  people.    The Soviet Union was among the countries that signed the  convention banning biological weapons in 1972. Today, the  Moscow defense ministry does not deny that the bacterial bomb  was developed in spite of this agreement.    In the 1980's, 25,000 people, including top biologists, in  18  research institutes and six factories worked for the "Bio  Remedy" program. Meanwhile, former President Gorbachev was  touring the West, denying the existence of any biological  weapons programs, and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for  his disarmament initiative. His successor Yeltsin admitted  possession of the banned weapon and stopped the program by  presidential resolution no. 390 in April 1992.    Even Yeltsin's environment adviser, Aleksey Yablokov, doubts  that the generals are observing the resolution: "The field of  biological and chemical weapons is extremely difficult to  control. Heaven knows what is going on in the individual  laboratories."    If anyone from these secret laboratories dares speak about  their work, they are not safe from persecution in modern Russia  -- as experienced by Vil Mirzayanov, a professor of chemistry.  From 1965 to 1992 he conducted research into chemical weapons;  and in 1992 he disclosed that the Russian Army, contrary to  Yeltsin's assurances, is having a new generation of chemical  weapons developed -- the signing of the Paris convention on  banning these weapons in early 1993 did not make any difference  to that program.    Publishing these details in the MOSCOW NEWS put him straight  into prison, from where he was released only after massive  public protests. He was not charged with spreading false  statements, but with betrayal of state secrets.    As evidence, chemists from the army stated in a secrete  document that Mirzayanov's claims were both true and secret.    This document, which has been made available to STERN,  proves: Russia is developing a new binary chemical weapon. Its  vicious effect only develops on hitting its target, when two  chemicals combine to a deathly poison. Since each of the two  substances is harmless on its own, they easily circumvent the  Paris Convention. "Our army does not want to disarm. They only  want to get rid of their old garbage," Mirzayanov said.    With disposing the inherited weapons alone, the generals  would be more than busy: According to official statements,  40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons are stored in Russian arsenals  -- the Americans have some 30,000 tonnes.    Meanwhile, the Russian Army is keeping its "chemical troops"  in shape. Sixty kilometers east of Moscow, soldiers are  exercising a chemical weapons attack on an old model: They are  attacking half-timbered houses, a country guest house and a  church -- of a small German town.</p>

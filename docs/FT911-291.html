			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Poland to discuss arrears settlement POLAND HAS indicated it is willing to negotiate a settlement of its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 588m) interest arrears owed to commercial banks before starting talks on a comprehensive agreement over its medium- and long-term bank debt. The move, at a meeting with leading bankers in Frankfurt last week, marks a significant shift in the Polish government's negotiating position. It was previously unwilling to negotiate over arrears except as part of a comprehensive debt agreement. The government, which has not paid any interest on its bank debt since the start of last year, also offered last week a Dollars 100m interest payment and said it would deposit 20 per cent of interest going forward into a special account at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. Banks are holding out for more, but the offer has opened the way for progress to a comprehensive debt agreement, including debt-cut options where loans will be exchanged for concessional bonds, bankers say. More talks with Poland's bank creditor group are expected this month. Poland's bank debt comprises about Dollars 10bn of its total Dollars 45bn foreign debt. The US and other nations have pressed the banks to match a debt write-off of at least 50 per cent granted by official creditors of the Paris Club. But many banks resist such a large write-off.</p>

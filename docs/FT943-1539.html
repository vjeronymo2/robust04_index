			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Higher margins lift PizzaExpress An improvement in margins in all divisions of the PizzaExpress restaurant chain helped lift pre-tax profits at the year end by 75 per cent and turnover by 41 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 5.56m, including a Pounds 858,000 contribution from discontinued operations. Turnover rose from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 26.8m with sales at company restaurants, which numbered 36 at the year end, rising by 14.5 per cent. PizzaExpress came to the market in February last year in a reverse takeover by Star Computer Group. In February this year Star Computer was sold for Pounds 2.22m. Mr David Page, managing director, said the Covent Garden and Salisbury restaurants had got off to a 'spectacular' start. Margins in all operating divisions had improved in the last year, although the company was mindful of the 'value versus profit' equation, he said. Mr Glen Tomlinson, finance director, said restaurant margins had improved from 12 per cent to 20 per cent and from 16 per cent to 19 per cent in the wholesale division. The improvement in restaurant margins was mainly due to increased sales combined with cuts in labour costs, he said. Eight new restaurants were opened and five were acquired from franchises. Capital expenditure stood at Pounds 4.5m and the average build cost of new restaurants stood at Pounds 278,000. Franchise fee income from the 37 franchised restaurants was 10.5 per cent higher than last year. A further two franchises opened in Leicester and Southampton in July. Spend per customer rose from Pounds 8.40 to Pounds 8.53. Mr Page said a target of 86 restaurants had been set for 1995, more than half of which would be company owned. New sites had been identified in six cities for company restaurants. He said the company was aware that restaurants within greater London showed a 'more immediate profit' than those outside. But PizzaExpress was commited to 'spreading the gospel of good pizza throughout Great Britain'. Earnings per share rose from 3.6p to 6.5p. A final dividend of 1p (nil) was proposed.</p>

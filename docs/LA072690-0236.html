			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABC TO OFFER NEWS SHOWS TO EUROPE OUTLETS  </P> <P> ABC News, seeking new overseas markets for its programs, said Wednesday it has  been showing European broadcasters "Nightline" and will do the same with four  more programs, including "World News Tonight."  </P> <P> The programs are being sent via satellite to cable and TV companies in 23  countries in Western and Eastern Europe, including Rupert Murdoch's new Sky  Television direct broadcast satellite based in London, ABC said.  </P> <P> Once the European television officials have had a chance to look at ABC's  programs, the network's executives will hold discussions with the companies  interested in carrying them, an ABC News spokesman said.  </P> <P> The evening newscasts of NBC and CBS and ABC's "Nightline" already are carried  in some overseas markets, including Japan.  </P> <P> However, the top-rated "World News Tonight" is not yet broadcast overseas, said  the ABC spokesman, Scott Richardson.  </P> <P> The new satellite transmission of "Nightline" to European broadcasters began on  July 2. The other four programs will be shown during the next few months, but  no schedule for their transmission has been set.  </P> <P> In addition to "World News Tonight," the programs are "This Week with David  Brinkley," "The Health Show" and "Business World."  </P> <P> ABC's move is the latest of recent efforts by all three U.S. network news  divisions to find new markets and revenues at a time the networks are losing  audiences to cable and other viewing alternatives.  </P> <P> According to CBS, Dan Rather's "CBS Evening News" is seen in France, Italy and  Japan. Tom Brokaw's "NBC Nightly News" is carried in Japan, New Zealand,  Australia, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain.  </P> <P> In addition to Japan, ABC's "Nightline" is carried by broadcasters in New  Zealand and Australia, and talks are under way to have it shown in Italy and in  Taiwan, according to a network spokesman.  </P> <P> Ted Turner's 24-hour Cable News Network, an early entry in the global news  market, is seen in 90 countries.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`When the Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything'" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The slogan "When the  Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything!" is seen anywhere in  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    The slogan reflects the revolutionary will and stamina of  the  people who are determined to share the destiny with the Workers'  Party of Korea (WPK) forever.    The Korean people have moved mountains and harnessed the sea  to carry out the party's decisions, displaying a revolutionary  spirit in the historical course of socialist construction.    Suffice it to take a glance at economic construction.    When the WPK initiated the construction of the West Sea  barrage which is of great importance for socialist economic  construction, the Korean people and People's Army soldiers  accepted the initiative as their own and turned out in its  construction.    It was a vast and difficult project which would have taken  dozens of years with the established method. The project  included the building of dam eight kilometres long across the  sea scores of metres deep, three locks which can let ships of  2,000 to 50,000 ton class pass simultaneously, tens of sluice  gates, railways and motorways on the dam.    The soldiers and civilian builders moved ten odd mountains,  disposed of 15 million cubic metres of earth, tamped two million  cubic metres of concrete and collected and transported 16  million cubic metres of stones and gravels to build the dam of  eternal value in five years with their own design, technology,  materials and strength. With the construction of the barrage,  the coastline diminished 20 kilometres and nine islands  including Ok and Horang islands disappeared.    The West Sea barrage is a precious product of the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the  Korean people who unconditionally accept and carry out the  decisions of the party.    When the party intended to make a 10,000-ton press, workers  of Korea did it without hesitation. The workers of the  Ryongsong combined general bureau of machinery wrought a miracle  by completing the processing and assembling of the 10,000-ton  press and successfully test-operating it in one year or more,  though it would have taken 4-5 years according to the experience.    When the party decided to launch a "200-day campaign" to  glorify the 40th anniversary of the DPRK founding as a grand  festival of victors, "200-day campaign youth death-defying corps  of loyalty" were organised at more than 3,000 units across the  country in the first ten days of the campaign. The entire  people rose up as one and achieved great successes in all  sectors of the national economy, giving full play to the  revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work.    Dressing plant No. 3 of Komdok with a capacity of 10 million  tons built in one year on top of a mountain 1,200 metres above  sea level, the Sangwon cement complex with a capacity of  millions of tons, the Pyongbuk smeltery, a powerful non-ferrous  metal producer, and many other edifices of eternal value are all  associated with the feats of the Korean people and People's Army  soldiers who accept the party's decisions as their revolutionary  will.</p>

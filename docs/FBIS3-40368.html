			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thierry Mahe: "Renault's Laboratory On Wheels, </F> Pasha"; first paragraph is INDUSTRIES ET TECHNIQUES introduction]    [Text] Engineers at the Aubevoye test center in Eure are  validating active suspension technology by mounting each wheel  on a computer-controlled hydraulic jack.    There are no highway signs to guide you to Renault's test  center in Aubevoye (Eure), where the manufacturer guards its  secrets carefully behind high hedges. The center is where  Renault tests the road handling of its prototypes. It also  validates there--with the agreement of the Rueil research  center--the new "skid resistance" technologies (suspension,  steering, braking, etc.) that will be standard on mass-produced  cars within 10 years. The suspension system of the Safrane (AMV)  passed its final examination at Aubevoye. The center will also  produce Renault's first "real" active suspension system. Nicolas  Varlot, the head of test systems development, explains.  "Renault's Safrane or Citroen's Xantia do not, strictly  speaking, have active suspension systems. Their shock absorbers  have simply been altered, without any addition of energy.  Outside of the Formula 1, the only example of active suspension  is Nissan's Infinity." Aubevoye has some strange-looking mutants  on its roads, including an R25 with an oddly upswept front hood  and a license plate that reads "Pasha", for "Active Hydraulic  Suspension Automobile Prototype." Each of Pasha's wheels has a  computer-driven hydraulic jack, and its rear trunk contains a  powerful (32 Mips) computer and an array of electronic boards.  Under the vehicle's front hood snakes a mass of hydraulic  circuits, and each suspension jack features three sensors to  monitor distance traveled, speed, and effort. Computations  consume a total of 32 input parameters. Pasha is a real  laboratory on wheels, designed to simulate all types of  suspension. Its has a steering counterpart, called Dirac. Says  Nicolas Varlot, "We have been testing Pasha since the beginning  of the year. By mid-1994, we will have worked up a  specifications sheet, and by late 1994, we will have preliminary  vehicles." Safrane's replacement may sport an active suspension  system...    Two parameters can be used to synthesize suspension  behavior:  wheel wobble, a safety factor; and autobody cycling, which is  linked to comfort (cycling = the oscillations to which the body  is subjected). Pasha can modulate these two parameters over a  very broad range. Depending on adjustments, passengers can feel  they are riding in a 2 hp, or a luxury limousine! Renault  engineers are experimenting with 16 types of servocontrol, one  of which will be selected as offering the best tradeoff between  comfort and safety. Assessing those two variables still provides  a great deal of food for thought. Francois Hebert, head of the  electronics/data-processing lab, stresses, "With Pasha, we can  even induce a counter-rolling motion. When the vehicle turns, it  leans in the opposite direction to that of most cars! Is this  good? Reducing or reversing rolling motion may be a good idea to  help cars grip the road, but the change skews the perception of  the driver. The same goes for the ABS, which makes people safer  and encourages them to drive faster. It's dangerous, especially  when the driver switches back to a regular model!"    The Aubevoye center is involved in every step of creating a  vehicle, starting from the very basic research level, during the  technology scouting stage. It remains active during the  pre-project phase "before the vehicle even gets to the drawing  board", and again during development of the prototypes. "Our job  is to work up the specifications sheet and check that the  prototype is valid. One of our suppliers (Valeo, Bendix, etc.)  then makes it. In return, we inspect the equipment," says  Nicolas Varlot.    One of the peculiar features of electronic equipment is that  it tends to break down. Annoying when the automatic window  controls are involved, failures are catastrophic if they affect  the steering, braking, or suspension systems! "Hence the  importance of strategies involving graceful degradation, which  occupies between 60 and 80 percent of the computer's memory.  Engineers must, for example, anticipate one of the suspensions  being knocked out--and design the other three to adjust  accordingly!" adds Nicolas Varlot.    Will numerical simulation of vehicle behavior make certain  road tests obsolete? "It's an old question.... We thought  structural computations were going to eliminate crash  studies--but they didn't at all. The more you refine a  simulation, the more new parameters pop up! At best, road  handling simulators will eliminate certain standard tests."  Concludes Varlot, "A problem solved raises other that need  solving. When the ocean recedes, it exposes new shoals!"  <H5>  Boxed Material: Using Electronics in Testing </H5>   Francois Hebert's electronics lab has a staff of six and two  electronics CAD stations that run the Cadence program. Cadence  can be used to design and simulate digital/analog boards. Says  Francois Hebert, "One of the product's great features is its  behavioral simulation module, which enables us to close the  simulation loop." Indeed, the sim module can be used to model a  mechanical device--jack, steering column--governed by linear or  non-linear laws. The laboratory designs between 15 and 20 boards  a year, each of which requires about three months of study. "By  extending the limits of electronic board simulation, we have  reduced the number of touchups per board from 4 or 5 to 1.2 or  1.4. With each touchup costing 30,000 or 40,000 French francs,  CAD quickly pays for itself."  <H5>  Boxed Material: Two Facilities for Torturing Prototypes </H5>   Renault has two facilities for prototype testing. The first,  at Lardy (Essonne), specializes in engines, while the second, in  Aubevoye (Eure), focuses on skid resistance (chassis,  suspension, brake system, etc.) and vehicle dynamics. Aubevoye  was created in 1982 and employs about 300 people. It boasts 21  kilometers of roadways to test speed, road handling, skid  resistance, comfort, and endurance. The test roads recreate  pothole conditions, high-speed national highways, city streets,  and mountain roads. The center has an acoustical bench and a  climate wind tunnel.</p>

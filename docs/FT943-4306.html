			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Glaxo obviously disappointed with its losses in the bond market, but the deceleration in sales growth is a longer-term worry. Growth in sales volumes, excluding currencies, declined from 13 per cent in the first half to 9 per cent during the second six months. Four out of five of the group's top products recorded lower growth rates. The deceleration is likely to continue. The most serious problem is Zantac, which continues to account for 43 per cent of sales. Zantac's growth rate actually improved in the second half, but such increases are clearly unsustainable. Competitors such as Astra's Losec are gobbling market share. In the US, generic versions of Tagamet - which did not have time to hit sales last financial year - are set to make their mark during the current 12 months. Most ominous is the continuing danger of direct US generic competition to Zantac by 1996. Once promising new products will not adequately compensate when Zantac sales start to decline. Zofran has peaked only four years after launch. Second half sales were below those in the first six months. Imigran and Serevent continue to grow strongly but from a low base. There is a significant possibility of group turnover plateauing from 1996. None of this is the fault of Glaxo's management. It continues to excel in the discovery, development and marketing of innovative treatments. On the earnings side, it is helping itself by slowing increases in R&amp;D. But Glaxo will remain weak as long as it remains so dependent on Zantac. It could afford to get round the problem by buying another pharmaceuticals company. There are still opportunities in the US.</p>

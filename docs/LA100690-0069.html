			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOES SAY MAILERS HELP INCUMBENTS;  </P> <P> FRANKING: A STUDY SHOWS THAT REPS. GALLEGLY AND LAGOMARSINO SPENT $185,179 AND  $121,457 IN 1989 ON WHAT A CHALLENGER CALLS SELF-AGGRANDIZEMENT.  </P> <P> Democratic challengers on Friday accused Congressmen Elton Gallegly and Robert  J. Lagomarsino of using taxpayer-supported mailers to strengthen their 1990  reelection campaigns, and of being among the biggest spenders in the House of  Representatives on newsletters to constituents.  </P> <P> Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) spent $185,179 and Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) $121,457 on  mass mailings in 1989, which ranked them fifth and 14th among California's 44  House members in 1989, says a new study by a national taxpayers group.  </P> <P> Citing that study and her own analysis of mailings this year, Anita Perez  Ferguson said Friday that Lagomarsino has spent $289,000 over the last two  years on mailers.  </P> <P> "My concern is that this is basically self-aggrandizing junk mail," Ferguson, a  former aide to state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), said after a Ventura  news conference.  </P> <P> Richard D. Freiman, an Agoura attorney and TV writer opposing Gallegly, said  the incumbent's reported spending on five mass mailings in 1989 was a waste of  money.  </P> <P> "These are puff pieces for Gallegly," he said. "Most people throw them out  because they don't have any information that is important or necessary in  them."  </P> <P> Controversy surrounding the so-called franking privilege, under which Congress  spent more than $100 million last year on mailings, led to extensive reform in  the U.S. Senate in 1989 and to lesser restrictions in the House of  Representatives.  </P> <P> Spokesmen for Lagomarsino and Gallegly said the congressmen both supported  those reforms, voting to reduce the number of mass mailings by House members  from six to three a year beginning in 1990.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino "would have supported eliminating them completely" if that had come  to a vote, said John Doherty of the congressman's Washington staff.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino and Gallegly voted to limit the mail privilege -- a popular  congressional benefit since 1793 -- even though both remain convinced that the  newsletters are useful tools in communicating with constituents, their  spokesmen said.  </P> <P> "The congressman believes it's an important way of keeping in touch with the  district," said John Frith, Gallegly's press secretary.  </P> <P> Frith and Doherty said surveys have shown repeatedly that residents of their  districts like the newsletters and want them to continue. They said, however,  that only about 10% to 15% of households in their districts respond to such  surveys.  </P> <P> "As long as it's there and our constituents want to have it, we'll keep using  it," Doherty said.  </P> <P> The cost of mass mailings by Gallegly and Lagomarsino, who represent the two  congressional districts that overlap Ventura County, was reported late last  month by the National Taxpayers Union, a 200,000-member nonprofit group that  lobbies for reduced government spending.  </P> <P> Bill Pierce, spokesman for the group, said the study shows that the average  expense by a congressman on newsletters in 1989 was 31 cents per household. By  comparison, Lagomarsino spent 37 cents for each household in his district and  Gallegly 71 cents, Pierce said.  </P> <P> Pierce said the figures in his group's study are not precise, because the exact  spending of House members on mass mailings are confidential. But most,  including Gallegly and Lagomarsino, confirmed the number of mailings from their  offices. A minimum figure was derived from that.  </P> <P> Frith acknowledged that Gallegly sent five of the six mass mailings allowed in  1989, as reported in the study. But he said it is somewhat flawed because it is  not exact.  </P> <P> Doherty said Lagomarsino did send three mass mailers in 1989, as reported in  the study. But he challenged Ferguson's claim that the congressman had spent  another $160,000 this year on six mass mailings. He said that Ferguson has no  way of knowing how much Lagomarsino has spent and that he has sent out only  three newsletters to all households in his district.  </P> <P> Three additional mailings were sent out over the summer to thousands of people  who have expressed concern about specific issues, he acknowledged.  </P></p>

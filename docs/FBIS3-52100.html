			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Arafat's political adviser Nabil Sha'th by </F> MBC correspondent Mu'tazz al-Dimirdash in Cairo on 2  January--recorded]    [Text] [Sha'th] The trip to Tunis by brother Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi and the criticism voiced in the territories now  and then, constructive and otherwise, are the lawful right of  the Palestinian people and all their leaders inside and outside  the territories. This criticism indeed has nothing whatsoever to  do with the recent crisis. In this crisis, all the Palestinian  people stand by the negotiating delegation and the Palestinian  leadership to establish the Palestinian rights.    [Al-Dimirdash] The crisis Dr. Sha'th is talking about is  represented in the pressure the Israeli side is putting on the  PLO to accept Cairo proposals. Are there new bases for resuming  negotiations this time?    [Sha'th] Our constant and basic commitment is to the  Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September.  There is no specific document called the Cairo document. We  worked out a document in Norway that outlined the points of  agreement and disagreement. There is no similar document  developed in Cairo. There were minutes dictated by Minister  Peres. The next day, we received a document totally different  from those minutes. We sent a correction and later sent  Palestinian ideas.    [Al-Dimirdash] What is the PLO's stand on Rabin's hardline  statements today, in which he implied that negotiations might  not be resumed if the Palestinians do not accept the draft  agreement?    [Sha'th] We do not accept ultimatums. If the Israelis halt  negotiations, we will go back to the two sponsors who signed the  agreement that should have been implemented on a specific date.  The Israelis have shown no commitment until now. We do not  want to escalate the situation. But we reject the Israeli  escalation and want real negotiations that lead to an acceptable  agreement.</p>

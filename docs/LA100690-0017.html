			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTE OVER PLAY  </P> <P> I am tired of the religious bigots who keep trying to set the rules for what I  should or should not see in a play at a theater in Costa Mesa. I am referring  to the controversy surrounding "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You"  at the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse.  </P> <P> I think that the time has come for those religious tyrants, whose religious  "sensitivities" are offended by anything and everything that does not agree  100% with their little narrow-minded view of Cosmic Realities, to know that  there are many ex-churchmen, like myself, who are offended by religious  censorship and fanaticism.  </P> <P> The zealots, who would like to forbid me and anyone else from seeing this play,  should realize that they are only making more and more enemies in the artistic  community.  </P> <P> ALAN ALBERT SNOW  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

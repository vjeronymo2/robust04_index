			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / JAL to cut investment and lose 5,000 jobs Japan Airlines is to cut its workforce by 5,000 and halve investment, as part of a four-year restructuring aimed at returning the company to profit. Yesterday it was presenting its unions with a plan to reduce its workforce of almost 22,000 to 17,000 by the end of fiscal 1997 through voluntary retirement, curtailment of new hirings and transfers to subsidiaries. Restructuring at the airline, Japan's largest, which last year reported a Y54.9bn (Dollars 508m) pre-tax loss, will cut capital spending to Y440bn from a planned Y840bn in the next four years. In addition, it aims to cut a further Y100bn from costs in the next fiscal year. Wages, which were limited to a 1 per cent increase last year, could be frozen this year. For the second year running JAL may not hire new stewardesses. JAL has been hurt by a downturn in business and first-class travel as a result of Japan's economic slowdown, increased competition on international routes, particularly from lower-cost US airlines, and a high cost structure. The restructuring reflects a growing recognition by the group - which has often been criticised for being an oversized high-cost company - that it must lower costs and raise its international competitiveness if it is to survive. The move was welcomed on the Tokyo stock market where JAL's share price rose Y10 on the news to close at Y640. Cuts in capital spending will range across all areas from aircraft to investment in facilities at the New Kansai International Airport scheduled to open in September. Orders for aircraft have been rescheduled so JAL will be taking delivery of 28 aircraft, six fewer than planned. JAL will order smaller aircraft to raise its share of the domestic market. The latest restructuring follows a survival plan introduced last year and extends measures JAL has already adopted. It also plans to maximise savings by moving more operations to low-cost off-shore bases and extending the use of low-cost subsidiaries on low-yield routes. The union representing cabin crew criticised the moves. It said it could not accept a plan which made employees pay for management failures.</p>

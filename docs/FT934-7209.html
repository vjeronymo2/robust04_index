			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (5): Secret behind Chanel's success - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the high-profile world of luxury goods / Alain Wertheimer ALAIN Wertheimer is one of the richest and most powerful men in the luxury industry, yet almost nothing is known about him. Wertheimer is the sole owner of Chanel, the Paris fashion house founded in Deauville during the First World War by Coco Chanel which is the role model for luxury companies worldwide. Yet while his peers blow air kisses to their favourite designers from the front rows of the couture shows, Wertheimer has done everything he can to ensure that he is left to lead his life - and run his business - in deepest secrecy. Wertheimer never gives interviews. There is no reference to him in the French Who's Who. Chanel (ever so politely) refuses to release any information about its owner. It even pays a special annual fee so that the accounts of its Swiss holding company are free from public scrutiny. This super-secretive style seems to have done no harm to Wertheimer, nor to Chanel, in the publicity-hungry world of luxury. When he took over Chanel in 1974 its only real asset was Chanel No 5, which had been one of the world's best-selling perfumes ever since its launch in 1924 when Pierre Wertheimer, Alain's grandfather and one of Coco's admirers, bought the rights to her first fragrance. But the fashion house itself was, as an editor of the era put it, like 'Seconal City' with 'one foot in the grave and another on a banana peel'. Wertheimer's solution was to appoint Karl Lagerfeld, the German, as chief designer of Chanel. The theory was that Lagerfeld's collections would bring back Chanel's elan and generate pages of free publicity, allowing Wertheimer to make even more money by selling its scents and accessories. The theory has paid off. Wertheimer has turned Chanel into a company with sales of around Dollars 500m (Pounds 331.1m) a year - without forfeiting his privacy.</p>

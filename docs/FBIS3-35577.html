			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] Moscow has rejected a report that Russia has  participated in DPRK's nuclear weapons development project.    (Walentina Korikayev), commentator of this broadcasting  station, wrote as follows: The Press and Information Bureau  under the Russian Defense Ministry distributed a written  refutation. The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN has spread a  groundless rumor.    The weekly said that the Center for Military Strategic  Analysis at the Russian General Staff under the Russian Defense  Ministry prepared the secret report that 160 Russian scholars  participated in the DPRK's nuclear program and manufactured  nuclear warheads.    The report also said that Nodong No. 1 -- the medium-range  missile for delivery of such warheads -- was manufactured with  participation of Russian experts.    According to a statement of the Russian Defense Ministry,  there is no center for military strategic analysis in the  Defense Ministry. There is a research institute for military  strategy that belongs to the General Staff. However, the  institute has never made such a report. Precisely, everything in  the report is false, so one could conclude that the report from  Japan is false. Information related to military affairs has  been continually distorted.    For example, a rumor is circulating that Russia is  attempting  to repay loans to the ROK with military technology. The press in  Seoul is spreading such a rumor.    The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that it has no official  document stipulating that Russia is going to sell ultramodern  weapons and to produce them jointly. Russia has no contract to  pay loans with military technology.    People think that someone is attempting to drag Russia into  complex conditions on the Korean peninsula.</p>

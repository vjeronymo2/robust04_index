			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Crucial point Sir, Your account of the financial restructuring at Mrs Fields (UK company news, February 17) omits one crucial point: why did an American company, which, to the best of my recollection, at the time of its stock market debut had no UK outlets, choose to list on London's USM rather than in New York, with all the complications stemming from a share price in pence and a balance sheet and income statement in dollars? The obvious answer would seem to be that the USM's disclosure requirements were less onerous, making life easier for companies, but more difficult for investors. If shareholders had stopped to ask that simple question, they might not have got involved. Institutions should have known better. Elizabeth Balsom, 16 Coalecroft Road, London SW15 6LP</p>

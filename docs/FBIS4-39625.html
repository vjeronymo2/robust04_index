			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the news segment of </F> the "Dalniy Vostok" program]    [Text] Parliamentary hearings devoted to an analysis of  the condition and problems of the Russian state border have  ended. The State Duma Committee for Geopolitics adopted a  decision to set up a working group of qualified experts to  comprehensively assess the possibility of concluding a peace  treaty with Japan, taking into consideration the 1956  declaration on Shikotan and Habomai.    As you know Russia signed this declaration in which the  turnover of the islands of Shikotan and Habomai to Japan is  stipulated as a condition for the signing of the peace treaty.  State Duma deputies do not rule out the possibility of finding  a compromise version in the territorial dispute with Japan.</p>

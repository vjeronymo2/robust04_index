			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a recent nationwide opinion poll  conducted by ASAHI SHIMBUN on 8 and 9 May, 53 percent of  respondents said "it was appropriate" for the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] to leave the coalition administration,  while 26 percent said "it was not appropriate." Thus, the  approval rate of the SDPJ's decision was much higher than the  disapproval rate. Among the respondents who support the SDPJ,  57 percent highly evaluated the party's secession from the  coalition while 29 percent were critical of the secession.    In terms of party affiliation, it is noteworthy that 76  percent of supporters for the Japan Communist Party [JCP]  welcomed the SDPJ's secession from the coalition. Next to this  figure, 67 percent of Sakigake [Harbinger] supporters and 57  percent of Liberal Democratic Party supporters welcomed the  SDPJ's action.    On the other hand, disapproval of the SDPJ's secession was  conspicuously noted among supporters for the ruling coalition  parties of the Tsutomu Hata cabinet. For example, the SDPJ's  secession from the coalition was criticized by 42 percent of  Democratic Socialist Party supporters, by 41 percent of Komeito  supporters, and by 36 percent of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  supporters.</p>

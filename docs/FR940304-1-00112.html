			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association also commented that two-stage or modulating burners reduce the energy efficiency of direct heating equipment. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, No. 40 at 6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's comment. When incorporated into a typical gravity or forced-air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct heater, i.e., heaters that are currently being manufactured, two-stage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and modulating burners actually reduce the energy efficiency of direct heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. Two-stage and modulating burners which are currently manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulate the gas flow but not the air flow. Excess air is induced at lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas-flow rates, resulting in lower combustion efficiencies when compared to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal or maximum gas flow rate. Because of this, typical heaters equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with two-stage or modulating burners will always have a lower energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency, as measured by the DOE test procedure, than heaters equipped with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single-stage burners. The Department is not aware of any two-stage or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modulating burners that regulate both the gas and air flow. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes however, that it is possible to regulate the air flow being drawn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into a two-stage or modulating burner if the direct heater is also equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a two-speed or variable-speed combustion fan, i.e., induced or forced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft system. With a multi-speed combustion fan, a low fan speed can be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to reduce the excess air that would normally occur at low gas flow rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the steady-state efficiency that occurs at the high gas flow rate of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-stage or modulating burner can be maintained at its lower gas flow rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since currently manufactured two-stage and modulating burners actually reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy efficiency in typical direct heating equipment, DOE is considering them  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a design option only if they are incorporated into a heater already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with a multiple-speed induced or forced draft combustion system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy said that DOE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should consider two-speed or variable-speed blowers. (American Council for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The practical application of two-speed or variable-speed blowers is with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-stage or modulating burners. When heating loads are low, both the burner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate and the blower speed could be reduced. This would prevent cycling of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit and reduce large fluctuations in room temperature. In addition, overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy consumption could be reduced. As with two-stage and modulating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burners, two-speed and variable-speed blowers will also be considered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department only on heaters already equipped with a multiple-speed induced or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forced draft combustion system. This is because two-stage or modulating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation can improve system efficiency only if coupled with a device, i.e., a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multi-speed combustion system that can regulate the air flow rate into a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-stage or modulating burner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The North Carolina Public Service Co. suggested that DOE consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether blowers can be used in direct heating equipment with self-generating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilots. (North Carolina Public Service Co., No. 74 at 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not clear to what North Carolina Public Service is referring, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it fails to define clearly in its comment which blower it is discussing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what a self-generating pilot is. A blower could be interpreted as either an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air circulation fan or an induced or power draft fan. The self-generating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilot is probably some type of electronic ignition device. The Department has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated all of the above-mentioned design options and has determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blowers of any type can be used with electronic ignition systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association commented that for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement unit incorporating an increased heat exchanger surface area,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condensate must be avoided in the existing vent system. This requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in limiting the combustion efficiency to 83 percent. (Gas Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers Association, 40 at 7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment and considered venting issues in the analysis. Design options that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased the combustion efficiency over 83 percent require an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation charge to account for venting low-temperature flue gases and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draining condensate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other comments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Southern Gas Association, Energen, and the Atlanta Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Light Company recommended baseline units for direct heating equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 8; Energen, No. 12 at 15,16; Atlanta Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Light Company, No. 29 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department considered these comments regarding baseline units in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engineering Analysis. Baseline unit efficiency levels for each of the direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating product classes have been set at the standard levels established by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act. Of the units currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act minimum efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards are representative of the efficiency levels that presently exist for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most models.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minnegasco said that installation and maintenance expenses for direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating products are important, and that DOE must consider them. (Minnegasco,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 83 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

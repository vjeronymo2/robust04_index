The deadline, which was unilaterally  established by the U.S. Government last May when actions were  taken against Brazil in response to a request made by the U.S.  Pharmaceutical Industry Association, is 28 February.    Many talks have been held at various levels following the  meeting between Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor here in Washington on 16  February. The implementation of commercial sanctions against  Brazilian exports by the U.S. Government has not been averted.  But it is no longer the only choice as it was before the visit  of the foreign minister.    If the negotiations go well in the next few days and lead to  similar positions on the main points of disagreement, the U.S.  trade representative could, for example, say that the  understanding produced sufficient progress to justify the  suspension of the action but that the U.S. Government reserves  the right to resume the case and retaliate if Brazil does not  honor its commmitments within a reasonable time.    The terms of the Brazilian commitment are in the note that  Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima  delivered to Kantor the day before the visit of the Brazilian  foreign minister. In the note the Brazilian Government offered  to submit amendments to the new industrial property code bill  which is being debated in the Senate to make the Brazilian  regulation for intellectual property protection compatible with  the TRIPPS [Trade Related Intellectual Property Protection  System] which was approved by the Uruguay Round of the GATT last  December.    The amendments to the code will reportedly resolve the  differences between Brasilia and Washington on Article 27 of the  TRIPPS which is the most important of the four differences that  the U.S. Government considers to be "critical." Until recently  the Brazilian Foreign Ministry argued that the demand for  "domestic registration" of pharmaceutical patents which is in  the industrial property code bill that was approved by the  Chamber of Deputies last year was compatible with the TRIPPS  which is reportedly "ambiguous" on that issue.    The U.S. trade representative said, however, that the  Brazilian interpretation is incompatible with the TRIPPS and  that it would not resist a discussion in the GATT.</p>

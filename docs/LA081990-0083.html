			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> DESERT CENTER;  </P> <P> SOLAR PLANE MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING  </P> <P> The pilot of an ultralight solar airplane making a cross-country journey was  forced to make his second emergency landing because of unfavorable conditions,  a spokesman said. Eric Raymond took off in his Sun-Seeker aircraft at 12:15  p.m. CDT Friday from Clinton, Mo., spokesman Jack Whitehouse said.  </P> <P> His flight lasted less than three hours and covered 42 miles. Raymond was  forced to land in a grass field in Deepwater, Mo., because weak thermals would  not lift the plane over the Harry S. Truman Reservoir, Whitehouse said.  Whitehouse has tracked Raymond's flight from the California airfield where it  began Aug. 2. The plane has been grounded for four days during the two weeks  because of insufficient thermals. Raymond had hoped to reach his final  destination of Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Sunday -- in celebration of National  Aviation Day, Whitehouse said.  </P></p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong advance at Telekom Malaysia Telekom Malaysia, the partially-privatised telecommunications utility, has announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 536m) for calendar 1993, a 20 per cent rise on the previous year, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian government floated 25 per cent of Telekom on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange in late 1990 and the utility is the second largest listed company on the market. Mr Rashdan Baba, Telekom's executive chairman, said he expected Telekom's customer base to expand by between 13 per cent and 15 per cent over the next few years. 'I believe our profits are a reflection of the scope of the market for telecommunications in Malaysia and, we'd like to think, management's ability to manage the business for commercial success,' he said. Telekom said operating revenue increased 15 per cent to MDollars 3.9bn in 1993 while expenditure increased by 12 per cent.</p>

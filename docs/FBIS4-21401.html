			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by R. Helmueller and J. Siebenlist: </F> "Positive Signal for Raw-Material Recycling"; Subheads:  "Packaging Ordinance Amendment Should Continue To Expedite Waste  Recycling"; "Planned Extension of Quota-Based Goals Allows Time  for Creation of Industrial-Scale Recycling Capacity"]    [Text]Duesseldorf, 18 February 1994 -- Federal  environmental minister Prof. Klaus Toepfer intends to use a  revised packaging ordinance to continue development of Germany's  entry into recycling. In this context, at the Euroforum  conference "The Dual System Facing Its Demise?!," recently in  Duesseldorf, Dr. Thomas Rummler explained that the federal  government wished to incorporate the experiences of the past two  years into the ordinance's amendment. For, although in the view  of the deputy department head in the Federal Environmental  Ministry [BMU], there had been some problems in the initial  phase, the present results demonstrated that something "had  gotten off the ground" both in the avoidance and in the  recycling of packaging.    Marion Caspers-Merk, however, complains about the proposed  bill for a new packaging ordinance: "What federal environmental  minister Toepfer has proposed no longer has anything to do with  ecological recycling." In the view of the deputy  environmental-policy spokesperson for the German Socialist  Party's [SPD] parliamentary group, the central thrust of the  proposed changes is "to extend the deadlines, lower recycling  quotas and allow access to the furnace in recycling." Therefore,  it is not ecological necessity but economic wishfulness that is  uppermost. The medium-sized business sector came to the  conclusion from the disastrous development of Germany's Dual  System [DSD] of fashioning an ecologically and economically  optimized counter-bill. But instead of allowing the market even  into the waste management sector and promoting the ordinance,  the DSD continued to be defended.    According to deputy ministerial head Thomas Rummler, the  planned amendment to the new packaging ordinance will allow new  chemical (raw material) recycling processes to be used for  plastic packaging. The industry wants to have an annual  recycling capacity of 190,000 t by 1995. Therefore the creation  of investment security for raw-material recycling processes lies  at the core of the respective bill.    According to Rummler this should be achieved with the  unambiguous conceptual definition. It was made clear that the  raw-material recycling law could be realized not only using  conventional recycling processes but also modern chemical  recycling processes. The BMU representative opined: "This  conceptual clarification will supply the indispensable  investment security for firms that want to use the material  properties of used plastics, for instance, in the process of  hydrogenation or the production of steel."    Petra Rob's judgment of Bonn's change of plans was: "We  welcome the fact that the amending of the packaging ordinance  redefines and unambiguously defines important concepts." Since,  according to the spokesperson for the DSD GmbH, Bonn,  raw-material recycling of plastic packaging, for example,  through hydrogenation or pyrolysis would be explicitly  recognized, industry would be given an important signal "to make  the necessary billions in investments in modern recycling plants  and technologies."    The amendment bill also provides for packaging consisting of  paper/pulp/cardboard, plastic or composite materials, a  reduction of the recycling quotas as well as a deferral of the  deadlines by which the quotas have to be met. As a result, the  currently targeted recycling quota of 60 percent (64 percent up  until now) for such retrievable packaging materials will have to  be realized only by 1 January 1998 (up until now, 1 July 1995).    According to Rummler this is needed to allow for the  development of appropriate recycling capacities. Slight  deviations in the quotas, nonetheless, have not led to any  substantial changes. As Rummler states: "The pressure on the  private sector to build large facilities for raw-material  recycling is in no way diminished." This is highlighted not  least by the fact that, in the case of plastics, half the  recycling quota has to be ensured using material processes. But  the amendment also makes it clear that effectively included  amounts of packaging exceeding the required materials quotas  could be recycled either in the form of matter or energy.  However, this would require furnaces having at least a 75  percent efficiency factor.</p>

			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Mitterrand hits out at speculators MR Francois Mitterrand, French president, has denounced speculators for triggering the recent currency crisis and called for a speeding up of the single European currency, Reuter reports from Paris. In an interview with the French daily newspaper Sud-Ouest released yesterday, he called speculation a challenge to democracy. 'I find it insane and immoral that speculation, using billions of dollars, can have its way against states representing their people's interests and upset the daily life of millions of people.' Mr Mitterrand said speculators had targeted the European monetary system rather than the franc and the system should be strengthened. He said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's recent suggestion that the EC might not achieve a single currency by the 1999 target date should be seen as a statement of difficulties lying ahead rather than a sign of fading enthusiasm for monetary unity.</p>

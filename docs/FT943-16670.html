			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Dockers lose redundancy case Twenty-six workers sacked from Goole docks on Humberside after industrial action lost a four-year battle for redundancy money yesterday. Three Court of Appeal judges dismissed by a majority an appeal aimed at reinstating their entitlement to compensation. The 26 were dismissed in April 1990 after an overtime ban in protest at a new bonus scheme. They said that their sackings were a 'set-up' to avoid paying redundancy. Lord Justice Dillon said that the industrial action in support of the bonus generated the dismissals and the subsequent decision to use contract labour.</p>

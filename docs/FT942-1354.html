			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Delors replacement top of Corfu agenda Pressure intensified last night on European Union leaders to settle at their Greek summit the divisive issue of who should replace Mr Jacques Delors as European Commission president. The 12 heads of government arrived in Corfu last night for the two-day summit, where chances of breaking the deadlock are generally believed to be, at best, even. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, appeared to retain a clear lead over his main rival, Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister. But the UK and Italy have still not signalled an intention to back either of them. Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned on Wednesday that the German EU presidency would call another summit next month if the 12 failed to agree on a successor to Mr Delors during their time in Corfu. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek prime minister, tried to be positive by suggesting the leaders would 'do everything we can' to reach agreement: 'I want to be optimistic. I think we will succeed,' he said. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, formally backs Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, as an outside contender, but the UK prefers Mr Lubbers to Mr Dehaene, who is being promoted by France and Germany. On arriving, Mr Major said: 'It is important to get the right result. Whether that will be here or not, I'm not sure.' He refused to comment on Mr Dehaene's candidacy. In the UK yesterday, Ladbrokes, the bookmaker, was quoting Mr Dehaene as 1-3 (on) favourite and Mr Lubbers at 7-2. Mr Brittan was trailing on 7-1 and Mr Peter Sutherland, outgoing head of the Gatt world trade organisation, was quoted at 8-1. The Belgian and Dutch leaders, both Christian Democrats, agreed at a meeting of EU Christian Democrat parties in Brussels on Wednesday that neither would veto the other. Both are expected to leave a dinner tonight while their colleagues remain to try to break the deadlock. The Netherlands intends to push hard its claim to the top Brussels job, according to Dutch officials, on the grounds that it is the only founder-member of the Euro-club not to have held the Commission presidency. It will also be argued that the Netherlands will shortly become the largest net contributor to the EU budget on a per capita basis.

Gaber announced that  a high government delegation of the Russian Federation will  arrive in Macedonia at the beginning of March, which is also  when the embassy will be opened in Skopje.    In its announcement, among the rest, the Macedonian Foreign  Ministry says: "The Russian Federation was among the first to  recognize the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional  name, and sponsored the resolution for the acceptance of our  country to the United Nations. The support from the Russian  Federation of Macedonia's request for admission as a full member  of the CSCE has been continuous, which represents a clear  confirmation that an independent and sovereign Republic of  Macedonia is an unsurpassable factor of peace and stability in  the region, and broader in Europe."    As it is known, the Russian Federation recognized the  Republic of Macedonia in August, 1992, while it is establishing  diplomatic relations after a year and half. Otherwise, the  Republic of Macedonia has been recognized under its  constitutional name by 11 other countries, besides the Russian  Federation.</p>

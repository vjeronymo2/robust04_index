			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The question of getting  repaid the credits South Korea had extended to Russia will not  be discussed during the upcoming visit to Moscow by President  Kim Yong-sam, a senior government official said Thursday.    Instead, the government will send a Finance Ministry mission  to Moscow in early June to sound out the possibility of  obtaining the repayment in kind, Second Assistant Finance  Minister Yim Chang-yol said.    While meeting with reporters Yim said the government  believes  that getting the credits repaid in kind best serves national  interests under the present circumstances.    The Finance Ministry mission will be led by Chong Tok-ku,  Finance Ministry's director-general for international  cooperation, he said.    The assistant minister said that it may be possible to  obtain  the repayment in such goods as coal, machinery and asbestos and  in the right to use land for the construction of a Korean trade  center in Moscow.    If the feasibility of obtaining the repayment in kind were  determined in the mission's visit early next month, a meeting of  high economic cooperation officials will take place toward the  end of June or early July to discuss the matter in earnest, he  said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Francois Leotard by Patrick </F> Poivre d'Arvour, in Paris on 18 May -- live or recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Poivre d'Arvor] Among the main  proposals of Bernard-Henri Levy and his friends, there is the  lifting of the arms embargo in favor of the Bosnian fighters who  have been asking for it from the start.    [Leotard] This can be done, but the French troops would  leave  a quarter of an hour after that. We should know that supplying  weapons would obviously mean extending the conflict. We cannot  put in soldiers to act as a buffer force between the  belligerents, and at the same time supply one of these  belligerents with arms. It is clear that if weapons are  supplied, in the quarter of an hour that follows, I would make  the decision -- with the agreement of the prime minister and the  president, of course -- to pull the French troops out.

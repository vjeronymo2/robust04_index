			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS: COUNTY ASSESSOR;  </P> <P> 7 CANDIDATES SUCCEED IN STIRRING UP ONLY YAWNS OF INDIFFERENCE  </P> <P> Los Angeles County assessor candidate Jay Curtis last week stood on a lonely  Hollywood street corner preparing to announce a plan to rewrite a section of  Proposition 13 that allows different taxes to be levied on similar properties.  </P> <P> Curtis carefully chose a site only a few blocks from TV stations, with a good  visual backdrop of similar houses that have different tax rates. But no one  showed up. Even a dog running loose in the neighborhood ignored the event.  </P> <P> "You talk about rejection," Curtis lamented. "The dog wouldn't even come up and  let us pet him."  </P> <P> Much like comedian Rodney Dangerfield, the seven contenders for the  low-visibility assessor's job clamor for respect, but they are encountering  apparent indifference.  </P> <P> Curtis also was scheduled to speak earlier this week at the University Club,  but the event was called off for lack of interest. Only a handful of people  signed up to attend, the club manager said.  </P> <P> In his first reelection bid, incumbent John J. Lynch faces six challengers,  including four current or former employees of the assessor's office, in the  June 5 election.  </P> <P> The employees seeking the top job are Kenneth P. Hahn, Sid Delgado and John  Carl Brogdon. Hahn is not related to County Supervisor Kenneth F. Hahn, who has  endorsed Lynch. Lynch's former secretary, Monica Anderson, also is running.  </P> <P> The other contenders are Joe Gardner, a retired county administrator, and  Curtis, an attorney and president of the Los Angeles Taxpayers Assn.  </P> <P> The challengers contend that Lynch is a bully who has failed to get tax bills  out on time. Lynch said he is a tough boss but fair. He blamed billing delays  on problems with a computer system installed by his predecessor.  </P> <P> If no candidate receives a majority of the vote, the top two vote-getters will  face off in November.  </P> <P> The assessor's race has been overshadowed by feisty battles for governor and  attorney general. And the candidates themselves have not had much money to  spend on campaigns.  </P> <P> Only Curtis and Lynch paid the $62,775 to publish a 200-word statement in the  official sample ballot, which is sent to 3.8 million voters.  </P> <P> "What price democracy, at $313.87 per word?" grumbled Brogdon, who said he  could not afford the statement. His campaign has been limited to attending  candidates' forums, buttonholing voters at shopping malls and handing out  photocopied campaign flyers during theater intermissions.  </P> <P> To qualify for the ballot, candidates had to collect 20 signatures and pay  $953.  </P> <P> Gardner also complained that he is having trouble getting support because  voters mistakenly believe candidate Hahn is a relative of the popular  supervisor.  </P> <P> Hahn, the candidate, acknowledged that he expects to benefit from the  well-known Hahn name, but said he makes it clear, when asked, that they are not  related.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County assessor, who will earn $130,869 a year when the new  four-year term begins Dec. 3, oversees the largest single property-taxing  jurisdiction in the United States, in terms of land value. The assessor's chief  task is to determine the tax bills for 2.2 million commercial and residential  properties.  </P> <P> Assessors lost much of their power in 1978 after voters approved Proposition  13, which limited reappraisal to changes of ownership and new construction.  Still, the Los Angeles County assessor, who oversees a staff of 1,600 and an  $83-million annual budget, expects to review about 500,000 properties this  year.  </P> <P> Lynch acknowledged that the duties of his office are a mystery to much of the  public. "I spend a lot of time telling people what I do," he said.  </P> <P> In 1986, Lynch, a 14-year veteran of the lower ranks of the assessor's office,  surprised himself by topping a field of 12 candidates to win the job vacated by  Alexander Pope.  </P> <P> Lynch, 53, did have some things going for him. He was a Republican Party  activist in the San Fernando Valley who was endorsed by tax fighter Howard  Jarvis, whose portrait now hangs on the wall above Lynch's desk. And he was one  of only two candidates with a campaign pitch in the sample ballot.  </P> <P> To get the statement in the ballot, Lynch filed an affidavit claiming he was  indigent and unable to pay the cost of the statement. The county later rejected  Lynch's claim, but it was too late to remove his statement from the booklet.  </P> <P> Lynch said he did not learn until after the election that only those living  below the poverty level are considered indigents. He said he has since paid the  printing costs.  </P> <P> During his first term, Lynch made headlines by throwing county auditors out of  his office and being accused of assaulting an employee during a heated argument  over the worker's union activities. Lynch denied the assault allegation.  </P> <P> The worker filed a complaint with the Civil Service Commission, but the matter  was dropped when Lynch agreed that there would be no reprisals against the  employee, and the employee agreed not to file a lawsuit.  </P> <P> In ordering auditors out of his office, Lynch contended that an audit was  unnecessary because it would review only procedures established by his  predecessor. In 1988, the county grand jury conducted a management review,  which found millions of dollars in billing backlogs. Lynch blamed the backlogs  on a computer system inherited from his predecessor, and said he has corrected  most of the problems. A routine follow-up audit is planned, but is not expected  to be completed until after the election.  </P> <P> Lynch, who has been endorsed by Jarvis' widow, cited a reduction in taxpayer  appeals as evidence that his office is operating effectively. He also noted his  office each year has produced higher property tax rolls.  </P> <P> A look at the challengers:  </P> <P> * Anderson, 39, left the assessor's office in 1988 after working as executive  secretary to Pope and Lynch. When she filed for the office in March, she called  Lynch a "bully," and said she was "appalled at the way he treated taxpayers."  But Lynch said Anderson once sent him a birthday card calling him "the best  boss I ever had."  </P> <P> * Brogdon, 61, supervising appraiser, is a 33-year veteran of the assessor's  office. He pointed out that he has worked longer in the office than any  candidate, including the incumbent. He also is a former Culver City councilman.  </P> <P> * Curtis, 47, former chief tax counsel of the West Virginia State Tax  Commission and former director of taxes for Pacific Enterprises, is making his  first try for public office. He is now in private practice. Curtis has spent  $40,000 of his own money on the campaign and raised another $50,000 -- more  than any of the other challengers.  </P> <P> He has proposed a complex plan to change the way property taxes are levied in  the event of a successful court challenge to a section of Proposition 13 that  requires new home buyers to pay higher taxes than longtime owners of similar  properties.  </P> <P> * Delgado, 51, a chief appraiser, is a 27-year veteran of the assessor's office  who is the highest-ranking challenger. Delgado has been endorsed by the Service  Employees International Union Local 660.  </P> <P> A former assistant to Pope, Delgado ran against Lynch in 1986. After the  election, Delgado said he was "exiled" by the new assessor to the South El  Monte office. Lynch insisted that he has never retaliated against any political  opponent in his office.  </P> <P> * Gardner, 59, retired in 1984 after working for county government for 25  years. He served as the Board of Supervisors' liaison to the county's 86  cities. Gardner, president of the Baldwin Hills Estates Homeowners Assn.,  unsuccessfully ran for assessor in 1986.  </P> <P> * Hahn, 50, an appraiser specialist who has been in the assessor's office 10  years, is running for the first time. He joined the county 23 years ago as a  social worker.  </P></p>

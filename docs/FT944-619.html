			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money: Permanent interest-bearing shares Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and sell.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Coupon     Issue  Minimum    Price*    Yield*                                    price Stock                (gross %)       (p)    (Pds)       (p) (gross %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires     9.375   100.165    1,000    90        10.411 Bradford &amp; Bingley      11.625   100.129   10,000   113.75     10.220 Bradford &amp; Bingley      13       100.2     10,000   126.25     10.297 Bristol &amp; West          13.375   100.338    1,000   127.75     10.470 Britannia               13       100.423    1,000   124        10.484 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs     11.75    100.962   50,000   116.75     10.064 Coventry                12.125   100.749    1,000   115.25     10.505 First National          11.75    100.247   10,000   103        11.408 Halifax                  8.75    100.615   50,000    89.75      9.749 Halifax                 12       100.28    50,000   120        10.000 Leeds &amp; Holbeck         13.375   100.227    1,000   127.50     10.490 Leeds Permanent         13.625   100       50,000   135.50     10.055 Newcastle               10.75    100.317    1,000   102.375    10.501 Newcastle               12.625   100.446    1,000   117.75     10.722 Northern Rock           12.625   100.135    1,000   120.50     10.477 Skipton                 12.875   100.476    1,000   121.50     10.597  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price as at midday 21 December 1994 excluding accrued interest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

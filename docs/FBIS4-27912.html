			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has made a decision to  approve the establishment of "winning-bid companies" [jiko  kyoraku gaisha] which are 100-percent-owned subsidiaries of  banks designed to purchase collateralized real estate offered by  such banks in an auction and to allow such subsidiaries to  engage in real estate operations. The formula allowing the  subsidiaries to purchase such real estate under a winning-bid  process will ensure the preservation of fairness in transfer  prices, and the ability to purchase adjacent lots will enhance  the value of the collateralized property. Having concluded that  such arrangements would promote the liquidity of collateralized  real estate and lead to restoring soundness in bank assets, the  MOF will issue a bulletin authorizing the establishment of real  estate subsidiaries effective in June for a duration of 10 years.    As a way to recover principal, banks have auctioned off  through court proceedings real estate used as collateral by  debtors who have failed to pay off loans. Procedures exist for  the disposition of real estate without resorting to court  proceedings, but auctions ensure fair pricing and eliminate the  risk of being eyed by the tax authorities for potential tax  evasion. Further, there is less risk of the sale being opposed  by lower-ranking creditors and the ability to avoid disputes  among interested parties.    Auctions have many such advantages, but the severe recession  in the real estate market has created many cases in which buyers  cannot be found even at the minimum acceptable auction price.  Accordingly, the situation gave birth to the idea of  establishing winning-bid companies that are 100-percent-owned  subsidiaries and submission of a winning bid by such  subsidiaries when other buyers could not be found.    The MOF will also approve such winning-bid company real  estate firms to operate as home builders. Banking laws prohibit  subsidiaries to engage in other businesses, but an exception  will be given with the proviso that the properties to be handled  will be limited to the collateralized properties and adjacent  lots.</p>

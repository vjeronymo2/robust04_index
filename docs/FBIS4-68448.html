			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Kemerovo Railroad safety inspection by deputy minister's </F> commission reported by GUDOK corespondent N. Domozhirov: "The  Inspectors' Landing Party"]    [Text] In the last 10 days of March, A. Koryachkin,  chief of the Kemerovo Railroad, signed an order in accordance  with the results of a traffic safety inspection. It was  conducted by a group of specialists headed by Russian Deputy  Minister of Railways Yu. Gerasimov    I will stipulate right away that the inspection had been  planned, and at first glance, nothing had foreshadowed any  particular trouble. After all, according to results of work in  the preceding quarter, the ministry collegium and the trade  union central committee had awarded the Kemerovo Railroad first  place in the system, providing it with a monetary bonus as  incentive. But overall evaluation of economic activity in a  specific period is one thing and meticulous analysis of one  aspect of the production process is a completely different  matter.    But the point is not in the method of inspection, of course.  Serious miscalculations in safety matters were actually made on  the Kemerovo Railroad. The commission checking implementation of  Order No. 1Ts of 8 January 1994 issued by the minister of  railways "On measures to provide for traffic safety in railroad  transport" came to the conclusion: this important work has  deteriorated on the Kemerovo Railroad in recent years, resulting  in a number of wrecks and accidents and an increase in the  number of cases involving defective items. The managers of  certain subunits began to embellish their reporting instead of  increasing their demands on subordinates and themselves. In  particular, more than 10 (!) cases of rolling stock derailment  and collisions during switching were not taken into account in a  2-month period this year at the Kemerovo-Sortirovochnoye station.    In the 37-page formal document on the 3-week inspection  compiled by B. Bogomolov, S. Nikishin, and A. Svetozarskiy, the  chief inspectors of the TsRB [possibly: Central Inspection  Bureau], the main cause of all the violations was a decline in  labor and performance discipline, as well as the reduced demand  for it. For example, 269 persons were absent from work in the  Kemerovo Subdivision last year, but only 66 were fired for  absenteeism. In the Topki Subdivision, the number of absentees  during the same period increased by 1.5 times as many, but fewer  persons were dismissed than in the previous year, 1992.    The commission revealed numerous cases in which disciplinary  misdemeanors were not investigated expeditiously. After this, we  should not be surprised by the irresponsibility of ordinary  production workers.    There is no reason to list the negative facts which appeared  in the inspection document, for they have already been given a  principled and quite strict assessment. I will dwell on the  analysis conducted by Deputy Minister Yu. Gerasimov.    The impartial discussion which took up an entire work day  proved to be instructive and certainly will be of value to  production commanders. Regardless of the persuasiveness of the  commission's criticism, not all the railroad's subdivision  managers were imbued with personal responsibility for the safety  conditions. Some attempted to turn the discussion into a calm  channel, as if nothing serious had taken place. Others were  inclined to place the blame on miscalculations by someone else,  but not on themselves. As an example, this position was taken by  V. Avdonin, chief of the Kemerovo-Sortirovochnoye station, who  "substituted" employees of the railroad's inspection service who  allegedly interpret individual violations arbitrarily. They hold  a similar point of view in the Novokuznetsk Division, where they  sometimes describe the escape of railcars during switching in  milder terms than they should.    What can be said in this regard? In fact, there are certain  contradictions between the normative documents and directives  from sector headquarters. But they are not sufficiently  important to be covered up. The striving to escape personal  responsibility at any price to smooth over the contradictions in  this situation was so inappropriate that the deputy minister  removed A. Avdonin as station manager on the spot.    It seemed to me that this was the culminating moment of the  analysis, which was typical of the tense situation. Though  several days afterward, through the railroad management's  intercession, the dismissed employee was given the chance to put  his place of work in order and to correct the procedure in  working with categorized and hazardous freight from chemical  enterprises in Kemerovo, for which Avdonin had been criticized.    All services without exception were sharply criticized. I  will name one of the most important ones--the lines service.  Last year, passenger train No. 178 from Kislovodsk to  Novokuznetsk was wrecked, railcars were derailed six times while  they were in trains and 54 times during switching, all the fault  of employees. Safety conditions were especially poor in the  Topki, Kemerovo, and Polosukhinsk line subdivisions, which  accounted for nearly half of the defective equipment in the 12  subdivisions of the lines service.    During the course of comments by the main administration  commission, a question was raised repeatedly about the  unsatisfactory view held by the lines service and its  subdivisions toward the directive of 18 March 1993 "On the  introduction of permanent alternate lines and engineering  structures." In conformity with the directive, it was planned to  add 240 line inspectors promoted from the ranks of the best  trained linemen. However, even now, a year later, the ministry's  directive has not been fully implmented, which has substantially  reduced the gain that had been planned.    Of course, it is more complicated to resolve the problem of  line personnel under conditions in Siberia than in regions with  a favorable climate. The fact that workers in the industrial  Kuzbass have a wide choice of work in their locations has a  negative effect as well. However, all this should not relax the  lines suprvisors, but make it incumbent on them to work more  diligently on personnel training.    The railcars service was the only one where the number of  equipment breakdowns increased at an alarming rate in 1993; they  included the following major defects: fractures in axle  journals, wheels, and truck side-frames. Preparation of trains  for a run shows practically no improvement, and flagrant  violations of the rules were permitted in repairing automatic  brakes and automatic coupling equipment. In the wheel and roller  bearing shops, repair procedure is not being followed, and  assembly and inspection of bearing boxes is performed manually.  These shortcomings have not been corrected for a long period of  time, and the commission proposed that the chief of the railroad  reinforce the service's management with personnel for this  reason.    But take the signals and communications service. Commission  members devoted their attention to the fact that equipment is  being updated very slowly here. Obsolete systems of electrical  centralization are being operated at 11 stations. Work to  separate the power cables and the signal and blocking cables has  not been performed at many ETs [electrical switch and signal  centralization] stations.    I would err against the truth if I limited a report on the  analysis to only the critical observations. At the inspectors'  recommendation, the chief of the railroad (more visible from the  side, as they say!) expressed gratitude and awarded a bonus to  leading employees who have been successful in resolving traffic  safety problems. They include V. Sinitsyn, chief engineer of the  Novokuznetsk Locomotive Depot, and L. Gulyakin, that depot's  deputy chief; and T. Khadarin, inspector in the Novokuznetk  Division, who was given particularly high praise by the deputy  minister. Monetary incentives were awarded to A. Rossoshanskaya  and R. Bauer, psychologists at the Novokuznetsk and Belovo  locomotive depots; their work, which was inconspicuous at first  glance, was put on an equal footing with the work of leading  production employees.    In the opinion of the main administration commission, the  experience of the Kemerovo Railroad psychologists who  distinguished themselves deserves every possible support and  dissemination in the system, and as a correspondent, I will tell  our newspaper's readers about this soon.</p>

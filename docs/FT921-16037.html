			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fears of lower margins in higher Christmas sales LADBROKE GROUP, the leisure company, yesterday began a season of retailers reporting how they had fared over the Christmas holiday period amid signs that many may have sacrificed margins to achieve sales. Ladbroke said its Texas Homecare DIY subsidiary had raised sales by more than 15 per cent in the ten days from Boxing Day to January 4. Boots should today make a statement about its last quarter sales, and Dixons, the electrical retailer, is due to report interim results tomorrow. These indications of consumer confidence and spending over Christmas follow disappointing sales at Ratners, the high street jewellers. Despite deep pre-Christmas price discounting, the resulting increase in sales was not sustained and the troubled retailer's share price has fallen sharply. Mr Ron Trenter, chairman of Texas, described the sales increase as very encouraging as it had come from only 3 per cent more space than last year. The announcement follows a mini-price war in the DIY sector where retailers B&amp;Q, owned by Kingfisher, and Do-it-all, owned by WH Smith and Boots, have intensified competition in selected areas. Mr John Richards, analyst at Smith New Court, said Texas's sales figures should not be interpreted as a sign of a significant upturn in the DIY market. 'The aggressive discounting that B&amp;Q and Texas have been doing appears to have been at the expense of their weaker competitors, notably Do-it-all.' Analysts pointed out that hastily arranged price discounting and planned price cutting campaigns have a markedly different impact on profitability. When Texas cut 25 per cent from all prices for two weekends last November, it arranged that its suppliers should swallow some of the discount in return for higher volume. Hurriedly arranged sales after stock has been bought, on the other hand, slice profits straight off a retailers bottom line.</p>

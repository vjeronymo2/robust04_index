Keldysh,  Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 629.197.23]    [Abstract] An approximate analytic method is given for  computing the motion of a spacecraft in the neighborhood of the  collinear libration points of an arbitrary system of bodies. In  connection with trajectory problems with the "Relikt-2" project  (halo orbit in the neighborhood of the L[.sub]2[/] point of  the Sun-Earth system), analytic allowance also is made for  perturbations from the Moon. A comparison with the motion of a  spacecraft in a halo orbit, determined by numerical integration,  gave an estimate of the magnitude of the systematic error of  about 1% of the characteristic amplitude of the halo  orbit. The  problem of the Earth's screening of a spacecraft against solar  radiation in a halo orbit of an arbitrary amplitude is  formulated. The proposed analytic method was used in estimating  the expenditures of characteristic velocity on the optimum  correction of spacecraft motion in order to prevent screening  (in the case of the limited control system in the "Relikt-2"  project and a more general case). Section 2 gives results  characterizing the accuracy in approximating an asymptotic  trajectory in the proposed third-order theory; Section 3 gives a  formalization of the problem of entry into the Earth's shadow  (or penumbra). Section 4 examines the optimum problem of  correction of the motion of a spacecraft, making possible  avoidance of its entry into a deep shadow. The analytic theory  developed in Section 5 rests on a similar method worked out  earlier for describing motion in the neighborhood of the  L[.sub]2[/] point in the Earth-Moon system.

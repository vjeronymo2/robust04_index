			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Soft drink sales set to produce sweet results - Cadbury Schweppes Cadbury Schweppes is expected to report on Thursday some of the best interim results among UK food manufacturers with pre-tax profits up by about Pounds 40m to about Pounds 200m. Its soft drinks will show the biggest improvement at home and abroad while confectionery will be patchier. The results will also lay to rest any residual fears that J. Sainsbury's aggressive own-label cola strategy will have hurt Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, Cadbury's 51 per cent owned UK joint venture. After the supermarket chain launched its Classic Cola line earlier this year in packaging resembling Coca-Cola's, Coke fought back with heavy promotions. In Sainsbury stores, Coke is now outselling Classic Cola in cans but not large bottles. But the cans carry a higher profit margin and Sainsbury accounts for less than 5 per cent of CCSB's sales. Overall, CCSB's operating profits should be up by about Pounds 5m to more than Pounds 50m. Cadbury's beverage profits will also be enhanced by a first-time contribution from A&amp;W, the US bottler. No news is expected on Cadbury's attempts to get board representation at Dr Pepper, the US bottler in which it has a 25 per cent stake. In contrast to growth in the US and UK, Cadbury's continental European beverage operations remain problematic and may require further restructuring charges. The picture is mixed in confectionery. In the UK, chocolate volumes are virtually static and Cadbury is trying to recoup rising cocoa costs. Sugar sweets, via the group's Trebor Bassett brand, look more promising in volume and price terms. Shareholders can expect a dividend increase of at least 0.3p to 3.9p but the group may act on a hint at its AGM about weighting the dividend more in line with sales during the year. This would require a rise to more than 5p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Islam Abduganiyevich Karimov, president of </F> Uzbekistan, by correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva; place and date  not given; from the "Utro" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Ganiyeva] Islam Abduganiyevich, your official  visit to Russia begins today. What prospects do you see for  cooperation with the Russians?    [Karimov] I have always said and I wish to reiterate once  more today that, Uzbekistan cannot see its future without  Russia. Regardless of the difficulties or artificial barriers  that are raised between us on issues of cooperation and economic  ties, and relations in other directions as well, I have always  been convinced and remain convinced that Russia and Uzbekistan  should be together in the most difficult conditions through  which we are living today. Of course, I am also convinced that  there will be prosperity which we will both share.    It is difficult to specify the directions in which we can  cooperate. The fact is the directions and forms of cooperation  as well as their depth are so boundless that it is difficult to  speak about some specific direction. Today, at every step we  feel the breakdown in economic ties, difficulties in economic  relations, as well as on questions of payments, more so since we  introduced our own currency. Every day, at every turn, and at  every step we feel that we cannot live without one another. I  would once more like to emphasize the significance of our visit.  I am confident the hopes which the Russian and Uzbek people  place on us, on our meeting, and on the signing of documents  which we are counting on, will be invariably justified.    [Ganiyeva] Islam Abduganiyevich, very briefly, what  documents will be signed as a result of this visit?    [Karimov] First of all there will be the document on  deepening economic integration in relations between Russia and  Uzbekistan. Second there will be the document on general  guidelines for deepening all-around cooperation between Russia  and Uzbekistan. The third document will be on cooperation in  military technical spheres.</p>

At a luncheon given by the president of the Hamburg  Parliament Ute Pape, Qiao said Hamburg has been playing an  important role in boosting Sino-German relations.    He said a great proportion of commodities traded between the  two countries are shipped via the Port of Hamburg.    He added that the number of Chinese companies in Hamburg has  risen from one in 1979 to more than 100 today, pointing out that  the first Chinese general consulate to Germany is also located  there.    Qiao said Hamburg established its partnership with China's  largest industrial city Shanghai as early as in 1986.    He said Germans from all walks of life are welcome to China  to work in cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.</p>

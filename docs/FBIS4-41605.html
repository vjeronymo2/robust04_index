			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting of the Georgian Defense Ministry's newly  appointed collegium was held on 23 June. The meeting was  conducted by Lieutenant Genereal Vardiko Nadibaidze, the  Georgian defense minister. Personnel problems, the provision of  foodstuffs and material, and technical resources were the  subjects of the straight talk held at the meeting. The defense  minister sharply criticized some senior officials of the  ministry for a lack of responsibility and negligence in their  work that has caused a just resentment among the personnel in  some of the military units. It has been indicated that a  detailed program for the improvement of the current situation is  to be worked up. Members of the military collegium of the  Defense Ministry, as well as Armed Forces commanders have to be  actively involved in the implementation of this program. Urgent  assistance has been requested from the government and the  authorities of the republic.    It is necessary to secure maximum efforts, a major sense of  responsibility, and emergency operational conditions in order  for Georgia to have a single and strong Georgian Army.    Special attention has been attached to problems revealed  during the inspection of the 11th brigade. It has been  indicated that the leadership of the republic demonstrates deep  concern over the establishment of the country's regular army.  Special attention toward military units will be increased.    This information was supplied by the Defense Ministry press  service.</p>

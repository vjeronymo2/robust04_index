			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo Pasinga, speaker of </F> the High Council of the Republic, in Kinshasa on 26 January --  recorded]    [Excerpts] Honorable HCR [High Council of the Republic]  members, Your Excellencies the ambassadors and heads of  diplomatic missions, distinguished guests: On this day of the  opening of the extraordinary session of our interim legislative  institution, I would like to wholeheartedly bid you all welcome.  Some of you have been actors and others witnesses of what men  can achieve when their actions are based on the will to  understand and on good faith. [passage omitted]    Dear brothers and sisters of the interim parliament, Zaire  our country did not drop like a bolt from the blue. This  institutional order whose texts you are going to finalize did  not fall from heaven. It is the outcome of a scrutiny of the  constitutional legacy handed down from the past, from the  colonial era until today, via the one-party system. At each  stage of constitutional change, we receive as a legacy our past,  with its strong and weak points, based on which we build the  change to come.    The last stage of the constitutional change was that of the  Sovereign National Conference [CNS], with an institutional order  governed by the deed setting forth the constitutional provisions  for the transition period. This legacy surely has its strong  and weak points. Several unilateral steps were undertaken by  individuals to improve it without success. Today, it is  together that we want to do so on the basis of the political  consultation we have all encouraged. Let us do so without  emotion or partisan thinking, but rather in a sober and  responsible manner.    In this regard, it is true that the deliberations of the  political class do not automatically bind the institution. It  is also true that the deliberations of the political class do  not carry the signature of all the negotiators; hence, they  cannot legally constitute a law binding the parties. But it  should be noted that their work contains several points of  agreement, which are the gains of the political class that must  be taken into account because, in a parliamentary system, it  would not be logical for the institution to fail to take account  of the thinking of the political class which makes up the said  institution. [passage omitted]    It will not only be dangerous, but also harmful for the  honor  and credibility of the Zairian political actor if the political  class happens to renege these points of agreement whereas the  public opinion (?grants it) the points of disagreement which  persist. It therefore behooves the political class to  demonstrate its maturity by remaining consistent and logical in  the defense of its gains within the interim legislative  institution. [passage omitted]    The main concern of the political class during the  transition  period is security, in order that no politician may be unfairly  rendered unable to take part in elections. The importance  politicians attach to positioning themselves in the interim  institutions is understandable. [passage omitted] It is  therefore important that at the level of the president of the  Republic, head of state, whose function is to serve as the  guarantor of national unity and at those of the legislative  organ and the executive, this balanced representation be  guaranteed during the transition period.    The executive has a great responsibility since it is charged  with implementing the principles of fairness in the key organs  of government machinery. But since some organs cannot  necessarily be subjected to certain aspects of equity, including  the ideological representation aspects, such organs will be  required to be neutral and apolitical. This is particularly the  case of the security and law enforcement agencies, the public  service, and the utilities. The Army, the security and law  enforcement agencies, and the public service must be in the  service of the Republic and the citizen, irrespective of their  tribal or ethnic affiliation, or even their political thinking.  The public service, including the department of territorial  administration, must, in short, be in the service of the  Republic and the citizen. [passage omitted]    Among the public service departments, one has particularly  engaged the attention of the political class: the state-run  media -- i.e. the radio, the television, and the ZAIRIAN PRESS  AGENCY. The CNS dealt at length with this question and the  political class took it up again in its consultations. As [word  indistinct] put it: Where the public opinion ceases to find free  expression, peace is in jeopardy. One could confidently state:  Tell me how the mass media is organized in your country and I  will tell you the system that reigns there.    The state-run media have been monopolized by governments  throughout the world without their necessarily being used to  provide objective information but rather to serve propaganda  purposes. This is why under systems of ideological pluralism,  democratic countries have created mechanisms that guarantee all  political leanings the right to get their message across to the  public. One such mechanism is to entrust the running of these  public services to a committee representing the principal  ideological leanings and to stop the state or a particular  political group from monopolizing their functioning. Since the  transition is the prefiguration of the Third Republic -- which  we would all like to be democratic and pluralistic -- it can  only have state-run media that serve all the various political  leanings. This is a prerequisite of the democratic principles  that must guide us. The apolitical nature of the Army, security  forces, and government services, as well as the free access of  all political leanings to the state-run media and the right of  all citizens to information, constitute one of the absolutely  essential conditions for democratic, open, and, therefore,  reliable elections.    With respect to politicians who have been appointed to head  political institutions or territorial bodies, they must show  neutrality in carrying out their duties since their political  leanings must not violate the rights of those who belong to  another political family. They must occupy their post without  taking financial charge of their political parties. To  paraphrase a French statesman, this is the price democracy  demands.    Honorable HCR members, distinguished guests, ladies, and  gentlemen: It has become a common utterance to say that the  economic and social conditions of our people are deplorable.  However, the word deplorable does not really convey the  dramatic situation of the country's average citizen especially  in the big urban centers. Low salaries and speculative  skyrocketing prices exist while certain commercial activities  flourish by shamelessly exploiting the misery of our people.    The political class deliberated on these questions and  recommended some urgent solutions. Whatever the case, the  consolidation of strength of all the active forces of the  country is necessary for meeting the challenge of achieving the  country's economic and social recovery. The holding of  consultations among businessmen, trade unions, and public  authorities is indispensable. These consultations must be placed  under the sign of national solidarity. It is good to note that  the awareness of the people themselves to contribute to work on  one side, and on the other, in the provision of self-protection  against excesses is an indispensable backup measure for adopting  the measures recommended by the said consultations. It is only  the combination of these factors which can marginalize murderous  speculators, provided the state regains all its capabilities of  public authority and exercises them without complacency against  the recalcitrant ones who go to excess.    What is happening in fuel stations is quite more  scandalizing. The way in which Chinese rice was being sold is  uncontrollable and is likely to discourage all those people who,  either in the country or abroad, try to relieve the misery of  our people. The state must set up a minimum of efficient  organization capable of sending out locally or externally  produced essential commodities to the needy consumers without  their passing through useless, expensive, or uncontrolled  intermediaries. The success of recovery is at this price. It  is not a regime of a police state that we want, but the regime  of a state that, on behalf of the citizens and the society,  plays the role of the guarantor of public order where every  citizen can fully enjoy his right in justice and dignity.    The advocates of liberal economy will probably feel  frustrated by this address. They should not worry. I am far  away from the idea to condemn market economy and the Sovereign  National Conference has opted for social market economy. The  crisis in Zaire prevents the interplay of the normal rule of  competition. For as long as production will not be reactivated  to ensure abundance, the state must promote and, if need be,  constraint the citizens to solidarity through appropriate  machineries. The state will see to it that the economic space  is not transformed into a jungle to the detriment of the poor as  is the case presently.    We finally want to suggest that it must be a national  moratorium between the National Association of Zairian  Enterprises, all branches of the trade unions, including the  press, and the government in order to sanitize and to ensure the  political, economic, and social well being of the of the nation.  During this moratorium period, the businessmen must endeavor to  maintain their profit margin within a reasonable limit, while  the trade unions limit their salary demands at a decent level,  and the media, following the political leaders must try to  discipline themselves to correctly inform and keep to positive  criticisms and refrain from personal attacks which destroy the  honor and dignity of citizens so as to promote the democratic  virtues of dialogue and tolerance.    As for the government, it must be committed to grant fiscal  facilities so as to stimulate production and encourage this by  actions which will strengthen its credibility and authority  through the creation of conditions of security for people and  their property.    Dear brothers and sisters, transitional parliamentarians,  the  fate of our people is in our hands. Let us try to work  together, constantly bearing in mind our priority duty to  eradicate the misery into which the people of our country have  been plunged. In this regard, let us forget what divides and  promote what unites us. In this way, we will be doing a great  service to our country and history, as well to future  generations who will be grateful to us.    My brothers, sisters, republican councilors, ambassadors,  and  heads of diplomatic missions, ladies, and gentlemen, I cannot  end this address without turning to my colleagues of the bureau  and congratulate them on the confidence that the assembly has  placed in them by appointing them bureau members.    They are all lay persons and are called upon to assume the  temporal duties, as God recommends, for the happiness of the  people. They will therefore understand that once the bureau is  inaugurated, I am leaving the responsibility of managing current  affairs of the HCR/Transitional Parliament, in order to  concentrate on finding solutions to problems that may arise in  the event of any major crisis under the same conditions as those  accepted by the Sovereign National Conference on 5 December  1992. It is on these words, honorable HCR members, dear  ambassadors, and heads of diplomatic mission, ladies, and  gentlemen, and demanding the blessing of the Eternal for our  country that I declare the end of the solemn opening session of  the HCR, our transitional parliament. I thank you.</p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Building equipment demand set to fall DEMAND FOR construction equipment in Europe is likely to fall by 8 per cent this year as the boom in Germany caused by reunification passes its peak, according to a forecast by the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group. The predicted decline follows a 3 per cent fall in the European market last year to 95,901 units, and sales are expected to fall by a further 7,000 units this year. If that happens, the group said, the market would have declined by 15 per cent since 1989. The surge in equipment sales in Germany has been the one bright spot in the industry over the past three years. Unit sales rose by 22 per cent last year to 44,555, and Germany now represents 47 per cent of the European market, compared with 18 per cent in 1989 for the former West Germany. Sales in Germany had benefited from the influx of new citizens from eastern Europe, and the work to be done in the new federal states. Wheeled loaders, hydraulic excavators and small earthmovers had been bought in great quantities. But 1993 had started slowly, and overall sales were likely to fall this year by 13 per cent to 38,955, the group said. 'In the bonanza of selling in the east, there are many dealers of very doubtful financial standing and by the end of 1993 there will probably be quite a shake-out in progress. 'There is the worry that rental fleets recently created will be under-used, with banks reclaiming machines and forcing them back on to the used equipment market at low prices.' In spite of the decline, however, the German market will still be about 120 per cent bigger than in 1988, and German sales will continue to dominate the European market. All other countries apart from Austria and Denmark declined last year, with the sharpest falls in Finland, Sweden and Spain. Overall the group said 1993-94 would be a period of continued difficulty for construction equipment producers, and real recovery was unlikely before 1995-96.

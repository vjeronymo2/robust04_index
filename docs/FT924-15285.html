			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Georgia accuses Russian air force of shooting down helicopter Georgia accused the Russian air force of shooting down a helicopter and killing the two-man crew over its breakaway region of Abkhazia, amid a worsening crisis in relations with Moscow, Reuter reports from Moscow. Russia's Defence Ministry denied responsibility and blamed Abkhazian separatists for downing the Mi-24 helicopter with a ground-to-air missile, Itar-Tass news agency said. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, told the ruling state council that the helicopter was shot down by a Su-25 fighter-bomber which took off from a Russian base at Gudauta. Tass said the stricken helicopter fell into the Black Sea after the attack near the coastal resort of Gagra, focus of fierce fighting since last weekend.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JIEFANGJUN BAO reporter Wang Wenjie (3769 2429 2638) and </F> XINHUA reporter Luo Yuwen (5012 3768 2429)]    [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the CPC Central Committee, state president, and  chairman of the Central Military Commission, held a discussion  meeting with the trainees at the National Defense University on  8 June. He emphasized during the discussion: In order to study  well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, it is most important to consider the  new circumstances and tasks, seriously implement the principle  of integrating theory with practice, persistently combine the  study of theories with the research on actual problems, and  display a study style of integrating study with application and  of studying for the purpose of application.    Present at the discussion were vice chairmen of the Central  Military Commission Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen, as well as  members of the Central Military Commission Chi Haotian, Zhang  Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou.    Six representatives of the trainees spoke during the  discussion. They discussed such issues as how to thoroughly  implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on Army building  during the new period and the Central Military Commission's  general and specific policies, how to step up Army building in  an all-round way, and how to further strengthen army-government  unity and army-people unity.    After hearing their views, Jiang Zemin made an important  speech. He first pointed out: To seize opportunity, deepen  reform, open up wider, promote development and maintain  stability is the general task set by the party Central Committee  for the whole party and the whole country. The general task,  set under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reflects the  fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities across  the country. In order to study theories in light of reality, we  must uphold the general task and consider it to be the greatest  reality. High-ranking Army cadres should take the lead in  ensuring that the orders of the party Central Committee, the  State Council, and the Central Military Commission reach all  levels, and in doing all work well according to high and strict  standards. High-ranking Army cadres should display a strong  party spirit and a high degree of sense of organization and  discipline, strictly enforce prohibitions, and obey orders in  all actions.    Jiang Zemin then pointed out: The Army should take a further  step to carry forward fine traditions and step up the building  of socialist spiritual civilization. It should uphold the  purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly and advocate the  spirit of selfless dedication. It should deepen the campaigns  to learn from Lei Feng, Su Ning, Xu Honggang, and other heroes  and models; further advance and enrich revolutionary  righteousness; foster good morality; and always keep the  distinctive character of Red Army veterans, as well as the image  of the People's Army.    Jiang Zemin emphasized: To seek truth and do a solid work is  the key to success in every work. Leading cadres must display a  style of doing arduous and meticulous work, work steadily and  make solid progress in every phase of the work. Leading cadres  must do all they can to reduce activities at the higher level,  constantly conduct investigation and study among troops of  grass-roots units, and familiarize themselves with the actual  situation of the troops, so that the policies and guidance  formulated by them will be more effective and with clearer  objectives. In the final analysis, to do a solid work means  doing a solid work for grass-roots units. When a leading organ  makes a policy decision or issues instructions, it must fully  consider the reality and endurance of grass-roots units. We  should create a concentrated atmosphere of doing a solid work  throughout the Army, strictly carry out all the policy decisions  of the Central Military Commission, and constantly push Army  building forward in an all-round way.    The training class is the second rotational training class  for cadres holding regular corps-level or higher posts to study  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. It  is run by the National Defense University at the request of the  Central Military Commission and the three general departments.    Zhu Dunfa, commandant of the National Defense University,  chaired the discussion meeting. Li Wenqing, political commissar  of the University, attended the meeting.</p>

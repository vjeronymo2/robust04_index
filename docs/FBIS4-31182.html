			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Krasimir Uzunov of the Balkan Agency: "Balkans </F> Are Not Persian Gulf"]    [Text] The strong U.S. military presence in the Balkans  during the last two years and the unconcealed and increasing  appetites of the United States in the peninsula are well on the  way to causing a huge row, which will certainly not be the last.    Albania's decision to hand over the Gjader air base in the  vicinity of Tirana for the siting of radio monitoring equipment  and the use of U.S. pilotless surveillance aircraft with an  800-km range are two links in a chain that now has to be  explained to the overtrustful Balkan peoples. In itself, the  ASSOCIATED PRESS's disclosure of the U.S. spy plane flights over  the Balkans would be merely worrying, if other facts were not  notable by their absence. The readiness of the Albanian  authorities to hand over air bases for combat aircraft in the  event it becomes necessary to bomb Serbian positions, doubts  about the building of a military base for the U.S. land forces  in what was formerly the most up-to-date testing grounds for the  Yugoslav People's Army at Krivolak in central Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the additions  to the U.S. "blue helmet" contingent, the gradual replacement of  Scandinavian troops with U.S. troops,... all these are only some  of the steps being made to step up the military activities of  the United States in the southern part of the Balkans, now that  it is free of Russian influence.    Although the forces and hardware that have been  concentrated,  in the classical sense, in this region have their attention  directed mainly toward the events in former Yugoslavia, our  criminal insouciance as immediate neighbors may, at a certain  stage of development, at the very least turn out to be a bad  thing for us.    Judge for yourselves. The Democratic Party of [Albanian]  President Sali Berisha and Eduard Selami, which sits firmly in  the saddle in Tirana, chose the U.S. military presence as a  means of settling accounts with Serbia in their dispute over  Kosovo. On the other hand, Tirana managed to provide solid  financial backing for itself by getting Albania, a country with  a varied religious composition, accepted into the Islamic  Conference Organization.    What is worse is that the troops who have come to monitor  the  Serbian border are casting their eyes more frequently toward the  border with Bulgaria. One also notes that the military hardware  that is transiting Bulgaria is suspiciously heavy-weight in  nature, and that the white plane that infringed our airspace (in  the region of Gyueshevo) last week was certainly not a  Macedonian one, and was even less likely to be Serbian or Greek.    You may say, what then? With our knowledge and consent or  not, the strata in the Balkans have begun to move and the  "hunting reserves" are beginning to change hands. In other  words, the United States is now a state with a firm footing in  the straits, at the surviving Greek bases, in Albania, and in  the newly restored Republic of Macedonia. The concluding stage  of the realization of this great goal is associated with  numerous moves of the most varied kind: Montgomery's readiness  to amend our Constitution at a certain juncture; the U.S.  patronage of the illegal Ilinden United Macedonian Organization  and of Kamen Burov's Pomak Democratic Party; its interest in  so-called artificial minorities; the location of the American  University nowhere else than in Blagoevgrad; the articles about  Bulgaria's territorial claims on Macedonia that have been  appearing with surprising consistency; and the formation of a  pro- American lobby among our politicians, who, to further their  own careers, are ready to turn their backs on and betray their  own country's national interests.    In the context of all this open and surreptitious activity,  AP's allegedly sensational revelations of U.S. spy plane flights  over the Balkans only mark the beginning of something far more  serious that might shake the states established in our  eruption-prone peninsula. If those of our statesmen that still  nurture pro-American feelings have not yet realized our  geostrategic situation, I advise them to spend an hour or two  perusing the map. The Balkans are not yet the [Persian] Gulf,  although some people are very keen on them becoming so. One  thing, we have no oil, and another, not all of us are yet  inclined to become Muslims.</p>

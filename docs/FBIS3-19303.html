			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>   [Text] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  took a major step towards widening its ranks here early  Wednesday [16 March] by accepting Norway's application two weeks  after agreeing to take in Austria, Finland and Sweden.    In a 13-hour meeting that ended after midnight, EU foreign  ministers also narrowed the gap in an internal split over voting  rights which was threatening to block the entry of all four  applicants into the Union by January 1.    The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers,  Theodoros Pangalos, said: "I think we can give out a message of  optimism to the people of Europe. It is a sign of strength that  Europe can work together well."    Pangalos added that impetus had been given to proposals for  a  further enlargement of the Union -- initially to take in Cyprus  and Malta, then other applicants which include Hungary, Poland  and the Czech Republic.    The EU ministers hammered out a compromise deal to give the  EU's poorer countries, particularly Spain, limited access to  Norwegian fishing waters plus bigger catch quotas in other  fishing grounds.    The negotiations had been blocked earlier by Spain's  insistence on access to Norway's fish-rich waters as part of  Norway's price for EU membership, and Oslo's refusal to open up  its carefully-husbanded fishing grounds.    But the meeting could not overcome Britain's refusal to give  way in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial  councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take  account of the four new members.    The ministers agreed to meet again next Tuesday in their  fourth attempt to resolve the dispute amid signs that a  compromise might be in sight to let Britain back down without  too much political damage at home.    Pangalos warned that the Union would be in trouble if the  issue was not resolved. "The whole of community life would be at  a dead end. I do not think this is possible," he said.    Britain, with some backing from Spain, was demanding that  the  entry of four small countries into the EU should not tilt the  balance of power in the EU by diluting the ability of bigger  members to block decisions they do not like.    The argument hinges on the system of weighted majority  voting  in ministerial councils. Under current procedures, 23 out of 76  votes divided up among the 12 members -- 30 percent -- are  enough to block majority decisions.    Such a blocking minority can be formed by one small and two  large countries. Most members want to keep the 30 percent  threshhold so that 27 out of 90 votes would be necessary for a  blocking minority after the four applicants join.    Britain and Spain objected because this would mean three  countries could no longer form a blocking minority, so that  London and Madrid would have a harder time defending their  interests.    But Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said Spain was  leaning towards the majority view on the issue. "I can't see  Britain alone being prepared to shoulder the blame for  preventing enlargement (of the EU)," he said.    Some diplomats suggested that the British opposition was  more  cosmetic than real, aimed at appeasing anti-Europe sentiment  back home which could be damaging to the government of Prime  Minister John Major.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there had been  understanding for the British point of view, despite the charge  from his Danish colleague, Niels Helveg Petersen, that London  was driving the enlargement drive into crisis.    Hurd suggested that progress might be made on Tuesday. "We  want enlargement but we do not want that to weaken minorities,"  he said.    Pangalos proposed a compromise -- that the blocking  threshhold should be raised to 27 pending a major review of EU  rules in 1996, but that the interests of minority groupings  would be treated sympathetically in the meanwhile.    The dispute must be resolved by the end of March if the four  applicant countries are to have any chance of joining the EU by  the target date of January 1 next year.</p>

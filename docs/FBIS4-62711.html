			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine published on  6 May 1994 its first-ever data about foreign capital investment  increments over the first quarter of 1994. According to the  Ministry's press release, as of 1 April 1994, foreign capital  investments in Ukraine totalled $180.5 million having increased  by $66.7 million over the January-March 1994 period.    Canada topped the list of major investors (32.7 per cent of  the aggregate amount), followed by Germany (11.6 per cent), the  United States (11.1 per cent), Cyprus and Switzerland (4.2 per  cent each nation), the United Kingdom and Poland (2.9 per cent  each nation).    Russia topped the list of former Union nations, which  invested in Ukraine (1.7 million US dollars, or 73.7 per cent of  the former Union nations' total investments).    Other nations' investments in Ukraine's economy were much  more sluggish and totalled $3.9 million by the first quarter's  close, or just one-forty-fifth of the total investment amount.  However, their first quarter increment amounted to 2.9 million  dollars in the first quarter of 1994.    Ukraine's capital investments in the January-March 1994  period were channeled predominantly into economies of European  nations (99 per cent of the total) with Austria having topped  the list of recipient nations ($2.9 million).    The table below presents the first quarter's foreign capital  investment break-down.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |(thousands of USD)                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Amounts of foreign inves-|Amounts of Ukraine's inv-|  |                         |tments in Ukraine        |estments in other nations|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total                    |180,453.10               |3,916.06                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including:               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |A.

Ukrainian enterprises with foreign investments, in  particular, those located in Kiev, are basically engaged in  trading and go-between activities (80 per cent of the total  amount of enterprises). Product manufacture and rendering  services are basic types of activities for respectively 15 and 5  per cent of the enterprises.    The Cabinet's Decree of 20 May 1993, "On the State Program  for foreign investment attraction", provides the legal  foundation for effecting foreign capital investments in Ukraine.  Following the Decree's provisions, the Law on the State Program  for foreign investment attraction was passed in December 1993  (see UBN no. 7/1994).    The State Program is designed to stimulate investments in  large state-owned enterprises with preference given to 11 key  branches of the national economy.    Ukraine's very immediate foreign capital investment  requirements to cover just a few years to come are estimated at  $5 billion.    The Ukrainian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations is  currently drafting a list of Ukrainian enterprises, which need  foreign capital perfusions with specified amounts of  investments, forms of cooperation and areas of activities. The  list is supposed to be annually revised and complemented.</p>

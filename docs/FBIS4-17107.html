			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report in the "NEGA reports" column] </F>   [Text] Within 10 days Ukrainian and Russian delegations  are to submit to their heads of state a draft agreement on the  division of the Black Sea Fleet. At a news conference in Kiev,  Leonid Kravchuk confirmed that he has invited Boris Yeltsin to  come to Ukraine on an official visit. This visit will take  place after a large-scale treaty on friendship and cooperation  has been prepared. The next round of negotiations on the  division of the Black Sea Fleet is scheduled for 22 April in  Moscow. Admiral (Ret.) Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet  commander, expressed his discontent with the agreements reached  in Moscow on the Black Sea Fleet problem. He stated that none  of the decisions made in Moscow will satisfy the Black Sea Fleet  servicemen: "People will relate to it negatively because the  presidents treat the fleet not an instrument to protect the  people's interests but as an instrument in political games."</p>

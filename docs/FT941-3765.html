			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Auditors' right to report fraud is made a duty Auditors may be barred from auditing financial-services companies if they detect fraud and fail to report it to regulators. Guidelines issued yesterday by the Auditing Practices Board convert into a duty the existing right of auditors to report fraud. The board, which is responsible for issuing advice to auditors, was asked to develop the guidelines in response to a recommendation in the 1992 report by Lord Justice Bingham into the regulatory implications of the closure of Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Under existing regulations, auditors are permitted to breach client confidentiality by reporting fraud in the existing regulated sectors: banks, building societies and companies involved in financial services. Under the new version, this right becomes an obligation and is extended for the first time to friendly societies and insurance companies. Auditors must still preserve confidentiality and will not be able to inform other clients that might be affected that they have detected fraud. However, they will have to ensure that the partner auditing a regulated entity is aware of other non-audit work undertaken by his or her firm for the same client. Mr Richard Fleck, a partner with Herbert Smith, the law firm, and a member of the board, said the guidelines would inevitably lead to an increase in the number of incidents reported to regulators. But they were an attempt to highlight issues on which auditors should report and not every trivial concern. For example, the guidance for the investment businesses stresses that incidents to be reported should be of 'material' significance. The guidelines for reporting to the Bank of England essentially follow the Bank's own authorisation criteria for deposit-taking institutions, such as the requirement for directors to be 'fit and proper'. Separate guidelines for insurance companies and friendly societies are to be published soon.</p>

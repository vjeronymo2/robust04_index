			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Swedish No Overturns Finnish </F> Yes?"]    [Excerpt] If Sweden and Norway say no in their European  Union [EU] referenda, a Finnish yes in the referendum on 16  October will not be confirmed by the Eduskunta.    This view was expressed by many Eduskunta deputies,  particularly from the Center Party, when the legislation on the  referendum was yesterday finally passed in its third reading in  the Eduskunta.    Markku Laukkanen (Center Party) said that he believes that a  third of Eduskunta deputies will bring down the EU agreement if  Sweden and Norway reject their agreements in their referenda.    Hannu Kemppainen, his party colleague, claimed that the  result of the referendum can only be binding on Eduskunta  deputies if it can be interpreted as representing a permanent  body of public opinion among the people. The result in Sweden  could, however, reverse public opinion. We should not have  arranged things like this, he said, blaming the situation on  President Martti Ahtisaari, Social Democratic Party chairman  Paavo Lipponen, and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen  (National Coalition Party).    Mirja Ryynanen (Center Party) made her contribution by  saying  that if after the referendum important new information relating  to the issue becomes available, the Eduskunta should naturally  take it into consideration. Such new information could be the  negative stances of the other Nordic countries.    At its party congress last weekend the Center Party resolved  that "the Center Party in Finland will respect any referendum  result that arises in this way." By "this way" the congress  meant that the national support package is approved before the  referendum in a form that corresponds to the government's  decision in principle. However, the congress resolution  contained no mention of the Swedish and Norwegian referenda.    Liberal People's Party chairman Tuulikki Ukkola reacted to  the Center Party deputies' statements and claimed that these  undermine the foundation for a referendum.    Constitutional Committee chairman Sauli Niinisto (National  Coalition Party) wondered why Finland's decision should be tied  to Sweden's. According to this argument, if Sweden had been  voting first there would be no need for a referendum in Finland.  And if the referenda were to take place simultaneously only the  Swedish result would be binding, he said.    Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Pertti Paasio (Social  Democratic Party) interpreted those debaters who want to tie  Finland's decision to Sweden's to be saying that they want  Finland to follow Sweden's decision, but only on the condition  that Sweden takes the same view as a minority in the Finnish  Eduskunta.    The debate was started by the Left Alliance's Esko Seppanen  who had distributed an amendment to the effect that a new  referendum should be arranged "if the other Nordic countries'  referenda change to a significant extent the base for Finland's  membership of the EU" -- in simple terms: if Sweden and Norway  say no after a Finnish yes.    However, Seppanen did not table the amendment officially. If  it had been voted down now, it would be more difficult to  arrange such a referendum if such a situation were to arise.    Unusually the Eduskunta also debated the nature of the EU,  whether the Union is developing in a federalist direction, and  whether Finland should promote or slow down such a development.    EU opponents in particular argued that the EU is developing  into a federal state. This argument was rejected by National  Coalition Party Eduskunta group chairman Ben Zyskowicz who  stressed that the creation of a federal state presupposes  agreement and that in particular the enlargement of the EU  currently taking place means that its structure as an alliance  of states -- the cooperation between national states -- will  remain for a long time to come.    This made Esko Seppanen assert that EU supporters are  entering the referendum with contradictory views of the EU:  Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) and now the National  Coalition Party are leading us into an EU of nation-states,  while Social Democratic Party chairman Paavo Lipponen is leading  us into the federal state of the EU.    Lipponen was not in his place, but Pertti Paasio replied  that  Lipponen had meant that looser integration is not necessarily  more advantageous for small member states as is more solid  integration.    Johannes Koskinen (Social Democratic Party) admitted that  both in Europe and in Finland the Social Democrats have  conflicting views on this issue.    The legislation on the referendum was passed unanimously,  because its content had already been settled in the votes during  its second reading. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear the case of accused serial killer  Charles Ng, moving the former U.S. Marine a step closer to extradition to  California to face 12 murder charges. Ruling without comment, the high court in  Ottawa rejected Ng's request to appeal an extradition order handed down by an  Alberta judge. Ng still can appeal to the Justice Minister. Ng, 28, is wanted  in connection with the sex-torture slayings of 12 men, women and children in  Northern California. Eleven of the deaths involved sex slayings at a rural  cabin in Calaveras County in the Sierra. The 12th involved the death of a San  Francisco disc jockey. Ng is also wanted on kidnaping and burglary charges.  </P></p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Mannesmann unit confident Mannesmann Mobilfunk (MMO), Germany's first private mobile telephone operator, said it would for the first time make a 'significant' profit in 1994, after almost doubling turnover. The company is also changing its tariff structure next year in an attempt to capture more of the mass market, a move which it expects to result in a further big increase in sales. Its D2 mobile telephone net is expected to have 850,000 subscribers by the end of the year, up from around 500,000 this time last year. Turnover in 1994 rose 88 per cent to DM1.7bn (Dollars 1.1bn) from DM902m the year before. The group would not give any details about likely profits in 1994, but analysts expect them to be between DM100m and DM150m. Around DM2.4bn has been invested in MMO since the company - a subsidiary of the Mannesmann engineering group - was started five years ago. Another DM1.6bn will be invested over the next five years to increase the capacity of the D2 mobile telephone net, especially in airports and railway stations where there is an unusually high number of users. Recently, MMO has taken the battle for the mobile telephone market to its two competitors, DeTeMobil, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, and E-Plus, a consortium run by Veba and Thyssen. Last month, MMO slashed the cost of calls on its D2 network, a move DeTeMobil was obliged to copy shortly afterwards.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cancun, QR [Quintana Roo], 24 Apr -- The Mexican  Government has decided to grant temporary, 180-day visas to the  Cuban boat people who arrived in national territory, as a  "general measure" to halt problems that may stem from the wave  of Cubans trying to seek asylum in the United States.    Jorge Mendoza Garza, coordinator of supervision and  operations control of the National Migration Institute [INM],  said here the 85 boat people who arrived at Isla Mujeres at dawn  on 11 April are the first Cubans to benefit from this measure.  Mendoza was in charge of transporting the boat people via  chartered plane to Mexico City today.    The official said that after verifying that the boat the  boat  people were planning to use to reach Miami "failed to meet  specified international security standards," these Cubans were  convinced to go to Mexico City "where they can probably expedite  procedures to enter the United States legally."    The Cubans voiced their doubts, however, that Mexican  authorities are trying to repatriate them in light of the 23  April incident, which occurred 13 km off the coast of Isla  Mujeres whereby 62 boat people evaded the Mexican Army, trying  to reach international waters on board the boat that brought  them from the Cayman Islands, the Ferro 25.    The Mexican Army deployed two frigates to intercept the  deserters of the Fidel Castro government. One of the frigates,  the "Chontal," rammed the middle of the Cuban boat. Carlos  Avila, one of the boat people who, as he said, "unintentionally"  became the group's spokesman, said "the boat was damaged after  we were hosed with water cannons."    During the operation, three Cubans were injured, one of them  in the ribs, but Jaime Machorro Musalem, Yucatan Peninsula  Migration representative, has insisted that the boat people had  minor bruises and that no seriously injured Cuban traveled to  Mexico City.    The Cubans left for Mexico City from the local airport at  1720 sharp on a chartered Boeing 727-200, plate registration  XA-TCX, owned by the Allegro Charter Company. Meanwhile,  another boat with 96 Cubans on board was on its way to Cozumel,  presumably to be transported to Mexico City in the same plane on  25 April.    Meanwhile, many relatives of the boat people in Miami have  contacted news correspondents and the local media to inform them  they would protest abuses to which the Mexican Army allegedly  subjected the boat people.    Machorro refused to confirm these allegations, but he  underscored immigration authorities had nothing to do with the  operation "because there are no formal relations between the  Navy [as published] and the INM." He added that for the time  being, these institutions are addressing the problem "only as  far as they are concerned." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ITALIAN OPEN;  </P> <P> CAPRIATI'S QUICK WIN MAKES IT LOOK EASY  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati's European debut was short and sweet.  </P> <P> Playing in front of Italian relatives and a crowd that has adopted her as its  own, the 14-year-old American overwhelmed qualifier Leona Laskova of  Czechoslovakia, 6-0, 6-3, Monday in the first round of the Italian Open.  </P> <P> The match, played on the red clay of the Foro Italico center court, lasted only  50 minutes.  </P> <P> It was an easy workout for the 12th-seeded Capriati, who has reached two finals  in three tournaments and moved to No. 25 in the world rankings since turning  pro in March.  </P> <P> Laskova, ranked No. 143 in the world, was always on the defensive, as Capriati  cracked forehand and backhand winners from the backcourt. The eighth-grader  also showed no hesitation in coming to the net, often charging in for putaway  volleys and smashes.  </P> <P> In the only other matches involving seeded players, No. 9 Laura Gildemeister of  Peru beat Nicole Provis of Australia, 6-2, 7-5, and No. 12 Helen Kelesi of  Canada defeated Jo-An Faull of Australia, 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> Unseeded American Lori McNeil lost to Czechoslovakia's Radka Zrubakova, 7-6  (7-2), 6-2.  </P></p>

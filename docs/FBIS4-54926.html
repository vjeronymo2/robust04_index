			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski has said  that, according to President Lech Walesa, the current wave of  strikes may hinder the functioning of the state. The president  thinks that serious negotiations between the government and  trade unionists should prevent any further strikes or stop them  altogether.    [Begin Drzycimski recording] This strike, which is beginning  to affect key security industries, is a threat not only to a  particular industry but also to the whole state. That is why  the president is saying that one must consider whether all of  the industries should strike when this could bring a halt to the  whole country. This strike is not aimed at changing political  power but at finding economic solutions. The president thinks  that, in such a situation, the talks must be continued because  nothing can happen without them. [end recording]    [Announcer] Andrzej Drzycimki said that the president has  not  yet decided on the excess wage increase tax [neopopiwek] law  because he has received contradictory opinions on this  regulation. Lech Walesa thinks that opponents as well as  supporters of the excess wage increase tax have very valid  arguments. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / American Express sales record AMERICAN Express, the US-based financial services group, reported record sales of its travellers cheques. In the period January to August this year, US dollar cheque sales were up 29 per cent and sterling cheques up 14 per cent on the same period last year. The company said recent shifts in the dollar exchange rate and a change in consumers' attitude to debt were partly responsible for the increase in sales.</p>

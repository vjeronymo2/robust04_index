			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIMBING TO THE TOP  </P> <P> Not long after California hosted the Special Olympics, CBS provided a wonderful  hour of TV programming featuring a climb of Mt.  </P> <P> Kilimanjaro by a group of developmentally disabled persons. It took great  courage for the athletes to make that awesome climb; it also took courage for  CBS to present "Let Me Be Brave," as well as for the sponsors who endorsed it.  </P> <P> The program was real, heartwarming and entertaining. It was TV at its best.  </P> <P> Sanford M. Gage, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Unidentified correspondent] A Croatian Assembly  House of Counties session was addressed today by Mate Granic,  Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign affairs minister, who  delivered a report on current Croatian foreign policy issues.  In his address he stressed that Croatia had good relations with  almost all neighboring and European countries. Official Italy  has contributed to this, he said, by denying worrying statements  made by Italian neofascists regarding Croatia's territorial  integrity.    For Croatian diplomacy, the most important task at the  moment  is to achieve the simultaneous resolution of the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of UN Protected Areas  into the legal system of Croatia, while the sanctions against  Serbia ought to be linked with the progress reached in  negotiations on UN Protected Areas. He warned that the UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force] mandate will not be extended if its troops  are not deployed along Croatia's borders with Serbia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and unless it prevents ethnic cleansing.    Minister Granic assessed the Vienna agreement on the  implementation of the Washington Agreement as being extremely  important for Croatia and stressed:    [Begin Granic recording] The Zagreb cease-fire agreement is  supported by all countries and by international financial  institutions. We must carry out our diplomatic activities  carefully, and gain support from international factors for all  activities that we will be undertaking in connection with  UNPROFOR. But the key issue is how the Washington Agreement is  going to be implemented. [end recording]    [Correspondent] In continuation, the Chamber of Counties  rejected a demand by the opposition parties for a no-confidence  motion in the culture and education and defense ministers to be  put on the vote, but demanded a report on the set-up of the  Croatian Army and results of an investigation into the explosion  at the Duboki Jarak munitions dump.

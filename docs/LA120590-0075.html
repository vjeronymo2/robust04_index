			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LESLIE LEADS USC WOMEN PAST SAN DIEGO STATE, 68-54  </P> <P> Neither coach will likely want to keep this one in her video file, but No. 21  USC defeated San Diego State, 68-54, in a nonconference women's basketball game  Tuesday in front of 1,539 in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "The first 20 minutes set the game back," SDSU Coach Beth Burns said.  </P> <P> "It was ugly basketball. It was almost scary it was still a game at halftime.  We probably played the worst 20 minutes I've seen in years."  </P> <P> SDSU guard Crystal Lee led all scorers with 25. Lisa Leslie, USC's standout  freshman, had 20 points and a game-high 23 rebounds. USC (3-1) out-rebounded  the Aztecs, 65-44.  </P> <P> Leslie, you may remember, is the player who scored 101 points in a game last  season for Morningside High in Inglewood. She entered Tuesday's game averaging  30 points and 20 rebounds a game, which are the same numbers she had in her  first college game, an 88-77 USC upset of then-No. 12 Texas Nov. 25.  </P> <P> It didn't take her long to impress the Aztecs (2-2). She had 12 points and 11  rebounds in the first half.  </P> <P> USC took a 12-0 lead and held the Aztecs scoreless for nearly five minutes. Lee  hit a driving shot from the lane with 15:07 remaining in the half to give the  Aztecs their first bucket. Lee then scored SDSU's next three baskets.  </P> <P> USC led at the half, 30-21, despite shooting only 32.5%. SDSU shot 26.5%.  </P> <P> "Overall, I thought we played consistently well on defense," USC Coach Marianne  Stanley said. "I think (SDSU) is going to beat a heck of a lot of people this  year. I really do."  </P></p>

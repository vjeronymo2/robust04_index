			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo (Japanese </F> Trade Union Confederation) by TOKYO SHIMBUN reporter Yuji Saito:  "Political Realignment Talks Should Come After Passage of the  Fiscal 1994 Budget"; place and date not given]    [Text] [Saito] Could you please tell us your views on the  controversial plan to form a new policy study forum among ruling  coalition parties?    [Yamagishi] The policy study forum was first said to provide  a basis for a parliamentary union of coalition party members in  the House of Representatives. However, when we think of the  next lower house election, there will be a good possibility that  the policy study forum will develop into the so-called  coalition-wide "new new party [shin shinto]" in the end.  Parties in the ruling coalition should first complete the  process toward forming a single parliamentary group in the House  of Councilors by dispelling the ill feeling among them, by  deepening mutual confidence, and by overcoming their fundamental  policy differences. It was reported that participation in the  policy study forum would become a precondition for candidate  selection that would be jointly supported by all coalition  parties in the next lower house election. It was also said that  the prime minister and the promoters of the study forum plan had  a secret meeting to discuss who would take up which post in the  coalition-wide "new new party." If this is true, I strongly  object to these moves. I have to confess, I never expected such  developments in the political realignment talks.    [Saito] Shinseito and Komeito are maneuvering quickly.    [Yamagishi] I want them to put off such a move until the  fiscal 1994 budget clears the Diet. Coalition members should  not give the impression that they are engrossed in an  interlocking puzzle to find a new combination of parties and  paying no attention to the most important and urgent matter,  which is the implementation of measures to stimulate the  sluggish economy. If they do not go all-out to win passage of  the fiscal 1994 budget, I am afraid that the fate of the  coalition government might become uncertain. If the coalition  government were to collapse, coalition members would suffer a  total loss. As such there is no point in discussing the "new  new party" plan right now.    [Saito] What exactly is the "social-democratic/liberal"  alliance?    [Yamagishi] Since Japanese people have various political  values, there should be a tendency to wish for a political force  that fights for the interests of workers, like the Labor Party  under the European type of two-party system. However, a  movement to create this sort of political force has not taken  shape so far. People with such an idea are still groping in the  dark. Hopefully, a neoliberal party should have the following  selling points: It should promote a nonmilitary role in global  security efforts, emphasize the interests of workers, and secure  clean and open politics.    [Saito] What kind of role do you expect Hokkaido Governor  Takahiro Yokomichi to play in the next phase of the unfolding  political realignment drama?    [Yamagishi] The governing coalition is now supported by two  forces. One is the Shinseito-Komeito axis, which is already  very steady. Unfortunately, the other one has not taken shape  yet. However, there are indications that it is coming into  existence. The movement toward the creation of a neoliberal  party is a sign. I want Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi to play a  certain role in promoting this movement, in cooperation with  other leaders. One point is that his comeback to the central  stage should be well timed. We are going to see another  climactic scene in the unfolding political realignment drama,  from the end of the current regular Diet session until early  autumn. At that event, Mr. Yokomichi should not give the  impression that he has been prevailed upon to become the new  leader of the liberal force. Like Prime Minister Hosokawa did  when he created his party, Mr. Yokomichi will have to  demonstrate that he is firmly determined to create a new party,  even if he is left alone.    [Saito] You have announced that Rengo will establish a  political forum in June. Don't you think that the forum will  become a means for selecting political parties with which Rengo  will cooperate in the next elections?    [Yamagishi] Before the inauguration of the political forum,  a preparatory panel will be set up in early April. Electoral  cooperation will necessarily be brought up for discussion.  However, participation in the political forum should absolutely  not become a precondition to get Rengo's support or endorsement  in the next elections. At this moment, the most delicate issue  for the preparatory panel is which parties should be invited to  join the political forum.    [Saito] Some Rengo-affiliated local industrial unions, such  as the All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, have  announced that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will  no longer enjoy a monopoly on their support. What do you think  of the change in their policy?    [Yamagishi] Candidates backed by all coalition members  will automatically receive Rengo's support; this is quite  natural. The recent gubernatorial election in Ishikawa  Prefecture showed the coalition parties will not be able to  defeat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] if they fight  individually. Rengo has traditionally backed the SDPJ and the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. However, in the next lower  house election to be held under the new single-seat electoral  system, many members who belong to neither the SDPJ nor the DSP  will be selected as candidates to be jointly supported by the  coalition parties. Therefore, these labor unions cannot but  change their policy of supporting only one party.    [Saito] What future do you foresee for the governing  coalition?    [Yamagishi] There are now two different tendencies among the  ruling coalition. However, all members are of the same opinion  that they will have to cooperate in fielding candidates in the  next general elections. They should present an effective united  front against the LDP by making utmost efforts to jointly  support a single candidate in each district.    [TOKYO SHIMBUN editorial note] Yamagishi is a senior member  of the SDPJ who joined the party in 1954 and has been affiliated  with it ever since. During the interview, we strongly felt his  anxiety about the future of his party. It seemed as if he was  saying: "Whether it stays with the ruling coalition or whether  it secedes from it, the SDPJ should remain united. Otherwise  other parties will try to take its electoral power base by  assault, bringing about a breakup of the SDPJ. As a party  member, I am anxious about it." At the same time, we also  realize he has a strong sense of duty as a "cheerleader" for the  governing coalition. In an effort to maintain unity within the  coalition, he seemed to be ambitious to play a role as a  mediator between the Shinseito-Komeito forces and the rest of  the coalition members.</p>

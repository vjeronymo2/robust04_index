			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: No shocks, please, we're careful - Unit trusts / Pembroke Pembroke does not rank alongside the better known names of the unit trust industry, such as M&amp;G or Fidelity, but it is the second highest-performing fund in the UK Equity Growth sector in the five and three years to November 1 (offer to bid, net income re-invested, Source: Micropal). The fund was established in December 1986 as a joint venture between John Carrington &amp; Co., a London-based independent fund management company established in 1970, and a Cardiff stockbroker. Carrington took over total ownership in December 1988. Once it acquired a five-year track record, Pembroke caught the eye of independent financial advisers, who recommended it to clients. As a result, it has grown from Pounds 5m last year to just under Pounds 14m at end-October. The price is still only weekly but there are plans to go daily in the new year. Also, the name is to be changed soon to Pembroke Growth following the recent acquisition by Carrington of two Brown Shipley unit trusts. Pembroke is managed by a trio: John Carrington, a former financial journalist with The Times; George Luckraft, who joined the company in 1980 from university; and Nigel Thomas, formerly an accountant with Robson Rhodes and one-time manager of Hill Samuel's Smaller Companies fund. The team's strategy relies heavily on stock selection and Thomas, as investment manager, has veto power over selection. 'We look for value in terms of cash flow per share, dividend cover, yield, earnings growth, and the growth relative to the price/earnings ratio,' he says. 'If we don't find it in the FT-SE stocks, then we look elsewhere.' He cites Sirdar, one of the top 10 holdings, as a classic example of looking for value in a declining industry. Sirdar, which deals in textiles and hand-knitting yarns, was bought on a 9 per cent dividend yield. Boosted by new management, the company has increased its dividend while the shares are yielding 5 per cent. Thomas adds: 'We are, hopefully, picking the best of the Footsie like Cable &amp; Wireless, De La Rue and Wolseley, and then giving it a good blend of medium and smaller size companies that are growing irrespective of the economy.' His aim is companies growing by 10-20 per cent a year. About 58 per cent of the fund is split evenly between large and medium sized companies. Four per cent is in cash and the rest in smaller companies. 'We're not a slave to sectoral weightings,' says Thomas. 'If we don't like oil companies, which are 9 per cent of the All Share, we don't have them.' The team has a predilection for companies 'which make things or sell things' so that it tends to ignore oil, some financials and property. There are certainly no financial or property companies in the fund's top five holdings: Electronic Data Processing, a Sheffield-based computer software and services group; Mayborn Group, which makes fabric dyes, baby products and florists' sundries; Cable &amp; Wireless; Filofax, the personal organiser company; and Next, the fashion retailer. EDP, the largest holding, accounts for 2.4 per cent of the fund but holdings usually are limited to 2 per cent. The team finds smaller companies through its network of specialist small company brokers and its own experience. Luckraft and Thomas both have small children and noticed that many of the products they bought for them came from Mayborn - which is now the fund's second-largest holding. Luckraft says Pembroke's performance has resulted from avoiding disasters - largely, by taking the view that, where smaller companies are concerned, investing is like lending money to the management. With three people involved, the team also has the time to meet the managements of the fund's smaller companies. 'We operate a management ban list and we will not touch some managements wherever they turn up,' he says. Thomas adds that performance is aided by a readiness to sell stocks which are not performing as well as expected. 'If something makes a loss for a good reason, it's worth keeping. But, in the main, if we've made the wrong decision, we cut them ruthlessly,' he says. Selling out can mean losing out, and the team says there are many times when it has come to regret disposing of a stock too soon. One such was Rhino Group, a computer and video games retailer, which was sold at half the present share price. At the moment, Thomas does not see much value in stocks on the FT-SE, which has many companies exposed to international earnings. 'There's some risks on international earners, especially in Europe, so we try to avoid those.' Pembroke's performance has slipped in the year to November, where it is in the second decile (18th of 144). The team attributes this partly to its dislike of non-manufacturing companies - it tends to steer clear of property companies and other recovery and cyclical stocks, which have performed well recently. 'We've missed out on the property sector and we don't like contractors, either,' says Luckraft. 'One wrong contract and the business is out of the window. We don't like nasty shocks.' Charges: The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual management fee 1 per cent. The bid/offer spread is about 5.7 per cent. Minimum lump sum investment is Pounds 500 and there is a monthly savings plan of Pounds 35. Holdings can be put into a personal equity plan without cost. This is the last article in the series.</p>

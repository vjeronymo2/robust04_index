			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The government decided on  Friday [4 March] to designate the lead and zinc mining and  smelting industry as a recession-hit industry eligible for  government subsidies from March 9, 1994 until June 30, 1995.    The industry is now in serious recession as a result of  reduced demand from the automobile and steel industries and the  yen's appreciation.    When a certain industry is designated as a specific  slump-hit  enterprise, businesses in the industry will be given subsidies,  to help them take steps to prevent unemployment and help workers  laid off find new employment.</p>

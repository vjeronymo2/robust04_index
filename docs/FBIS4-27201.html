			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [30 May] cautioned the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] against its move to try  and reestablish its presence in the government, either as part  of the ruling coalition or in an alliance with the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP).    "Although there's speculation that the SDP will join a third  coalition government by returning to the fold or it may form a  grand alliance with the LDP to force a dissolution of the House  of Representatives, while the multiseat constituency system is  still in place, such moves would be contrary to the momentum of  history," he said.    Hosokawa was speaking about recent political developments at  a party in a Tokyo hotel to mark the establishment of the Tokyo  chapter of the Japan New Party [JNP], which he founded in 1992.    The statements were Hosokawa's first public remarks since  the  administration of his successor, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  was launched April 25 following Hosokawa's fall from grace amid  allegations about his shadowy personal finances.    The speech came shortly before an alleged rightist assailant  fired a shot in the Keio Plaza Hotel. The assailant, Masakatsu  Nozoe, was quickly overpowered and later claimed shooting at the  ceiling in a show of protest against Hosokawa.    "Although the withdrawal of the SDP from the ruling  coalition  was prompted by the formation of the unified parliamentary bloc,  Kaishin (Innovation), it constituted a part of the historical  adjustment process of the 1955 system," Hosokawa said.    The 1955 system refers to the fundamental power balance of  the LDP-led conservative political camp and the SDP-led  left-leaning opposition camp, which had been in place since  1955, when the LDP was formed from the merger of the Liberal  Party and the Democratic Party.    Hosokawa refuted allegations that the days of the Japan New  Party are numbered due to public disillusion with the party  following the Hosokawa scandal.    "If the public thinks that the JNP's role no longer exists  due to the fall of the Hosokawa administration, we have to stir  up our courage against such a perception," he said.    The JNP made an impressive debut on the national political  scene during last July's general election, when the party won 35  seats in the powerful lower chamber after its anticorruption  campaign attracted corruption-weary voters.</p>

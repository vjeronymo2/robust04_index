			<p>BFN     [Text] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the  Presidential Council, today received Robert Douglas Gordon, the  British ambassador to our country.    During the meeting, they discussed bilateral ties, as well  as  the current situation and the rebels' noncompliance with the  cease-fire.    The member of the Presidential Council explained the efforts  that were made and the concessions that were offered in order to  avoid igniting the fire of sedition and how the rebels insisted  on sparking it and on departing from legitimacy. He asserted  that the state does not want war and loves peace. However, he  added: We are keen on maintaining our unity and the  independence and sovereignty of our country and the continuation  of shura and democracy and respecting the people's will,  represented in the 27 April 1993 elections.    For his part, the British ambassador expressed satisfaction  over the Yemeni government's cooperation with Lakhdar Brahimi,  the envoy of the UN secretary general. He said that Britain  supports democracy in Yemen and is anxiously awaiting the report  that will be presented by the international envoy.    Afterward, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zindani, member of the  Presidential Council, received Arthur Hughes, the U.S.  ambassador in Sanaa.    They discussed bilateral ties and ways of enhancing them.  The brother member of the Presidential Council asserted that  the state had complied with the cease-fire but that the rebels  violated it. He added: We are waiting for the U.S. Government  to explain its position toward this. He pointed out that the  Yemeni Republic appreciates the concern of the brothers and  friends not to see more Yemeni bloodshed, noting that the war is  not an end in itself and that it will leave negative effects.  He said all countries that care about Yemen should seek to end  the war by not extending any moral or material support to the  secessionist rebels and ensuring our Yemeni people's rights as  noted in the UN Charter, primarily freedom, democracy, justice,  and independence.    For his part, the U.S. ambassador expressed his satisfaction  with the recent cease-fire decision issued by the state, saying  he deems this a step toward a complete cease-fire. He said the  United States had earlier asserted that it does not approve of  recognizing secession and that it seeks dialogue. He expressed  his belief that new efforts for reconciliation could be made by  Lakhdar Brahimi in a new visit to the region.</p>

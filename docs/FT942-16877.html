			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Teamsters in first big strike for 15 years Picket lines went up across the US yesterday as the once powerful Teamsters union launched its first big strike in 15 years against 22 road haulage companies, but little immediate effect was felt on deliveries. Mr Ron Carey, Teamsters president, called about 75,000 members out on strike after talks broke down over the haulage companies' plan to use more part-time workers and to send more goods by rail. 'We have no other choice but to strike,' Mr Carey said. The companies targeted by the Teamsters' strike, which belong to a negotiating consortium called Trucking Management Inc, handle about half of all consolidated road freight in the US - single truck loads made up by the haulage companies of consignments that on their own make up less than a full load. They include companies such as Consolidated Freight-ways, ABF Freight Systems, and Roadway Express, which have faced increasing competition in segments of their market from parcel delivery companies such as UPS. The strike is most likely to affect deliveries of manufacturing components, small finished goods and non-perishable groc-eries, but is not expected to constrict food supplies, since most supermarket chains have their own truck fleets. The trucking companies currently ship between 5 and 15 per cent of their freight by rail, but had proposed a new contract allowing up to 35 per cent to move by rail. They also wanted a quarter of the work in their terminals to be done by part time workers, giving them more flexibility to deal with peaks in demand. For the Teamsters, the strike is a critical test. Mr Carey was elected president in 1991 as the leader of an effort to clean up the scandal-ridden union, which had been operating under a federal court order as part of a settlement of allegations stemming from its close links with organised crime. Three of Mr Carey's six immediate predecessors went to prison, and two others were the objects of criminal investigations when they left office. His leadership has been called into question, however, and the union's finances, especially its strike fund, are in poor shape. Members last month voted against an increase in union dues but the Teamsters have secured a Dollars 50m loan guarantee from the AFL-CIO, the US labour union federation.</p>

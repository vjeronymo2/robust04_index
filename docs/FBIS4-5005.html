			<p>CSO     [Text] Next-Generation Communications Experiments  Launched by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company NTT in Kanto  Region    Experiments to be launched in July at the Kansai Cultural  Academy Research City will involve many companies and will be  the first large-scale domestic test of the broad-band integrated  system digital network known as B-ISDN. On the other hand,  although of a small scale, NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Company] intends to proceed earlier with experiments of its  next-generation communication system in the Kanto region.    In the spring of last year, it built an optical-fiber  communication line between its Yokosuka Research and Development  Center in Yokosuka city and its Musashino Research and  Development Center in Mitaka city.    Both centers are equipped with numerous terminals including  work stations linked to local area networks (LAN) which are each  tied into the new communication lines via asynchronous  transmission mode (ATM).    The system has the capacity to transmit and receive data at  speeds of 2.4 gigabytes (with one gigabyte equalling 1 billion  bytes) per second between Yokosuka and Musashino, equaling the  basic transmission capabilities of a B-ISDN.    Further, a model house was built at a point about four  kilometers away from the Yokosuka center and the two were linked  with optical fiber cables. Although the same type of optical  fiber cable was used, differences in the equipment installed at  both ends will limit the transmission speed to 156 megabytes  (with one megabyte equalling 1 million bytes) per second. This  speed will equal the capacity built into B-ISDN subscriber lines.    In the future, the type of basic transmission line installed  between Yokosuka and Musashino will crisscross the Japanese  archipelago and telephone exchanges and offices and homes will  be interconnected just like the Yokosuka center and the model  house. The purpose of the experiments is to determine the  practical uses of the system as well as the residual technical  hurdles.    NTT has labeled the new services to be made available in the  B-ISDN age with the acronym "VI&amp;P" from the title "Visual  Intelligent and Personal Communications Services." As indicated  by the title, the services visualize multimedia use in the home  as well as commercial use such as high-speed computer  communications.    Subscriber functions being tested relative to the model  house  include transmission of high-resolution images and simultaneous  multiplex transmission of data.    High-resolution images are called super high definition  (SHD)  images which can be used without alteration for purposes such as  computer graphics and fabrication of printing plates. They have  the capacity to hold four times as much data as that prescribed  for high-definition television broadcasting studios. It has been  confirmed that static images can be transmitted at the rate of  one per second without obvious compromise of quality as the  result of compressed transmission.    Evaluations are being performed of applications for the  system to include operation of electronic newspaper services  entailing the transmission of newspaper page images to homes and  the conduct of remote diagnostics based on transmissions of  microscopic photographs of pathologic tissue. Consideration is  being given to the conduct of experiments on the transmission of  data between medical institutions.    It has already been confirmed in intra-research center tests  that animated images compressed under criteria similar to  international standards known as MPEG2 can be transmitted  without deterioration at speeds of 625 megabytes per second.  Sooner or later, transmission of such images will be tested on  the optical fiber circuits. It is said that technical problems  do not exist relative to the concept of receiving high-vision  images when using television telephones.    The VI&amp;P Integrated Experimentation Section states that  in  the area of high-speed computer communications, "capabilities  and stability factors relative to transmission functions are  adequate." However, actual transmission tests at the speed of  2.4 gigagbytes per second have not been conducted yet between  Yokosuka and Musashino. Work has not been completed on  installing equipment for interfacing between terminals and LAN  or LAN and the high-speed transmission circuits, thus limiting  transmission tests between terminals at speeds of 25 to 30  megabytes per second.    Needless to say, this bottleneck can be eliminated when the  interface issues are resolved, while considerably high  transmission speeds have already been achieved even under  current tests. Data on floppy disks used with wordprocessors and  personal computers can be transmitted at the rate of 1.25  megabyte (1 byte equals 8 bits) per second. A standard sheet of  documentation handled routinely by businessmen can be  transmitted in a short 0.4 seconds which is more than adequate  of such purposes.    High-speed transmission of data is very useful in such work  as computer-aided design work (CAD) done at work stations and  for engineers to crunch massive numbers on super computers. Such  requirements can probably be handled on the B-ISDN.    Now that a year has passed since commencement of  experiments,  officials in charge of the VI&amp;P Integrated Experiment Section  express the frank sentiment that, "They would like to expand the  application for the proposed system." It may be appealing to  transmit super high-resolution images and a floppy at  instantaneous speeds, but the question arises as to whether  there would be any demand of such capabilities alone.    VI&amp;P experiments conducted by NTT represent forerunners  of  the technical phase of tests to be performed at the Kansai  Cultural Academic City. Trials and errors to produce concepts  for new types of commercial services represent a major project  for the future.</p>

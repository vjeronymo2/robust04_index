			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 20 May (XINHUA) -- ZHONGGUO SHIBAO  published an editorial today, "Second Ku-Wang Meeting Should Be  Held As Soon As Possible To Close the Rift Between the Two  Sides." The editorial affirms the statement issued on 17 May by  Wang Daohan, chairman of the mainland's Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], and appeals to both  sides to discard prejudices over some side issues and to decide  on the date for the second Ku-Wang meeting as soon as possible  to overcome the stalemate between the two sides arising from the  "Qiandao Lake Incident."    The editorial says: ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan on 17 May  issued a statement on the "Qiandao Lake Incident," which pointed  out that the two sides should put national interests first, and  earnestly draw a lesson by viewing the case and issues cropping  up in the process of handling the case rationally, calmly, and  objectively. As Wang Daohan suggested, in the wake of the  incident, the ARATS and the Strait Exchange Foundation should  especially step up contacts and increase dialogue between  top-level officials so as to eliminate misunderstandings. The  editorial deems this as the mildest and most reasonable  statement issued by the mainland since the occurrence of the  incident.    The editorial clearly points out: Regardless of the  complexity of the case, the "Qiandao Lake Incident" is, after  all, an incident related to public order. It will be a grave  mistake to use this case to negate the mainland's existing  social mores or even the entire Chinese nation's blood  relationships.    The editorial says: It is definitely impossible to dismiss  overnight the more than four-decade-long separation,  confrontation, and hostility between the two sides. However, at  the least, we should not let this misunderstanding and  alienation continue and should actively seek ways for gradual  and reasonable solutions. For this reason, we place high hopes  on the second Ku-Wang meeting. We deeply believe that the  cross-strait relationship is a historical question and naturally  can be solved through a tortuous course. The "Qiandao Lake  Incident" has further complicated this course. Now is the  important time for us to straighten out facts and analyze twists  and turns to increase common understanding. It is hoped that  the authorities of both sides can make good use of the time.</p>

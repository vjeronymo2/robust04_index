			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Different interpretation Sir, My letter on US foreign indebtedness (July 22), now challenged by Professors Thirlwall and Kennedy (July 27), was based less on the theoretical ignorance gratuitously attributed to me than on an interpretation of the following developments. Since the early 1980s, the US current account has moved from rough balance to a deficit of more than 2 per cent of gross domestic product. In the same period, the US's real effective exchange rate has depreciated and relative unit labour costs have fallen both by about 30 per cent; gross national saving as a per cent of GDP has declined from 20 per cent to near 14 per cent; and US GDP has risen by nearly 3 per cent a year while unemployment has fallen from 8 per cent of the labour force to just above 6 per cent. Do these statistics suggest that US economic growth has been held back by excessive saving and an overvalued exchange rate, a possibility that Thirlwall and Kennedy appear to have in mind? Or do they not support the view that the US's trade problem (if there is one) lies in the country's low propensity to save, not in an overvalued exchange rate? When preparing their next tutorial, Professors Thirlwall and Kennedy will no doubt bear in mind that in this period the current balances of Japan and Germany rose as a proportion of GDP, at least until German reunification put a special strain on Germany's saving. In both countries, also, gross national saving as a per cent of GDP rose strongly, as did their real effective exchange rates. Japan's GDP growth rate was somewhat above that of the US while Germany's was a little below. I do, of course, agree that the US suffers from 'deeply rooted' problems, as do the UK, France, Germany, Japan, Italy et al, although the nature of these problems no doubt varies from country to country.

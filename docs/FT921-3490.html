			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Forced winding-up at Ramar Textiles Ramar Textiles, the Durham-based clothing manufacturer, was compulsorily wound up yesterday with debts of Pounds 13m. Its shares were suspended at 14p and receivers were appointed last September after its poor financial health had disrupted production and prevented it filling some orders. As a result Samuel Montagu withdrew its underwriting for a rights issue and share placing which would have given the company Pounds 6.4m of new funding. The placement would have been to Mr Richard Caring, a businessman with clothing industry interests including half of Together, a joint venture with Otto-Versand, the German group. It would have lifted his interest in the enlarged Ramar to 29.9 per cent. Subsequent negotiations between the receivers and a potential buyer fell through.</p>

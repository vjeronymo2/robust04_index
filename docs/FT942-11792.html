			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: SmithKline's prescription When Merck bought Medco for Dollars 6bn in July last year most other pharmaceuticals companies were unconvinced of the commercial logic and flabbergasted by the price. It is a measure of how far the market has come in the last 10 months that SmithKline Beecham's decision to follow into vertical integration seems to have immediately convinced on both counts. True, SB seems to be paying a shade less than Merck for its US pharmacy benefit manager. A handy tax break means that earnings will barely suffer this year and should benefit thereafter. Even so, paying a multiple of around 50 times last year's earnings demands a compelling case. At its crudest level, buying Diversified Pharmaceutical Services allows SB to recoup some of the margin now being lost to its new breed of customers. DPS's earnings depend on its ability to negotiate aggressive deals with drugs companies. There is also the promise of rapidly rising profits as benefit managers cover more of the US population. It remains to be seen whether DPS's customers will be happy about its loss of independence. The relationship with SB will have to be played carefully. Still, the early evidence from Medco is that large healthcare buyers are reluctant to take their business elsewhere. The wider benefits, including access to DPS's clinical data, will only become apparent over time. The relative performance of SB's drugs will be the critical test. As Roche's acquisition of rival drug company Syntex makes clear, there is more than one way to tackle the margin squeeze now under way. With two of the big three US benefit managers in the hands of drugs companies, though, others in the sector will find that opportunities for vertical integration are few and far between.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A former nursing home aide was found guilty on charges that she smothered five  incapacitated patients in a pact with her lesbian lover. A jury in Grand  Rapids, Mich., deliberated five hours before finding Gwendolyn Graham guilty on  five counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder  in the 1987 deaths of patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home. Graham, 26, faces  mandatory life imprisonment without parole. The case rested largely on  testimony by Catherine Wood, who said the two had formed a pact to suffocate  patients so they would be bound to each other. Wood, who pleaded guilty to  second-degree murder, faces up to life in prison when she is sentenced.  </P></p>

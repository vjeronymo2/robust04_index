			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu called on North Korea Thursday to fulfill  its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)  and the inter-Korean denuclearization agreement.    An era of reconciliation and cooperation can begin only when  North Korea embraces a policy of co-existence and cooperation,  Han said in his keynote speech at the opening of an  international seminar titled "Nuclear Policies in Northeast  Asia."    The seminar opened at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and  National Security (IFANS) under the joint sponsorship of the UN  Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in Seoul for a  two-day run.    Over 60 experts from home and abroad are participating in  the  seminar including UNIDIR director Sverre Lodgaard, German  Ambassador at large Josef Holik, Tokyo University Professor  Takashi Inoguchi and a senior fellow at the China Institute of  International Studies, Tan Han.    South Korea fully supports extension of the NPT beyond its  scheduled expiration in 1995 and also favors strengthening the  nuclear safeguards measures of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA), Han told the seminar.    The seminar is divided into four sections on the nuclear  policies of Northeast Asia, the potential for nuclear  proliferation, preventive action against such proliferation, and  the nuclear policies of Russia, China, Japan, the United States  and South and North Korea.</p>

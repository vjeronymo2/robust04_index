			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / People: Barkshire follows property interests John Barkshire (right), the former chairman of Mercantile House who has hardly been heard of in the City since his 1980s-style financial services conglomerate was sold to the now collapsed British &amp; Commonwealth in 1987, is joining the board of TR Property Investment Trust (TRPIT) as a non-executive director. Also on the board of Sun Life, Savills and the Household Mortgage Corporation, Barkshire, 58, says it is the 'remarkable cross-section' of financial and property interests, the two areas to which he has largely devoted his career, that attracts him on to the board of the trust, which has total assets of just Pounds 105m. But Barkshire is a catch for TRPIT; for one thing, 'John's knowledge of how government departments are thinking is very valuable to us', according to director Peter Duffy. Barkshire learnt the ropes in Whitehall not least as chairman of the Barkshire committee, which has tried to interest the government in single property ownership trusts, but has so far fallen at the tax hurdle. Three non-executive directors had retired in the last two and a half years from TRPIT, but Duffy says he had been in no hurry to replace them, the search being partly interrupted by TRPIT's hostile, and ultimately successful, bid for New England Properties. Barkshire, one of the prime movers behind the establishment of Liffe and hailed at the time of the Mercantile House sale as a great strategic thinker who would re-emerge to do yet greater things, now claims he knew then he did not want 'even to try' to become chief executive or full-time chairman of another big company. What he thinks the City really needs is a 'strategic look at its future, reporting back straight to the governor of the Bank of England and the Chancellor. If London does not take the threat seriously,' he goes on, 'it is in real danger of finding business ebbing away to other financial centres.' He says, not entirely convincingly, that he thinks he is not the right person to embark on such a project. ***** Stephen Robinson, who joined JOHN MENZIES recently as head of the retail division, has now been appointed to the main board. ***** Martin Thomas has been promoted to group treasurer of BICC Cables. ***** Fred Heaton, formerly md of Hydra-Tight, and John Crabtree, formerly deputy md of T&amp;N Technology, have been promoted to new business director and technical controller, respectively, of the industrial products and materials group of T&amp;N. ***** Jim Heilig, chief executive of Bonar Inc, and Peter Bartlett, md of LOW &amp; BONAR's specialist materials group, have been appointed to the main board. ***** Rod Varley, formerly operations director with Amoco Fabrics (UK), has been appointed manufacturing director of WAVIN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS. ***** Michael Hewitt has been appointed vice-chairman of SHANKS &amp; MCEWAN. ***** Pierre Marie Valentin, formerly chairman and chief executive of Technip, has been appointed president of Carrier European and Transcontinental Operations, part of UNITED TECHNOLOGIES. ***** Gerald Bell, group operations director, has been appointed joint md with Martin Marcus of QUEENS MOAT HOUSES. ***** Kevin Doyle, president and ceo of Wassall USA, has been appointed to the main board.</p>

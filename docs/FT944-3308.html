			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Tram schemes win approval Approval for tram systems to be built in Birmingham and the south London borough of Croydon was granted by the government yesterday. Both will be funded by a mix of public and private capital. Detailed proposals for the schemes, which are expected to require a total investment of Pounds 305m, have been prepared by private sponsors and local authorities. They were delayed for several years while awaiting government approval. The schemes will depend on the private sector making a 'significant' contribution to the total cost, Mr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, said. London Transport, one of the backers of the Croydon Tramlink, said the government's statement represented an important step forward, but West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority criticised it as requiring too large a financial contribution from local authorities. If the two schemes do proceed they will represent a significant boost to light rail systems in the UK. Manchester began operating trams in 1992, followed by Sheffield this year. Before that British cities had neglected trams for decades. Croydon Tramlink is a 17-mile network aimed at speeding up journey times between Wimbledon, Croydon, Beckenham and New Addington. London Transport and Croydon Borough Council believe the private sector would be willing to provide more than half the Pounds 160m cost. The Midland Metro would link central Birmingham with Wolverhampton over 13 miles of track, with the private sector contributing about Pounds 10.5m to the Pounds 145m cost. Mr Richard Worrall, chairman of the West Midlands PTA, said it had already spent or promised Pounds 13m to aid preparations for the project. 'We are being asked to commit further capital from resources we do not have,' he said. Proposals for Croydon Tramlink have been drawn up by a private consortium comprising German engineering group AEG, Tarmac Construction and Transdev, an operator of trams in France, but the project would be put out to open competition. The Midland Metro contract has already been won by a consortium comprising John Laing, the UK construction group, and Ansaldo Trasporti, an Italian supplier of rail systems.</p>

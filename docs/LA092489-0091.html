			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: WHO CARES?:  </P> <P> What happened to the much-rumored boxed set MCA Records has been readying to  celebrate the Who's 25th anniversary (which some of us feel has already been  celebrated a little too much). We now hear it's been delayed till sometime next  year. Also still in limbo: a live "Tommy" collection culled from the group's  recent live dates. But here's a fascinating statistic (courtesy of Goldmine  magazine): Since 1966, the Who have released 10 new albums -- but put out 19  live, compilation and sound track records. Talk about living off past glories!  . . . Blues great B.B. King will talk with KPCC-FM's Ann the Raven tonight,  from midnight till 2 a.m. . . . And Pop Eye's all-time record for the longest  thank-you note goes to funk balladeers Full Force, whose new "Smoove" album  sleeve has about 3,500 words (!) of acknowledgments. Chatty greetings go to  hundreds of stars, including LaToya (Playboy) Jackson, Arsenio Hall and Mike  Tyson ("Keep up your winning ways -- also tell your sister we say hello"). But  the best thanks go out to such non-celebs as "Mr. Leo and his great soul food"  restaurant, Mr. and Mrs. Yim at Peter Pan Cleaners ("You're the best!") and  Lakaiya, daughter of band member Bowlegged Lou, who Lou describes as being  beautiful like her mother but having the brains of her father, Lou, who boasts:  "I don't know where I get these high I.Q. sperm cells from."  </P></p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Shop assistants sue over Sunday trading THE BATTLE over Sunday trading in England and Wales returned to the High Court yesterday when four women shop assistants employed by B&amp;Q sued Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire for lost wages resulting from the enforced Sunday closure of the DIY chain's Dewsbury store over a four-month period last year. The case was adjourned until next month together with a renewed application by Kirklees for injunctions preventing B&amp;Q and Comet, the retail chain, from opening stores in its area on Sundays. Mr Nicholas Davidson, counsel for B&amp;Q and Comet, said the length of the case would depend on whether the European Court of Justice gave its long-awaited judgment on the legality of the Sunday trading laws in the meantime. The European court has been asked by the House of Lords to rule on whether restrictions on Sunday trading in England and Wales under the 1950 Shops Act clash with EC provisions on free trade.</p>

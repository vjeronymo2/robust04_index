			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A reformist bloc of Soviet lawmakers adopted a platform that calls for allowing  ownership of private property, letting market conditions set prices and and  freeing television of government control. The 345-member bloc in the Supreme  Soviet, which convenes a new legislative session today, also drafted a bill  that they say could lead to the formation of non-Communist political parties.  The group's platform emphasizes new laws to guarantee human rights. It includes  the freedoms to publish, strike and travel freely. Soviets now must obtain  permission to move into desired urban areas such as Moscow.  </P></p>

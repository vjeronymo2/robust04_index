			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Delayed Murdoch data bid rejected The Independent Television Commission has rejected the highest bid for a data broadcasting licence because the application was received nine minutes after the deadline, Raymond Snoddy writes. Skytext, part of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International, bid Pounds 355,000 a year for the licence to broadcast data on the ITV television signal compared with a bid of Pounds 78,000 by Simple Active. The ITC has ruled that the Skytext bid was 'non-valid' because it missed the noon deadline on August 3. The licence is therefore likely to be awarded to Simple Active, a company controlled by the Guardian Media Group, which was the only other bidder. Mr Justin Cadbury, chief executive of Simple Active, was at the ITC offices as the deadline approached. Two seconds before it the ITC received a call saying another bid was on the way. Mr Cadbury was there when the Skytext application arrived at 12.09pm. The company blamed heavy traffic.</p>

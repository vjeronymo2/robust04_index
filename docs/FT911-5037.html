			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Saunders' ill health raised in appeal court THE HEALTH of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former head of Guinness, could be a serious issue in appeals by him and two other men jailed last year for their part in the Guinness affair, the Court of Appeal heard yesterday. Medical evidence is to be called during the appeals, which opened yesterday and are expected to last two weeks. Mr Anthony Shaw, counsel for Mr Saunders, said the health issue was of paramount concern to Mr Saunders and those representing him. It was relevant to Mr Saunders' appeal against his five-year sentence and, arguably, also his appeal against conviction. The nature of Mr Saunders' illness was not specified in court, though reference was made to him having been seen by a neurologist. Mr Saunders, who was jailed last August, sat in court with one of his co-appellants, Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, jailed for two-and-a-half years. Both men are serving their sentences in Ford open prison in West Sussex. The third appellant, Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron group, was not in court. He was freed from Ford in February after serving just under half his 12-month sentence. The three men are appealing against convictions and sentences resulting from their involvement in an illegal share support operation mounted by Guinness during its takeover battle for Distillers in 1986. Mr Saunders was convicted of stealing Pounds 8m from Guinness, conspiracy and false accounting. Mr Parnes was sentenced for false accounting and stealing Pounds 1.94m from Guinness. Mr Ronson was fined a record Pounds 5m as well as being jailed after being convicted of conspiracy, the theft of Pounds 2.875m from Guinness and false accounting. Mr Michael Sherrard QC, for Mr Ronson, said the jury had been very seriously misdirected about charges under section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act, under which it was an offence for a company to give financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares. He said the judge had usurped the function of the jury, directing it that section 151 offences involving dishonesty had been committed, in a situation where the issue of dishonesty had been a factor common to all the charges. Mr Sherrard also complained that the judge had 'diminished' the evidence of Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance director and the principal prosecution witness, whose account of events had largely supported Mr Ronson's. The appeals continue today.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'HEROIC' PARKING BUST CRITICIZED. . .;  </P> <P> . . .BUT 'SCOFFLAWS' TAKE LUMPS TOO  </P> <P> "Scofflaw: flouting the law" -- Webster's.  </P> <P> These scofflaws not only flouted the law, but they did so with very selfish  motives: They also, in flouting the law, very selfishly deprived other  motorists of the right to park in the obviously crowded Malaga Cove shopping  plaza.  </P> <P> Their acts, while not criminal, were offenses against society as a whole -- and  they justly deserve whatever punishment the courts mete out.  </P> <P> Inconsiderate, selfish people comprise the greater number of scofflaws, whose  only interests are self-interests . . . and the public be damned.  </P> <P> Kudos to the law enforcement officers who took the necessary steps to insure  fairness overall.  </P> <P> CLINT HOWARD  </P> <P> Gardena  </P></p>

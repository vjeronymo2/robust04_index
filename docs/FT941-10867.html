			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Engineering clash looms in Germany The threat of an all-out strike in Germany's vital engineering industry loomed closer yesterday, when negotiations for a 'pilot agreement' in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia broke down without progress. Both sides accused each other of refusing to compromise in the talks, in which the employers are demanding absolute cost cuts while the union is seeking guarantees of job security in the recession-hit industry. The national executive of IG Metall, the trade union representing 3.6m engineering workers, will meet in Frankfurt today to decide its next move. Calls for an all-out strike will be on the agenda. It was clear yesterday, however, neither side wanted an outright conflict in an industry which has seen job losses running at more than 30,000 a month for the past year. Most observers expect urgent efforts to reach a compromise. The national executives of IG Metall and Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, were waiting in the wings of yesterday's negotiations, in the Maritim Hotel in Cologne, in the hope of a possible national deal emerging from the talks. They had to leave empty-handed. In the late afternoon the two sides emerged to declare: 'There is no pilot agreement.' 'We have broken off the talks without any result,' Mr Norbert Wrobel, IG Metall's chief negotiator in North Rhine-Westphalia, said. Both sides agreed there was no point in continuing. 'The signs are very bad,' he added, when asked about the danger of an all-out strike. 'Something special has to happen to prevent it.' Yesterday's talks went ahead as token strikes in the industry continued, with 2,800 workers stopping work briefly at the Robert Bosch Blaupunkt plant at Hildesheim. The stumbling block is the need to find a trade-off between the union demand for job security, and the employers' insistence on real cost cuts. Yesterday's talks focused on changes in working hours, which might bridge the gap. Employers proposed a flexible 'working-time corridor' of between 30 and 40 hours a week, with each plant free to decide its own appropriate level - thus allowing either a reduction or an increase in working hours from the current 36-hour week. The union said the proposal was not new, insisting that only a deal to reduce working hours for a temporary period would provide real job security. The union has made it clear it is prepared to reduce its claim for a 5.5 per cent pay rise, in exchange for job security guarantees. The employers are seeking, in addition to more flexible working hours, a reduction in the holiday bonus.</p>

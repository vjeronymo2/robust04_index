			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours comes under strong attack from Owners Abroad OWNERS ABROAD yesterday attacked the hostile bid launched by its rival tour operator Airtours, saying it had taken advantage of a profits fall that followed one mistake over holiday pricing at the end of 1991. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, said shareholders should not under-play the commercial benefit of its proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agency, which was designed to establish a pan-European tour operator. He warned that if Airtours succeeded in its hostile Pounds 214.7m bid, it could create a duopoly in the UK market. Together Airtours and Owners Abroad would control 33 per cent of the market against the current leader Thomson's 28 per cent, according to market figures from November last year. Alternatively it could lead to a price war and the kind of wafer-thin margins seen in the late 1980s. These had resulted in some tour operators making only 90p profit on a Pounds 230 holiday. Referring to Airtours' share bid, which is accompanied by a partial cash alternative, Mr Klein said: 'If you are looking down the barrel of that sort of thing who is going to want to take paper?' Airtours' bid, he said, was a defensive move triggered by concern about the threat from a tie-up between Owners Abroad and Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank that owns 86 per cent of Thomas Cook and 34 per cent of LTU, the German charter flights and holidays company. Airtours had provided no evidence to show it could run a group that would have Pounds 1.2bn of sales. Nor had it justified claims that it would make 'substantially' greater cost savings in 1994 and 1995 than Owners Abroad has said it would enjoy from its Thomas Cook deal. Owners says the savings on that tie-up would be Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m in the two respective years. There were also fundamental flaws in Airtours' stated objective of wanting to expand its Pickfords retail chain which it bought last September. 'The price war has moved from the tour operators to the retail part of the business,' said Mr Klein. The deal Owners Abroad was proposing would allow shareholders to enjoy the benefit of greater access to Thomas Cook's retail outlets and brand name without having to own the chain. Mr Klein accepted that Owners Abroad had initially set the pricing of its summer 1992 holidays too high. 'Owners have got it right this year and Airtours has got it wrong in Florida and Greece,' he said. Mr David Crossland, chairman of Airtours, denies its Greek pricing is wrong. The company had cut its Florida prices, after gaining a rebate from Owners Abroad's Air 2000 charter airline, after Owners had cut its own prices to levels that had 'amazed the whole industry', he said. Airtours' shares slipped 1p to 289p yesterday while Owners Abroad fell 2p to 113p. See Lex</p>

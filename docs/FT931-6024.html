			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Contract-out trend boosts Serco to Pounds 7.2m SERCO, the facilities and project management company, yesterday announced a sharp rise in profits and turnover, helped by the growing trend for government and companies to contract out services. Pre-tax profits increased 37 per cent from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 7.21m in 1992. At the interim stage, profits also increased 37 per cent to Pounds 3.39m. Mr Richard White, managing director, said he was 'extremely pleased' with the results. 'The whole market remains quite busy,' he said. Turnover rose 43 per cent to Pounds 149.7m. About half the increase came from International Aeradio Limited (IAL), the civil aviation specialist acquired last April from BT for Pounds 12.3m. IAL contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 956,000, slightly ahead of expectations. Operating profits, however, rose only 7.7 per cent to Pounds 5.69m. This was partly due to costs on restructuring IAL. Serco holds contracts as varied as the maintenance of Hyde Park, Ministry of Defence radars and speed cameras in London. Mr White said the company retained several important contracts after retender. Associates, which include some Ministry of Defence joint ventures and a New Zealand company, increased their contribution from Pounds 519,000 to Pounds 1.38m, thanks to contract expansions. Serco had net interest receivables of Pounds 131,000 compared to charges last time of Pounds 561,000, mainly because of reduced borrowings after the Pounds 9.7m rights issue in November 1991. Fully diluted earnings gained 22.5 per cent to 37p (30.2p). A final dividend of 9.5p is proposed, to make a total of 14p (11.9p). COMMENT Serco is undoubtedly a class act working in a market with guaranteed growth. But yesterday's 47p rise in the shares to 810p suggests the market may be a little carried away. To be fair, much of the buying was prompted by analysts upgrading forecasts for this year by about Pounds 1m to Pounds 9m. The shares are also closely held so can over react. But after rising more than 40 per cent since September, they are now on more than 17 times and leave little margin for error. The one question mark is operating profits, where growth has tended to lag behind increases in turnover. This year, the figures are obscured by the IAL acquisition. Next time, it should be clearer whether Serco can make the most of all the new business it is winning.</p>

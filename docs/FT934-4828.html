			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Bristol waterfront project wins extra funds in Budget Extra funding in the Budget has cleared the way for Bristol Development Corporation to develop its 30-acre flagship site next to Temple Meads railway station. Regeneration of the waterfront site close to the city centre - being marketed as Quay Point - has been held up because the corporation has been unable to afford a crucial 8.5-acre parcel of land owned by Royal Life Insurance. The corporation is seeking a partner to develop a 2m sq ft commercial centre at Quay Point, including offices, hotel and leisure and retail space. It described the site as a Pounds 400m gateway project with the potential to create 8,000 jobs. A compulsory purchase order for the Royal land was confirmed by the government in January last year, and an attempt by Royal to have the order rescinded was rejected by the High Court last July. However, the corporation lacked the money to proceed with the purchase. It is enacting the order in the light of the Budget announcement of additional government funding. The amount of the grant has not been disclosed because the compensation for Royal has to be negotiated. But the funding is understood to be above Pounds 2m. Mr Miles Collinge, chief executive of the development corporation, said yesterday: 'The timing couldn't be better. The market is continuing to move, and move very positively for us. We are receiving very significant speculative offers.'</p>

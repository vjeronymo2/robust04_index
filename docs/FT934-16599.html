			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Attack on Moslems by Bosnian Croats FIGHTING between Croats and Moslems worsened yesterday while international negotiators struggled to forge an agreement on keeping UN troops in ex-Yugoslavia, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. A spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) said Bosnian Croats had launched an offensive against Moslems in Kiseljak, in central Bosnia about 35km west of Sarajevo. Col Bill Aikman also told reporters in Sarajevo that parts of the disputed southern town of Mostar had come under mortar fire despite a ceasefire signed at the weekend between Croats and Moslems. Two civilians died in the shelling, Sarajevo's Moslem-controlled radio reported yesterday. European Community foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg were discussing the deadlock in peace talks, prompted when the Moslem-led Bosnian government effectively rejected the latest Geneva peace plan by demanding more concessions on land. Peace mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg said they had not given up hopes for an end to the war in Bosnia, but a settlement looked far away.</p>

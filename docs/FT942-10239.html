			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures burst through Dollars 1,900 a tonne Coffee futures stared briefly into the abyss yesterday before regaining their poise and bursting back through Dollars 1,900 a tonne to a fresh five-year high, up 6.7 per cent on the day. The London robusta market began strongly but then dropped over Dollars 70 after New York arabica futures stumbled into profit-taking shortly after the opening. The subsequent recovery in New York fired London into another round of buying. The July contract in London closed up Dollars 122 at Dollars 1,935, just below the day's high of Dollars 1,947. In afternoon trading in New York, the second position was up marginally at 109.2 cents a pound. 'I think the two markets are goading each other on,' said one London trader. However, the dip in New York had 'put the frighteners on' because US funds were believed to be about 30,000 lots long. Traders have been warning of a huge correction after the London market's 62 per cent rise this year, much of it in the past two weeks. But news yesterday that arabica coffee producers are free to release 50 per cent of their stocks now that the trigger price has passed 85 cents a pound caused only a blip in the upward momentum. 'Sometimes a market just goes and goes and goes,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'We view stocks as being extremely tight and the fundamental situation as constructive. But we're starting to discount a lot of the news. We should be cautious.' He added, however, that further gains might be justified by the significant reductions in Colombian and Brazilian crops and high internal prices in Brazil, which were discouraging exports.</p>

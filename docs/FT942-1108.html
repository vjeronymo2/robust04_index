			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: The right to be informed - Diary of a Private Investor Share dealing in the UK is under close scrutiny. In February, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the industry's watchdog, issued a discussion paper on 'Regulation of the United Kingdom Equities Market'. The deadline for submissions has just ended. The paper noted: 'There is analysis which suggests that retail dealing costs are high when compared with institutional dealing costs and are also high when compared with retail dealing costs in other European equity markets.' Early this month, it was announced that the Office of Fair Trading had begun an investigation into market-making in shares on the London Stock Exchange. It remains to be seen if either inquiry benefits private investors. But one section of the SIB paper dealt with 'well informed markets' and commented: 'Market regulation should aim to enable market participants and users to be well informed for the purposes of making their trading conditions.' As private investors pay more than institutional investors to deal in shares, surely they should be treated better when it comes to getting information from companies. At present, institutions are allowed swifter access to information (and given more of it) than private investors. There is, for instance, the matter of annual general meetings. Far too many start at highly inconvenient times - such as 9.30am in London or 10.30am in Glasgow. This means that many private investors cannot attend unless they are willing to spend money on setting off the previous day from their distant homes and staying overnight. Unless there are good reasons for holding early-morning AGMs (and I cannot think of any), they should start no earlier than 11am. The timing of certain comments and announcements also leaves much to be desired. If, for instance, a company's directors wish to discuss their results with analysts on the day of an AGM, this should not happen before the meeting and/or the release to teletext services of the chairman's AGM statement. For that matter, many companies do not make enough use of teletext on BBC 2 and Channel 4. Any major announcement by a company to the stock exchange should go to teletext simultaneously. I would also like very much to see a ban on companies making non-urgent announcements to the stock exchange at times - such as Friday afternoons before bank holidays - when press coverage of them is likely to be limited. The same goes for companies which announce poor results. These should have the widest possible publicity. So, why are companies allowed to publish them on a Friday afternoon or (worse still) on Christmas or new year's eve? Institutional investors get the facts almost immediately via their trading screens. But the poor private investor could well have to wait several days before a press report appears. Indeed, companies should be forced to send all shareholders (by first class post) full details of any 'bad news' results at the same time they are delivered to the stock exchange. Then there is Crest, the proposed new share settlement system, and the moves to rolling settlement within a strictly limited time. These will force many more private investors to use nominee services. As a result, company reports and circulars will go straight to the nominee rather than private investors. Anyone using such a service should have the right to demand that listed companies send such reports and documents direct to investors - and at no extra cost. SIB's discussion paper said: 'To a greater extent than in the case of any other national securities exchange, trading on the London Stock Exchange is dominated by institutional, large size dealing . . .' Perhaps if some (or all) of the above suggestions were implemented, the situation might improve for private investors.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / CBI stresses demand for curbs on pay settlements The Confederation of British Industry yesterday reinforced its recent warnings about the upward drift in pay settlements, after saying that, according to its pay databank, manufacturing pay awards had risen to 2.9 per cent in the third quarter. The latest figure compares with 2.6 per cent in the first quarter and 2.8 per cent in the second quarter but comes against the backdrop of an award of more than 10 per cent over two years for most workers at Rover and the rejection of a 7.5 per cent offer over two years at Jaguar. Pay awards in service companies rose slightly from an average of 3.3 per cent in the second quarter to 3.4 per cent in the third quarter. But the CBI said that just under one in five manufacturers and one in nine service companies were operating pay freezes for up to 12 months. Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said: 'While the increase in pay awards is marginal, the slight upward shift over the last six months gives cause for concern.' Productivity expectations suggest that unit labour costs are continuing to fall with an average increase in productivity of 5 per cent expected in the coming 12 months. Nevertheless Mr Davies said that Britain was no longer matching the pace of key competitors such as the US and Germany, which were experiencing unit labour cost falls of 2 per cent and 3 per cent a year. He said the figures reinforced the need to curb the upward creep in pay awards.</p>

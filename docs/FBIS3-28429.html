			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Foolish Maneuver Aimed at </F> Ideological Disintegration"]    [Text] As it has already been reported, the U.S. Senate  passed a bill on the initiation of Radio Free Asia. Regarding  this, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry exposed the U.S.  intentions behind the initiation of Radio Free Asia in his  answer to the question raised by a reporter from the Korean  Central Broadcasting Committee and strongly demanded its  cancellation.    This is a clear expression of our people's unshakable will  to  stop the infiltration of U.S. ideology and culture, and to  protect our nation's sovereignty.    It goes without saying that Radio Free Asia which the United  States is trying to initiate is targeting our Republic and other  Asian socialist countries. A byproduct of anti-socialist,  anti-Republic strategic maneuvers, the U.S. Senate's passage of  the bill on initiating Radio Free Asia is an intolerable  interference into the internal affairs of our country and other  Asian countries and a hostile, criminal act against them [uri  narawa tarun asia naraduredaehan chamulsu omnun naejonggansobigo  choktaejogin pomjoehaengwi imnida].    As is known, the United States turned its spearhead of  attack  to the Asian region in recent years following the waning of the  Cold War era from the international arena and the frustration of  socialism in some countries. The reason lies in the fact that  there are numerous important strategic points, and abundant  manpower and resources in the Asian region. With rapidly  growing economies, many countries in this region oppose  domination and interference by outside forces, and are  constantly walking along the road of independence.    The United States has declared the Asian Pacific region as a  region of vital importance and interest in the 21st century, and  is regarding our Republic and other Asian socialist countries as  the stumbling blocks to the expansion of its sphere of  domination. Based on this notion, the United States has focused  its world strategy on the Asian region and attempted to set up  Radio Free Asia, a tool for ideological and cultural  infiltration, in addition to its military threat.    Every country has its unique tradition and culture, and,  accordingly, implements an independent broadcast policy in  conformity with its people's taste and customs. However, the  United States attempts to paralyze [mabi] the Asian peoples'  ideological consciousness and create social chaos and disorder  by spreading the U.S. life style and culture so as to demolish  the Asian countries from within. Where else in the world could  there be such a shameless and brigandish interference in  internal affairs!    The true intention of the United States in initiating Radio  Free Asia is to infuse the so-called U.S.-style democratic  values and the toxin of bourgeois ideology into our country and  other Asian countries in order to crush [apsal] socialism in  this region and demolish the independent governments there from  within. However, this is a foolish and indiscreet act.    The United States was able to effectively use all sorts of  machination and propaganda with Radio Free Europe, under the  command of the Central Intelligence Agency, to bring about the  cave in and return to capitalism of former socialist countries  in another region, but it will far from work with our country.    We have the chuche idea, the great guiding ideology of the  era of independence, the spirit of independence, and our-style  of life. Clearly acknowledging the fact from their life  experience that only socialism can provide genuine freedom and  rights and ensure their abundant and happy life, our people  regard the chuche socialism, in which the leader, the party, and  the masses are wholeheartedly united, as their life and lifeline.    If the United States thinks it can create the false image  among our people and perpetrate social chaos and disorder with  Radio Free Asia so as to topple the might of the socialism of  our own style as it did in eastern Europe, it is grossly  miscalculating. Many Asian countries strongly denounce the U.S.  maneuvers to start broadcasting Radio Free Asia as interference  into their internal affairs and a violation of the rules of  international relations, and express their will to protect their  tradition, culture, and consciousness from Yankee culture.    If the United States initiates Radio Free Asia despite the  consistent opposition and rejection of the people of Asian  countries, it will gain nothing from it.    The United States should immediately stop the game of  initiating Radio Free Asia, a propaganda and machination  organization aimed at ideologically disintegrating our country  and other Asian countries.    The Asian people, including our people, will resolutely  confront the U.S. ideological and cultural infiltration, and the  rascals' anti-socialist, anti-Republic strategic maneuvers will  not be able to avoid failure.</p>

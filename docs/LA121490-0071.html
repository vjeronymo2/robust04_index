			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRUNK DRIVER GETS NEARLY 5 YEARS IN  CYCLIST'S DEATH  </P> <P> A woman with a history of drunk-driving arrests was sentenced Thursday to  nearly five years in state prison for the death of a motorcyclist she ran down  while driving drunk on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley last fall.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, however, said that while Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, received a  sentence of four years and eight months, she will probably only serve a little  more than two years in custody for the Oct. 4, 1989, crash that killed David  Jaggs, 24, and seriously injured his wife of one month, Janine, 21.  </P> <P> Giunta, who was convicted last month of vehicular manslaughter, will receive  credit for time served in county jail, where she has been since April. When she  is transferred to state prison, her sentence will be further reduced as  mandated by law depending on good behavior.  </P></p>

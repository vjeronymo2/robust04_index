			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Food sector active Credit Lyonnais Laing was behind a number of significant moves in the food manufacturing sector, triggering weakness in key stocks such as Cadbury Schweppes, 4 softer at 480p, and good rises in Tate &amp; Lyle, 8 firmer at 449p, and Hillsdown, 4 up at 182p. CLL also unsettled Hazelwood Foods, which dipped 4 to 139p as the broker shifted its stance from hold to sell. There was mild disappointment in the market with interim results from Burmah Castrol, the lubricants group. Net income was below best estimates, as was the dividend. But analysts said the market's reaction was more a reflection of the stock's recent strong outperformance; the shares hit an all-time high of 915p last week. They closed 14 lower yesterday at 891p. Ms Irene Himona, oil analyst at Strauss Turnbull and a long-time bull of the stock, said she still viewed the shares as 'undervalued'. Mr Bruce Evers at Yamaichi Europe said he remained positive on the stock because of its good exposure to the recovery in Europe and in the US and Far East. Figures from Coats Viyella, the UK's leading textile group, saw the shares improve 6 to 226p following recent underperformance. Half-time profits of Pounds 69.2m were at the top of the range and analysts were relieved to hear that the company's difficulties in Turkey were easing. However, some analysts expressed caution over the low level of growth at the operating profits level. The profits range for the full year is now between Pounds 160m and Pounds 170m. There was strong speculation in the electricity sector of further share buy-backs by the 'recs', although the only significant individual deal was a trade of 1m Eastern Electricity shares at 788 1/2 p. Eastern, which eased 3 to 792p, has already been active in the market to buy in its own shares, acquiring around 5 per cent of its shares last year. Other recs rumoured to be about to embark on buy-backs included Northern and South Wales. Northern was one of the best performers yesterday, the stock climbing 14 to 824p. South Wales rose 9 to 796p. Oil shares put on a good showing in spite of the end of the strike by Nigerian oil workers. British Petroleum led the sector, moving up 5 to a record 422p, albeit in thin turnover of 4m, as marketmakers spoke of US buying and a chart breakout. Traders were picking up stock ahead of a presentation to analysts in London on Thursday week by the head of the group's exploration division. BP recently announced a substantial new gas discovery in Colombia and the market is expecting more good news from that region. Shell Transport, which reports its interim dividend the same day as the BP presentation, rose 5 1/2 to 758p. Bank shares remained among the market's best performers, with institutional buyers continuing to chase the sector. TSB reached its highest level for six months, closing a further 5 1/2 up at 233p on turnover of 4.7m, still boosted by last week's Hoare Govett buy note and also by hints of possible takeover activity. Fund management groups kept up their recent good form, with Mercury Asset Management appreciating 17 to 670p. The aerospace sector was an oasis of calm as most analysts left their desks to attend the first day of the Farnborough Air Show. News that Airbus was to take over the European military transporter project came as no surprise and British Aerospace, one of the four Airbus partners, was unmoved at 513p. Positive comments from Siebe's chief executive Mr Allen Yurko at the company's annual meeting helped to take the shares up 5 to 595p. The market had been expecting the good news - on Friday the stock bounced 18 to 590p - but was particularly pleased with news of the contracts for Foxboro, the US industrial controls group, which showed it gaining market share. Suter, whose interim profits dropped to Pounds 12m from Pounds 29.6m previously, fell 11 to 198p. BTR added 8 1/2 at 392p ahead of results due on Thursday. Kleinwort Benson reiterated its positive stance. Paper group Bunzl improved 7 to 173p following top-of-the-range half-year profits of Pounds 32.8m. Many analysts responded to the confident statement and strengthening margins by edging up forecasts for the full year above Pounds 68m. Hoare Govett went to Pounds 68.5m and Panmure Gordon to Pounds 73m. Elsewhere in the sector, Bowater, which reports today, moved forward 6 to 473p. The group is expected to produce profits of around Pounds 102m. MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Clare Gascoigne, Steve Thompson. Other statistics, Page 39</p>

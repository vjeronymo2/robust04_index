			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok April 27 TASS -- Arms will be used now  to hit unidentified people without a warning when they attempt  to penetrate into the grounds of military units, ships or other  facilities of the Pacific Fleet.    ITAR-TASS learnt from the press service of the Pacific Fleet  that such orders were given on Wednesday by fleet Commander  Georgiy Gurinov. This extraordinary measure was prompted by the  heinous murder of Major A. Tedeyev, officer-on-duty at a  military unit, in Vladivostok on Tuesday.    The terrorist act was committed by unidentified people at  night. Several days before this accident, a group also of  unidentified people attempted to capture one of the fleet's  munitions depot.    In the opinion of the Pacific Fleet commander, only extreme  measures can now stop brazen criminals.</p>

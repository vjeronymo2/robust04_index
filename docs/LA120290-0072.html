			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: 'TIS THE RIGHT SEASON TO GO SHOPPING FOR SOME OF THE BEST  ROOM RATES;  </P> <P> HOTELS: MANY ESTABLISHMENTS OFFER GREAT DEALS DURING THE SLOW HOLIDAY PERIOD.  SOME INCLUDE SHOPPING BARGAINS, FREE GIFT WRAPPING AND CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS.  </P> <P> Ever think of spending Christmas at a hotel? It may not sound particularly  festive, nor does it conjure up warm and cozy thoughts, pleasant memories or  romantic notions of the holiday spirit.  </P> <P> Thus, you may be surprised to learn that many Americans do indeed celebrate the  Christmas holidays in hotel rooms.  </P> <P> Why? First, the price is right. With few exceptions, hotel occupancy between  now and the middle of January is very low. This fact, coupled with a glut of  hotel rooms in many cities from recent construction and a downturn in domestic  travel, has created some great deals, many of which go beyond just a discounted  room rate.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, it's a slow time for business travel," says W. Andrews Kirmse,  vice president and general manager of the Nikko Hotel in San Francisco, "so  we're trying to lure the leisure traveler and his or her family during  December. It's a trend and a major emphasis for us."  </P> <P> In Dallas, the Loews Anatole Hotel has a special holiday rate of $78 per night,  single or double occupancy, through Dec. 30. In San Francisco, room rates at  the upscale Huntington Hotel have been dropped to $195 for a suite. And the  Stouffer Stanford Court is offering a special holiday season package with a  $149 room rate now through Dec. 30.  </P> <P> At the Checkers Hotel in Los Angeles, room rates start as low as $125 per night  between Dec. 14 and 28.  </P> <P> Looking for a real bargain? Between now and Feb. 25, Omni hotels are offering  special weekend discount deals -- rooms from $59 to $99. And that's per room,  not per person (the deal covers up to two adults and two children under 17). In  addition, checkout can be extended to 5 p.m. on Sunday.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best new hotel deal comes from Marriott, which just announced a $49  Holiday Room Rate available between Dec. 13 and Jan. 6. Only two restrictions:  Reservations must be made two weeks in advance, and most Marriotts will not be  offering the rate on New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> Many hotels offer special room rates that also include Christmas shopping  deals, transportation to stores, even free gift wrapping.  </P> <P> The Stanford Court's $149 deal includes gift wrapping as well as transportation  to downtown shopping in the hotel's Rolls-Royce limousine. Guests who stay two  consecutive nights will receive a $25 gift certificate from Gump's.  </P> <P> Similar discounted room/shopping programs are offered in San Francisco by the  Four Seasons Clift, the Mandarin Oriental and by Campton Place.  </P> <P> In New York City, the Parc 51 has discounted rooms to $195 per night on any  weekend between now and Dec. 17 (and any night Dec. 17-30), and the hotel  provides a free wrapping service between now and Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> The Westin Crown Center hotel in Kansas City has a great holiday package rate.  From now until Dec. 30, guests can get a "Shopper's Holiday" room for $69 per  night. Indeed, the hotel is surrounded by more than 60 shops and restaurants in  the Crown Center.  </P> <P> At some luxury hotels, almost all of the rooms are full during Christmas.  Normally, finding a significant discount is next to impossible at the Regent  Beverly Wilshire. During this Christmas season, however, the hotel has dropped  its regular $255-a-night rate to $215. Not a tremendous discount, yet the hotel  is booked to near capacity this year.  </P> <P> "Staying at a hotel during Christmas is not exactly first on most people's  lists," admits Beverly Wilshire spokesperson Georgiana Francisco. "But you'd be  surprised how many locals elect to come here and stay for a few days during the  holidays."  </P> <P> Family tradition is a large part of the holiday activities offered by The Drake  hotel in Chicago. Yuletide festivities take on a Dickens theme at the  70-year-old hotel. Drake's holiday package is priced at $145 per night, double  or single occupancy, and is available now until Jan. 31.  </P> <P> Guests will be treated to two weeks of Christmas entertainment in the hotel's  Palm Court, including holiday choirs, madrigal singers, handbell choirs,  carolers and a special puppet-show performance of the holiday classic "Hansel  and Gretel."  </P> <P> In Tucson, the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort celebrates the holidays  Southwestern-style with a posada on Dec. 16. The hotel has also initiated a  comprehensive children's holiday program for kids between the ages of 5 and 10  that starts Dec. 26 and continues through Dec. 30.  </P> <P> At Lake George, N.Y., the Omni Sagamore Hotel also features a children's  program, which includes arts and crafts, sleigh rides and a nature scavenger  hunt. The program runs Dec. 15-28. Rates begin at $85 per person, double  occupancy.  </P> <P> In Kansas City, for $20 more than its "Shopper's" package, the Westin also  offers a special children's program, where parents can shop and the kids are  supervised with an itinerary that includes a visit to the Hallmark card  company, followed by Christmas cookie decorating, ornament-making and, of  course, a visit to Santa.  </P> <P> Other hotels offer special Christmas tours. The Ritz-Carlton in Boston is  conducting reservations-only tours of its Victorian decorations, which are  located in public areas as well as special suites. Guests entering the lobby  are greeted by a six-foot Nutcracker King. Each of the hotel's restaurants will  re-create one of the acts of the Nutcracker; check out the "battle of the toy  soldiers" in the hotel cafe. And there will be daily appearances by carolers.  </P> <P> But don't look for shopping deals and free gift wrapping at the Ritz-Carlton in  Boston. "We tried it and it didn't work," says spokesperson Patricia Cutler.  "People generally like to have their gifts wrapped by the stores where they  bought them. We've learned that if people shop at Filene's, they want their  packages wrapped there."  </P> <P> Not all of the great deals are in the United States. Despite a weakening dollar  and higher fuel prices (or, perhaps because of it), a number of foreign  airlines and hotels are also offering great holiday packages.  </P> <P> Perhaps most important, there are the hotels that have embraced the truest  sense of the Christmas spirit. The Middlebury Inn in Middlebury, Vt., has an  annual teddy bear raffle. All the proceeds from the raffle go to a Christmas  charity for underprivileged children.  </P> <P> The Huntington Hotel in San Francisco is donating $15 from each guest's room  rate -- in the guest's name -- to the Youth Advocate Charities.  </P> <P> Nothing embodies the holiday spirit more than the "Room at the Inn" service  offered by most Doubletree and some Compri hotels. Under the program, free  accommodations are provided to individuals and families who are traveling out  of town during the holiday season to visit hospitalized loved ones.  </P> <P> "Room at the Inn" was an idea that started at the Doubletree Hotel in Seattle  in 1982. Since then, it has expanded to include more than 32 Doubletree and  Compri hotels. Each hotel has set aside a number of rooms to be used for the  program between now and New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> Last year, Doubletree gave away more than 1,500 rooms for this cause.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the latest plenary session in Vienna of the  permanent committee of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] Yuriy Kostenko, the head of  Ukraine's delegation, commented on a statement by Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.    In his speech Yuriy Kostenko especially drew the attention  of  the representatives from CSCE member states to Ukraine's deep  concern that a tendency has recently been discerned in Russia's  policy toward increasing the toughness of its foreign policy  course, in particular toward the independent states created  after the break-up of the USSR.    Notwithstanding the statements on the main new threat to  international peace and security, which Russia describes as  aggressive nationalism, the Ukrainian representative continued,  whether it wants to or not Russia is provoking the exacerbation  of this issue and thus is inciting the citizens of Russian  descent in other states to expressions of national intolerance.    The speech by the head of Ukraine's delegation was  positively  evaluated by the delegation from the United States, which  interpreted it as an attempt at an early stage to facilitate the  prevention of conflicts emerging on an interethnic basis, in  particular in the Crimea.</p>

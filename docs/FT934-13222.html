			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Air London declines to Pounds 726,000 A DEPRESSED market and increased competition made for a difficult year at Air London International, the USM-quoted charter broker. On turnover of Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 17.8m), pre-tax profits for the 12 months to July 31 fell from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 726,000. Mr Tony Mack, chairman, blamed a difficult UK market and a 40 per cent fall in business from overseas for the lower turnover. He added that the number of flights arranged had fallen by only 2.7 per cent but the average expenditure was 13 per cent lower. The shares fell 7p to 68p. Earnings per share were 5.6p (8.1p) but directors said that as the company was still generating cash they were recommending a maintained final dividend of 1.9p for an unchanged total of 3.5p.</p>

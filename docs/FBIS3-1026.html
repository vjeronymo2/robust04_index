			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government communique issued on 16 March; place not given; </F> read by government spokesman Moctar Bello]    [Text] Rebels intercepted a seven-vehicle convoy on the  Agadez-Tahoua road in 14 March, subjected the passengers to  torture and undignified treatment, and robbed them of all their  property. During the same period, similar crimes were  perpetrated on the Agadez-Arlit road. The unfortunate result of  these latest attacks are as follows: one dead, four seriously  wounded, more than 1 million CFA francs extorted from the  victims, and various goods worth several million CFA francs  stolen. Vehicles were seriously damaged and peaceful citizens  were harassed and humiliated. Taking stock of this situation,  one realizes the numerous crimes perpetrated by the rebels  against the people of Tillabery, Tahoua, and Agadez.    The ignominious acts the rebels are continuously  perpetrating  are in line with the objectives of their rebellion which include  the revival of ethnic hatred in order to divide Niger our  beloved motherland. Though determined to solve this issue  through dialogue, the Government of the Republic of Niger will  not tolerate these deliberate attacks on goods and on the  physical and moral integrity of people. In any case, it will  not accept the antinationalist objective that is being pursued.    The government hereby calls on all patriotic and active  forces of the nation to mobilize themselves so that through  cohesion, efforts, and sacrifices the Niger people, in unity,  will be able to impede and foil the rebels' attempts at  secession.</p>

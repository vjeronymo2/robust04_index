			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Italian deal in Lebanon THE Lebanese government has awarded a L100bn (Pounds 41m) contract to Ansaldo, the Italian state-controlled engineering group, to repair the country's power stations, writes Robert Graham from Rome. The contract is seen as an important signal of the Lebanese government's resolve to revive the country's war-torn economy. Lebanon has three hydro- and three oil-fuelled power stations. The project is expected to last 18 months, and when complete Lebanon will have an installed capacity of 1,100 MW. Work on the first two powers stations, in the capital Beirut and near Sidon, has already begun. Funding is coming from Italian government aid funds and Arab aid, especially from Kuwait.</p>

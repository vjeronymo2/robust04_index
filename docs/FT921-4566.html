			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Fears arise on redeeming equity-linked paper HUGE sums of equity-linked bonds launched in the international bond market in the late 1980s fall due for redemption this year and next. Under normal circumstances the debt would simply be refinanced with new equity-linked bond issues. However, many of the issuers never expected to redeem the bonds, and the appetite of international investors for equity-linked paper is much less than when the bonds were issued. For example, companies which issued convertible bonds in the late 1980s expected that debt would be converted into equity well before the redemption date. However, equity prices remained soft and conversion never took place. Similarly, companies which issued warrant bond issues against a background of a booming equity market have found the warrants were never exercised and the debt must now be refinanced on less attractive terms. Equity-linked finance was a source of cheap funding for many companies. Many Swiss franc convertible bond issues launched in the late 1980s carry no interest payments. Investors were willing to buy the bonds as an investment linked to the equity market. Japanese companies were the greatest exponents of equity-linked finance in the Eurobond market. In 1989 Dollars 65bn of warrant bond issues were launched in the international market, the vast majority by Japanese companies. Securities firms became rich on the proceeds. On standard Euromarket fees of 2 1/4 per cent, the volume of new issuance in 1989 alone would have netted Dollars 1.46bn of fee income. In addition, the majority of the issues traded up from issue price, adding to the earnings of underwriters. Some Dollars 32bn equivalent equity warrant bonds fall due for redemption this year alone, rising to Dollars 78bn in 1993. Around Dollars 4.6bn of Swiss franc convertible bond issues fall due this year, rising to over Dollars 10bn in both 1993 and 1994. These figures give only a rough guide to the amount of refinancing required. Some of the bonds have been called after the warrants were exercised, and others were converted into equity before the Tokyo stock market collapsed in 1990. But Japanese equity prices have languished well below the peak of the late 1980s, when most of the bonds were issued. The Nikkei stock market index is now trading at around 21,000, similar to the levels seen in 1987 and well below the peak of 38,915 in early 1990. This suggests that a large proportion of the outstanding bonds were never converted into equity and that warrants were never exercised. Refinancing these bonds poses a challenge to corporate financiers. It is clear that the market will not absorb new issues of warrant bonds or convertibles on the scale required for full refinancing. Last year only Dollars 26bn of new equity warrant bond issues were launched, an improvement on the Dollars 19bn issues in 1990 but still well below the levels achieved at the peak of the market. If the Tokyo stock market remains buoyant, the more popular companies may refinance maturing debt with more equity-linked finance. However, many will have to use other more costly instruments or simply swallow the fact that debt must be redeemed. Many Swiss franc issues falling due this year will be repaid at the end of this month, the end of the Japanese fiscal year. Japanese companies may need to buy around SFr2bn to SFr3bn to repay bonds.</p>

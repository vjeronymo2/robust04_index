			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Albania's Acceptance in the Council of Europe Favours the </F> Observation of the Human Rights" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, April 6 (ATA) -- In the meeting of April 5  with the delegation of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Council of  Europe [CE], the Albanian Helsinki Committee [KShH] said that  Albania's acceptance in the Council of Europe would favour the  observation of the human rights and would be fruitful for the  development of democracy. The chairman of this committee, Josif  Vrioni, made a panorama of the work made for the rehabilitation  of the formerly politically prisoners, establishment of the rule  of law and the press freedom, underlining the great difficulties  that existed in the post dictatorship period.    Mr. Kujtim Cashku, one of the representatives of this  committee, said that Albania has started the observation of the  human rights from the scratch, when there were no ministry of  justice and specialised institutions for this purpose, there  were no laws on the protection of the private ownership and  other such things.    Asked by one of the members of the delegation of the Council  of Europe whether there are cases of human rights violations in  Albania, Mr. Vrioni said that the situation of human rights  observation is not perfect, but it is generally good, stressing  that Albania fulfills all conditions to become a full member of  the Council of Europe.    With regard to the existence of an influence from the  political forces on the decisions by lawyers, Mr. Vrioni said  that to speak about such a thing one needs to have facts and not  suspicions.    Questioned whether the Albanian Helsinki Committee insists  in  Albania's becoming a member of the Council of Europe, all its  members gave an absolute unanimous positive reply.    Mr. Cashku handed to the European delegation a report about  the questions of the human rights observation in Albania.</p>

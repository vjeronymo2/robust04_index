			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ICE HOCKEY OFFICIALS THREATENING TO BOYCOTT 1992 WINTER OLYMPICS  </P> <P> Hockey could be pulled from the 1992 Winter Olympics if the issue over playing  facilities is not resolved, International Ice Hockey Federation officials said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's possible that we won't take part in the Olympic tournament," Gunther  Sabetzki, president of the IIHF, said at a news conference.  </P> <P> "We are not prepared to have the Olympic tournament played in one place."  </P> <P> French organizers at Albertville at first promised to build two arenas for the  Olympic tournament. But they said last September that they wanted to hold the  games in an existing arena in neighboring Meribel, and use a small arena in  Courchevel, another Alpine resort, only for practice.  </P> <P> "To organize an Olympic tournament in one arena in 12 days is impossible," said  Miroslav Subrt, a IIHF council member. "We would have to play six games daily."  </P></p>

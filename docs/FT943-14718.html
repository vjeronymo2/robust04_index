			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No harm from switch to unleaded petrol Sir, Dr David Gidlow of Associated Octel (Letters, July 11), a major manufacturer of lead additives for petrol, claimed that the switch to unleaded petrol had resulted in an increase in the aromatic content of petrol. This is certainly not true of the UK. Dr Gidlow's own company publishes a survey of gasoline quality which clearly shows that the aromatics content of petrol sold in the UK has declined not increased in recent years. In fact, this data shows that the average aromatic content of UK premium unleaded petrol sampled in 1992 (the most recent year for which data is available) is less than that of leaded petrol in 1988, when virtually no unleaded petrol was sold. Certainly some petrol will contain more than the average level of aromatics and some will contain less. However, if aromatics are a 'sinister threat to health', which I would dispute, it would be the total level of aromatics that would be crucial; and the total level of aromatics has declined, not risen, since unleaded was introduced. This decline is due to investment by the British oil industry in oil refinery processes such as isomerisation. Additionally, as catalytic converters are now fitted to around a seventh of all cars and to all new ones, any emissions associated with aromatics are declining rapidly. There is therefore no basis for Dr Gidlow's claim that the switch to unleaded petrol has resulted in an increase in the aromatic content of UK petrol or of emissions associated with aromatics.

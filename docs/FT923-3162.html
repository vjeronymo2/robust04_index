			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: Example - Liverpool Everyman Television and theatre maintain an awkward relationship. Actors often have to choose between a lucrative Soap Opera or a worthy season in Repertory, while theatre producers need stars made bankable by television fame. At a deeper level, the two media can be mutually informing when they treat the same issues. Here is a documentary play born of documentary television; Example, at the Liverpool Everyman Theatre, is a piece of legal history still unfolding. It was devised by the Belgrade Theatre in Education group in Coventry in 1977, and has now been reshaped by the Merseyside Young People's Theatre Company (director Chris Channing) to tour Merseyside and visit the York Arts Centre. It is a folk tale of South London. The action recounts the story of Derek Bentley. On January 28, 1953, Bentley was hanged in Wandsworth Prison for the murder, on November 2, 1952, of PC Sidney Miles during a robbery in Croydon. The gun which killed Miles was fired by Bentley's partner, Christopher Craig. At the time the shot was fired, Bentley was unarmed and under arrest. Craig was 16 and therefore, when found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey on December 11, 1952, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment; but Bentley was 19, and was sentenced to hang. He was also an epileptic, had an IQ in the 60s and a mental age of 4. After the verdict, an appeal (13 January 1953) and representations to the Home Secretary were turned down. On 26 January, a motion for reprieve presented by Sydney Silverman, MP, was removed from the Order Paper on the Speaker's instructions. No commutation came from the Home Secretary, and Bentley hanged. Several books have taken up the case. David Yallop's To Encourage The Others (1972) and MJ Trow's "Let Him Have It, Chris", (what Bentley is said to have shouted, meaning either 'Kill him' or 'Give him the gun') along with a Thames Reports documentary (1990, director. Roger Corke) have brought fresh evidence, augmented by Craig's new contribution and an Observer piece in September 1991, to suggest that Bentley was wrongfully hanged. A petition, signed by 205 MPs, for Bentley's pardon was submitted to the Home Secretary in June this year. A play is not a case, nor a theatre a courtroom. Example presents the emotional argument for Bentley's relative innocence: he was involved in an armed robbery, but he did not commit the murder. But Elvis Costello's viciously ironic song, 'Let Him Dangle' puts a better ad hominem case. The legal profession and the police fare badly here, the former seen as self-serving snobs and the latter as callous liars. But if this is to be more than - justly in this instance - an anti- authority drama, the publicity material for schools should be clearer about the issues. A look at changing practices in the United States should highlight the position of convicted murderers under 18 who are, as Bentley was, mentally subnormal. In some States, they face death by electrocution. Example, Everyman Theatre throughout September, October and November (051 708 0877)</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY LESSONS  </P> <P> My late father, Leo Seltzer, who created Roller Derby in 1935, did not go out  of business in 1960 as Bill Griffiths was quoted as saying. Rather, I started  promoting in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1960 and eventually syndicated  Roller Derby to 120 TV stations.  </P> <P> Our league did not perform in "musty arenas," as Meyers writes, but rather  Madison Square Garden, the St. Louis Arena, the Oakland Coliseum and others.  For an untarnished history of the game, see Frank Deford's book, "Five Strides  on the Banked Track."  </P> <P> I am sorry that the producers of the coming "RollerGames" television series are  not attempting to present the real game with skilled and professional  competitors -- apparently fostering instead a "wrestling on wheels" approach.  </P> <P> JERRY SELTZER  </P> <P> Chairman of the Board, Bass/TicketMaster  </P> <P> Oakland  </P></p>

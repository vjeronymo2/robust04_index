			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> GALANTER BACKS YAROSLAVSKY FOE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has bucked council tradition by  backing Laura Lake over fellow Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky in the 5th District  race.  </P> <P> "I owe Laura personally and politically a great debt," Galanter said of Lake,  who played a key role in Galanter's successful campaign against Councilwoman  Pat Russell two years ago. Lake also took Galanter's mother into her home after  Galanter was stabbed by an intruder.  </P> <P> Galanter first endorsed Lake, a fellow environmentalist, in September, when  Yaroslavsky was expected to give up his council seat to run for mayor. But  Yaroslavsky earlier this month decided not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley and  to run again for his council seat.  </P> <P> It is rare, but not unheard of, for members of the city's small rather  collegial body to endorse a challenger over an incumbent.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, who supported Russell two years ago, said of Galanter, "I  understand her personal relationship with Laura, and I respect it."  </P></p>

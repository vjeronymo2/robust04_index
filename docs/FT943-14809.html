			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / The Dollar in Decline: Mistrust of Clinton leads to new lows  -Philip Gawith finds most analysts in agreement that the dollar will probably fall further in the short term, but there is also a belief that a change of sentiment on the US currency may be near If Bob Woodward's account, in his new book, of life in Mr Bill Clinton's White House is to be believed, US financial markets have caused the president more than a little heartache. The latest fall in the dollar can have done little to help. Despite the best efforts of the president and his economic team to highlight positive US economic fundamentals, the US currency has continued to reach new lows. But Mr Guy Whittaker, head of foreign exchange and money markets at Citibank in London, dismisses the contention that news 'soundbites', flashed into dealing rooms at speed, are pushing markets away from fundamentals. 'In the very, very short term, what a politician says can have an impact on the price action, but the duration of the effect is a reflection of the underlying market position and the behaviour of customers. The medium term is more driven by policies and fundamental flows, rather than short-term flows.' The market can be driven by a herd instinct. For spot traders, the response of the rest of the market to a given piece of data is more important than the fundamental information it conveys. But traders argue that, while this may sometimes lead the market in the wrong direction, it soon retraces to reflect fundamentals. Most analysts agree that the dollar will probably fall further in the short term. Mr Rob Loewy, head of foreign exchange at Midland Global Markets, reports, for example, that the bulk of business being conducted on the options side involves hedging for a further decline in the dollar, not a recovery. Traders argue that this is not because foreign exchange markets have become divorced from fundamentals. Mr Whittaker says the dollar is currently reflecting the fundamentals of a large trade deficit, reduced capital inflows and ongoing capital outflows. It has also suffered from the re-rating of the D-Mark, on improved growth prospects, and of the yen, on lack of progress in opening domestic markets. A factor in the fall of the dollar, has also been the markets' distrust of Mr Clinton. There is also a sense that he and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, and his team of do not always speak with the same tongue. Lack of policy clarity has already contributed to the reluctance of the Goup of Seven countries to endorse a dollar support package. 'Historically, central banks have found it difficult to agree on the correct value for a currency. Clearly there are different views at the moment as to what the appropriate value of the dollar is,' said Mr Loewy. 'We are only likely to see co-ordinated intervention when there is a much stronger consensus on what the correct value is,' he said, adding that European central banks see 'little value in squandering their reserves to support the dollar when there is no clear policy from the US.' Mr Whittaker says the dollar is now suffering from an 'investor strike'. Although many customers believe the dollar is cheap at existing levels, uncertainty is such that nobody is willing to buy it when there is a good prospect it will be cheaper the next day. 'Clearly there are long-term investors still looking to sell the dollar,' says Mr Whittaker. But until investors stop believing that dollar assets are likely to depreciate - the currency or the underlying asset - 'any rally will be taken as an opportunity by long-term investors to sell.' He believes, however, that the dollar is 'not a million miles from a turning point', with sentiment likely to change in the latter part of the year.</p>

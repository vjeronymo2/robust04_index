			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Mercosur customs union to begin on January 1 The four South American countries in the Mercosur trade group yesterday settled all their differences and said they were ready for the trade area to become a full customs union from January 1 as planned. Foreign ministers from Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay reached agreement on a number of outstanding problems after a hectic night of negotiation. The agreements will be included in the document, to be known as the protocol of Ouro Preto, which is to be signed by the four presidents today and will give Mercosur a similar legal status to the European Union. Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, said he was 'very proud' the four countries had put in place the first customs union among developing countries. The protocol also sets out rules for the Mercosur institutions such as an arbitration system for disputes and rules to promote competition and ease customs procedures. The four countries agreed the final lists of products, mainly those considered unready to face full competition, which will be allowed to keep domestic tariffs for four more years rather than cut tariffs to zero immediately. Brazil and Argentina, which together account for more than 95 per cent of Mercosur's gross domestic product, also reached an accord on their automotive industries. Because both countries consider this sector strategic, it is given a special exemption from the free trade rules. The protocol commits the four countries to review before 2001 when and whether to go ahead toward a full common market, which implies the free movement of goods and labour.</p>

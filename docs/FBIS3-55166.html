			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- The president of the Russian  Federation has signed an edict endorsing the Statute on the  Federal Counterintelligence Service (FCS) [Federalnaya Sluzhba  Kontrrazvedki], which defines the tasks and structure of the  service. The FCS public relations center announced this today.    The functions of the counterintelligence and antiterrorist  units are defined and the powers of the FCS have been kept as  far apart as possible from those of the law enforcement bodies.  An FCS which performs functions outside their specialized  service is ruled out. The total staff of the FCS will be 46  percent less than that of the former Ministry of Security.    The statute envisions that the FCS will be directly  subordinate to the president of the Russian Federation.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Saving the ozone layer INTERNATIONAL conventions on the environment are too prone to self-congratulation. However, after this week's United Nations conference in Copenhagen on the ozone layer of the atmosphere, congratulation is deserved. The 1987 Montreal Protocol phasing out production of chemicals that damage the ozone layer was tightened for the second time. It stands as one of the world's most successful responses to an environmental threat. The thinning of the protective ozone layer, which shields both people and crops from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation, was detected only in 1985. But reaction has been faster than that to other perceived threats, partly because scientists were confident about the part played by man-made chemicals, and partly because chemical companies moved quickly to develop substitutes. The main achievement in Copenhagen was to bring forward the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - the most damaging chemicals, used in air conditioning and refrigeration - by four years, to 1996 in industrialised countries and 2006 in developing countries. The conference was right too in taking a first step towards regulating methyl bromide - a substance used to preserve fruit and grain, whose ozone-depleting potential was only recognised six months ago. These measures fall short of those demanded by some countries, including the UK and the US, but they still come at considerable cost. The US has put the cost to itself of complying with the original protocol at Dollars 35bn over the next century, and that of the acceleration agreed this week at an additional Dollars 2bn. On its estimate that the new deadlines will prevent 10,000 US cancer deaths, this represents Dollars 200,000 for each life saved. Nevertheless, the signatories should now take other steps. In particular they need to look at the administration of the international fund set up in 1990 to help developing countries adapt. Parties to the protocol have pledged Dollars 240m to cover the costs for 1991 to 1993, and in Copenhagen they committed Dollars 500m more for 1994 to 1996. The need is clear: UN figures say that although developing countries consume some 20 times fewer CFCs than industrialised countries overall, their consumption rose by 50 per cent between 1986 and 1990, while that of industrial countries fell by 30 per cent. In spite of this, the fund - administered by the World Bank and the UN's environment and development programmes - disbursed only Dollars 70m in 1991 and 1992, on studies and administration. No ozone-saving projects have started. The fund's pace needs to be stepped up, as promised, by the time the parties meet again next year. Signatories also need to improve scientific research and communicate its results to the public more effectively. The ozone hole has captured the public imagination, but ozone depletion is not as predictable a phenomenon as is sometimes portrayed. The Copenhagen conference demonstrates that rapid global agreement on pressing environmental problems can be achieved. That should encourage the international community as it moves on to larger, more complex and more politically difficult challenges like global warming.</p>

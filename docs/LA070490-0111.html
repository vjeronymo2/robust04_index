			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> THEN THERE WERE 6: Today is the last day fireworks are legal in Westminster. .  . . Thursday it joins the majority in Orange County, leaving just six cities  where personal fireworks can be sold and set off: Buena Park, Costa Mesa,  Fullerton, Garden Grove, Orange and Santa Ana. . . . Five of them have extra  patrols looking for illegal fireworks, but Costa Mesa has given up. . . . "I've  tried it -- I even tried the police helicopter -- but it's a waste of time,"  says city Fire Marshal Tom Macduff. "Trying to find just the illegal ones is a  nightmare. The only way you can enforce anything is to enforce it against all  fireworks." Steve Emmons and Jeffrey A. Perlman  </P></p>

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Opec agrees to hold ceilings on output OIL ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) decided yesterday to leave untouched a nominal output ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day for the second quarter, pronounced at their last meeting in February, after slight recent firming of crude prices. However, Dr Subroto, Opec secretary general, said after the ministers' meeting in Vienna they had agreed that members still producing above their nominal February allocation 'should implement the agreement' - a nod in the direction of Iran, which has been producing 3.4m b/d rather than its allocation of 3.2m b/d. Although some members, notably Iran and Algeria, had entered the meeting urging further output cuts, ministers settled for a reiteration of the February limit, encouraged by the slight firming of prices which Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister described as 'a good omen'. Dr Subroto said Opec output for March was 23.2m b/d, 'very close' to the February ceiling which was lowered from post-Gulf war output levels of 23.65m b/d in an effort to shore up softening crude prices. This, he said, had been achieved, citing the rise in the price for the Opec basket of crudes from Dollars 16.39 in early March to Dollars 17.73 in early April. Oil analysts in London suggested the market might take some encouragement from yesterday's meeting, particularly if Opec tightened output closer to the February figure. However, Opec's own output figures are at variance with industry estimates, which put Opec production nearer 23.5m barrels per day.</p>

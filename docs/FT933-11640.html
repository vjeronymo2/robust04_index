			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Shares slide after Data General loss worsens SHARES in Data General fell yesterday after the US minicomputer manufacturer announced it had fallen further into the red during its third quarter. The company lost Dollars 16.4m, or 47 cents a share, between April and June, against a Dollars 11.7m loss in the same period of 1992 and a Dollars 7.6m loss in the first three months of this year. The latest losses were more than twice as large as analysts had expected, pushing Data General shares Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 8 1/2 at the close on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Ronald Skates, president and chief executive, blamed 'the weak worldwide economy, particularly in the European marketplace, and industry-wide competitive pricing pressures' for the poor results. Overall revenues during the quarter totalled Dollars 252.4m, down from Dollars 259.2m, although the decline was entirely due to the negative impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Revenues from traditional proprietary minicomputer products continued to decline. The company, however, is shifting away from proprietary products to open systems based upon industry standards. But once again, strong sales of its open systems products failed to stem the losses. Mr Skates said the success of the open systems line of products reinforced their belief the open systems strategy was correct.</p>

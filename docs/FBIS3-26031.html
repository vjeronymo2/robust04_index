			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Patent Courts To Guard Rights"] </F>   [Text] A patent court system is planned for major cities  to protect domestic and foreign intellectual property rights.    The move follows what officials call "a positive  participation of China in the world scene" in copyrighting and  patenting product and technological innovations.    One patent court was established in Haikou, Hainan Province  last week.    "We'll suggest local governments open such courts at a  proper  time," said Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi.    She said China was better than the world average in  protecting intellectual property rights, although improvement is  needed.    "China is so large a country. We'll kick off nationwide  education campaigns to promote public awareness," she said.    And patent courts will be an integral part of the campaigns.    "If violations are evident, both Chinese and foreigners can  appeal to such courts," Wu added.    She urged countries like the United States to better  understand China's situation, calling it unwise for the US to  pressure China on its patent reforms.    "The United States doesn't understand what is happening with  China," she said in response to a question on possible straining  of Sino-US relations over the intellectual property rights issue.    China and the US reached a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  on January 16,1992 on the protection of intellectual property  rights.    "China has honoured the MOU since then, a fact even  recognized by the US," Wu said.    She also pointed to a series of new laws on trademarks,  patents and copyrights.    According to a Xinhua report, China's trademark law conforms  to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial  Property, of which China is the 95th member.    The report said since signing the Madrid Agreement for the  International Registration of Trademarks, about 10,000 foreign  trademarks have been protected in China.    Moreover, China has signed the Berne Convention for the  Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, and the Universal  Copyright Convention.    In another development, Wu reaffirmed that Sino-British  trade  could hardly escape damage from "an uncooperative and unfriendly  Britain."    But she noted the trade increases between the nations last  year, which leaped 86 percent to around $3.6 billion.    Sino-Russian trade also experienced a boom last year to $7.7  billion, up 31 percent over 1992.    Broken down, China's imports from Russia went up 41.4  percent  to $4.99 billion, while its exports grew 15 percent to $2.69  billion.    Vice Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said the two  neighbours have vast potential for trade development.    There were 27,000 Chinese working in Russia's projects last  year, with more than 2,000 Chinese enterprises set up there with  $82 million in investment.</p>

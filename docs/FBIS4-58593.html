			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Ministers held its periodic session  this morning under Muhammad Sa'id al-Attar, deputy prime  minister, the minister of industry, and head of the General  Investment Authority.    At the outset of the session, the council recited the  opening  verses of the Koran for the souls of the martyrs of the  incidents in 'Imran, including First Deputy Prime Minister Dr.  Hasan Makki's bodyguard.    The council discussed the wicked attack on Dr. Hasan Makki.  It stressed that the concerned quarters should follow the issue  and arrest the rest of the perpetrators and those who cover for  them and bring all of them to trial.    Moreover, the council decided to offer full legal care for  the families of the three heroic martyrs who were guarding Dr.  Makki and to grant the families of those martyrs medals, rank,  and appropriate compensation.    The Council of Ministers also reviewed a report on the  meeting held by the ministerial committee in charge of following  up and facilitating the work of the Military Committee formed by  the Council of Ministers and headed by the minister of defense.  The Military Committee was delegated to draw a plan to move the  military forces from what used to be called the border areas  prior to unity between the north and the south in implementation  of the first part of the accord document. It was supposed to  present this plan during this session. The council agreed to  continue with the previous [word indistinct] and to have the  Military Committee present a detailed report on the results of  its actions.    The council also decided to amend the bill on weight loads  presented by the Roads and Bridges General Authority. The  council also reviewed a report by the Ministry of Health on the  efforts exerted by the ministry to save and treat the victims of  the regrettable incidents in 'Imran.</p>

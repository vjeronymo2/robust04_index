			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santiago, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Several Chilean  authorities and business sector leaders agreed today that  persistently high inflation rates, increased unemployment rates,  and a drop in investments are causing concern within the Chilean  Government and the private sector.    Data disclosed on 1 June by the National Statistics  Institute  (INE) shows that the annual inflation rate remains at 12.7  percent, following a rise of 1.4 percent in May, while  unemployment rose to 5.3 percent; a 0.9 percent increase over  the past 12 months.    All this, in addition to a growth of only 3.4 percent of the  GDP during the first quarter and a persistent drop in the  exchange rate, makes businessmen fear that the economic  adjustment the government has been implementing for the past  year may became negative and that the Chilean economy may slow  down.    Chilean Economy Under Secretary Carlos Mladinic asserted  that  these figures reveal that the struggle to curb inflation--one of  the government's main objectives and the main reason for the  adjustment--is not easy and demands great discipline and  austerity in public and private expenditures.    Mladinic denied that the Chilean economy has been  drastically  over-adjusted, adding that it is only "logical" that the  measures to reduce expenditures would increase the unemployment  rate.    Mladinic added that the government is maintaining its goal  of  an inflation rate not higher than 11 percent for this year.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa, of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, by Giovanni Valentini; place  and date not given: "`I Challenge Miracle Man to Unarmed  Combat'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Valentini] Mr.  Spaventa, why did you eventually agree to challenge [Forza  Italia leader] Berlusconi? Are you not afraid of pitting  yourself against him?    [Spaventa] I did not accept. I did more than that: I  suggested it. I am not afraid. I am a teacher by profession,  and I am not investing everything in this contest. I can always  return to university and earn no less than I would as a deputy,  and certainly more than as a minister. My motivation is not to  win a seat in the lower house.    [Valentini] So what did prompt you to run as a candidate?    [Spaventa] Let us say moral irritation.    [Valentini] What does that mean?    [Spaventa] I was prompted by two factors. The first is that  I have spent many years of my life condemning the intrusion of  politics into industry, its contamination of business, and  attacks on the production system. These ties are harmful to  everyone. And now a representative of the economic world is  entering politics, in an improper manner. You cannot become  your own monitor.    [Valentini] What is the second reason?    [Spaventa] I do not think that at present it is permissible  to deceive the Italian people with promises or announcements of  miracles. Our past two governments have taken a difficult and  exhausting path of reform. It is dangerous to think that anyone  can guarantee at a stroke the recovery of employment, growth, a  new economic miracle, and a reduction in taxes.    [Valentini] Pardon me, Minister, but your constituency is  made up of wealthy Rome storekeepers: How do you think voters  will respond to a program of austerity and stringency?    [Spaventa] We shall see whether there is an aware and  responsible bourgeoisie. The choice is between believing in  miracles or seeing things rationally. The people are free to  choose: They will decide whether to place their trust in someone  who is intimately acquainted with the city's problems or whether  to assign the role of savior to someone coming from outside who  does not know much about them.    [Valentini] Which sectors will you be addressing in  particular in your quest for votes?    [Spaventa] Everyone. Absolutely everyone, without giving  priority to any one source of votes. I want to understand and  to reason with other people. Ours is a very diverse  constituency, which includes some underprivileged areas. It  could therefore constitute a representative sample of the entire  city.    [Valentini] Will you occupy an awkward third position  between  Berlusconi and Michelini [Pact for Italy]?    [Spaventa] If the term "awkward" refers to my own personal  situation, it is appropriate. I certainly do not have much  experience, and I lack resources. The barefoot infantrymen must  face armored divisions. I am fighting with my bare hands.    [Valentini] The law sets a ceiling of 92 million lire for  each candidate: How much do you expect to spend? And where  will you get the money?    [Spaventa] No, I could never spend as much as 92 million. I  will draw on my meager savings. I have yet to see how. An  electoral apparatus costs money, and I have no television  networks. But the law also forbids explicitly costly forms of  propaganda. It will not be an easy venture.    [Valentini] What do you think of the Mammi law, which  granted  Fininvest three television networks?    [Spaventa] A great number of gaps and shortcomings in this  law have already been highlighted. The entire matter must be  reappraised. In healthy conservative countries, such as  Britain, no one private individual can own more than one network.    [Valentini] Do you consider Berlusconi the reincarnation of  [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi?    [Spaventa] Many say so. Certainly in the past his proximity  to Craxi did him no harm.    [Valentini] What is your opinion of the electoral agreement  between Forza Italia and Fini's National Alliance?    [Spaventa] It is fundamentally ambiguous. It seems that the  transitive relation, whereby the League is with Forza Italia in  the North and Forza Italia with the National Alliance in the  South but the League will not stand with the National Alliance,  does not work. There are some major differences within this  alignment, first and foremost over the federal issue. Here,  more than in other instances, the uniting factor is merely  electoral.    [Valentini] Do you think Berlusconi needed [Northern League  leader] Bossi more, or vice versa?    [Spaventa] The League realized that it could lose some  positions in the North to Berlusconi. This is no marriage for  love, but a marriage of convenience. And perhaps each partner  is thinking of his own interests.    [Valentini] Some people are already talking in terms of a  new  fascism, of an Italian-style Peronism. Do you consider the  right-wing front an authoritarian movement?    [Spaventa] For the present, it is easier to say what it is  not. Obviously it is not a responsible conservative right. Nor  is there anything reminiscent of the Thatcher experience. In  that alignment it is not easy to identify a uniting rationale  and program, other than the slogan, "if we prevail everything  will be fine." In other words, we lack one of the essential  democratic elements -- a liberal-conservative right.    [Valentini] This being so, are you not afraid that the  so-called "pact for freedom" could win and govern, even on its  own?    [Spaventa] Until recently this prospect seemed very  unlikely.  Now it is much less so. Many misjudgements have been made,  abroad too: Last month at a seminar at Harvard, everyone was  still asking me for information about the League, not about  Forza Italia. But I would like to quote from the FINANCIAL  TIMES of 15 February: A victory by the left, it wrote, is the  lesser of two evils; the greater danger comes from the League,  the National Alliance, not to mention -- and I am translating  literally here -- from Berlusconi's dubious credentials.    [Valentini] Many predict that the next parliament, lacking a  self-sufficient majority, will be ungovernable.    [Spaventa] This danger does exist. Perhaps wings will be  clipped on both sides. There could perhaps be some changes of  heart with regard to the government. The center will be  crucial, and in fact even it is a two-headed creature.    [Valentini] If that does happen, could there be a second  Ciampi government?    [Spaventa] This hypothesis could be part of the postelection  scenario. However, present conditions are very different from  those of the first Ciampi government, which stemmed from a  political disintegration. The new parliament may be fragmented,  but it will be highly motivated from all sides. A political  truce is unlikely to recur.    [Valentini] So will we not have a government of experts?    [Spaventa] I prefer to talk in terms of an institutional  government. Be that as it may, it will have a stronger  political role.    [Valentini] Could you become prime minister, Mr. Spaventa?    [Spaventa] Please! Let us not talk about such things.    [Valentini] In recent weeks you clashed with Berlusconi over  the issue of tax cuts. Is it really impossible to alleviate the  tax burden?    [Spaventa] We can and must do a great deal to reorganize  what  is a rickety system. In particular, taxes on industry are  excessive and ill-conceived. Our tax system favors debt, but  discourages risk capital. There could be a reduction of direct  taxation, counterbalanced by an increase in indirect taxation.  But a reduction of the tax burden is not feasible in view of  our public debt situation.    [Valentini] Forza Italia argues the need for further public  spending cuts.    [Spaventa] A gradual cut in expenditures is possible, and  this has already been started by the government. But the  results will be achieved in the medium term. Our welfare  system, for instance, bears the burden of the fact that the  entire West is growing older, with longer life expectancy and  lower birth rates. Pensions reform must also safeguard the  interests of our children when they grow old.    [Valentini] What about interest costs?    [Spaventa] The average cost of the debt is falling, with the  cut in interest rates. As the positive response from the  markets show, this is the only road to a proper reform. If tax  reform were to fail, taxes would rise sharply and public  finances would suffer as a consequence.    [Valentini] So what is your answer to Berlusconi's group  when  they propose cutting taxes and reducing expenditure by 1 percent  a year for the next 10 years?    [Spaventa] I do not know whether those gentlemen have ever  examined a state budget. I really would like to know where they  intend to make such huge cuts. In some sectors, such as public  investments and research, there have already been drastic  reductions, verging on the intolerable. I am impatient to  discover what other areas of expenditure they want to cut, and  how.    [Valentini] Meanwhile, Communist Renewal leader Fausto  Bertinotti is suggesting taxing treasury bills above a certain  ceiling.    [Spaventa] That interest cannot be touched. This element of  the state budget can be contained by credible debt management:  The Treasury did so very successfully in 1993. The wealth tax  or other such proposals are a recipe for the country's economic  and political suicide.    [Valentini] But Communist Renewal is part of the left-wing  cartel.    [Spaventa] Both in the Senate sand in the lower house  Communist Renewal voted against my finance bill. They are well  aware of who they are dealing with. Nor do I intend to  relinquish the finance bill.    [Valentini] Do you think that anything can be done to combat  unemployment?    [Spaventa] This disaster is affecting the whole of Europe.  Unfortunately there are no solutions that will work overnight.  There are means of facilitating higher employment: flexibility,  the reduction of labor costs -- above all for young people --  and labor mobility. For instance, there is no reason to prevent  any youngster from working in a supermarket for three hours a  day.    [Valentini] Mr. Spaventa, what does "solidarity" mean today?    [Spaventa] Well, it is difficult to define in a few words.    [Valentini] And who are the "progressives"?    [Spaventa] This reminds me of the "shining and progressive  future." Of course, everyone wants progress. The progressives'  label seems to me a rather generic one. There is no question of  changing forms of ownership. The progressives want a  well-regulated and disciplined form of private capitalism; state  intervention to regulate and redistribute (this is where the  concept of solidarity could be relevant) in order not to debase  some and to elevate others. In other words, a system more  similar to other, better capitalist economies capable of  achieving social solidarity. A system capable of limiting the  domination of the economy by politics and, still more, the  domination of politics by the economy.</p>

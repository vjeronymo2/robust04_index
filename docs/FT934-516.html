			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Gas in Belgian bid talks British Gas has emerged as one of the potential bidders for the Belgian government's 50 per cent stake in Distrigaz, the monopoly gas transportation and storage company in the country, writes Robert Corzine. The company declined to comment on whether it would make a bid, although it said that it 'was watching the situation very closely.' The Belgian government's interest in Distrigaz is held through NIM/SNI, the state holding company which includes businesses ranging from publishing and television distribution to paper and textiles manufacturing. It is not clear whether British Gas would be able to bid only for Distrigaz. Other potential bidders include Tractabel, Bayernwerke of Germany and the Conoco oil subsidiary of DuPont, the US chemicals company. Distrigaz operates 3,400 km of pipelines in Belgium and Luxembourg, compared with the 17,900 km network run by British Gas in the UK.</p>

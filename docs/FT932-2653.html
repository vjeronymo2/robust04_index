			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (5): Cell phone at the ready / Profile of Aleksander Kwasniewski of the Social Democratic party FOUR years ago Aleksander Kwasniewski was a top communist party aide, deeply involved in the so-called 'round table' negotiations between Poland's last communist government, led by Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski, and the anti-communist Solidarity movement. Last month, as leader of the Social Democratic party, he was talking with his former opponents about a possible compromise which would have kept the government in place, thanks to his party's benevolent abstention. In the end no compromise was possible. But the fact that the talks took place indicate how far the former communists have regained a degree of political respectability. This is partly a tribute to the political skills of Mr Kwasniewski, whose party dominates the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) of former communists. Almost indistinguishable from Poland's emerging business management class, Mr Kwasniewski, with his double breasted suits, natty ties and cellular telephone, has gained a reputation as one of the most able and far-sighted of the younger generation of Polish politicians. The alliance which he leads developed, by default, into the largest parliamentary group in the recently dissolved parliament. This followed the defection earlier this year of a dozen MPs from the Democratic Union, the largest party of the former Solidarity coalition parties to emerge from general elections in October 1991. The defectors, led by Mr Alexander Hall, set up their own Polish Convention party. Oddly, the re-emergence of former communists as the biggest group in the outgoing parliament attracted less attention than the SLD's earlier decision, in May, to support the Suchocka government's mass privatisation programme (MPP), albeit after the government had incorporated, at the SLD's demand,amendments in favour of state employees and pensioners. Significantly, the SLD supported the principle of giving an important role in the MPP to foreign-run investment funds - a crucial part of the MPP, which was opposed by catholic nationalist members of the coalition government itself. The votes of Left Alliance deputies helped Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, defeat a right wing and solidarity union no-confidence vote which saved both the MPP and the government. 'The privatisation vote carried a high risk for our party. It was not easy to explain to our electorate why we were supporting the government while the Solidarity trade unions and the Christian nationalists were opposing their own government,' Mr Kwasniewski admits. But it was a decision which gave credibility to the social democratic credentials of the party in the business community and brought closer the time when the party could be legitimately considered as a potential member of a future left of centre coalition government. The SLD is again expected to perform strongly at the elections in September, capitalising on the votes of former communists and those who feel poorer for the loss of the low level social security of the communist years. The political rehabilitation of former communists has not gone so far as neighbouring Lithuania, where the party led by Mr Algirdas Brazauskas won the recent elections. But developments in Poland are similar to those in Slovakia, where the Democratic Left led by Mr Peter Weiss is preparing itself for a future government coalition role, and in Hungary, where the reform communists led by Mr Gulya Horn are also benefiting from the low popularity of the right wing coalition government. The SLD, Mr Kwasniewski adds, has close links with all these parties, and with reform communists in Italy. Helping to rally former communist voters, including many unemployed and unskilled blue collar and office workers, behind the revised mass privatisation programme is part of a long term strategy. There may be many among his voters nostalgic for a simpler, more comfortable past, but Mr Kwasniewski is not among them. He opposed the idea of holding new elections under the old electoral proportional electoral system. 'Poland needs a stable government, and that would not have emerged from early elections under the old rules,' he said shortly before President Walesa agreed to sign the law which will eliminate smaller parties from parliament. Mr Kwasniewski argues that the rightward shift of the former communists is matched by a leftward shift in the attitudes of right wing parties such as the liberal democrats led by Mr Jan Krzyzstof Bielecki. 'The liberals no longer believe in Adam Smith's invisible hand. They too recognise that we need a compromise between the market and people's social needs. So maybe we are both moving towards collaboration in a future government,' Mr Kwasniewski said, looking ahead to the inter-party negotiations which will follow the elections. Memories are probably too long for such an 'historic compromise' to take place soon after the September elections. But even the idea of such a centre-left coalition would have been unthinkable four years ago  - underlining the fluid nature of Poland's post-communist politics.</p>

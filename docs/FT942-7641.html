			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / IBM gives its global advertising to O&amp;M International Business Machines is to give a single advertising agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, all its advertising around the world, in one of the largest account moves in advertising history. IBM, which currently uses more than 40 agencies worldwide, yesterday would not put a figure on how much it spends on advertising, but industry observers believe it could be up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) a year. The company said that O&amp;M - which is based in New York but, as part of the WPP group, is listed on the London Stock Exchange - will assume full advertising responsibility, including media buying, for the IBM brand and all IBM products and services from next month. The consolidation into one agency came as a surprise to the advertising world, which was not aware that IBM's account was up for review. It follows a shake-up of IBM's marketing and sales, announced earlier this month. Instead of being organised along geographic lines, marketing and sales are to be restructured into 14 teams, each covering a specific industry segment. The wider reorganisation is part of a plan by Mr Lou Gerstner, IBM chief executive, to restore the company to profit: this year's first-quarter results showed net earnings of Dollars 392m, compared with net losses of Dollars 399m in the first quarter of 1993. Ms Abby Kohnstamm, IBM vice-president for corporate marketing, said: 'IBM is one of the world's best-known brands. Our advertising team decided that in an industry undergoing such rapid change, we would be better able to maintain and increase brand awareness by having a single agency to leverage IBM and its products around the world.' Analysts said it was too early to tell what effect the account win would have on WPP - the agency could lose other customers as a result of account conflicts. The marketing services group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54.4m for the year ended December 31 1993, up from Pounds 7.8m the previous year. In spite of the improvement in performance, Mr Martin Sorrell, chief executive, was cautious about the forecast for this year, saying that recovery for the industry was 'still unstable and uncertain'. The group's other main advertising network is J. Walter Thompson. WPP shares gained 6p last night to close at 126p. O&amp;M, which has among its other clients American Express, Ford and Unilever, will also become responsible for a substantial proportion of IBM's direct marketing. Ms Kohnstamm said the agency would help 'deliver clear, consistent messages, in the most efficient way possible'. The agency had the 'relevant technology expertise and the extensive multinational and local capabilities' needed, said IBM. Advertising agencies which will lose out because of the consolidation include Lintas, DDB Needham, and McCann-Erickson.</p>

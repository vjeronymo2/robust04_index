			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Kuchma muted over Sevastopol Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma yesterday rejected the Crimean port city of Sevastopol's unilateral declaration, made earlier this week, that it was part of Russia. Mr Kuchma, himself vacationing on the contested peninsula, told reporters that the decision of the city council of Sevastopol, which is the home port of the Black Sea Fleet, 'has no legal weight'. But, beyond making this expected and formulaic statement, Mr Kuchma, who said he would try to 'persuade' the city council to reverse its decision, has been remarkably mild in the wake of Sevastopol's separatist ruling. The recently elected Ukrainian president's unruffled reaction is part of a more general easing of the hostilities between Ukraine and Russia, which has been evident this week in the measured responses of both Kiev and Moscow to Sevastopol's declaration. Over the past three years, Crimea, transferred from Russia to Ukraine only in 1954, has often been a lightening rod for deeper tensions between the two Slavic neighbours. After Crimea's election earlier this year of a separatist president, who received political advice and financing from Russia, some analysts, including the CIA, warned that the two countries could come to blows over the lush peninsula. But political developments in Crimea this week have suggested that Mr Kuchma's victory in Ukraine's July presidential race has made that dire scenario unlikely. Although Mr Kuchma has backed off from the pro-Russian rhetoric that he employed on the election campaign trail, he is clearly a leader with whom the Russians feel they can do business and their reaction to Sevastopol's break-away bid has been appropriately amiable. Whereas a year ago the Russian parliament passed its own ruling declaring Sevastopol to be Russian territory, earlier this week senior Russian officials dismissed the city's unilateral effort to join Russia as 'illegal' and said they did not wish to 'warm their hands over Ukraine's troubles'. Russia's new-found desire to be a good neighbour to Mr Kuchma's Ukraine may be in part explained by Moscow's perception, as articulated yesterday by Mr Sergei Karaganov, one of President Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy advisors, that under Mr Kuchma's new regime 'the old Ukrainian elite, which made its career on the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, is being ousted.' Unlike the breakaway regions with strong local ethnic identities, such as embattled Chechnya, which are bedevilling Russia in the Caucasus, Crimea is dominated by ethnic Russians whose calls for independence have always been a thinly veiled plea for reintegration into their perceived motherland. If Russia is now placing a higher priority on good relations with the new Ukrainian leadership, Crimeans may have no one to turn to but Mr Kuchma, the man they overwhelmingly voted for in July.</p>

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOM HOUSE COST DEPENDS ON HOW FANCY YOU WANT IT  </P> <P> What will it cost to build a custom house? There's no simple answer to this  most-asked question.  </P> <P> Your costs will be determined by a variety of factors, most notably the price  of your lot, which experts say can account for anywhere between 25% and 40% of  your total expense, and the level of luxury you decide to give your new digs.  </P> <P> Other variables include building fees assessed by local governments, which can  add at least 5% to the cost of a house, material costs and prevailing local  wage scales for laborers and craft workers.  </P> <P> In the end, say experts from the National Assn. of Home Builders, you can  expect to pay a minimum of between $55 to $90 per square foot to build a new  home today. The figure, which does not include the price of the lot or  landscaping costs, varies according to area.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles region, the association's research chief Gopal Ahluwalia  says, the average minimum hovers in the $75 per-square-foot range. It is lower  in the eastern and northern stretches of the basin and higher along the  coastline.  </P> <P> The L.A. figure is roughly equal to that for Chicago and suburban New York. In  San Francisco and New York City, the average minimum, Ahluwalia says, is nearly  $90 per square foot, largely because higher labor costs and local fees. By  comparison, the average minimum is $55 per square foot in Kansas City and St.  Louis, $60 in Phoenix and $70 in Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> Is there a maximum?  </P> <P> Don't be silly! Of course not.  </P> <P> Mike Ashley, a custom home builder in Hidden Hills is completing a nearly  9,000-square-foot house with a 3,000-square-foot guest "cottage" in that  community, complete with an underground racquetball court, swimming pool,  waterfall and spa, lavish marble flooring and other luxurious touches.  </P> <P> The cost? About $300 a square foot.Carla Lazzareschi  </P></p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Arts: Collectable playboy - Patricia Morison marvels at the Demidoff exhibition at London's Wallace Collection The life and times of Anatole Demidoff, Prince of San Donato, now featured in an exhibition at the Wallace Collection in London, read like the stuff of novels. Demidoff was a Russian aristocrat with a vast fortune from family mines and factories in the Urals. Born in St Petersburg in 1812, he died in Paris in 1870, so ravaged by syphilis that he was cruelly called Count Decomposition. Demidoff's was a life of scandalous amorality and yet with his insatiable appetite for pleasure he combined a streak of philanthropy unusual among Russians of his class. He, and still more his equally lustful ex-wife Princess Matilde, feature prominently in accounts of Second Empire Paris. Elsewhere too, Demidoff has left his mark. When next in Florence, I shall look for Piazza Demidoff and the huge monument Anatole designed for his father, the first Prince of San Donato. The marble figures of The Muse of Society and Siberia with the young god Pluto appear, as well as the half-naked Anatole at his papa's knee. It is not entirely to modern taste. Nor, I guess, is Chicken Demidoff - too heavy on caviare and cognac. The small Wallace Collection show commemorates Demidoff the collector, with a sparkling essay by Francis Haskell. It relates how the count built up one of the century's greatest art collections in the villa his father built in Florence. The Villa San Donato, briefly renamed Villa Matilda in honour of his wife, was really a palace grander than anything of its kind in 19th-century Florence. It is unlikely Demidoff needed the money, but perhaps from weariness he began selling off his collection nine years before he died. These spectacular sales were highly gratifying to the 4th Marquess of Hertford, another ageing expatriate roue living in Paris. He bought some 80 objects, including paintings, watercolours, armour and weapons, snuff-boxes, knick-nacks and jewels, now in the Wallace Collection. The exhibition only takes up two small rooms so that had it been anywhere else one might not think it worth bothering about. But then, this is the Wallace Collection, a place of rare delights and many art-lovers' favourite museum in all London. If you have never been, the Wallace Collection has an unbelievable wealth of paintings, furniture, sculpture, majolica and porcelain. While a paradise for clock-fanciers, it also has the finest arms and armour outside the Tower of London. The museum, five minutes walk from Bond Street in Manchester Square, is in a brick and stone mansion with 19th-century galleries and sumptuous drawing rooms so that it hardly feels like a museum at all. The collections were amassed over three generations by two marquesses of Hertford and an illegitimate son, Sir Richard Wallace. Here you will find 17th-century Dutch low-life scenes and 19th-century Orientalism and the best 18th-century French collection in Britain. Frame to frame hang superb masterpieces by Titian, Velasquez, Rembrandt, Rubens, Van Dyck, Boucher, Delacroix and more. Just as people are surprised to realise that Manet's Bar at the Folie Bergere hangs in the Courtauld Collection, so the Wallace Collection's trump card is Frans Hals's Laughing Cavalier. And yet, not one painting nor candlestick have you seen anywhere else. The Wallace Collection is an exceptional cultural asset seemingly doomed to obscurity - except that doomed is hardly the right word. By the terms of Lady Wallace's will, nothing can be either lent or borrowed. No grandiose temporary shows means almost no press coverage. Hence, therefore, the freshness and air of exclusivity that reigns over Hertford House. On its silk-hung walls we find works of art blessedly safe from the hurly-burly shuttlecockery of the international exhibition scene. The Demidoff show may be the incentive you need. It sheds light on the shared tastes of two aristocratic playboys, with money to burn and conservative tastes. Not for them the Barbizonists or squalid Realist paintings. Pictures of historical events appealed: battles, lives of painters and, above all, Napoleon. (Had Matilde not been a Bonaparte, she would have been safe from Demidoff's clutches.) Naturally they had an eye for decorative women, for Fragonard's Fountain of Love and Ary Scheffer's airborne nude in Paulo and Francesca. Paul Delaroche's Execution of Lady Jane Grey, however, was a little too painful for the Marquess - or perhaps simply too well clad. She ended up at the National Gallery. The exhibition runs to July 25.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (38): Suddenly last summer - Just when it seemed that China's first takeover was at least a decade away, a Shenzen conglomerate made a surprise move / China's first takeover bid WHEN China's stock market regulators were writing the rule book earlier this year the legal department of the State Council - China's cabinet - questioned why rules were needed governing takeovers. As Mr Gao Xiqing, a director of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China's corporate watchdog, remembers it, one official said 'it will take 10 to 20 years before we have a takeover in China'. Wrong. The ink had barely dried when Bao'an, a fast growing conglomerate listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, was buying stock in Yanzhong, a Shanghai-listed manufacturer with large property holdings. Bao'an's tilt at Yanzhong this autumn sparked controversy up and down the south China coast about the efficacy of company takeovers and the quality of the regulations governing the stock market. Local loyalties were also fully engaged. The superior-minded Shanghaiese were horrified by what the parvenu from the south was up to. In Shenzhen, China's first and most successful special economic zone, Mr Zeng Hanxiong, chairman of Bao'an, was elevated to the status of a local hero. Like it or not, as Mr Xu Qing Xiong, chairman, Shanghai International Securities Co., noted, takeovers have come to China. 'This sort of acquisition is inevitable; you can do nothing to prevent them from happening.' Late last month, however, the CSRC found that Bao'an had violated the law governing the acquisition of substantial shareholdings. Bao'an's sin was to move from 10 per cent of Yanzhong to nearly 20 per cent of the company without making the required statutory declarations. The CRSC fined Bao'an Yn1m and it was required to pass on to Yanzhong some of the profits (about Yn500,000) it made from the illegal trade in Yanzhong's shares. Bao'an was banned from buying any further stock in Yanzhong until November 4. The CSRC's ruling has cleared up what some professionals thought was a flaw in the rules concerning the timing of declarations and the definition of concert parties. It has also got China's securities industry talking about the value of takeovers. Mr Gao, although admitting that China's regulatory environment is not 'pro-takeover', is in no doubt about their benefit. 'A lot of listed companies still behave in the same way as they did before corporatisation,' he says. 'The threat of takeover shows them that control now rests with shareholders, not government departments.' Mr Liu Bo, executive vice-president at the Shanghai Securities Exchange, agrees. 'Takeovers are good for management change and for the management of resources and for the economy in the long run.'</p>

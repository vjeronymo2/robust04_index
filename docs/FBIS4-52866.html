			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Nuclear Culprit Caught Red-handed" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- 70 kg of unregistered  plutonium in pure powder was discovered recently at a reactor of  the Tokai nuclear fuel plant of Japan.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this case as  a  product of conspiracy among Japan, the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] which had carried out its inspection and  the United States which had manipulated the IAEA.    The news analyst says:    The hiding of plutonium by Japan shows there is a grave  problem in IAEA inspections and nuclear non-proliferation.    The hypocrisy of Japan, a double-dealer, has been stripped  naked and its wild ambition to become a nuclear power exposed as  a stark fact.    It has been proved that the Japanese Government's persistent  pressure on the DPRK over the "nuclear issue" was a despicable  drama to conceal its criminal nuclear arms development.    Facts clearly show Japan is a culprit who deliberately  violated the Non-proliferation Treaty.    The plutonium concealment also causes grave doubt as to the  impartiality of IAEA inspections.    The IAEA had said the nuclear facilities of Japan were under  its strict inspections, but had never reported that there was a  problem.    While closing its eye to Japan concealing a large amount of  plutonium, the IAEA has faked up "suspicion of nuclear  programme" of the DPRK and framed every conceivable intrigues to  have "sanctions" taken at the United Nations organisation. This  is an act contrary to the basic mission of the IAEA and the  culmination of its application of a double standard.    This eloquently proves that the IAEA is rather used as a  shameful political tool of the superpower than performing its  duty and mission.    The United States is also involved in the problem. The U.S.  Government, aware of Japan's concealment of plutonium, has kept  silence and connived at Japan's nuclear development.    It is shameless of the United States to hurl mud at the  peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK that offer no problem  and threaten it with the use of arms such as "preemptive strike"  while keeping mum about Japan's concealment of plutonium, a big  problem.    This shows the United States does not intend to prevent the  proliferation of nuclear weapons but is using the nuclear issue  for a sinister political purpose.    Japan must frankly open to the public the whole amount of  plutonium it has stockpiled in secrecy and give up the nuclear  armament programme.    The IAEA must observe the principle of impartiality in  accordance with its mission.    The United States must refrain from using the nuclear issue  for a sinister political purpose against the DPRK and from  applying the double standard.</p>

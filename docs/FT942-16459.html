			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Disaster strikes in middle England: Adam Raphael explains the sense of betrayal among fellow Names at Lloyd's who now face ruin Shortly after 5pm on his first day as chairman of Lloyd's, the London insurance market David Rowland heard a knock on his door. It was a waiter, resplendent in a Victorian navy blue and crimson tail coat, bearing a glass of champagne on a silver salver. 'The chairman always has a glass of champagne at this time,' he was told. Champagne is no longer served on the 12th floor, the Rolls-Royce has been sold and the waiters are gone. The days when Lloyd's chairmen lived like Renaissance princes have disappeared. So, too, have the conflicts of interest, the incompetence and the amateurishness which brought the market to its knees. But the losses continue. There is no English word for Schadenfreude, the joy that comes from watching other people's misfortunes, but the crisis at Lloyd's has undoubtedly given pleasure to many. The gloating over those who were seen to have gambled on unlimited liability and lost everything is based on a myth that only the seriously rich have been stung. Not so - most of the Names who are now facing ruin are neither rich nor famous. As most shy away from publicity, the results are rarely obvious However, lives have been wrecked, careers ended, children forced to leave school, houses sold, marriages sundered. In a few cases, the consequences have been even more tragic. A year ago this month, Diana Weston found the body of her husband hanging from a noose tied to a banister in their north London home. Harold Weston, a 51-year-old solicitor, had told his wife that he could see no end to his losses at Lloyd's, which he feared would result in his professional disgrace. 'They asked for more and more money; that's when he started to sleep badly,' Diana Weston told the coroner. 'He was told he might go bankrupt.' Two years earlier, when Lloyd's was about the announce its first losses for two decades, David Coleridge, then chairman, said in an interview: 'We have the misfortune to blush very publicly. We had 30,000 members. Many of them will have lost money and they make a lot of fuss . . . Most of the people who are bitching and whingeing are doing it because they don't like losing . . . No-one has been swindled and it has nothing to do with unlimited liability. It's simply pure losses.' But the crisis at Lloyd's is not simply a result of pure losses. Given the belief of some underwriters that they could ignore the basic principles of insurance, it was perhaps inevitable that a complacency born of 300 years of successful trading would sooner or later be shattered. The scale of the catastrophe is nevertheless extraordinary. Losses have exceeded more than Pounds 7bn in four years, more than than the loss of any other British financial institution in history. Those who have been caught in this financial disaster are understandably angry. One bankrupt Name went up to David Coleridge and shouted, an inch from his nose: 'Remember this face - I hope you have nightmares over it. You have ruined me.' Clive Francis, a former RAF fighter pilot, who has had to sell his house and move into a rented flat having lost nearly Pounds 3m says: 'To think that my fortune is now in the hands of those fools.' Nick Gratwick, a 36-year-old insurance broker, was in a militant mood when I sat next to him at a Lloyd's general meeting. 'Why should I mortgage my future for that bastard down there,' he said pointing at Coleridge. 'I am going down to the county court next week to declare personal bankruptcy. If they want my future, they can whistle for it.' The bitterness of those who have lost everything has been increased by a feeling of betrayal. How, they ask, could a market, which had built up a reputation for integrity and fair dealing over three centuries, allow itself to be turned into a cauldron of insider dealing? As one disillusioned Name put it: 'What has been destroyed is trust. People joined Lloyd's confident in its reputation for 'utmost good faith'. To be a member of Lloyd's was a distinction, something of which one could be proud. No longer.' The factors leading to the downfall of Lloyd's are complex, but undoubtedly a root cause was its failure to control capacity. Between 1983 and 1988, the market doubled in size while premiums grew by less than a fifth. Insurance has always been a cyclical business, depending on the flow of capital. But there had never been anything quite like the mid-1980s premium frenzy. A leading members' agent, James Sinclair, managing director of Willis Faber Dumas, is refreshingly blunt: 'Lloyd's recent history is an outrageous disgrace, with greed, bad management, incompetence and catastrophes bringing the market to its knees.' During the 1980s boom a very large number of new Names joined with inadequate capital resources. Often they were persuaded to join by individuals on commission who were paid undisclosed fees by members' agents anxious to expand their capacity. The British tennis player, Buster Mottram was relaxing in a bath in the changing rooms at Wimbledon after losing the men's doubles final in 1983 when he was approached. Did he know anything about Lloyd's? asked a fellow member, who then outlined the glowing advantages of joining. An introduction was effected and, persuaded by the agents' enthusiastic endorsement, both Buster and his father, Tony, signed on, a decision that was to land them with losses of more than Pounds 1m. Buster looks back with bitterness on how he was snared. 'I knew nothing about excess of loss insurance. I was never given any explanation. The whole thing has been a nightmare.' Lloyd's not only connived at such practices as commission payments, it allowed its own entrance requirements to be undermined. Names are not allowed to use the value of their principal residence either for their deposit or as evidence of their net wealth. But this precaution was sidestepped by the use of bank guarantees, a device which lured many who should have never have gone near such a high risk market. One such innocent was Bridget Milling Smith, the 26-year-old widow of a Royal Marine officer killed on active service in Oman. On her return to England in 1979 with her two small children, she was advised by Charterhouse Japhet to join Lloyd's. 'I don't want you to think I was a wimp, but I had been married since I was 21, and I didn't know anything about how to manage my financial affairs,' she explained later. Her financial adviser listened to her worries about how she would be able to bring up and educate her children on her own. 'Join Lloyd's, I know just the right man,' he advised his client, who had a small cottage but no job and no income apart from dividends from her capital of Pounds 70,000 in shares. A decade later, Milling Smith now continuous calls from several open year syndicates with huge asbestos and pollution liabilities. She has given up counting how much she owes, but it must be more than Pounds 200,000. 'It doesn't make any difference to me any more,' she says. The consequence of encouraging thousands of Names with only moderate means to gamble their homes away is now admitted to have been a disastrous mistake. 'I think we should have been asking in crude terms - if you join Lloyd's, can you write a cheque for Pounds 100,000 and not disturb your lifestyle,' says Sir Peter Miller, chairman from 1984-1988. 'We failed to raise deposits sharply enough.' The large intake of new Names provided the cannon fodder for the market's greatest folly - the notorious reinsurance spiral in which catastrophe risks were shunted incestuously around the market so that the original liability became completely obscured. The availability of exceptionally cheap reinsurance led to basic principles being flouted. Primary insurers were able to accept dubious risks, confident that, however bad the claims record turned out to be, they could lay off the risk and still make a handsome profit. The result was doubly damaging. The spiral undermined underwriting standards at the same time as exposing thousands of Names to enormous losses in the event of a series of catastrophes. The fortunes of Names and those who act for them should have been closely aligned, but this crucial relationship was undermined by the get-rich-quick-mentality of the 1980s. Agents, remunerated by profit, commissions and fees, stood to gain greatly from expansion. The temptation to expand capacity regardless of risk was increased by the agents' desire to capitalise their businesses and sell out for large sums while the going was good. Conflicts of interest also exacerbated the most serious threat that Lloyd's faces - the problem of old year losses. The market's system of trading, a three-year accounting period at the end of which a syndicate's financial position is finalised by means of an internal reinsurance premium paid to the successor year, depends almost entirely on trust. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many long-tail syndicates paid out illusory profits and reaped equally bogus profit commissions as a result of inadequate reserving. Thousands of newly-recruited Names found that they were trapped on syndicates which had inherited billions of pounds worth of pollution and asbestos claims dating back half a century. Were they gulled into joining such under-reserved syndicates in order to dilute the losses? Robert Kiln, a distinguished former underwriter, says: 'Many Names who joined Lloyd's in the 1980s have suffered unfair and enormous losses due to the gross inadequacy of the reinsurance to close made over the past 40 years and which was well known about in the early 1980s.' The discrediting of its traditional system of trading leaves Lloyd's with a difficult structural problem. A no less serious difficulty is the mis-match between the increasing volatility of the market's capital base and the long-tail business it has traditionally underwritten. When the highest-level direct tax was at 98 per cent, the risk of underwriting losses was borne largely by the Inland Revenue. The destruction of the market as a tax shelter has coincided with a realisation that the risks of underwriting with unlimited liability are folly for all but the seriously rich. After the devastating losses of the past four years and the bankrupting of a sixth of its capital base, few believe that a market, in which professionals were trusted to run the business on behalf of amateurs, can be brought back to life. The new Lloyd's that is emerging is one in which big corporate players with limited liability will call the shots. Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman, is among those who believe there is no future for the individual Lloyd's Name trading on the basis of unlimited liability. 'It causes too much grief,' he says. Anyone who seeks to forecast what will happen next is faced by the difficulty familiar to portrait painters - the sitter refuses to keep still. Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, noted shortly after his appointment: 'No British institution has ever taken the losses that Lloyd's has and survived.' Yet the market has professional skills, a world famous brand name, and an institutional resilience which should not be underestimated. Adam Raphael, is a Name at Lloyd's, chairman of Syndicate 90 Names Association, and a member of the Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party steering group. His book Ultimate Risk - the inside story of the Lloyd's catastrophe, is published by Bantam Press on April 28 at Pounds 16.99.</p>

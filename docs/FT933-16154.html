			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / VAT introduced in Poland Poland brought in value added tax yesterday, set generally at 22 per cent but with a 7 per cent rate for items such as childrens' goods and construction materials, and a zero rating for basic food items, writes Christopher Bobinski from Warsaw. The government expects VAT, which replaces a turnover tax, to add only 1.5 percentage points to the annual inflation rate. The tax rises will be phased in as old VAT-free stocks are replaced. In a last-minute rush to avoid price rises, Poles have been on a shopping spree. Cars and lorries have also blocked border crossings with Germany in a scramble to import goods before the tax took effect.</p>

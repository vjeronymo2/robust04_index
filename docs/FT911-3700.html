			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian government support package criticised as too little CANADA'S federal government plans to bolster 1991 farm income by CDollars 425m (Pounds 214m) this spring through its Farm Support and Adjustment Programme. It claims that this will bring realised farm income to CDollars 3.3bn from Dollars 3bn in 1990. Realised income is operating profit after depreciation. But both western and eastern farm groups said that this would not be nearly enough to counter the farm crisis, particularly on the prairies. Incomes will remain under pressure from the continuing wheat trade war between the US and Europe, and the impact of Canada-US free trade on horticulture. Western groups were the most critical. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool said that the prairies alone needed CDollars 1.3bn this year to offset low prices and 'they gave us Dollars 200m.' However, Mr Donald Mazankowski, the federal agriculture minister, said that the government 'just doesn't have the dollars.' The Farm Support programme replaces emergency annual bail-outs, with income insurance designed to guarantee participating farmers 90 per cent of long-term average income in case of crop disasters or low commodity prices. Further changes in the system are due next year. The federal government picks up part of the premiums but most provinces have delayed their contributions and farmers have been slow to sign up. Mr Mazankowski agrees that the premiums are high. The government has also announced modest help for horticulture and direct financial incentives to prairie farmers to take marginal land out of production.</p>

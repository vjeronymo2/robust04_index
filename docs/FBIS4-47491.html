A  goniophotometric apparatus for measuring the backscattering  diagrams for samples of soils and vegetation and for water  surfaces at laser wavelengths was developed. A diagram is given  with 29 components identified, serving as a basis for a detailed  description of instrument structure and functioning. It ensures  measurement of the effective brightness coefficients in the  range from 10[.sup]-4[/] to 10[.sup]4[/] with an error not  greater than 20%. The results of measurements of sand,  earth  (clay loam) and mixed meadow grasses, as well as an open water  surface and water with an oil film with a thickness 0.5 mm, at  wavelengths 1.06 and 10.6 m are presented. The experimental  data on the angular energy and polarization reflective  characteristics of samples of underlying surfaces, in  combination with simulation of the geometry and observation  conditions of the macrosurface of extended terrain sectors, make  it possible to synthesize their images and therefore to select  the best parameters of laser sounding apparatus.

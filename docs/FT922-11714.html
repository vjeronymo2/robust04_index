			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / The Property Market: A turn for the worse Returns on commercial property turned negative in March for the first time since last August, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research group. Yields moved outwards, reflecting the continued downward pressure on rental and capital values as well as the climate of pre-election uncertainty. Rental values were cut by a further point in March, after falling by a percentage point in February. Capital values fell by 0.7 per cent, their worst single month's result since last July. The quarterly figures also deteriorated. In the three months to March, rental growth fell from -1.5 per cent to -2.3 per cent, capital growth dropped from -0.9 per cent to -1.7 per cent, and total returns declined from 1.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent. The year-on-year total return of 1.2 per cent improved, although at a slowing rate compared with late 1991. Retail outperformed the industrial sector, with total returns of 0.6 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. The total return for the office sector was -1 per cent, which is the lowest monthly return since last July. During March, the retail sector's rental values dropped by another 0.2 per cent and the equivalent yield increased from 8.6 per cent to 8.8 per cent.  -------------------------------------------------------- IPD MONTHLY INDEX  -------------------------------------------------------- Monthly change (index based at Dec 1986=100)                    Mar 1992     Feb 1992     Change IPD                167.04       167.15        -0.11 Retail             152.11       151.18         0.92 Office             161.97       163.53        -1.56 Industrial         232.51       232.14         0.37  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

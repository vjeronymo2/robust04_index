			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Serdar Turgut report: "$1.5 Billion From the United </F> States"]    [Text] Washington--The U.S. Administration has agreed to  transfer the $1.5 billion which has accumulated in the Gulf Fund  to Turkey, on the condition that Ankara sign a stand-by  agreement with the IMF. It has been learned that U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has "agreed" in principle to Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller's request for the transfer of that fund to  Turkey. It has also been discovered that Bentsen's only  condition was the IMF's approval.    The United States does not want the fund to be used for  political purposes. That is to say, it does not want it to be  used to increase the wages of workers and employees. Nor does  the United States want it to be used to meet agricultural needs.  In light of that, Bentsen has received President Clinton's  consent and is now waiting for Turkey to conclude a stand-by  agreement with the IMF. When that agreement is signed, the  Turkish Government will not be able to use that fund in any way  it wishes. The U.S. Administration has decided to wait for that  guarantee.    The Gulf Fund can only be used for the realization of  Turkey's F-16 project. However, circles close to the U.S.  Administration have said that the United States will ignore any  move by Turkey to use that fund for short-term measures aimed at  reactivating the economy, provided that the IMF agrees.  Meanwhile, it has been ascertained that the Pentagon has  withdrawn its reservation on the transfer of that fund in  accordance with the guarantee Turkey has given that it will be  used in the long run for its original purpose.    Meanwhile, during the Turkish officials' talks with the IMF  and the World Bank to prepare for the requirements after the  stand-by agreement is reached it became apparent that Turkey may  quickly relax on the economic front when that agreement is  signed. The IMF and the World Bank have decided to extend a  $300 million credit to Turkey for privatization projects.  Furthermore, Japan will also extend a credit of $300 million to  Turkey. That was decided in the talks the IMF and World Bank  officials had with the Japanese Government. Japan's credit will  be available immediately after the IMF and the World Bank extend  their credit to Turkey. That means that Turkey will receive a  total credit of $600 million.    Turkey will receive $1.5 billion dollars from the U.S.  Administration and $600 million from the IMF, the World Bank,  and Japan after it concludes a stand-by agreement with the IMF.  That development will ease the economic and financial situation  in the country. However, the funds that will be transferred to  Turkey will have to be used in accordance with the stand-by  agreement's conditions.    Meanwhile, it has been observed in Washington that Ankara's  willingness to conclude a stand-by agreement with the IMF is  gradually removing the anxiety about Turkey.    Furthermore, the IMF Executive Council has approved the  World  Bank's decision to extend a $100 million credit to Turkey for  the services of consultants in the realization of the master  plan for privatization. The World Bank decided to extend that  credit to Turkey some time ago; however, it has withheld it for  the past two months. Meanwhile, Japan has donated $2 million to  Ankara to be used for privatization projects.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AD AGENCY DEFINES BUYERS BY LIFE STYLES, NOT BY AGE ANYMORE  </P> <P> It used to be that age had a lot to do with how we act and what we buy.  </P> <P> Now, stage could become important in how products are pitched to us, according  to J. Walter Thompson, the ad agency that bills $3.8 billion annually  worldwide.  </P> <P> When they talk about stages, they aren't talking about second childhoods or  mid-life crises. They're talking about say, a young parent, married and whose  oldest child is preteen. That young parent could be 25 years old or 50.  </P> <P> "We no longer define parents in terms of their own age, but by the age of their  children," said Peter Kim, who heads JWT's consumer behavior department. "We  have found that studies based on age such as 50-plus, the graying of America or  life-style studies, such as the yuppies, are obsolete as we enter the 1990s,"  said James B. Patterson, chief executive officer of J. Walter Thompson USA. "If  we think of people in terms of their life stage rather than their age or even  socioeconomic position, we will have a more accurate window into their needs  and desires."  </P> <P> In the postwar years, life was fairly cut and dried. A young man got a job,  married and started a family all before he was 30. He stayed married through  his retirement and until he died at 69. The young woman spent her life as a  homemaker.  </P> <P> Not so today and not well into the 1990s, says Kim. Today, he says, young  people will go through many phases between the time they leave school and die,  at average age 80 by the year 2000.  </P> <P> There are the singles, broken into four groups: at-home singles, young adults  living with their parents; starting-out singles, young adults sharing or  supporting their own apartments; mature singles, older adults either never  married or divorced, and left-alone singles, widowed seniors or older divorced  adults, 77% of them women.  </P> <P> There are two types of couples: young couples recently married and childless,  and the empty nesters, those left alone because their children are grown.  </P> <P> In addition to young parents, the parental life stage includes mature parents  and single parents. Mature parents are married and their oldest dependent child  is a teen-ager or adult. Single parents are unmarried parents rearing their own  children.  </P> <P> The whole thrust of this, of course, is how to target the markets.  Empty-nesters and mature parents, just in case you're wondering, are the  largest groups in the country, 65 million total now and 77 million in 1995.  </P> <P> The 33 million mature parents in the country control $650 billion in income  while the 32 million empty nesters control $520 billion.  </P> <P> By 1995, when baby boomers age, mature parents' ranks and income are expected  to swell by 24% and empty nesters' by 14%.  </P> <P> Move over, yuppies.  </P> <P> X  </P></p>

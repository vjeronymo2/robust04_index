			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liang Yurong (2733 3768 2837): "Mechanism and </F> Market, the Points To Start With in Improving Large and  Medium-Sized State-Owned Enterprises"]    [Text] Large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises  constitute the mainstay of the socialist market economy and the  endeavor to improve these enterprises has very important  significance in economic development and social stability.  Thus, it is a major event in China's current activities to  proceed from reality in fully studying and understanding the  measures for improving large and medium-sized, state-owned  enterprises.    1. Transform Mechanism To Clarify Property Rights    The issue on clarifying enterprises' property rights or  putting property rights in place is comprised of how to  distribute the assets to individuals under the public economy so  that both the public and individuals own public property. After  several years of exploration, it can be said that the best way  we have come up with is to promote the shareholding system at  state-owned enterprises.    There are two patterns we can adopt in promoting the  shareholding system:    One is to maintain the original property rights and draw in  the shares of staff members and workers. This is a moderate and  conservative therapy. The original state-owned assets, after  being reappraised, serve as public shares, and then the shares  of staff members and workers are drawn in. This not only helps  separate ownership from management rights but also helps clarify  the enterprises' property rights.    The other is to divide public property into the liability  shares of staff members and workers. This is a larger-scale  reform measure. The original state-owned assets are manifest as  collective property, but it is difficult to see their micro  embodiment. If we divide state-owned property into individual  shares to make everyone possess specific property and then pool  the property and turn the enterprises into shareholding  enterprises, the property as a whole belongs to the public  although the shares belong to individuals. This is not only an  effective method to maintain public ownership under the new  market economy but also an effective way to maintain and  increase the value of state-owned assets. It is the  continuation, not disintegration, of public ownership; and it is  progress, not retrogression, of history.    In maintaining public ownership of state-owned assets, we  may  adopt two methods. One is to let the state or governments at  all levels appoint representatives of property rights to execute  the property rights of companies. The other is to appraise the  current assets of state-owned enterprises and then lease them to  individuals.    2. Establish a Modern Enterprise System and Turn Enterprises  Into Companies    In a strict sense, both enterprises and companies are  qualified, independent, legal persons and economic entities  capable of independent operation. Why is it then, that  enterprises are urged to transform into companies? In general,  there are two categories of enterprises. There are those with  one main investor and there are others that are partnership  enterprises, with unlimited liabilities for their operation so  that when enterprises go bankrupt, the investment partners not  only lose the enterprises but also all their personal deposits  and property. Companies that emerged later are actually all  stock companies, whose prominent characteristic is the  diversification of major investors and share of risks and  interests. In the process of development and evolution, stock  companies have gradually become ones with limited liabilities.  That is, investors bear the risks of companies only within the  limits of the stocks they invest, excluding other property. The  limited liability stock companies and limited liability  companies that have emerged, all shoulder limited liabilities  only. From this, we have come to the initial conclusion that  turning enterprises into companies means changing one  owner-enterprises into companies with many investors and limited  liability.    Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are  enterprises invested solely by the state, and they are, as we  often say, owned by the public. As the sole investor, the state  holds unlimited liabilities for the enterprises. Heilongjiang's  large and medium-sized enterprises have suffered losses year  after year, their deficits have remained high, and two-thirds of  them are in difficulty. However, most of them have not gone  bankrupt. This is because the state holds unlimited liabilities  for these enterprises.    How then, should large and medium-sized enterprises be  turned  into companies? Of the two methods that can be applied, one is  to transform large and medium-sized, state-owned enterprises in  line with the shareholding system. This not only helps  pluralize investors but also enables the state to hold limited  liabilities correlating to the capital investment amount.    The other is to turn large and medium-sized, state-owned  enterprises into companies owned solely by the state.  Transformation to the shareholding system is good, but extensive  application is impossible for the time being. It is not that  loss-making enterprises cannot be transformed in line with the  shareholding system. It is that flexible methods should be  adopted, such as auction, buying out, or quantifying the  relatively profitable parts and turning them into shares to  invest. The direct way out for loss-making enterprises is to  turn them into companies first. That is, the existing  state-owned enterprises are changed into limited liability  companies solely invested by the state, and the state holds  limited liability according to its current investment, no longer  unlimited liability for continued losses. Property rights are  delegated to enterprises thoroughly so that they operate  independently and shoulder the responsibility should they go  under. This may be the best way to enable enterprises to  survive.    3. The Government Should Strengthen Service and, in  Particular, Cultivate and Improve the Market System to Improve  Large and Medium-Sized, State-Run Enterprises, .    Speeding up the cultivation and improvement of the market  system is a guarantee for transforming mechanisms and  invigorating enterprises and also an important function of the  government. In this regard, a good job should be done in three  aspects. First, we should do a good job in building markets to  establish the market networks more rapidly. Currently,  Heilongjiang has yet to build stock markets, labor markets,  futures markets, cultural markets, and enterprise markets, and  it should transform its various types of markets into open ones  with advanced facilities and complete functions, which can play  a wide radiating role. Second, we should accelerate economic  legislation and establishment of the market mechanism. Third,  we should strengthen the coordination and control of some  markets that monopolize the business of some essential elements  of production. Some essential elements of production, such as  funds, railways, and transportation, are seriously restricting  Heilongjiang's enterprise production. Under conditions where  these essential elements of production are under unified  management by the central authorities, the government should  make positive efforts in coordinate and control to ensure a  reasonable distribution of the existing essential elements of  production.</p>

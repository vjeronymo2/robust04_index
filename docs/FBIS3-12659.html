It has become abundantly clear that  settlement activity and peace are incompatible. Moreover, the  only way to prevent the recurrence of the Hebron massacre in  other Palestinian towns is to begin dismantling the settlements,  whose establishment rational Israeli circles admit was a mistake  in the first place. Furthermore, the continued existence of the  settlements is a more serious mistake whether with regard to the  chances of coexistence or the physical presence of the  defenseless Palestinian people.    The occupied territories' residents do not view this demand,  which the international community should comply with, as another  prerequisite for resuming the talks regardless of what it is  called. This is because disarming the settlers and dismantling  the settlements, whose existence fundamentally contradicts any  rational concept of peace, is the only correct beginning. It is  also the duty of the international community to provide an  effective force to protect the Palestinians and separate them  from the armed elements, be they settlers or otherwise, and  maintain security and safety.    The United States, which has backed Israel against any move  in the Security Council to provide the international force being  called for by the Palestinians, should consider the formation of  that force a humanitarian demand that can end daily frictions  and confrontations between Palestinian residents and the Israeli  forces, resulting in death and injury.    What increases pain and suffering is that the Israeli  authorities, instead of allowing the residents legitimate  freedom to express their grief and anger, they rush their forces  to confront the marches and the demonstrating processions.  Thus, the number of martyrs and wounded goes up. This in  itself is an indication that the calm for which the Israeli  authorities are striving cannot be achieved through violence,  but by permitting the relatives of the victims, the wounded, and  other residents to express their feelings and pain, while  removing the chances of confrontation and friction between them  and the Israeli forces. Enough victims have fallen so far.</p>

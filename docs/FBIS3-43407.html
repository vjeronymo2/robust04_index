The syndicate, uncovered at a spot near the (?Crepys) Hotel in  Accra, is suspected to be run by drug barons. The GRAPHIC  quotes the deputy superintendent of police in charge of the  narcotics unit, Mr. Robert Ayalindu, as saying that eight  people, including the owner of the spot, have been arrested.    Fifty-nine international and diplomatic passports were also  seized during the operation. The passports are from the  Bahamas, Liberia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Kenya, and  Canada.

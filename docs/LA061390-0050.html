			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> DEFENSE KEY IN BELGIUM 2-0 VICTORY  </P> <P> Belgium frustrated South Korea's attack and pulled away to a 2-0 victory on  second-half goals by Marc Degryse and Michel De Wolf in the opening World Cup  match for both teams Tuesday.  </P> <P> Degryse put Belgium ahead, 1-0, in the 53rd minute when he floated an 85-foot  shot over goalie Choi In-Yong, after the South Korean ventured too far from the  penalty area.  </P> <P> In the 64th minute, De Wolf intercepted a pass in the South Korean end of the  field, then maneuvered into position and scored from the left side.  </P> <P> "There have been so many surprises in the World Cup. Some small teams have  beaten giants. We had to win this match," Belgian defender Eric Gerets said.  "We weren't afraid, but we had a lot of respect for the South Korean team."  </P> <P> More than 32,000 fans saw Belgium take an early lead over Group E rivals  Uruguay and Spain, both considered as strong as the top-seeded Belgians.  </P> <P> "Belgium has its first two points in its pocket, that is the most important,"  Coach Guy Thys said. "But I would have loved to see a couple of more goals."  </P></p>

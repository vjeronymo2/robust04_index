			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The cracks begin to show - Investing in . . . Italy - A market for the risk-takers IF ART mirrors life, then the news last week that the Colosseum in Rome is beginning to fall apart is an apt metaphor for the political and economic problems afflicting Italy. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has only this week been able to appoint a prime minister by asking Giuliano Amato, deputy leader of the Socialist party, to form Italy's 51st government since the war. This is a full two months after the latest elections in which a resounding vote of no-confidence was given to the ruling Christian Democrat-Socialist alliance. Italy has been leaderless at a time when important decisions are needed and constitutional reform is on the agenda. The frustration was made clear by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, when he called earlier this month for the urgent introduction of an austerity package to tackle the country's deteriorating economy. Sentiment has not been helped by the brutal assassination last month of Giovanni Falcone, Italy's leading anti-Mafia magistrate, and revelations about a municipal corruption scandal in Milan. These uncertainties depressed the stock market, until the news that the appointment of a new prime minister was imminent caused a short-lived rally. The market started its downward slide almost exactly a year ago. The BCI index at June 4 was 10 per cent below its February high for the year according to JP Morgan and has underperformed the FT-A Europe index since then by 15 per cent. Most investors are underweight in Italian equities and JP Morgan recommends them to stay that way. Should Italy be left well alone until it sorts itself out? Or is this a low point representing a good buying opportunity for brave investors? There are certainly plenty of negatives. The main problem worrying fund managers is the growing size of Italy's budget deficit. Dino Fuschillo, of the fund management team for the Lazard European Growth unit trust, estimates this at L160,000bn-185,000bn for 1992, or around 11 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares with 4 per cent in Germany, 1.5 per cent in France and 4 per cent in Spain. Yet, if Italy is to meet the convergence timetable set by the Maastricht treaty, it will have to reduce the figure to 3 per cent by the end of 1996. Total public debt - more than 100 per cent of GDP - and retail price inflation of around 6 per cent also distance Italy increasingly from its main EC partners. 'Italy has to face up to a whole range of problems which, in the short term, it cannot do,' says Stephen White, fund manager of Foreign &amp; Colonial's Eurotrust. For this reason, he has taken the Italian weighting in the fund down to 3 per cent - the lowest since June 1986, when it reached a high of 9 per cent. Apart from inflation and the budget deficit, White points also to the increasing industrial competition being faced from neighbours such as France and Germany. 'Italy is locked into a fixed exchange rate. But its costs are rising in D-mark terms, and companies like Fiat are suffering because they used to be in a protected market,' he says. Yet, the Italian situation is paradoxical. The wealth of its private sector is in stark contrast to the poverty of the public sector, but its economy remains the world's fifth-largest and is ahead of the UK's. It is the second-biggest producer of capital goods in Europe after Germany, and a 2 per cent growth in real GNP in 1990 was higher than the US and the UK. There are some signs of an official determination to confront the economic problems. In January, the government imposed a six-month freeze on capital spending projects to hold down the public sector deficit; the caretaker administration extended this by three months. Some fund managers see potential for a turnround. 'There is no law that says Italy always has to be in a mess,' says David Sachon, managing director of Hill Samuel unit trusts. 'There is potential for significant returns over 12 months because wage inflation has been brought under control, which is allowing the economy more space.' Sachon believes the government recognises that it will have to tackle the economic problems seriously if Italy is to play a full part in Europe. The Italy weighting in Hill Samuel's European unit trust is 8 per cent, which is greater than in most other collective funds investing in Europe. Sachon says there are no plans to increase it because of the risk of continuing political instability. But he regards the Italian market as a stock-picking opportunity rather than one in which to spread assets. 'The private investor should think of Italy as a small part of his portfolio and identify reputable companies with a solid basis,' Sachon notes. These include Eridania, an agro-industrial company, responsible for the improvement in the operating results of Montedison, the Italian chemical and agribusiness concern. The Italian market is certainly cheap in price to cash flow terms of 2.8 compared with 6.6 for France, 5.8 for Germany and 5.8 for West Europe, excluding the UK which is 10.0. 'You can pick up 15-20 stocks at low levels but you have to be selective,' says Francesco Ricciuli, Italian equity market analyst at Paribas. He favours Sirte, Stet and Italcapel in the telecoms sector; Sai and Ras in the insurance market; Sme in food; Credito Italiano and Banco Lariano in the banking sector; and Teleco Cavi, the equipment manufacturer. Trading volume, though volatile, has been generally thin and it is unclear where the demand for a stream of new issues due on the market is to come from. The potential for volatility means that the opportunities that might exist in Italy still are reserved very much for risk-takers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FACTFILE: ITALY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Population 1990:                                       57.7m Gross Domestic Product 1991:                   Pounds 653 bn Market Capitalisation, end 1991:               Pounds 82.3bn Inflation Rate, May 1992:                       5.6 per cent Interest Rate (discount), June 1992:             12 per cent Exchange Rate, Jun 15:                    Pounds 1 = L2207.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

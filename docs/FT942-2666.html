			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Political uncertainty and inflation fears push up bond yields European government bonds fell yesterday on fears of rising inflation and large budget deficits. Political uncertainty following elections to the European parliament earlier this month reinforced the bearish sentiment which has dogged the markets since the start of the year. During the week, German, French and Italian bond prices hit lows for the year. US Treasuries were bruised by a falling dollar, climbing commodity prices and data showing a rise in consumer confidence, all of which fuelled fears of further rises in US interest rates. Wall Street closed sharply lower in the wake of the bond market slide. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 34.56 points down at 3,776. Report, Page 24</p>

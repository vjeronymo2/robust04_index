			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION PANEL OKS GORE'S BANK LOANS  </P> <P> Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) did not receive favored treatment from banks  that lent him $1.6 million for his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic  presidential nomination, the Federal Election Commission reported Thursday.  </P> <P> Most of the loans were taken out around March, 1988, when a large number of  primaries were held in the South. The Tennessee senator had pinned much of his  hopes for winning the nomination on those primaries.  </P> <P> Election commission auditors initially questioned whether some of the banks had  received enough collateral and assurances of repayment. Gore's campaign argued  that the loans had been repaid in full, which should serve as proof of the  soundness of the decision to lend the money.  </P></p>

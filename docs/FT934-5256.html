			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): Don't mickle with a muckle THE OXFORD DICTIONARY FOR THE BUSINESS WORLD Oxford University Press Pounds 15.95 996 pages It is possible that a Sassenach closing a deal on the Isle of Skye or some similar place might need to know the meaning of the Scots word 'mickle'.

Uruguay is described and the Uruguay Round defined. Is 'thatcher - n. (Old English)' a joke? Thatcherism does not feature. Alas, some of the country definitions are already dated. Under 'United Kingdom': 'the economy is based on manufacturing industry.'</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SYRIA SHOULD LEAVE LEBANON -- U.S.  </P> <P> In what appeared to be a U.S. policy shift, Assistant Secretary of State  Lawrence S. Eagleburger said in an interview broadcast today that Syria should  withdraw from Lebanon.  </P> <P> "The Syrians have to back off," Eagleburger said in an interview on  Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon conducted by the station's Washington  correspondent. "All of the outside parties ought to back off and let the  Lebanese make their own judgment about where their future lies. There is too  much foreign involvement on all sides."  </P> <P> His remarks in the taped interview reversed a statement he made before the  Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on March 16. He said at that time that the  withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon would aggravate the situation because  their presence restrains the warring parties.  </P></p>

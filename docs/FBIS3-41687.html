Now the physicians still have the situation under  control, but cholera ``import'' from the Asian countries has  been recorded; it was brought as one of the items acquired by  shopping trip participants. We even have our ``own'' cholera. In  Kaspiysk, Dagestan, a patient could not be saved. A  three-month-old infant with the diagnosis is being treated today  in a local hospital in Makhachkala. A bum, also with cholera,  was brought in the infectious disease hospital on Sokolinaya  gora on in Moscow. Typhoid fever was recorded in Rostov oblast  and anthrax--in the Altay.</p>

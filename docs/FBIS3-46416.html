			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Teng Mei-ling (6772 5019 3781): "Beijing </F> University Teacher and Student Issue a Letter of Appeal Jointly  Signed by People From All Walks of Life, Calling for an End to  Encroachment of Civil Rights"]    [Text] Yuan Hongbing, deputy director of the Beijing  University Law Department Procedural Law Teaching and Research  Office, and Wang Jiaqi, a postgraduate law student specializing  in handling cases wherein ordinary people have gone to law  against government institutions, yesterday made public a letter  of appeal signed by people from all walks of life, demanding  that public security organs take measures to stop the occurrence  of any events which encroach on citizens' interests and personal  dignity. The letter of appeal was signed by 350 people and  involved the largest number of people to sign a petition since  the 4 June incident in 1989. The signatories include many  prodemocracy activists.    The petition was sparked by the following event. On 2 July  1992, Yan Zhengxue, "head" of an artist's village near Yuan Ming  Yuan, who is also a deputy to the Jiaojiang City People's  Congress, Heilongjiang, was involved in a dispute with a bus  conductor. He was then detained by the public security organ of  Beijing's Haidian District and was attacked by the security  officers with electric batons. Yan later brought an  administrative suit against the public security office,  demanding that the public security organ be charged with such  illegal behavior.    The letter of appeal pointed out that if a deputy to the  people's congress could be treated in such a rude way, then  ordinary people would be less protected. The letter of appeal  supported Yan Zhengxue's suit and demanded that the authorities  act in accordance with the laws and that the law courts try  cases independently and affix responsibility to those who should  be blamed. The signatories will continue to pay close attention  to the development of the event.    The petition was caused by a dispute between the police and  civilians and it was on the largest scale since the 4 June  incident. The petition signatoriess included scholars, artists,  reporters, lawyers, workers, cadres, members of the provincial  people's congress standing committee, and ordinary people. Such  prodemocracy activists as Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and "Peace  Charter" members Liu Nianchun and Zhou Guoqiang also signed the  letter.    The appeal letter was drafted in August 1993 but, as the  drafters said, in order to prevent further complicating the  event, they did not make it public. However, as the authorities  did not take action to correct the wrong, and even continued to  threaten Yan, they were forced to make public the letter and  submit it to the National People's Congress Standing Committee,  the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's  Procuraterate.</p>

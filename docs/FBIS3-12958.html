Beloved citizens, I address you today to express my love and to  thank you for everything you have shown over the past days in  terms of your sincere emotions and condolences over the painful  loss of the late Basil.    From the day when Basil left this earth to face his creator,  I have been constantly preoccupied with two things: Basil's  departure and your sensitive and noble stand and sentiments,  which covered the entire country, filled every town and village,  and clearly manifested itself all over our land. This  remarkable phenomenon, with its national and human dimensions,  attracted the attention of people outside the country. It won  appreciation and admiration in terms of its noble and sincere  meaning and its manifestation of national unity. Sincere people  who are cohesive in weal and woe, in happy and sad times, are  always able to build their country, develop their life, and  realize, defend, and preserve their aspirations.    I have been engrossed by two things from the very beginning.  One was Basil's departure, because I am a father and any father  is pained by the death of his son. However, I was not saddened  only because he was my son. He possessed many talents,  capabilities, and characteristics that surfaced in him from his  childhood and grew over the years and reached an advanced stage  of ripeness, firmness, and clarity. At this advanced stage and  at 32, the peak of his youth and activity, Basil left this life,  his people, and homeland. I am not going to enumerate his  talents and capabilities. This may be done at a later time.  Basil left many friends and comrades who knew and lived with  him and who knew a lot about him. However, they did not know  him as his father did who lived with him for 32 years.    Basil had a pure, spotless, and unambiguous nationalist  upbringing. The homeland is sacred. It deserves more than  anything else all kinds of supreme sacrifices. This is a  fateful, moral, human, and religious issue that does not wane  and grow as time poasses, but remains as constant as time and as  strong as the continuity of life on earth. It is a cause that  is above all other causes and whose justice is above all other  types of justice, a cause that makes everything that serves it  an accepted possibility and a duty. It is the homeland whose  air we breath, whose water we drink, and whose food we eat. In  light of all this, love and unity grow among its homeland.    Hence, and stemming from this concept, Basil loved his  mates, friends, and fellow citizens. From this concept came  Basil's optimism and confidence in the future of the homeland  and people. Thus, he loved benevolent deeds and loved to serve  both the people and the public interest.    Basil reacted with the community and loved the people. He  was a brother of each youth in this homeland and a faithful  friend of each citizen who actively worked to serve everyone.  Basil did this whenever an opportunity was available, whenever  he could support a man in need or anyone who was done an  injustice, and whenever he could stand against those who did  injustice to others and encroached on others' rights, directly  or indirectly.    All this and much more attracted me to both Basil and his  departure. What attracted me much to you, beloved brothers, was  your great stand, your great sympathy and the extension of  condolences, and your understanding that the event was a general  one and that it concerned everyone. Your understanding was  correct and embodied nobility, faithfulness, and patriotism.    Beloved ones, we have long reciprocated love and shared  concerns and burdens. We will continue to do so as long as we  are alive, so our coming generations will inherit our  humanitarian, social, and national values, with God's help.  What relieved the sorrow was your genuine sympathy -- men,  women, and children. This was the source of real consolation.    Brothers and sons, the true sentiments you have shown are  beyond description. I can find no words to express my  impressions about what I saw, sensed, and heard in the past  days. I wish I could shake hands and talk to you, one by one,  in order to express to each of you my gratitude and appreciation  for this great stand. However, you know that the time factor  and vast distances would preclude this.    I was unequivocally confident that your sentiments toward me  were genuine. Through your deep sympathy for the painful event  which took place, you once again confirmed the genuine character  of our great people, who have always proved this character on  all occasions, whether happy or sad. This has consolidated and  further entrenched national unity. As I always say, national  unity is our sharpest and most important weapon in confronting  all challenges and calamities of life.    What I saw with my own eyes when we left home on our way to  the airport to take the body to the burial ground embodied the  meaning that I have mentioned. From my home to the airport,  people gathered along both sides of the road. Nobody gathered  them there. Nobody, including members of the household among  whom Basil lived, knew what time we were to leave because the  departure time was connected with a number of details. The  people who gathered along the streets were not spectators.  Sadness was clear on the faces of everyone, men and women.  They were either crying or raising their hands in prayer. In  more than one place, I saw a number of men collapse on the  ground.    These sad and grave scenes all along the road made our souls  more sublime. Deep sadness engenders strength and determination  to be patient as if this is the purport of God's wisdom when he  counseled patience and brought good tidings to the patient.    With this faith, I faced the disaster when I was informed of  it by the minister of defense, the chief of staff, and the  foreign minister who came to my house. Everyone of you can  imagine the impact of such a shock. After they answered my  queries, I told them: God be praised. God has given and God  has taken. Basil's demise is a great loss. One of them said it  was a national loss. I said: That is what I think. Let us  rely on God.    The slogans which were raised everywhere, repeating phrases  such as: We Are All Basil, We Are all Your Sons, have left  deep, and immense impression on our hearts. Rest assured that I  share this feeling with you from the bottom of my heart. For  me, each citizen in this country is either a son or a brother,  just like Basil. We are one big family and you are all my sons  and brothers of whom I am very proud and on whose originality,  zeal, and boldness I rely when the need arises.    I send my sincerest love, thanks, and appreciation to all  of you, beloved citizens, men and women, at home and abroad;  party members and officials of parties and of state; officers  and NCO's in the Armed Forces; men of religion and ulema;  members of popular, professional organizations, and trade  unions; university professors, teachers, and students; all the  sportsmen, knights, and youths; people in towns and in the  countryside; and all sectors of the people. I send my love,  thanks, and appreciation to all those who participated in any  sad demonstration, sat in a condolences meeting, and took pains  to go to al-Qardahah to offer condolences. I send my love and  appreciation to anyone who joined prayers on the soul of our  son, in his own house or at mosques; to those who prayed to God  or read verses of the Koran; to anyone who eulogized or wrote a  line in any cable or letter of condolences; to those who took to  the streets and courtyards in our towns and villages, raising  slogans of sincerity; to those who participated in any form in  expression of sorrow over our loss, the national loss, the  demise of the late Basil.    What I have seen over the past days is bright proof that in  this country we are one big family. What saddens one, saddens  all; what is glad, gladdens all of us. Hearts are one and arms  are held together. The national fabric is as firm as steel.    Brother citizens, my permanent concern and sole ambition is  that God may grant me the ability and strength to serve the  homeland and the people and to carry out what we believe is for  the good of the homeland and the nation. While increasing my  sense of responsibility, these generous sentiments you expressed  to me grant me further ability to exert my efforts and to  continue work at full capacity for the sake of construction and  liberation; constructing a decent life for the sons of our  people, and working seriously to liberate the occupied Arab  territories.    We have a lot to accomplish and immense responsibilities to  carry out. Let us continue our march, armed with faith in God,  and let us redouble our efforts. The people who believed in  God, unified themselves, and resolved to regain their rights  will surely regain them.    Beloved citizens. Words cannot express the feelings I have  for you, feelings of love, appreciation, and pride. I am  certain that we will continue our march on the path of dignity  and serious work. I pray God to lend me his support in order to  continue my efforts to build the homeland and its strength and  to defend our national and pan-Arab causes.    I send my thanks and appreciation to the Arab kings,  presidents, officials, and citizens who offered condolences  either personally, by sending representatives, by telephone, or  by sending cables and letters. I send thanks to all heads of  state, governments, officials, and figures from all over the  world who sent delegates, telephoned, or cabled condolences.    I repeat my thanks, love, and appreciation for you. I press  your hands, beloved citizens. May God have mercy on Basil and  may God make paradise his abode. Peace and blessings of God be  upon you.</p>

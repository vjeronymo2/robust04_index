Ustad Saeed [name as received], who represents the Hezb in  Peshawar, Pakistan, said no convoy would be allowed "to travel  to military bases," but three markets had been opened for  civilians in those parts of the capital controlled by the  faction or its allies.    The decision to stop aid going to areas controlled by former  defence minister Ahmed Shah Masood follows a warning by the  United Nations that some 200,000 people in the capital face  famine after weeks of fighting.    Saeed said the move came after accusations that supplies  recently brought in by an International Committee of the Red  Cross (ICRC) convoy were distributed to Masood troops.    The ICRC has denied the claim saying that the distribution  of  supplies to the population remained at all times under its  control.    An ICRC convoy carrying medical supplies was turned away  from  Kabul Sunday and had to return to Jalalabad in the east,  according to a journalist from the French newspaper, LE FIGARO,  who was travelling with the convoy.    The journalist also said that Hekmatyar had told him in an  interview that he was determined to set up a complete blockade  of the capital.    Analysts said the blockade was aimed at either causing a  mass  evacuation of the centre of Kabul by civilians or to push the  population into a revolt against President Borhanoddin Rabbani  and Masood.    Several UN trucks are waiting in Jalalabad for permission to  travel, a UN source said.    The Hezb controls the main road between Pakistan and Kabul  as  well as the southern approach to the city along the Logar  highway.</p>

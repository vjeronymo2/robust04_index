			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> CITY SEEKS WAYS TO KEEP LID ON PARTIES  </P> <P> Because of a recent fatal stabbing at a rowdy party, the City Council called on  police and city staff to suggest ways to prevent such parties from getting out  of control.  </P> <P> The council's action Tuesday came in response to the death of Ty Aaron Stout,  23, who died of stab wounds on Dec. 8 after a fight broke out at a party in the  4900 block of Via del Cerro. A second stabbing victim, Steve Nicholas Lindsay,  17, of Yorba Linda, was treated at a hospital for a wound to his arm.  </P> <P> Last week Richard Velasco, 19, of Anaheim was arrested on suspicion of stabbing  the two men. Dennis Scott Kidd, 22, of Anaheim was arrested later on suspicion  of aiding, concealing and harboring the murder suspect.  </P> <P> City Council members had suggested an ordinance similar to one in Los Alamitos,  which prohibits charging admission to parties in residential areas. But City  Atty. Leonard Hampel said that ground is already covered by state laws.  </P> <P> Police said hundreds of people showed up at the Via del Cerro party, which had  been advertised through flyers at several high schools in the area. One  principal in the district handed over a flyer to the police several days before  the party, school officials said. But police said they were unable to determine  much about the party because the flyers gave no exact date, time or place.  </P> <P> "It was very difficult to pin it down when it happens," said Lt. Cliff Trimble,  adding that even parents can be unaware of a party.  </P> <P> "We've had cases where there have been parents putting suitcases in the car and  not knowing there was going to be a party."  </P> <P> Bill Kielty, a trustee of the Placentia Unified School District board, said he  will pursue a policy of expelling students who hand out flyers advertising  parties where alcohol is to be served.  </P> <P> Duane Liable, a Yorba Linda resident and a member of the city's Traffic  Commission, said that neighbors should get in the habit of calling authorities  about such signs as excess cars on the street or high school students taking  alcoholic beverages into a house. Police can be stationed outside the party to  make sure it doesn't get out of hand, he said.  </P> <P> "Don't wait until someone is knifed or stabbed," Liable said. "You call the  police when it's building up. . . . Let's not wait until the beer bottles start  flying." TED JOHNSON  </P></p>

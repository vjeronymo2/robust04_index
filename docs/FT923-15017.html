			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Letter: Electrical industry training stifled by fragmented dealings with Tecs Sir, My interest was aroused by your article, 'Shephard Investigates Training Shortfall' (July 1), because on June 30, together with other leaders of the electrical contracting industry, I met Patrick McLoughlin, the junior employment minister. We took the opportunity then to raise with him the difficulties being faced by our electrical contracting training scheme. Traditionally, the electrical contracting industry has train-ed 4,500 apprentices per year: important not just for the contracting industry but for industry at large because 80 per cent of all electricians in the UK are trained via that scheme. Following changes over the past few years, which included the scrapping of the employers' contribution through the levy system, we now have find ourselves having to negotiate for government support with not one central body but with 82 Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales and 22 Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland. This, in itself, is difficult enough but the employers, 80 per cent of which are small companies, face immense bureaucratic procedures if they are to benefit from government support. It is reaching a point where many of them are simply refusing to take on apprentices. This, fuelled by the recession, explains why this year's figure is likely to be 1,000 apprentices or less. It goes some way towards answering the question which Mrs Shephard intends to investigate - that is, why Tecs are failing to meet the guarantee of training places available. The answer clearly is the creation of a national agency which will allow us to negotiate with one body. This will mean that our training advisers throughout the country can get on with the job of training and ensure that our apprentices achieve National Vocational Qualification standards. Rather than applying themselves to such training, our advisers are spending countless hours in negotiations with individual Tecs and on other meaningless bureaucratic functions. I know that many Tecs share my view that the system is overly bureaucratic and in need of reform. The electrical contracting industry will continue to train apprentices but to do so we work in place. Given the predicted reduction in apprentices, it is not over-egging the pudding to say that the existing framework could be brought into question and our ability to continue to train apprentices will be jeopardised. This can only result in yet more 16- and 17-year-olds hanging about on street corners. I want them properly trained so that they can become valuable members of our society.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Watch Out for British Intervention in `Xi </F> Yang' Case"]    [Text] Reportedly, [Governor] Patten reviewed Hong Kong's  latest developments with British diplomatic officials on 6  April, which included the sentencing of MING PAO reporter Xi  Yang. After the meeting, Patten's spokesman said that a  statement will be made by Chief Secretary Chan Fang On-sang on  the case.    Mrs. Chan Fang On-sang did make a statement, saying that the  British and Hong Kong governments are naturally concerned about  Xi Yang's fate.    Obviously, Mrs. Chan was backed by Patten, who was supported  by the British Government. Mrs. Chan merely repeated what  Patten and the British Government wanted her to say.    Because of his involvement in criminal activities  incompatible with his capacity as a reporter, MING PAO reporter  Xi Yang violated the State Security Law by spying and stealing  important state financial secrets. The Beijing judicial organs  arrested, tried, and sentenced him in accordance with the law.  This is China's internal affair and brooks no foreign  interference.    Some people in Hong Kong do not understand China's laws and  judicial procedures and are not clear about Xi Yang's criminal  offense. It is understandable that they have requested more  information about the case. However, a handful of figures like  Martin Lee and Sze Tu-wah have acted diametrically. On the one  hand, they say that they know nothing about the Xi Yang case and  "not even the kind of crime of which he is charged." On the  other hand, they attacked the Chinese judiciary for being  "unfair" and "hostile to the freedom of press," "brutally  trampling upon human rights," and "intentionally dealing Hong  Kong press circles a head-on blow at the first encounter."    Regarding Xi Yang's criminal offenses, officials responsible  for the relevant Chinese departments have answered questions  raised by the press circles on various occasions, clearly  pointing out that he stole state secrets, including the  unreleased plans of the People's Bank of China concerning  savings interest rate changes, the decisions by the People's  Bank of China on participating in international gold bullion  transactions, and other major financial secrets. A few days  ago, Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong  branch, and Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office, gave an account of the nature of the  case and the grounds for the sentence. Zhu Yucheng said: It is  true that Xi Yang has been convicted of stealing major state  financial secrets. As he has violated the "PRC Security Law,"  he must be handled in light of the "PRC Criminal Procedural  Law." The purpose of not trying the Xi Yang case openly is to  prevent leakage of state secrets during the trial. This  conforms to article 111 of the "PRC Criminal Procedural Law":  "Cases involving state secrets or privacy shall not be tried  openly."    These remarks are based on responsibility and not made  willfully by any individual. We believe that the Chinese  judicial departments will be very prudent in the arrest, trial,  and sentencing of a Hong Kong reporter who has violated the  criminal law. Based on evidence and the law, the case will be  handled realistically.    Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said  yesterday: "Each country has its own commercial and economic  secrets. If these secrets are stolen, the person involved, of  course, must be punished." Has the Hong Kong British  authorities not introduced the "Government Security Law" from  Britain? In Britain, you cannot make everything public and  secrets are not to be leaked. For the sake of Hong Kong's  overall interests, former legislative councilor Sit Hao-yan made  public some material concerning the airport and he was  investigated by security officials for leaking secrets. For the  sake of maintaining the secrets of the Independent Commission  Against Crime [ICAC], the Hong Kong people are still kept in the  dark about the case of Tsui Ka-kit, who was sacked by the ICAC.  Naturally, China has its own secrets as well as laws for  maintaining secrets. The handling in accordance with the law of  a person who has stolen major financial secrets is precisely a  manifestation of the legal spirit. We do not know why the Hong  Kong British authorities have made indiscreet remarks and shown  "concern" over an espionage case. What kind of law is it in the  world which allows one to maintain its secrets but does not  permit the other to fight against spying?    This reminds us of the Han Dongfang case which took place  last year. Han was handled according to law and his passport  was revoked for violating China's criminal law. Taking  advantage of the case, the British Government wantonly carried  out provocations and even "showed great concern" by raising it  to a diplomatic level. The Hong Kong British authorities  attacked China's handling of the Han Dongfang case as "violating  human rights" and "contravening the International Law," saying  it "would dampen the confidence of the Hong Kong people for a  long time to come." The followers of the Hong Kong Alliance for  Promoting Democracy in China added fuel to the flames, lodged  protests, held sit-in strikes, and stirred up trouble for some  time.    We can draw the following conclusion, after reviewing the  past and current situations: The British side's concern over  the "Xi Yang case" is not for the individual. They think that  the individual can be used to smear mud over China, incite Hong  Kong people's discontent against China, dampen the confidence of  the Hong Kong people in their future, and meddle in Hong Kong's  smooth transition. All people of goodwill should heighten their  vigilance.    The British side did not gain any advantage from the Han  Dongfang farce which they played in the past. How can they  attain their objective with the "Xi Yang case" today?</p>

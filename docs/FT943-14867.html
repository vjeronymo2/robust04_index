			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (13): Kicking the support habit - David Buchan finds that agriculture is learning to live with the Gatt What Mikhail Gorbachev used to call 'new thinking' is gaining ground in France's farming establishment - or at least in its agriculture ministry and parts of its food industry and farming community. France is learning to live with the Gatt accords which, only a year ago, many French were denouncing as instruments of American 'agri-imperialism' aimed at turning the French countryside into a desert. Paris is developing proposals to enable French and European farmers to sell more of their produce on the world market without subsidy - and thereby to sidestep legally the Gatt requirement for a 21 per cent cut in subsidised exports over six years. Despite their past tirades against Gatt, the French are better placed than other Europeans to kick the habit of high support prices and high export subsidies. In the Paris basin, France's prime wheat growing belt within a radius of some 200 kilometres from the French capital, production costs are roughly the same as in the American middle west; for French farmers, the cost of using fertiliser more lavishly than their American counterparts is offset by higher French yields (6 tonnes per hectare on average, compared to 2.5 tonne in the US). But price is not everything when it comes to food, where France has always traded on its 'marques' and 'appellations controlees'. Only about a third of French farm produce is exported in unprocessed form, and an increasing share of exports, such as almost all wines, cognacs and most cheeses (except for the more basic types such as Emmenthal), need no subsidy from Brussels. Of the FFr50bn worth of farm products that France exports outside Europe, FFr 17bn worth was sold without subsidy. 'Can this practice (of subsdidy-free export) be extended to other sectors, such as poultry, certain milk products and even large scale production of cereals?' asks Mr Jean Puech, the agriculture minister, answering himself in the affirmative. In pursuit of this goal, the minister is proposing: Various national measures to cuts costs and increase efficiency in French agriculture. Last month Mr Puech announced cuts in special levies cereal farmers have had to pay (because they are considered richer than other farmers). He would also like to abolish the discriminatory system which levies social charges on a farmer's entire income (including capital savings), not just on earned income - as in the case of everyone outside farming. Another possible legislative change would encourage the incorporation of more farms as companies, to deal better with the Napoleonic code's requirement that estates be equally parcelled out to heirs. To maximise the possibilities offered by the Gatt, both in terms of market opening and of product protection. France is now seriously prospecting new markets in Asia, and its Breton pig farmers have now joined their Danish counterparts in acquiring the right to sell pork into Japan. France also hopes that Gatt will help it crack down on counterfeiting, particularly of cognacs. To extend to other products the system already existing for sugar which, beyond a certain quantity, is exported without subsidy. In general terms, the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU is making European farm products more competitive, chiefly through the 20-25 per cent cut in the prices of cereals, an important agricultural input. For instance, this is making France much more competitive in poultry because, as an aide to Mr Puech comments: 'chickens are basically cereals with feet'. But Paris is also examining the idea of 'split internal pricing' whereby producers would get the guaranteed Brussels minimum price for a certain quota of their production, and beyond that they would be free to produce as much as they liked for whatever return they could get on the world market. The French agriculture ministry notes that it would not be easy to control these two different production and price systems so as to avoid fraud and market disruption. Eridania Beghin Say, France's biggest sugar producer, says it would welcome an extension of the European sugar regime (which has the added advantage to the European taxpayer that producers pay for their own export subsidies). But it recognises that it might be difficult for products less industrial than sugar, which has to pass through refineries. However, Mr Puech says he believes it should be possible to let farmers 'develop extra production which could be sold at lower prices, given its marginal cost of production. With all the necessary prudence, we ought to be able to find solutions based on differentiated pricing.' The minister intends to encapsulate his ideas in a memo sent to the European Commission in time to be debated under the French presidency of the EU in the first half of next year. In the meantime, the French agro-industry is proving its durability and adaptability. Last year's recession hit some companies such as its leader, the Danone group - the renamed BSN - which saw retail sales drop slightly, but left unaffected others such as Eridania Beghin Say. Overall, the French agro-industry held its turnover steady last year at FFr 695.5bn, the only industrial sector to do so during the 1993 recession. 'We are happy to have been proved wrong,' says an official in the French agriculture ministry. Paris had criticised the European Commission for over-estimating the degree to which European farmers would reconquer their home market in the wake of CAP reform. 'But perhaps this shows that the set-aside arrangements should be made more flexible,' adds the official. The CAP reform's requirement that French farmers have to take 15 per cent of their arable land out of production still grates. And it was only after being promised that the Gatt agreement would not increase this set-aside ratio that France put its signature to the world trade deal. Now, Paris sees the glimmer of a hope, or at least an argument, for reducing it.</p>
